"(CNN) -- Same-sex marriage will be the law of the land -- inevitably but not immediately. That's the message of the Supreme Court's decision today to let stand five federal appellate court rulings that recognized a constitutional right for gay people to marry. The practical effects of today's non-decision are considerable. At a minimum, it means that the five states whose cases were before the court -- Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Wisconsin and Indiana -- should allow same-sex marriage immediately. In addition, the states covered by the circuit courts that include these states will almost certainly now allow same-sex marriages as well. This includes the Fourth Circuit, covering Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina; the Seventh Circuit, including Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin; and the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. So for a non-decision, today's non-ruling has a big impact. The justices never explain why they decline to take a case, but it's possible to offer some informed speculation. It takes only four (of nine) votes for the court to hear a case. So why didn't four justices vote to hear the challenges to the same-sex marriage ban? The court is polarized, with four conservatives (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) and four liberals (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan), with Anthony Kennedy holding the balance of power, especially on gay rights issues. It's possible that neither the liberal nor the conservative bloc felt confident enough of Kennedy's vote to risk letting him decide the case. So better to kick the can down the road. The conservatives have a special reason for delay. Ginsburg, at 81 the oldest justice, will probably leave during the next president's term. A Republican president would replace Ginsburg with a solid conservative vote and make Kennedy's vote irrelevant. So waiting might be an appealing option for them. The liberals had their own reasons for delay. Same-sex marriage has marched with great speed across the country. Today's non-decision means that more than half the states, with well more than half the population, have marriage equality. Those facts create their own momentum. More time equals more states, which might (the theory goes) make Kennedy's vote easier to get a year from now. But for now, the state-by-state battles continue. As a result of today's decision, there will not be a 50-state resolution any time soon. But the direction of the country, if not the court, is clear, and that's more important than any Supreme Court decision.","Jeffrey Toobin: Decision to let same-sex marriage rulings stand has big impact .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Bolly is working the streets, watching clubbers spill from one bar to the next when he spots his next mark -- two westerners in one of Manila's most notorious areas. It's a little after 10pm when Bolly sees me and my cameraman -- though he doesn't have a camera visible with us on this night -- rolling out of a sports bar known for its bounty of women offering 'companionship' in Edsa, Manila's unofficial red light district. He strides over quickly, waving a little white flier in our faces. The street is teeming with people after an evening rain. Pedestrians dodge neon-bathed puddles while darting behind and between passing cars. On the sidewalk, several homeless families have bedded down on cardboard for the night. On the block ahead, we see teams of girls in tight-fitting cocktail dresses and school girl uniforms standing in front of karaoke bars, calling out to western businessmen to come inside and join them for a little fun. ""Hello friends. Where are you going?"" Bolly says. ""I know where there lots of girls. Cheap drinks. This way,"" he says, thrusting the pamphlet into our hands. Bolly is a recruiter for a number of nightclubs in the area. ""We are looking for young, pretty girls"" my cameraman asks, playing the part. ""Where can we find them?"" Bolly grins broadly. ""OK. I take you."" We make small talk as Bolly happily walks us the several blocks to the first bar. My photographer and I don't tell our new friend that we're actually working at the moment; on the lookout for evidence of forced prostitution or children being sold for sex. It's part of the two year-long investigation CNN embarked on as part of its Freedom Project, an initiative to help the battle against modern-day slavery. It's estimated 800,000 people are involved in prostitution in the Philippines. The government and NGO estimates on the number of women trafficked range from 300,000 to 400,000 and the number of children trafficked range from 60,000 to 100,000. Click here to get full infographic on human trafficking in the Philippines . We follow Bolly down the street, until we come upon a little door guarded by a large bouncer. He opens the door and our eyes struggle to accept the flood of pink fluorescent light bathing the room. Katy Perry's ""Teenage Dream"" blares from unseen speakers. Along the wall a dozen girls seated in a row stare at the newcomers. A few wave hello, most look bored. They're not drinking. Not really even talking. Just sitting and waiting to be selected. A few red plastic tables are scattered around the room, each decorated by a single man sitting and drinking. One man has a girl he's chosen sitting beside him. She's kissing the lobe of his ear. There are no empty tables left, so the manager puts us on the side of the L-side couch, opposite the girls. It feels a little like it's an adolescent school dance, with everyone waiting for someone else to make the first move. I struggle for a place to look away from the gaze of the girls and cast my eyes to the ground. A cockroach skitters around the legs of the tables and chairs and patrons' feet. The manager is behind the bar, getting us beers. She sees me looking at the cockroach and laughs from across the room. ""Our pet,"" she says. The girls giggle, somewhat embarrassed. I force a smile, but another patron, who hadn't heard the quip gets up from his chair and smashed his shoe down on the husky insect. The girls groan and the manager pretends to cry. This is too weird. Time to go. My photographer and I race through our San Miguel Lights and leave. Bolly is there outside the door. He leads us through a labyrinth of roads and alleys. Fifteen minutes later, near the Manila port, we arrive at a strip club. We're seated near the front of the stage, where two girls sway in a bored dance. This time instead of the girls sitting in a line, the manager brings them to us. More than a dozen girls in skimpy cocktail dresses line up in front of us. The manager shines a flashlight across each of their faces. He tells us to select one. ""No, that's okay. I don't want one,"" my photographer says. In the back, smaller than the others, I see a young girl, hiding behind the others. I can't tell if she's frightened or uninterested. ""Her."" The other girls part way. She hesitantly makes her way to sit beside me. She orders an ice tea. When the bill arrives, we'll find out it cost us $22. How old are you? I ask ""18,"" she says. ""Really? You look younger."" She doesn't budge. ""18,"" ""Do you like working here?"" She looks forlornly at the stage. ""Yes."" How long have you been working? ""Three months."" Despite our best efforts, she has no interest in giving up information to two white strangers. Read what girls rescued from trafficking say . We decide to leave and end up getting into an argument with the manager. The bill for two beers and an iced tea comes to $83 dollars. But carrying undercover camera equipment, and because of the size and number of security guards, we only offer a half-hearted protest. We would go to several other bars and speak to a number of women working in the sex industry. Some seemed to enjoy their work, but most said it was a sort of last resort. They had children at home they have to feed and they hadn't been able to find any other work. Still, it's important to note, no one we spoke with said they were being forced to do this work by another person despite our suspicions and their youthful looks. Often, skeptics of the modern slavery issue will point to a story like this as proof that it doesn't exist, or that the problem is overblown. But the absence of evidence is not evidence of its absence and the simple fact is; it is very hard to get deep enough into an underground criminal culture to find evidence of trafficking, especially in a single night. It's equally difficult to convince a person who may be in that situation that it is safe and wise to speak openly with a foreigner. In filming the documentary, ""The Fighters,"" we witnessed the hard work of the Filipino government's Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking, honest police officers and anti-slavery organizations like the Visayan Forum and International Justice Mission. They are working to ensure that jaunts like the one we attempted aren't successful, not only for a night, but for good.","In Manila's unofficial red light district, scantily-clad young girls are everywhere .

"(CNN) -- Decades-old Russian engines are believed to have caused the Antares rocket's failure to launch properly, Orbital Sciences Corp.'s CEO David Thompson said Wednesday. ""Current evidence strongly suggest that one of the two AJ26 main engines that powered Antares' first stage failed about 15 seconds after ignition,"" Thompson said in a conference call with investors. Last week, a company spokesman said the unmanned rocket, which exploded in a fireball at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, was deliberately destroyed after it became apparent there was a problem. The turbo pump in one of the engines likely failed, Thompson said Wednesday. Orbital will likely stop using these engines, he said, since they have proven to be unreliable. The Antares rocket and Cygnus cargo spacecraft had been set to carry roughly 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station. Despite what Thompson described as a ""setback,"" the company plans to stay on track with its $1.9 billion NASA contract delivering cargo to the space station, he said. Orbital hopes to launch its Cygnus spacecraft using third-party rockets, he said. There are three companies in the running: two from the United States and one from Europe. Thompson would not reveal which companies, but said a decision is expected within a month. SpaceX and United Space Alliance, the two likely U.S. companies -- operate regular launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Orbital Sciences, SpaceX and the Russians' Soyuz all regularly fly cargo and supplies to the six astronauts and cosmonauts stationed on the space station. While using another company's launch vehicle, Orbital will concentrate on replacing the 1970s-era Russian engines by 2016. Thompson thanked NASA for its support. ""We look forward to working closely with them to quickly recover from last week's setback,"" he said.","Evidence indicates an engine failed 15 seconds after ignition, Orbital's CEO says .

"(CNN) -- Schools, major roads and an airport remained closed Tuesday, as a thick cloud of filthy smog smothered the northeastern city of Harbin. Meteorologists in the city, which is famous for its annual ice festival, issued a red alert for fog at 5 a.m. Tuesday, with visibility in some central areas of the city down to less than 20 meters (65 feet), the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Video from China's state-run CCTV showed some people -- obscured by smog even just steps away -- wearing masks over their mouths as they walked in the province. Some drivers who braved the roads flashed hazard lights. Kindergartens, primary and junior middle schools were ordered to suspend classes for a second day, while Harbin Taiping International Airport remained closed -- with 250 flights canceled on Monday alone, according to Chinese state media. China needs smog-free air in a can . Hazardous levels . Pollution levels remained far above international standards, as the city's monitoring stations on Tuesday showed that concentrations of PM2.5 -- the tiny airborne particles considered most harmful to health -- were more than 30 times the World Health Organization's recommended standard, the state-run China Daily reported. Could smog choke China's sporting ambitions? Government officials blamed the smog on a lack of wind and farmers burning crop stalk after their autumn harvest, though the city's coal-burning heating system, which was recently started, is also a likely factor. Harbin's environmental bureau has also conducted checks on factories known to discharge pollutants, the China Daily report added. Extreme conditions . Fang Lijuan, the city's chief meteorologist, said it was very rare for the city to suffer such extreme conditions. ""There has been no strong wind and the level of humidity is high,"" she said, in quotes carried by China Daily. Residents of this city of 10 million people were also surprised by the thick smog. Living with an 'air-pocalypse' ""The pollution is indeed very bad, we can only see things within 100 meters, and yesterday it was 20-30 meters. We can smell the smoke in the air,"" one man, who identified himself as Mr. Ren, told CNN. ""The smog started about four days ago ... I heard all face masks in Harbin are sold out. People are very angry about this and there is a lot of discussion over the Internet. ""The main reason is Harbin started its heating and the main resource is coal. Every year at this time, the air quality is bad -- but this year is especially polluted."" Can social media clear air over China? Naming and shaming . Last month China announced plans to start listing its top ten most air-polluted cities every month in the hopes that national humiliation will push positive environmental action. ""We must put air quality control as an ecological red line for economic management and social development,"" China's Vice Premier Zhang Gao Li said in a statement as he announced the new policy at the 18th Air Pollution Control Conference in Beijing. Chinese officials did not say when the first list would be announced, but the northern megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as the surrounding provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shandong have signed onto an official plan to speed up air pollution control measures. China's capital often suffers with hazardous pollution levels and smog. An explosion in the number of cars on the roads, as well as industrial pollution are seen as the main contributors.

"(CNN) -- Nevada won't defend its ban against same-sex marriage, saying its legal position has been ""undermined"" in a series of rulings that began last June with a historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing gay marriages. The state's decision comes in a case filed by eight same-sex couples represented by the gay rights group Lambda Legal. The case challenged Nevada's constitutional amendment banning marriage for gay and lesbian couples, the group said. A federal court judge dismissed the suit in 2012 at Gov. Brian Sandoval's request, but Lambda Legal appealed that ruling to the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Since then, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that had denied to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses. A subsequent 9th Circuit Court ruling in an unrelated case persuaded Nevada to abandon its defense of the gay marriage ban, Nevada officials said. That recent case involved a preemptory challenge to strike a prospective juror in a trial because he was gay, but the 9th Circuit ruled that discriminatory classifications based on sexual orientation must receive heightened scrutiny and should be presumed unconstitutional, Lambda Legal said. ""After thoughtful review and analysis, the state has determined that its arguments grounded upon equal protection and due process are no longer sustainable,"" Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement Monday. Gov. Sandoval agreed with the attorney general's decision to drop its defense of the gay marriage ban. ""Based upon the advice of the attorney general's office and their interpretation of relevant case law, it has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court,"" Mary-Sarah Kinner, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Tuesday. A Lambda Legal attorney praised the governor's decision. ""The governor has recognized that the writing is on the wall, and that arguments seeking to perpetuate discrimination are becoming extremely difficult to justify,"" Lambda Legal Senior Attorney Tara Borelli said in a statement. ""Denying marriage to same-sex couples serves no legitimate state interest and is intended solely to perpetuate discrimination."" The state's withdrawal leaves only the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, which a lower court allowed to intervene, defending the marriage ban in federal appeals court, Lambda Legal said. The coalition wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. U.S. expands legal benefits, services for same-sex marriages .

"(CNN) -- Want to visit Yosemite, Grand Canyon or Yellowstone next year? Pack your camping supplies and knock those parks off your bucket list now, because it may cost you a little bit more to explore the national parks by summer 2015. For the first time in eight years, the National Park Service sites that charge entrance and amenity fees can increase their rates by set amounts. They have to engage their communities, note what the increases will cover and get approval by park service headquarters. Fee increase proposals are due by March 15. Though just 133 of the 401 National Park Service sites across the United States charge an entrance fee, they're some of the parks that travelers often think of first. Yosemite National Park, which released its fee proposal on Tuesday, wants to increase its weekly entrance pass from $20 to $30. Camping fees would rise from the current range of $5 to $20 per night for family sites ($40 per night for group sites) to a range of $6 to $24 per night for family sites ($48 per night for group sites). The cost of national park passes will remain at $80 for the regular annual pass, $10 for the lifetime senior pass and free for the annual military passes and access passes (for those with permanent disabilities). These are five national park sites we think you must see, either now or after any fee increases take effect. They're still a bargain! Yosemite National Park, California . President Abraham Lincoln first protected Yosemite with his signing of the Yosemite Land Grant on June 30, 1864, 150 years ago. Yosemite will celebrate 125 years as a national park in 2015. Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona . The Colorado River cuts through the bottom of the magnificent Grand Canyon for 277 miles, and it's a full vertical mile from the South Rim to the canyon floor. The canyon's width varies, but it measures 18 miles in several spots. The South Rim is open year-round, but the North Rim -- generally the coolest place in the park -- is open during the spring and summer. Current vehicle entrance fee: $25 . Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho . Old Faithful calls this place home. Established as the United States' first national park in 1872, Yellowstone is also one of the first 12 sites on UNESCO's World Heritage List, which recognizes the world's most important natural and cultural wonders. Yellowstone is one of the few remaining intact ecosystems of significant size in the northern temperate zone on Earth, including a volcano, more than 300 geysers and more than 10,000 thermal features. Current vehicle entrance fee: $25 . Arches National Park, Utah . Arches National Park is one of the most unique spots on Earth, home to the world's highest collection of natural sandstone arches. They include the largest, Landscape Arch, and the tallest, Double Arch South. Current vehicle entrance fee: $10 . Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee . It's free! Despite its reign as the most-visited national park in the country last year, with 9.4 million visitors, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is our bargain park, with no entrance fees. (There are camping and other amenity fees.) That's because the park's Newfound Gap Road was once owned by the state of Tennessee. When the state transferred it to the federal government, the state required that no fee ""ever be imposed"" to travel the road.","National Park Service allowing fee increases for first time in 8 years .

"(CNN) -- Some lawmakers lashed out at the CEOs of the Big Three auto companies Wednesday for flying private jets to Washington to request taxpayer bailout money. ""There is a delicious irony in seeing private luxury jets flying into Washington, D.C., and people coming off of them with tin cups in their hand, saying that they're going to be trimming down and streamlining their businesses,"" Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-New York, told the chief executive officers of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. ""It's almost like seeing a guy show up at the soup kitchen in high hat and tuxedo. It kind of makes you a little bit suspicious."" He added, ""couldn't you all have downgraded to first class or jet-pooled or something to get here? It would have at least sent a message that you do get it."" The executives -- Alan Mulally of Ford, Robert Nardelli of Chrysler and Richard Wagoner of GM -- were seeking support for a $25 billion loan package. Later Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reversed plans to hold a test vote on the measure. An aide told CNN that Reid decided to cancel the test vote when it became clear the measure would fall well short of the 60 votes needed. Reid did, however, make a procedural move that could allow a vote on a compromise, which several senators from auto-producing states were feverishly trying to craft. At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Brad Sherman, D-California, pressed the private-jet issue, asking the three CEOs to ""raise their hand if they flew here commercial."" ""Let the record show, no hands went up,"" Sherman said. ""Second, I'm going to ask you to raise your hand if you are planning to sell your jet in place now and fly back commercial. Let the record show, no hands went up."" The executives did not specifically respond to those remarks. In their testimony, they said they are streamlining business operations in general.  Watch Nardelli ask for help » . When contacted by CNN, the three auto companies defended the CEOs' travel as standard procedure. Like many other major corporations, all three have policies requiring their CEOs to travel in private jets for safety reasons. ""Making a big to-do about this when issues vital to the jobs of millions of Americans are being discussed in Washington is diverting attention away from a critical debate that will determine the future health of the auto industry and the American economy,"" GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson said in a statement. Chrysler spokeswoman Lori McTavish said in a statement, ""while always being mindful of company costs, all business travel requires the highest standard of safety for all employees."" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker pointed to the company's travel policy and did not provide a statement elaborating. But those statements did little to mollify the critics. ""If it is simply the company's money at stake, then only the shareholders can be upset or feel as it might be excessive,"" said Thomas Schatz, president of the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. But in this case, he said, ""it's outrageous."" ""They're coming to Washington to beg the taxpayers to help them. It's unseemly to be running around on a $20,000 flight versus a $500 round trip,"" Schatz added. iReport.com: Should the Big Three be bailed out? The companies did not disclose how much the flights cost. Analysts contacted by CNN noted that the prices vary with the size of the plane and the crew, and whether the aircraft is leased or owned by the company. Analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group said that $20,000 is a legitimate ballpark figure for a round trip corporate jet flight between Detroit, Michigan, and Washington. When asked whether they plan to change their travel policies as part of the restructuring needed to shore up their finances, none of the companies answered directly. But they said they have cut back on travel in general as revenues have fallen. CNN's Emily Anderson, Virginia Nicolaidis and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"(CNN) -- One day after leading a peaceful procession of demonstrators along the streets of his native Ferguson, Missouri, State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson turned an outdoor news conference into an impromptu community forum. ""I'm here to make sure they hear what I'm talking about,"" Johnson, standing with Gov. Jay Nixon and others, told reporters Friday. He stepped away from the microphone and moved closer to members of a community still seething after Saturday's racially-charged police shooting of an unarmed black teenager. ""Move in a little closer,"" he implored residents who had gathered behind reporters. ""Come in closer."" For the man tapped Thursday to restore order in the restive St. Louis suburb where sometimes violent protests were met with a heavy-handed police response, the mission is personal. Demonstrations and confrontations with local police marked the night hours earlier this week, in the wake of a weekend police shooting by a white officer that left an 18-year-old African-American man dead. Michael Brown, who was unarmed, died in the Saturday shooting. Police say he was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say Brown was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. State troopers took over security after days of clashes between protesters and local police, who have been accused of using excessive force -- including rubber bullets and tear gas -- in response to the demonstrations. ""The people of our community need to hear what I'm saying,"" Johnson told the crowd. ""They have questions. This isn't about Ron Johnson ... It is about the people that live in our community."" On Thursday night, Johnson and other officials marched with the protesters and, in his words, they ""walked and shook hands and talked to people and listened and promised that we're going to communicate better."" ""Last night was a great night,"" he recalled on Friday. ""There were no calls for service. We did not deploy tear gas. We did not have road blocks. We did not make any arrests. It was a good night. People were talking."" At Friday's news conference, residents expressed skepticism on details released earlier by Ferguson's police chief implicating Brown as the ""primary suspect"" in a convenience store robbery moments before he was killed. Johnson said he would brief residents about the claims after meeting with Police Chief Thomas Jackson. But he urged residents ""to make sure that we don't burn down our own house, that we don't go down there and vandalize our own buildings...That doesn't prove a point. That does not solve the issue. That hurts this community, and that's what I don't want."" At one point in the news conference, a man who said he was the father of seven children talked about his kids being ""scared to death"" of the police. Johnson responded more like a pastor than a law enforcement officer: ""When I got home, my daughter said, 'Daddy, were you scared?' I said, 'Just a little.' She said, 'Daddy, I want you to remember when Jesus asked Peter to walk with him in the water. When Peter got scared Jesus picked him up and said have faith.' Today, we need to be just like Peter."" On social media, people praised Johnson's handling of the situation. ""Capt. Johnson. Inspiring. What an incredible night this is in #Ferguson,"" one person tweeted. Music impresario Russell Simmons tweeted: ""When police know the community and come from community, the relationship can be transformed overnight. Well done Capt. Johnson. #Ferguson"" When Johnson took over security in Ferguson Thursday, the suburb had become a flashpoint. ""A young man lost his life and so I grieve for that family because I have a son,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""We're going to look at this from a personal standpoint and if that was my son -- or that was my friend -- how would I feel?"" Johnson grew up in the area and considers it both his community and his home. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Although locals say race relations have long been troubled between the city's mostly African-American population and the mostly white police force, anger spilled out after Brown's death. ""It means a lot to me, personally, that we break the cycle of violence, diffuse the tension and build trust -- showing the utmost respect for every interaction with every citizen,"" Johnson, who is African-American, told reporters. ""Moving forward, I'm confident that the patrol and police resources present here in Ferguson will do just that."" Johnson said he is committed to the new approach. He stressed the importance of not focusing on the past. ""We're going to start from today. We're not going to look back in the past,"" Johnson said. ""We are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we're in this together."" Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . A white man's response to Ferguson .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A winged piece of history sits parked at a small airport. It's 70 years old, and in a few minutes, I'll know firsthand if this old warbird can still fly. In all, nearly 13,000 B-17 Flying Fortresses rolled off the assembly lines. Now, only about a dozen flying B-17s remain -- in the entire world. These are the famous bombers that helped the Allies win World War II. Every year planes like these are retired to aviation junkyards, destined for a rusty demise. But there's a group out there working to preserve the precious legacy of these planes by keeping them flying. OK, that's all nice and everything -- but it's not really at the top of my mind. Right now, I'm just trying to fit inside this thing, along with seven other passengers. Getting aboard involves stepping up a short ladder and ducking through a small hatch in the back of the plane. Seat cushions? Surely you jest. Instead, the B-17 offers webbed, canvas seats bolted to the side walls of the cabin. They make seating on a small regional jet comfortable by comparison. Seat belt: check. Camera: yep. Ready for an unforgettable flight? You bet. I need to pay attention. Bill, our host, is announcing something important. ""Whatever you do,"" Bill tells us, ""don't touch the overhead cables."" There they are -- just a couple of feet above me. The wire cables directly connect cockpit controls in the front of the plane to the tail rudder and ""elevators"" in the back. Basically, they help steer the plane. So yeah, we kind of need those to work. Note to self: Don't touch the cables. Tip No. 2: Stay away from the bomb bay doors. They can probably hold no more than 110 pounds. Any heavier than that, Bill says, you'll be doing some unplanned skydiving without a parachute. By the way, there ARE parachutes on this ancient plane, right? Nope, says Bill. As the plane's four propeller engines sputter to life, I'm tweeting (with misspelled words) about how LOUD they are and how they're spewing the smell of oil. ""A great sound and smell,"" Stephen L Avery tweets back. Inches from my head sits a replica machine gun. Near that, a side window with a view of the plane's whirling propellers. Before I know it, the pilot is gunning the engines and we're accelerating down the runway. It's bumpy, deafening -- and we're airborne! Bill indicates it's safe to stand up and walk around -- although there isn't much to grab on to. This waist gunner station -- because gunners stand up in the middle of the aircraft -- was the most dangerous job on the aircraft because they were so easily targeted. Images of faceless military crew members who've flown aboard this plane cross my mind and -- WHOA! -- the plane takes a surprise left bank 1,600 feet above Atlanta! Hold on! Keep in mind no one is shooting at us. Combat conditions here were uncomfortable at best: no temperature-controlled, pressurized cabins. Imagine trying to fight off enemy planes amid the overwhelming roar and the freezing cold seeping in from outside. I'm not the only aviation geek who's awestruck. I look around to see other passengers who clearly get it: Flying aboard this plane puts them a little closer to history -- and a lot closer than they'd feel in a dimly lit aviation museum. They're trading smartphones and taking photos of each other, to treasure the moment. ""I can't wait to tell my dad about this,"" one avgeek tells me. At one point I step carefully across a gun ball turret embedded into the floor, where a small gunner would fire on enemy planes. A stiff wind whips into my face through a quarter-inch-wide gap between the turret and the plane's body. Waaaaay down below I can see the trees and homes of Atlanta rushing by at about 160 mph. That's solid ground down there! Despite the windy gaps, the B-17 was named the Flying Fortress for a reason. Its resilient design gained a reputation for taking a beating and still bringing its crew home alive. As for this crew, the pilot starts lining up with the runway and we're told to buckle up. We touch down on the runway. The old-fashioned tires give a weird little yelp. Our 20-minute adventure is over. For me, the stories I'd read in history books had come to life. The experience was nothing short of thrilling. These refurbished warbirds are as close as most of us will ever come to understanding the horror and stress of aerial combat during WW II. Amazingly, some are still able to fly across the nation, visiting air shows from coast to coast. Last weekend, ""Sentimental Journey"" -- the plane I flew on -- traveled from its home base in Arizona to Atlanta's DeKalb Peachtree Airport. The planes are operated by the Commemorative Air Force, a national group which has been working to restore and maintain flying warbirds since 1957. Events like these offer younger generations a living, breathing, real-world lesson about these planes' contribution to history. ""Unlike static museums, you can go out and see them in their natural state,"" says Steve Brown, CAF president. ""You get the oil, the smoke, the smell. You can ride inside them and imagine."" During battle, P-51 Mustangs often escorted B-17s for protection -- engaging in dogfights with enemy fighters, if need be. They were among the fastest and most nimble fighter planes of the era. Less than a few hundred are still flying today. ""You don't really have time for emotions"" during dogfights, says ex-Mustang pilot Robert ""Punchy"" Powell. Powell escorted B-17s during the 1944 D-Day Allied invasion of France. ""You're not thinking too much about what you have to do. You do it because you've been trained to do it, and your experience makes you do what you're supposed to do."" Now 93, Powell destroyed six enemy planes between September 1943 and August of '44 as part of the U.S. Army Air Force's 352nd Fighter Group ""Bluenosed Bastards of Bodney,"" out of Bodney, England. Mustangs were made for two things: shooting and speed. They bristled with guns and boasted a top speed of about 300 mph. ""It wasn't hard to fly,"" Powell says. ""It was a very stable, easy airplane."" On D-Day, Powell took off from England toward France during a night mission to escort B-17s. Later that day, Powell's squadron was among more than 1,000 fighters in the air shooting up ""convoys, tanks and trains and buses and motorcycles -- whatever moved toward the beaches."" When he first sat down inside a Mustang cockpit, Powell was only 21 years old. ""All of us can reflect on what were doing at age 19, 20,"" says the CAF's Brown, a former Army aviator. ""Now put yourself in these complex airplanes, flying thousands of miles over water, away from home to drop bombs while you're being attacked. It's pretty amazing to think about."" Related story: D-Day paratrooper jumps again, 70 years later . The CAF operates 162 restored warplanes from WWII and beyond and shows them at air shows and airports across the U.S. ""to educate Americans about what these aircraft did -- and what role they played in our freedom,"" says Brown. The air shows help fund its $24 million yearly budget, along with membership fees and donations. Its members number about 12,000. By next year, the CAF plans to move its headquarters from Midland, Texas, to a small executive airport southwest of downtown Dallas. There, the group plans to build a $40-million, world-class aviation museum. ""We expect to attract a quarter million visitors a year or more,"" Brown says. ""And we'll have aircraft on display in a unique venue."" Powell says ""the glamour days are over."" He knows dogfighting is all but obsolete as more aircraft attack by using precise, long-range guided missiles. ""In the future, most of the air combat will be what they're beginning to do today: long-distance firing and drones,"" Powell says. ""Recently, I heard a general say that the last fighter pilot has already been born. It takes about 20 years to raise and train a fighter pilot. Imagine what the technology will be in 20 years. In the future, there won't be any dogfighting."" As the ""greatest generation"" passes on, Brown says America's youngest generation has no understanding of WWII and what it was like to defend the nation during those dark times. With that in mind, the CAF sees itself as much more than a group of warplane enthusiasts. ""We're here to inspire,"" Brown says. ""We can use the inspiration of what they accomplished then to inspire us accomplish great things in the future.""","Only about a dozen WW II-era B-17 bombers still fly .

"Ames, Iowa (CNN) -- If government prosecutors are right, a former top researcher at Iowa State University is guilty of brazen scientific fraud-actions which a criminal complaint says have cost taxpayers nearly $15 million. Federal prosecutors accuse Korean-born researcher Dr. Dong Pyou-Han of deliberately falsifying key blood research into a possible vaccine for HIV. An indictment brought against Han says he falsely showed that rabbits infected with the virus had shown remarkable improvement. That improvement was so advanced that the government's National Institutes of Health awarded Iowa State and Han nearly $15 million in federal research grants. Prosecutors say the false results actually cleared a first level of back-up testing but fell apart after Han's boss at Iowa State began to get suspicious. According to the criminal complaint, the false results were secretly given to the NIH as well as a senior scientist at Iowa State after the first publication of the scientific paper. It was then, according to the complaint, that they discovered the rabbit blood was spiked with human antibodies, making it appear the rabbits were developing an immunity to the virus. A spokesman for Iowa State University, John McCaroll, told CNN that the school's reaction was ""disbelief, surprise, shock, disappointment."" In a letter attached to the complaint, and before he entered a plea of not guilty, Han said he was ""foolish, coward and not frank."" He added, ""My misconduct is not done in order to hurt someone."" The U.S. attorney for the southern district of Iowa, Nicholas Kleinfeldt, told CNN that ""just because somebody has a PhD, just because someone's involved in the scientific community, doesn't mean they're going to necessarily be treated differently than anyone else who's committed a criminal offense."" As for the roughly $15 million in federal research grants handed out to Han and Iowa State, most of it is gone, spent on salaries and lab gear, the spokesman said. The school did repay about $500,000. According to Retraction Watch, a group that tracks research fraud, scientists who fake research rarely go to prison and hardly ever are forced to pay taxpayers back for misused grants. In all, says a prominent scientist, the NIH has given about $58 million in funds to science that turned out to be phony over the past 22 years. Dr. Ferric Fang, a scientist at the University of Washington, added up the numbers but cautioned the real number may be even higher. As for Han, there was no answer at a Cleveland apartment building where he was believed to be staying until the trial. CNN did reach him on his cell phone, and when asked what happened, time and again he said only two words: ""I'm sorry."" If he's found guilty on all the four federal charges against him, prosecutors say he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine.","Federal prosecutors accuse a researcher of falsifying HIV research .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United secured a vital 2-1 victory against Arsenal, their first on the road in the English Premier League this season under coach Louis Van Gaal. Arsenal started much the brighter and could have been three nil up in the first thirty minutes, but poor finishing and an inform David de Gea in the Manchester United goal kept the scores level. But United took control in the second half thanks to a Kieran Gibbs own goal and a late Wayne Rooney chip. A stunning solo goal by Olivier Giroud, returning from a broken leg, gave Arsenal a glimmer of hope but United held on to move up to fourth place in the table. ""I think it is a very important victory,"" Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told Sky Sports after the match. ""We weathered the storm and knew they were vulnerable to the counter attack. We rode our luck at times but our goalkeeper was fantastic."" Indifferent form . Both teams came in to the match having endured a subdued start to the season. Whilst Manchester United remain in transition, having had three coaches in three seasons, Arsenal have also been playing far from their potential. Yet it was Arsenal that started the game much brighter with Jack Wilshere in midfield and former United Striker Danny Welbeck carving out a number of chances. But Wilshere and Welbeck could not find the back of the net. In fact, WIlshere was lucky to stay on the pitch after appearing to strike United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with his head. United were content sitting back and hitting Arsenal on the break and it was against the run of play when they took the lead. A hopeful cross from the left appeared to be of little trouble for the Arsenal defense. But, under pressure from the imposing Fellaini, Kieran Gibbs managed to first knock down his goalkeeper and then divert the subsequent shot into his own net past the prone Wojciech Szczesny, who was then replaced due to injury. No way back . Arsenal probed in the minutes that followed but it was a poor quality game and when Angel di Maria was cut loose by Fellaini on the break, who in turn fed Rooney before he chipped the on rushing goalkeeper to make it 2-0, half of the Emirates Stadium had gone home. Giroud's wonder goal deep in injury time gave Arsenal some hope but the full time whistle came soon enough, and with it a chorus of boos from the home crowd. It has been a good week for Rooney, who played his 100th match for England midweek, scoring three times in two victories, before scoring again today. ""It has been an indifferent start,"" he admitted after the game. ""It has been a good week and I hope now we can go on a good run of games. Today was a massive result."" Chelsea roll on . Chelsea continued their unbeaten run this season with an easy victory against West Brom. Early goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard, followed by a red card for West Brom's Claudio Yacob, effectively ended the contest before half time. Chelsea are now seven points clear of second place Southampton, who play Monday. Meanwhile, Manchester City kept up their chase of Chelsea by beating Swansea City 2-1. But City had to come from behind to do so. Wilfred Bony scored within the first ten minutes for the Swans before goals from Steven Jovetic and Yaya Toure secured a much needed win.","Manchester United beat Arsenal on the road .

"(CNN) -- Running at full speed since the summer, a lab with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testing blood samples collected by American hospitals on patients they suspected of having Ebola, has returned a negative result in every case. Until Tuesday. Some public health officials are explaining the first confirmed case of the Ebola virus in the United States, found in a man in Dallas, as a predictable event. But at least for this case, there are many questions surrounding that assertion. Were crucial procedures that might have prevented the victim--who Liberian officials have identified as Thomas Eric Duncan, according to an article in the New York Times--from arriving in the United States not in place? Have errors and missed opportunities put a handful of Dallas residents at risk of an infection, with a roughly 50% fatality rate? As the facts roll out about Duncan, who is fighting for his life in Presbyterian Hospital Dallas' critical care unit, we should scrutinize the travel screening procedures in use in the United States and the apparently myriad ways Ebola patients can slip through the cracks, even in one of the world's most advanced medical systems. We know that airport screening efforts, such as they are, failed. Duncan, traveling from the Ebola-ravaged city of Monrovia, boarded a plane bound for Dallas on September 19 after passing a screening that would have consisted of a few questions about symptoms and measurement of his body temperature. The effectiveness of the answers to screening questions depends entirely on the good faith we hold in the traveler's truthfulness. As evidenced by numerous flights of returning aid workers and journalists, recent Ebola contacts do not bar re-entry. Reports now indicate Duncan had such a contact. Since infected Ebola victims will remain asymptomatic for up to 21 days, does the screening procedure match up with the science? In Tuesday's CDC briefing, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Centers' director, disclosed that Duncan left Liberia to visit family members living in the United States. We deserve more detail, because this choice is another possible point of intervention. Are hops from this stricken region to destinations across the Atlantic for vacation and family get-togethers reasonable at this moment? Should travelers be required to describe a compelling reason to visit the United States, when their choice to do so potentially affects others? Your questions answered . I feel greatly for the quarantined Dallas ambulance drivers and other community contacts whose lives are now upended as they wait in quarantine away from work life, income, and all other activities for three weeks. But it goes beyond lax screening: There is no effort to follow-up with potentially infected travelers after they arrive and begin circulating in America. If checking in with a nurse via telephone every few days for three weeks sounds too expensive, why not charge an entry fee to cover that cost? Ebola is a novel threat. It's time we think outside the box. Beyond these screening and surveillance problems, critical medical errors have compelled the CDC to dispatch a team of epidemiologists and crisis control specialists to augment Texas public health resources. The mistakes that brought us to this point reveal the fragility of our much-vaunted American health care system when it comes to anything out of the ordinary. As a physician I can empathize with the emergency room providers at Presbyterian who discharged their patient after an exam on September 26 with a course of antibiotics that are useless for his actual diagnosis. And it appears a nurse did inquire about recent travel, and Duncan volunteered that he was from Liberia. But in a story all too common where medical errors are concerned, Presbyterian hospital admitted on Wednesday that this information was ""not fully communicated"" to all the emergency room practitioners caring for him. Containing Ebola depends on such truthfulness and cooperation. CDC epidemiologists performing the painstaking ""contact tracing"" of the patient's movements for the four days he was symptomatic in the Dallas community will depend on such openness from everyone they interview. (To that end, as bioethicist Art Caplan points out, some of the rationale for patient privacy may need to be rethought, given the importance of identifying contacts. The Dallas victim's identity was a closely guarded secret by Presbyterian hospital, due to long-established norms for controlling private health information. Do those rules apply to a situation where contacts need to be identified urgently, and where the victim is at no risk of long-term stigma associated with a fast-moving disease process from which he will either survive and be noncontagious, or not? Liberian officials released Duncan's name Wednesday, irrespective of the hospital's deference to privacy. This makes sense if public health is the priority. ) But there was another error that had followed Duncan's initial release from the ER. On September 28, when he returned to Presbyterian, this time deathly ill in an ambulance, the ER staff immediately suspected Ebola, Presbyterian told reporters, and called in the infectious disease team. How then did the ambulance drivers and the ambulance itself continue in circulation, unquarantined, for the next 48 hours. Hopefully no further errors will occur. To date, the four precedent-setting Ebola patients brought to American soil for treatmentâ€”at Emory University and Omaha's Nebraska Medical Center -- have received their successful care in CDC-partnered units designed for just such a threat. Now brave Dallas health care workers will use the level of isolation seen at most ""tertiary"" care hospitals in the United States, adequate even for airborne pathogens, which Ebola is not, but not the ideal setting to provide a high level of isolation. To be effective in preventing contamination, workers will have to be more meticulous than usual, 100% of the time, given the gravity of the infection. After Atlanta's CDC-affiliated unit at Emory successfully treated and discharged the first two Americans to receive care here for Ebola, we learned about a disturbing lack of preparedness for handling the patient's waste. Federal agencies didn't take the lead in coordinating those hospitalizations, and that left logistical and regulatory hurdles, causing Emory Healthcare workers to pile the waste in rubber barrels they rushed to purchase at Home Depot before ultimately sending them down the street to the CDC for proper disposal. The Dallas hospital doesn't have a CDC center down the street. Let's hope it gets the logistical support it needs from the get-go.","Ford Vox: Some say discovery of Ebola in U.S. predictable; it didn't have to be .

"(Mental Floss) -- There's a good chance you'll either drink too much eggnog this holiday season or spend time around someone who has. Here's a look at the background of this December staple. Eggnog can trace its roots back as far as the 14th century, when medieval Englishmen enjoyed a hot cocktail known as posset. Posset didn't contain eggs -- the Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""a drink made of hot milk curdled with ale, wine, or the like, often sweeten ed and spiced' -- but over the years eggs joined in on the festive fun. While the egg-laden version of posset was popular with the English, it became less common as time went by. Milk and eggs were both scarce and expensive, and the sherry and Madeira used to spike the mixture was pricey, too. Over time, the concoction became a drink that only aristocrats could really afford. All of that changed in the American colonies, though. What we lacked in parliamentary representation we made up for in easy access to dairy products and liquor. Since many Americans had their own chickens and dairy cattle, tossing together a glass of eggnog was no problem, and the drink's popularity soared among the colonists even as it sagged back home. This disparity in the drink's popularity on either side of the pond endures to this day; eggnog's popularity in the United Kingdom. still lags far behind its holiday ubiquity here in the States. In fact, here's how the Guardian's Andrew Shanahan memorably described the drink in 2006: ""People rarely get it right, but even if you do it still tastes horrible. The smell is like an omelette and the consistency defies belief. It lurches around the glass like partially-sentient sludge."" Appetizing! Using your noggin . The word ""eggnog"" itself has fairly murky origins, but many etymologists think the name stems from the word ""noggin,"" which referred to small wooden mugs that were often used to serve this type of drink. Others propose a similar story but explain that the ""nog"" comes the Norfolk slang nog to refer to the strong ales that were often served in these cups. Still others think the name is a contraction of colonial Americans' request to bartenders for an ""egg-and-grog"" when they wanted a glass. Furthermore, while the drink itself may date back to medieval times, the word ""eggnog"" is a relatively recent invention. The first recorded instances of the use of ""eggnog"" only date back to the late 18th century, and by that time, bartenders in the young United States had already tweaked the recipe to give it a more American twist. The Madeira and sherry that English aristocrats had used for their version of eggnog were scarce on this side of the pond, but we had plenty of rum and whiskey. In 1800, author Isaac Weld, Jr. described the American recipe for eggnog as consisting of ""new milk, eggs, rum, and sugar, beat up together."" Mental Floss: The pooping log and other colorful holiday characters . Have one for George Washington . Yes, early Americans loved their eggnog, and you can use this fact to your advantage if you down a few too many glasses this year. Simply point out that you're in good company with the likes of George Washington. Kitchen records from Mount Vernon indicate that Washington served an eggnog-like drink to visitors, and since the general wasn't strapped for cash, he didn't skimp on the sauce. Washington's potent recipe included three different types of booze: rye whiskey, rum, and sherry. Nobody could tell a lie after having a few cups of that. Not everyone had Washington's funds, though. A thorough look at historical recipes reveals that for most tipplers, the type of booze they snuck into their nog didn't really matter as long as there was something to give it a little kick. In addition to rum, ale, whiskey, and wines, an 1879 collection of recipes from Virginia housewives features a recipe that calls for 12 eggs, eight wine-glassfuls of brandy, and four wine-glassfuls of wine. Another calls for three dozen eggs, half a gallon of domestic brandy, and another half-pint of French brandy. Something's telling us these shindigs got a little wild. You might not want to read the label . If you pick up a carton of commercial eggnog at the supermarket, you're probably getting much more nog than egg. FDA regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product's final weight be made up of egg yolk solids for it to bear the eggnog name. For ""eggnog flavored milk,"" the bar is even lower; in addition to requiring less butterfat in the recipe, this label only requires 0.5 percent egg yolk solids in the carton. Of course, there are other good reasons why we don't tip back eggnog year-round. Sure, nobody's reaching for a nice cup of something custardy on a hot day, but it's not very good for you at all. A relatively small four-ounce cup of store-bought eggnog boasts a whopping 170 calories (half of them from fat), nearly 10 grams of fat, and over 70 mg of cholesterol. (If you're keeping score at home, that's around a quarter of your recommended daily intake of cholesterol.) If you choose to eschew these commercial brands in favor of mixing up your own eggnog, you'll probably want to use pasteurized eggs to suppress the risk of a nasty case of salmonella; not even a playlist featuring ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" ruins a holiday party quite as quickly as making everyone in attendance violently ill. Don't use unpasteurized eggs under the old argument of ""the booze will kill the germs,"" either. The FDA advises that this strategy isn't likely to work. Mental Floss: The history of Christmas tree lights . An unhealthy obsession . Nutritional info aside, eggnog still has a strong following among holiday drinkers. It's hard to top the devotion shared by a Virginia father and son in the late 19th century, though. In 1900, Good Housekeeping ran a story about the Christmas-morning eggnog traditions of Virginia, and it included this anecdote: . ""So religiously is this custom of the eggnog drinking observed that Judge Garnett of Mathews County tells a story of rushing in on Christmas morning to warn his father that the house was on fire. The old gentleman first led his son to the breakfast table and ladled out his glass of eggnog, drank one with him, then went to care for the burning building."" True or not, the story certainly underscores the downright magical powers of eggnog. Nobody's braving a burning building to have a cup of fruit punch or spiced cider.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Rihanna cleared her schedule to testify next month in the case against singer Chris Brown, who is charged with brutally beating her earlier this year, her lawyer said. Rihanna's lawyer revealed that the singer will comply when prosecutors call her as a witness. While Brown's lawyer previously indicated he hoped to resolve the case without public testimony, Los Angeles Criminal Court Judge Patricia Schnegg set on Thursday a preliminary hearing for June 22. Schnegg also ruled Thursday that a leak of police photos showing Rihanna's bruised and bloodied face would not affect the prosecution of Brown. Brown, 19, faces two felony counts of assault and making criminal threats stemming from an early morning incident on a Hollywood street in February. After a short motions hearing Thursday, Rihanna's lawyer Donald Etra revealed that prosecutors told him they would call Rihanna -- whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty -- as a witness at next month's hearing. ""She will definitely comply with the subpoena and any court order,"" Etra said. While he would not disclose whether she still had contact with Brown, he said, ""She's monitoring closely the progress of this case."" Rihanna's schedule has been cleared for the expected court date, he said. It is unclear whether Brown and Rihanna are still in a relationship. Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos was unsuccessful in his effort Thursday to get police records concerning their internal investigation of the leaking of the Rihanna photos. The judge said she might change her mind before a trial, but -- for now -- those records are not relevant to the case against Brown. Brown, who issued a public apology for the incident in February, recorded a short video posted on YouTube this week in which he said ""I ain't a monster."" He entered ""not guilty"" pleas in an earlier court appearance. If Brown is convicted on the two counts, he could be sentenced to anywhere from probation to four years and eight months in prison, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has said. The alleged attack happened in February during an argument that began when 21-year-old Rihanna, who had been dating Brown, found a text message from another woman on his cell phone, according to a sworn police statement. CNN's K.J. Matthews contributed to this report.","Lawyer says singer has cleared her schedule to comply with a subpoena .

"Washington (CNN) -- Apple and Google have won praise from privacy proponents for efforts to encrypt their latest smartphones in a way that would prevent law enforcement from accessing certain private data. The FBI, not so much. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey told reporters Thursday that the agency is talking to both companies to raise concerns that their privacy efforts could hinder criminal investigations. Apple last week touted that with release of its latest operating system iOS8, it no longer could bypass the smartphone user passwords. ""So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8,"" Apple said in a blog post. Google quickly followed suit, saying it already had such technology in phones running its Android operating system, but that ""as part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on."" Comey said that he was ""very concerned"" that the companies were ""marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves above the law."" Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of government mass surveillance programs has posed problems for U.S. tech companies, which are required by federal law to cooperate with surveillance program requests. Concerned that the revelations will damage their businesses, particularly in foreign markets, the companies have taken a more public role in pushing back on the surveillance programs. Yahoo, which fought a losing court battle against some surveillance requests, recently won a fight to make public secret court documents detailing that battle. The company used the information to tout its efforts to protect the privacy of its customers. The FBI director said he understood the privacy concerns in the wake of Snowden. But he noted that the FBI sometimes has an urgent need to access data, such as in cases of kidnappings or terrorism. Comey said he supports the idea that the FBI should have a warrant from a judge to take a look into someone's closet, or smartphone, but added he couldn't support ""the notion someone would market a closet that would never be open.""","Apple and Google announce encryption programs designed to protect customers' privacy .

"(CNN) -- ""Life is difficult,"" said the first line of the first self-help book I ever held in my hands. ""This is a great truth,"" it continued. ""Because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it ... once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters."" Though I was a child and barely knew what they meant, the words spoke to me. They resonated because it was 1979, and I was fleeing a revolution. Suddenly I had no country and no home. Overnight, life had become unfathomably difficult. An Iranian child refugee now living in America, I was a stranger in a strange new land. Now I'd fixated on some stranger's copy of ""The Road Less Traveled,"" M. Scott Peck's classic. Self-help books elicit extreme reactions, ranging from ""can't stand them"" to ""make me want to vomit"" and ""poke my eyes out."" As a whole, they're considered lowbrow, and not the cool kind of lowbrow either; they're often used in films as a device to mark the protagonist's lowest depths of desperation. But to dismiss self-help is folly. This is not just because the genre sells loads of books, audio, video and online products, seminars and personal coaching services. In fact, the U.S. self-improvement market is an almost $11 billion industry, with projected annual gains of more than 5% over the next several years, according to Marketdata Enterprises. The real reason to take it seriously is because here and there, amid the trite and banal, lies a gem that might shift your perception instantly, such as the drawing of the beautiful young woman that transforms in a blink into a haggard old crone in the late Stephen Covey's ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."" What do the books do for us? I asked folks to share their self-help experiences via social media; anecdotes ran from life-altering insights to guffaws prompted by sappy New Age advice. ""I have used them through bouts of depression as well as during happier, more stable times,"" wrote Wendy Maldonado. ""If I hadn't stumbled across Lundy Bancroft's book, 'Why Does He Do That,' about women living in abusive relationships, I shudder to think of what my life would look like today."" Self-help books are like pep talks, said Beth Pilz. ""I highlight them and copy favorite quotes into blank books."" ""They're good for equipping yourself with skills and insights outside local sources of wisdom,"" said Jamie Craig. ""If you were to leave me on a planet with my wife to reboot the human race, I would take 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' with me."" ""A lot cheaper than therapy!"" said Jenny Dubner Coleman. ""Cheaper than therapy, but nowhere near as effective,"" replied LaToya Baldwin Clark. ""I just don't like mass-produced advice for really serious issues like depression. I always think of this scene in 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' "" The scene shows Bridget gulping wine as she sings along tearily to a Celine Dion song -- a self-help manual at her side. Bronwen Safai pointed out: ""Isn't the Bible like a big self-help book?!"" Faika's thinking ran along similar lines. ""While divine guidance is free, people pay for superficial happiness,"" she wrote. ""The public library is free too!"" retorted my cheeky friend, Joel Bass. ""I think we're seeing the dawn of the science-based self-help book, and some of these have been really amazing."" He recommended Sonja Lyubomirsky's ""The How of Happiness"" and Charles Duhigg's ""The Power of Habit."" If you were to ask me earlier this week whether I am a reader of self-help books, I wouldn't have identified myself as such -- and certainly not in the secretly smug way I own up to having read scores of science fiction. But as I stood before my bookshelf looking for my old copy of Covey's ""7 Habits"" the day I heard about his passing, I found it, along with a half-dozen other books that were unabashedly self-help. I pulled them out and flipped through each one, noting the passages I had highlighted. ""People must face that which they fear,"" wrote Caroline Myss in ""Anatomy of the Spirit.""

"(CNN) -- A group of clergy in North Carolina on Monday filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The group argues the ban violates the First and 14 amendments and stigmatizes same-sex couples and the people and institutions that would support them. ""Marriage between two loving individuals is both a fundamental legal right and a cornerstone of almost every religion,"" says the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte. ""By depriving the Plaintiffs of the freedom to perform religious marriage ceremonies or to marry, North Carolina stigmatizes Plaintiffs and their religious beliefs, and the State relegates the Couple Plaintiffs to second-class status."" The lawsuit was filed by the United Church of Christ, a Protestant religious denomination with some 1.1 million members, various religious leaders, including a rabbi, and some same-sex couples. Among the defendants are North Carolina Attorney General Ray Cooper, several country district attorneys, and register of deeds. Noelle Talley, a spokeswoman for Cooper, said that as a rule his office does not comment on pending litigation. The state has received the lawsuit, and is currently reviewing it. ""By denying same-sex couples the right to marry and by prohibiting religious denominations even from performing marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, the State of North Carolina stigmatizes same-sex couples, as well as the religious institutions and clergy that believe in equal rights,"" the suit says. North Carolina voted in 2012 to outlaw same-sex marriage, which was already prohibited in the state. Supporters pushed for -- and won -- a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as solely between a man and a woman. Voters approved the amendment by a large margin. Same-sex marriage is legal in 17 U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Besides North Carolina, same-sex marriage is banned by state constitutional amendment or state law in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Worldwide, 16 other countries -- and parts of Mexico -- also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of these are in Europe and South America.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- With Kim Jong Un out of sight for a month, three North Korean officials popped down to South Korea for a last-minute visit Saturday. And they delivered a diplomatic bonbon. The three officials told South Korea that Pyongyang is willing to hold a new round of high-level meetings between late October and early November, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement Saturday. ""Within my memory ... there was never ever such a high-level visit. Never,"" said North Korea analyst Andrei Lankov, from Seoul's Kookmin University. Lankov said two of the three visitors ""are essentially number two and number three in North Korean official hierarchy."" Right behind Kim, the ""Dear Leader"" himself. Is North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lying low? Short notice, extensive media coverage . It was a sudden ""charm offensive,"" Lankov said. And it caused a media flurry, with South Korean television network YTN following the delegation's moves via extensive live coverage. The three gave Seoul short notice on Friday that they were dropping in officially to attend Saturday's closing ceremonies of the Asian Games in the port city of Incheon. The South granted permission the same day to Hwang Pyong-so, vice marshal of the Korean People's Army, Kim Yang-gon and Choe Ryong-hae. Kim Yang-gon is one of North Korea's top politicians responsible for dealings with the South. Choe is the former head of the military but was replaced in May, triggering some speculation in the international press that he may have fallen out of favor with Kim Jong Un. But South Korean analysts say that he remains extremely influential. He holds a seat as secretary on the Workers' Party's Central Committee, Pyongyang's highest decision-making body, and commands preeminent authority over civilian affairs. Choe is also chairman of the Sports Guidance Commission. The officials' Asian Games appearance was followed by a lunch with South Korean officials, and Seoul's reunification minister greeted the North Koreans at their hotel. The delegation met with the South's national security chief, Kim Kwan-jin, and later with Prime Minister Chung Hong-won. Speculation on Kim's absence . Kim Jong Un has been conspicuously absent even from important state events, and Pyongyang officials have said Kim is ""suffering from discomfort."" The last times he was seen publicly, he had gained weight and developed a limp. He missed the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea's Parliament. A prominent seat remained empty onstage, surrounded by North Korea's top brass. A count of North Korean announcements about Kim's public appearances went from 24 events in July to 16 in August -- then to just one event in September. His last listed public appearance was a September 4 concert. His absence has triggered conflicting speculation among longtime North Korea watchers about the security of his position, and on the mechanisms of power in what is arguably the world's most closed society. Jang Jin-Sung, who was a prominent propagandist for Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father and predecessor, said the 31-year-old dictator is a merely the ""puppet"" of a shadowy oligarchy. The old guard who make up the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) are the real ""power holders,"" Jang told CNN's Brian Todd via telephone from South Korea on Friday. They were tied closely to the late Kim and are not beholden to his son, he said. Jang, who defected to South Korea almost a decade ago, told Todd that he has spoken with highly placed sources within the regime in recent days. The OGD, he said, ""are calling the shots, and not the words of one man they do not know. Basically, they're no longer loyal to the ruling king's word."" Neither CNN nor U.S. intelligence officials can confirm whether Jang's claims are credible, but Ken Gause -- who has studied North Korea for two decades for CNA Corp., a nonprofit agency that provides research and analysis to U.S. government agencies -- agreed that the OGD has enormous clout. ""It keeps the files on everyone (in the regime's leadership), and that definitely makes it a very powerful and dangerous organization,"" Gause said. Jonathan Pollack, who specializes in East Asian issues for the Brookings Institution, downplayed the likelihood of a power struggle in Pyongyang, telling CNN that high-level maneuvering to influence Kim is much more likely than any effort to strip him of power. ""This is a top-down system. There is no number two,"" Pollack said. ""It is a royal system, a dynastic system predicated on there being a Kim and then, dare I say, a 'next of Kim' able to wield authoritative power from the top on an unquestioned basis."" Lankov, the Kookmin University analyst, doubts Kim is in political hot water. ""People get sick,"" he said. ""I wouldn't make much of it."" He said he believes Kim is still in charge and is behind Saturday's remarkable visit. ""North Korean diplomacy has been engaged in concerted, well-arranged, well-managed efforts to improve relations with pretty much the entire outside world. And you would not expect it to happen with nobody in control,"" he said. Lankov's take on the reason for North Korea's friendlier approach: economics. ""They want South Korean money and they want normal trade, which is subsidized by South Korea."" In particular, they'd like the South to lift the so-called May 24 Measure, a heavy trade sanction taken in 2010 after the North Korean military sank a South Korean ship, killing 46 sailors. Toning down the rhetoric . In stark contrast to the bellicose gesturing that has haunted relations in the past, North Korea and South Korea took conciliatory steps in each other's direction in February's first round of high-level talks. North Korea took the initiative in proposing the talks as a measure to build trust. At the meeting, both sides agreed to tone down the harshness of their rhetoric. Pyongyang has been particularly irked by joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, and would like them to cease. The North views them as a prelude to an invasion. Routine military exercises followed later in the same month the first round of talks was held, but were met with less vitriol and military bluster from the North than in the previous year. During joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers in 2013, Kim Jong Un flung aggressive threats at both countries and set his military in motion. Following February's talks, South Korea's Unification Ministry proposed a second round in August. The North Korean side had not responded to the proposal until Saturday. CNN's KJ Kwon reported from Seoul, Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- It was supposed to be an ordinary night out with friends for 20-year-old Zukiswa Gaca but it ended with her lying on a railway track attempting to take her own life. Gaca was at a bar, drinking with friends in Khayelitsha township, less than 40 kilometers outside Cape Town, South Africa, when a man tried to ask her out. ""I told the guy that no I'm a lesbian so I don't date guys and then he said to me, 'no I understand. I've got friends that are lesbians, that's cool, I don't have a problem with that.'"" Gaca says he was nice and she trusted him, and they left the bar to go to the home of one of his friends, and that is where his friendly exterior turned nasty. ""He said to me, 'you know what? I hate lesbians and I'm about to show you that you are not a man, as you are treating yourself like a man,'"" she told CNN. ""I tried to explain 'I'm not a man. I never said I'm a man, I'm just a lesbian'. And he said, 'I will show you that I am a man and I have more power than you.'"" Then he raped her, she says, as his friend watched. Gaca said: ""[Afterwards] I went to the railway train road, because I was suicidal at the time. I was lying on the tracks. I think the train was 100 meters away from where I was. Then some other guy came and grabbed me. The train passed. He called the police."" It is called ""corrective rape"" - where men force themselves on lesbians, believing it will change their sexual orientation. The extent of the problem is hard to know as South African police do not compile corrective rape statistics separately from other rape cases. But human rights groups in the country -- where gay rights are constitutionally protected -- are outraged. Cherith Sanger, of the Women's Legal Centre in Cape Town, which provides legal support for rape victims who cannot afford good lawyers, said: ""We believe that corrective rape warrants greater recognition on the basis that there are multiple grounds of discrimination. ""It's not just about a woman being raped in terms of violence against women, which is bad enough, but it's also got to do with sexual orientation so it's another ground or level of unfair discrimination leveled against lesbians."" It was not the first time Gaca had been raped. She says she ran away from her home village, in the rural Eastern Cape, after the first rape when she was 15 years old and too afraid to press charges. She says running was easier than dealing with a community that didn't accept lesbians. She moved to Khayelitsha Township, a sprawling shanty town near Cape Town, Africa's ""gay capital"" where she hoped to find tolerance. Instead, she was confronted by more hate. ""Being a lesbian in Khayelitsha is like you are being treated like an animal, like some kind of an alien or something,"" she said. While there are no official statistics on corrective rape, there have been enough publicly reported incidents to spark widespread alarm. This time Gaca is fighting back. New York-based Human Rights Watch recently conducted interviews in six of South Africa's nine provinces and concluded: ""Social attitudes towards homosexual, bisexual, and transgender people in South Africa have possibly hardened over the last two decades. The abuse they face on an everyday basis may be verbal, physical, or sexual -- and may even result in murder."" The group added: ""This is a far cry from the promise of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of 'sexual orientation' contained in the country's constitution."" Most known victims, like Gaca, are poor and black and so are the perpetrators, prompting many to ask how a people who fought against discrimination during apartheid can today treat some of its most vulnerable in such a violent manner. Siphokazi Mthathi, South African director at Human Rights Watch, said: ""We've failed to make it understood that there is a price for rape. Sexism is still deeply embedded here. There is still a strong sense among men that they have power over women, women's bodies and there's also a strong sense that there's not going to be consequences because most often there are no consequences."" Interpol estimates that half of South African women will be raped in their lifetime. But corrective rape is not even recognized as a hate crime and rights groups say few victims report their cases to the police. But Gaca did. In many African countries being gay is illegal. In South Africa, those entrusted with enforcing the country's ""tolerant laws"" now stand accused of re-traumatizing victims. ""When a woman is raped she is re-raped by the system and for me this is a big thing because it's a serious violation of our constitution and the duties that are placed on the state in terms of what the state needs to do for survivors,"" Sanger said. CNN saw the treatment meted out to survivors firsthand with Gaca as she trekked from police station to police station trying to first find, and then get answers from, her investigating officer. He was the third assigned to her case since she reported the attack in December 2009 and she eventually found him at the sexual offences unit in Bellville, a 30-minute drive from her home. Despite the sensitive nature of her case, he met her in the wide, open office. When Gaca asked why the police had failed to interview her alleged attacker's friend, who witnessed the rape, another officer in the room told her: ""I never take a statement from a suspect's friend."" He added: ""The suspect's friend is obviously going to say you are in a relationship with the suspect or that he didn't see anything. The only statements that are important here are the ones from your friend, a neutral person or a neighbor. Not someone who was there watching while you were being damaged and he wasn't helping."" CNN requested an interview with the investigator and was referred to his superiors, before being granted an interview with South Africa's Minister of Police, Nathi Mthethwa, who promised an investigation. ""I feel bad,"" the minister said. ""I feel bad about all these things. That is why I'm saying people who are responsible have a case to answer."" No action has so far been taken against the police officers who not only treated Gaca with disdain but who she also had to push every step of the way to do their job. When they let her alleged attacker go without taking DNA evidence, potentially crucial in proving his guilt, it was Gaca who insisted they re-arrest him. After neglecting to question the eyewitness who was allegedly there throughout the incident, it was Gaca who forced the police to talk with him. She says she sat in a car while they questioned him, as he leaned in through an open window to tell the police officer what he saw of the assault, forcing Gaca to once again relive the experience. South Africa's Victims' Charter was drafted in 2004, granting seven fundamental rights to every victim of crime. Among them is the right to be treated with fairness and with respect to your dignity and privacy. Gaca says these rights are ideals she has never experienced. Yet she's determined to press on. She said: ""They always get away with it. I'm just pushing so that there will be a different story on my case. Maybe if this guy could be sentenced or something happens to him I think a lot of my friends will report their cases because some of the lesbians, they don't report their cases, they don't go to the police station because they know that it will just be a waste of time."" Nearly two years after reporting her case, Gaca is still awaiting her day in court, still hoping for justice, and still fighting.","In South Africa the full scope of 'corrective rape' is not known because cases are not separated from other forms of rape .

"(CNN) -- Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher likely had a devastating brain disease when he shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself two years ago, a doctor says in a new report. Dr. Piotr Kozlowski, who prepared the report, found tangles of tau proteins in seven sections of the hippocampus structure in the brain, findings consistent with other players diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure crucial for memory. CNN had an outside neuropathologist validate the findings of Belcher's pathology report. The doctor said the results appear consistent with CTE, which is concerning because tau is not normally found in such a young brain. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. More than 50 former NFL players, including Junior Seau and Dave Duerson, have been posthumously diagnosed with the disease. Many have committed suicide. Belcher's body was exhumed in December, a year after he was buried. Former NFLer: 'Your mind just goes crazy' Belcher, who was 6-foot-2 and weighed 228 pounds, played for the Chiefs from 2009 to 2012, appearing in 59 games. On December 1, 2012, the linebacker fatally shot his girlfriend, Kassandra Perkins, in the same home with their 3-month-old daughter. He then drove to the team's practice facility, thanked his coaches, and shot himself. He was 25 years old. The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau -- a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear. CTE can be diagnosed only after death. Report: Former NFL player's body exhumed for brain study . In July a federal judge approved a preliminary settlement in a class action concussion lawsuit filed by thousands of former NFL players against the National Football League. The suit alleges the NFL didn't do enough to warn players about the risks of brain damage. About 5,000 former players are involved in the class action but as many as 20,000 might be eligible. Current NFL players are not included in the agreement. Some family members can also file a claim after the ruling becomes final this fall.

"(CNN) -- Location, location, location: It matters greatly to the success of democracy. Last week, for the second time in a decade, a popular uprising in Ukraine chased away a corrupt, authoritarian leader. (The same leader both times, as it happens.) The Orange Revolution of 2005 ended badly -- and the same adverse conditions overshadow Ukraine's hopes today. Yet in Ukraine, neighbors Poland and Germany have supported and defended that nation's dissidents and democrats. But Ukraine is not the only authoritarian regime facing protests. And it's not the only nation where democratic neighbors could make a positive difference. Unfortunately, in the other case -- Venezuela -- too many of those neighbors are silent. Except only for brief punctuations by rebellions and invasions, Russia ruled Ukraine as a province from the late 17th century until 1991. Vladimir Putin seems to regard the state of affairs since 1991 as merely another of those punctuations. Under Putin, Russia has subverted Ukrainian institutions and manipulated the Ukrainian economy. The goal has been to subordinate Ukraine as a dependent, compliant and nondemocratic subject state. Putin succeeded in that goal after 2005. He'll surely try again after 2014. Whether he succeeds again or is thwarted will depend greatly on the efforts of Poland and Germany above all. Those neighbors exemplify the transition to democracy and a normally functioning economy. The Polish foreign minister was in Kiev during the crucial hours before the flight of President Viktor Yanukovych. Germany has offered aid to cover Ukraine's energy debt to Russia and has warned Russia against any tampering with Ukraine's territorial integrity. In Venezuela, at least eight people are dead and dozens wounded in protests. Many of the casualties have been inflicted by semicriminal motorcycle gangs known as colectivos, loyal to the Bolivarian regime, so-called because Hugo Chavez helped change the official name of the country to Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Internet has been turned off in cities sympathetic to the opposition, both to stop information arriving -- and, maybe even more, to prevent photos and videos of regime brutality from exiting. Colombia's cable news network has been dropped from Venezuelan cable systems. CNN has been threatened with the same fate unless it alters its coverage more to the authorities' liking. CNN has not complied, and thus far the Venezuelan government has not executed its threat. Cuba has sent troops to reinforce the government. In this dangerous situation, the presidents of Chile and Colombia have urged the Venezuelan government to permit peaceful protest and eschew violence. These statements carry impressive moral weight. Chile is South America's outstanding democratic paragon. Since the end of the dictatorship in 1989, power has alternated from democratic right to democratic left and back again. Outstanding economic management has led Chile to the highest per-capita income in South America, catching up to Estonia and Lithuania, and ahead of Poland. Colombia has made impressive progress subduing a decades-long insurgency and inviting former rebels to join the political progress under the new and more liberal constitution of 1990. It has suppressed drug trafficking: Aerial surveys indicate Colombia's coca acreage has been reduced by three-fourths since 2000. President Barack Obama has hailed Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as ""bold and brave"" in his work for peace and security inside Colombia -- a task made more complex and difficult by the late Hugo Chavez's military and financial support for the drug-trafficking remnants of the Colombian insurgency. Because the presidents of Chile and Colombia are identified with the political right, however, their condemnation is easier for the Venezuelan government to shrug off than would be condemnations from democratic presidents associated with Latin America's democratic left. Brazil's Dilma Rousseff could play an especially important part here. Herself once a left-wing guerrilla against Brazil's former military regime, Rousseff embraced democratic politics in the 1970s and 1980s and was chief of staff to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a former trade unionist and Brazil's first president of working-class origins. Lula da Silva was everything that Chavez pretended to be, a leader who promoted social welfare policies while also respecting basic freedoms and civil rights. Unlike Chavez, who started his political career with a failed coup, Lula da Silva always followed constitutional rules. Again, unlike Chavez who repeatedly rewrote Venezuela's laws to extend his hold on power, he left by the constitutional timetable. As Lula da Silva's successor, Rousseff inherits much of his prestige. Yet that moral voice keeps silent as Venezuela's goon government exerts ever more censorship, corruption and violence to extend its grip on power. The authoritarian governments of Latin America -- not only Venezuela but also Cuba, Ecuador, and Nicaragua -- form almost a trade union of shared ugly interests. Where is the unity of the continent's democracies? For very understandable historical reasons, Latin American governments worry about overbearing American action. Yet many won't act, even when their most important interests and most cherished values come under violent attack. The leaders of Germany and Poland have learned from history that embattled democrats, when left alone, may die alone. The lessons apply as well in the Western Hemisphere as in the East -- the lessons and the responsibility. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Ukraine and Venezuela experience deadly uprisings against authoritarian regimes .
David Frum: Ukraine's neighbors support the activists, but many of Venezuela's don't .
Chile and Colombia condemn regime, he says, but they're right wing and thus suspect .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ann Romney told CNN on Thursday that she is still ""done"" with the idea of another presidential bid, but adds ""you know, you never do say never."" ""At this point in time, that's where we are mentally is done,"" Romney said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday morning, when asked about the possibility of her husband Mitt Romney seeking a third presidential bid. And she said her husband is ""absolutely"" in the same mindset. That interview came after she said her family was, ""Done. Done. Done"" with her husband's presidential ambitions in an interview with the Los Angeles Times published Monday. But Romney said Thursday on CNN that ""we never say never"" and that the country would be in a better place if her husband were president, calling him ""one competent guy who really is a great leader."" Ann Romney on Mitt 2016: No 'at this moment' The drain of the 2012 campaign hasn't faded from the Romney family and Ann Romney recalled that the family vowed to be done with Mitt Romney's presidential ambitions after his loss to President Barack Obama in 2012. ""At election night, we all looked at each other ... and we said we gave it everything we had,"" Romney said. ""We didn't have an ounce left to give."" ""Emotionally and mentally, that's where we still are,"" she said. But Romney again refused to completely shut the door on 2016 when asked if she could say confidently that her husband would not make a 2016 bid. Romney grew emotional when she described her husband's accomplishments and experience managing ""turnaround situations"" -- from rescuing the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics to his tenure as Massachusetts governor to his corporate experience. ""I think the times call for someone of that capability,"" she said. Romney even suggested that ""what's happening in Russia"" wouldn't be the same if her husband were president and recognized that would make a great case for a 2016 bid. And Mitt Romney's entire family agrees on that point, his wife said. ""My kids are like, 'Come on Dad, it's just such a shame you're not there,'"" Ann Romney said. Mitt Romney's open letter: I love Ann . Romney was on CNN's New Day discussing the launch of the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases, a research center that will look to find treatments and cures for diseases like multiple Sclerosis, which Ann Romney was diagnosed with, as well as Alzheimer's Disease and ALS, among others. That interview came after Romney first said her family was, ""Done. Done. Done"" with her husband's presidential ambitions, but then told the Washington Post the next day that ""we'll have to see what happens."" Will Mitt Romney take the plunge again? And on 2016, Ann Romney seems to be taking the cues from her husband as she told the Washington Post Tuesday that ""we'll have to see what happens."" That comment nearly identically echoed how her husband has explained that while he doesn't envision a 2016 run, there's always a chance. ""We'll see what happens,"" he told New York Times Magazine last month. And in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, the two-time presidential contender said ""circumstances can change, but I'm just not going to let my head go there.""","Ann Romney said her family -- including her husband -- doesn't want a repeat of the emotionally draining 2012 campaign.

"(CNN) -- For Anna Younker, owning a bridal shop means serving customers who are planning one of the happiest days of their lives. It's a job she loves. ""She's the salt of the earth,"" said her husband, Donald. But since October 16, the couple's lives have been turned upside down. Ever since news broke that nurse Amber Vinson had visited their Ohio store just before being diagnosed with Ebola, the fallout has been unrelenting. The couple's Coming Attractions Bridal Shop, a business they cultivated for nearly 25 years, is dark, they say, mainly thanks to Ebola hysteria. ""It's a little hard to believe that something like Ebola from halfway around the world can affect our lives right here in Akron,"" said Donald Younker. ""The world is clearly smaller than we think."" On Sunday, the bridal shop looked like a ""Star Trek"" set. Bright blue light beamed from five ultraviolet ray machines in an operation designed to eliminate any possible trace of the Ebola virus. It's called a TORCH UV system from New Jersey-based ClorDiSys Solutions Inc. The Younkers say a team spent about five hours performing the service free of charge. Now, the fascinating part: The Summit County Health Department told the family the cleaning effort was unnecessary. ""You don't have to do it if you don't want to, that's what they told us,"" Anna Younker said. Even if the virus was present, health officials say it doesn't live long on surfaces. Dr. Marguerite Erme, the Summit County medical director, also told CNN the cleanup wasn't needed. ""It was the same thing they told us about closing,"" Younker added. 'I'm hoping that this will ease everybody's mind' The couple say they did it because of ""public scrutiny."" ""I'm hoping that this will ease everybody's mind that if there's anything floating in my store that it's gonna be gone,' Anna Younker said. The couple say that by shutting their doors and scrubbing the shop, they hope to ""get rid of any"" stigmatization. Or will they? Despite their efforts, the Younkers worry they may have to get rid of their entire inventory, including hundreds of dresses. ""I think that's probably what I'll have to do,"" Donald Younker said. For now, their insurance company is suggesting they may not be covered, saying a virus such as Ebola may be an exclusion. Yet, the Younkers say, there's no evidence the virus was in the shop. He's also worried about possible lawsuits from customers. He isn't sure why. Yet he says nothing would surprise him. It's unexpected craziness,"" said his wife, Anna. ""Some people are going over and beyond to panic."" Travel restrictions . Anna Younker is listed as a ""contact"" with Vinson because she waited on her in the bridal shop. The Health Department told her that for three days, she wasn't allowed to leave her home. Now, the restrictions have been loosened. She can leave her house but cannot use public transportation and must tell officials if she wants to leave the county. Someone still comes to her home to record her temperature once a day. Her 21-day oversight will last about two more weeks before it can be lifted. But even though her husband, who works at IBM, and their 10-year-old son have no official restrictions, they're also affected. ""He was supposed to go to an amusement park to do some Halloween activities. He was supposed to go to a Cavs game, (but) we can't do any,"" she said. ""They're not under quarantine, but because of the stigma that we would feel ... and getting scrutinized and being told we were reckless with public safety, we didn't want that,"" she added. When she first found out about Vinson, Younker called her son's school principal to let her know. ""I wanted to make sure she was comfortable that my son was at school, and she was,"" Younker said. Then, as news spread, the school closed as a precaution to get scrubbed down. The principal told her that parents were calling with concerns. ""They asked me what can I do,"" Younker said. ""They weren't telling me I cannot send my son to school but ... I did choose to keep him home just so all the parents, teachers, families are not panicking."" And while Younker says she's been getting a lot of support from a diocese and friends, there are others who don't want her son there, for now. ""I don't want my son to be treated as if he's full of germs. ... There've been some parents that said if this particular child would come to school that's associated with this Ebola ... they will not send their kids to school.""

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong restaurateur Yenn Wong got quite a surprise one morning earlier this month. The co-founder of popular Hong Kong restaurant Chachawan Isaan Thai and Bar, Wong woke up and logged onto her computer to find a friend had forwarded her multiple images of a second Chachawan restaurant in Shanghai. In addition, Chachawan's Facebook page was filled with enthusiastic inquiries asking if the shop had opened a new branch in Shanghai. Wong looked closely at the pictures online. The Shanghai Chachawan bore the hallmarks of her successful Hong Kong eatery. It had the same exterior look and feel as the Hong Kong shop. Even the menu, focusing on northeastern Thai -- or Isaan -- cuisine, looked the same. Opened earlier this month, the Shanghai restaurant had already earned scores of 5/5 stars from six of its eight reviewers on Dianping, China's crowd-sourced food forum. Given that she had no plans to expand her operations to Shanghai, the copycat Chachawan stunned Wong. ""It is extremely disappointing to see the restaurant in China has used not just the Chachawan name, but also our exact logo and font which was designed specially for us,"" Wong tells CNN. ""They have also used a very similar retro-poster theme for their interior and marketing materials, as well as other elements of our interiors,"" says Wong. ""We feel this is such a disrespect to the hard work and creativity that our own team, graphic designers and local artists have put into Chachawan Hong Kong."" A collaboration between Wong and chef Adam Cliff, Chachawan gained instant popularity upon its opening in 2013 and has remained one of the hottest no-reservation restaurants in Hong Kong. Shanghai Chachawan claims no knowledge of original restaurant . Both the manager and a staff member at the Shanghai Chachawan tell CNN they have no idea about the existence of the Hong Kong Chachawan. To their knowledge, theirs is the only Chachawan in China, they say. The manager, surnamed Guo, said the restaurant's name and logo are the responsibility of a marketing department manager who was not made available for contact. ""I'm surprised that they say they have no idea about Chachawan since the owners have dined at Chachawan [in Hong Kong], and in fact had formal meetings with chef Adam Cliff and owner Yenn Wong in April this year, expressing their interest in taking the concept to [mainland China], which was declined,"" says Kiri Sinclair, a public relations spokesperson for Chachawan in Hong Kong. Knockoff 2.0 . Long known for knockoff smartphones, designer clothing and luxury hangbags, mainland China's copycat profiteers have in recent years moved into the business of counterfeiting whole shops and brand identities. A 2011 blog post depicting the brilliant ripoff of an Apple Store in Kunming -- which copied nearly every element of the store, including the friendly blue-shirted staff -- went viral, leading to a reported government clampdown. Some 22 illegal stores were identified and forbidden to use the Apple logo. Chachawan isn't the first restaurant to suffer the indignity of a mainland knockoff. Japanese cheesecake shop Uncle Rikuro found an unlicensed chain of Rikuro bakeries operating in various cities in China, attracting long queues of gulled fans. More than 200 ""Rikuro"" stores are still operating in China. Chinese restaurants are also imitated. After Chinese President Xi Jinping was spotted lining up for steamed dumplings at one of Beijing's Qing-feng steamed dumpling chain shops, the store began attracting even longer-than-usual queues ... as well as imitators. A Qing-feng dumpling shop in Zhengzhou was discovered shortly thereafter to be operating without a franchise agreement from the original store, nor a proper business license. Legal recourse . Though it hasn't yet taken action against its imitator, the Chachawan team in Hong Kong says it's seeking legal advice. The difficulty in pursuing legal action in China often stems from lack of awareness about steps needed to protect one's trademark. ""Generally speaking, a lot of people don't understand the concept of registering the name of their restaurant or store as a trademark,"" says Hong Kong-based Rosita Li, an intellectual property partner in global law firm Mayer Brown JSM.. ""Even if they understand the concept, they may just have registered their name in the location where they have operations. It never occurs to them that there may be people copying their name. ""And it's difficult to prove your name is well-known in China, where the threshold is high, as well."" According to Dr. Yahong Li, an associate professor of law at Hong Kong University, attaining legal redress in such cases in China is often difficult. ""Chachawan can take legal action only if it has registered its trademark in China, or can prove that its mark is well-known in China,"" Dr. Li tells CNN. ""Otherwise, it has a very slim chance to win and I do not recommend suing."" To Chachawan's owners, however, the issue has moral as well as financial implications. ""We serve authentic Isaan cuisine and the concept was put together exclusively by myself and Yenn Wong after a great deal of research and my own experience of having worked and lived in Thailand,"" says chef Adam Cliff. ""It is upsetting to have someone else ride on the reputation and success that has come from so much hard work, creativity and passion."" CNN's Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","An unauthorized version of popular Hong Kong Thai restaurant Chachawan has opened in Shanghai .
Despite near-identical signage and menu, manager from replica Chachawan says he has no knowledge of the original restaurant .

"(CNN) -- What would we lose if we lost 220,000 postal jobs (120,000 proposed through layoffs, 100,000 through attrition), 3,700 post offices, 300 mail processing plants, or even the post office itself? With millions of jobs and businesses lost to the recent recession, these may seem like just more numbers, or more seemingly inevitable ""facts"" -- that in the electronic age we now rely on the private sector to deliver public services. But postal workers are people we depend on and post offices are places we want to know will always be there. Downsizing the U.S Postal Service - -which is so low on money, it's in imminent danger of default -- may seem like a ripple in this troubled economy, but it promises to be a social tsunami if action isn't taken soon to save it. For one thing, the postal service has been a huge employer. Before I became a history professor I carried mail for the Postal Service for 20 years. As with many government jobs, you're hired for this one based on achieving a high score on a competitive exam. Veterans, roughly 20% of today's postal workforce (though once well over 50%) earn extra points on this exam, thus giving them a head start and a job to come home to after military service. Who were my co-workers? Just everyday people who, like me in 1980, were attracted to a job that had good benefits, job security, and started at $8.10 an hour. This was as a result of the 1970 nationwide postal wildcat strike that began in New York after postal workers declared they were tired of earning $2.95 an hour and having to work a second job or collect food stamps to make ends meet. In collecting oral histories for a book I later wrote on the postal service, I interviewed those who had worked before 1970, including those who struck. The postal worker's job could include processing mail as clerks and mail handlers, delivering it as letter carriers, driving it as truck drivers, and as maintenance workers keeping up the vehicles, buildings, and grounds. Above all, postal workers were proud of having a career serving the public. The job allowed many to move into the ranks of middle-class wage earners, where they were able to buy homes and send their children to college. But they were also members of extended families and community networks. Many started small businesses on the side, adopted foster children, were active in civic organizations, or enrolled in college classes. Their jobs mattered to communities. Postal jobs have especially played a key role in black community development. The post office has long been one of the largest employers of African-Americans. Even as they faced discrimination at other jobs, many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts. By 1970, they had become twice as likely as whites to work for the post office, and even before the wage bump that year, the job had afforded them a middle-class status and the ability to accumulate wealth. Today the nation relies on a vast mailing industry that operates primarily for profit. But that network is underpinned by the U.S. Postal Service -- a self-supporting quasi-corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate. Many Americans may not realize that it was the Post Office that pioneered parcel post in 1916 in response to the overpriced, poor, and inconsistent service disaster that was private package delivery. Or that the USPS came up with the concept of overnight mail and zip codes that UPS and FedEx rely on so heavily in their business. Many don't make the connection that e-commerce not only competes with but also generates U.S. mail. Or that during the turn of this century -- the Postal Service's peak years of revenue and mail handling -- it was common to hear competitors and political ideologues calling for the agency's privatization, while at the same time blocking USPS innovations like the proposed 1997 Global Postal Link program to help expedite parcels through customs. Or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, signed by President George W. Bush, which forces the Postal Service to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years. What should have been annual revenue surpluses for the Postal Service over the last decade have instead contributed to nightmare annual deficits as it is forced to pay $5.5 billion a year out of operating funds to satisfy this unnecessary and devastating mandate. . We lose more than numbers when we lose postal jobs and post offices, or even the existence of a universal postal service. We lose more than just people committed to providing service, but also people engaged with their communities. People able to consume goods that others produce to help drive local economies. We would also lose the promise of jobs in the future that provide what has become a more dependable service over two centuries since the founding of this country (the post office was started in 1775). An alternative to this loss? People could demand that Congress treat the Postal Service as a venerable American institution worthy of fulfilling its enduring mandate, for which it has recruited generations of skilled and dedicated professional government employees. A good start would be H.R. 1351, introduced by Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts, a bill that would at least allow the Postal Service to transfer surplus pension funds to satisfy the retiree health plan pre-fund requirement. And that pre-fund requirement ultimately needs to be repealed to keep the Postal Service from running off the rails. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philip F. Rubio .","Philip Rubio says the U.S. Postal Service threatened by major cuts or even closure .

"(CNN) -- The crackdown on protesters after the police shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, highlighted that more and more, police departments possess sophisticated weapons and equipment originally designed for the battlefield. Federal anti-terrorism funding is a major driver of this trend, but once police departments have this equipment they use it -- even if it's not against terrorists. What few people understand is that police increasingly make use of sophisticated surveillance equipment as well. NSA-style mass surveillance technologies are making it possible for local police departments to gather information on each and every one of us, on a scale never before been possible. One key area in which the government is amassing large pools of data is location tracking, particularly of automobiles. You might think that location data isn't sensitive. After all, when you're out in public other people can see you. But that's not the right way to think about it. Most Americans drive everywhere. Most can't go to a therapist, a church, a gun range, a bar, or a casino without driving. And when all of that information about where we go is amassed into a large database stored by a government agency and held for months, or years, that's a sensitive collection of information. History has shown that once the government has access to massive pools of data, it's just a matter of time before it's abused -- for political retribution, or even simple voyeurism. An important driver of this trend toward mass surveillance of Americans' movements is the automatic license plate reader. They sound innocuous -- and if they were used in a limited and appropriate manner, they would be innocuous. These devices snap a photo of every passing license plate. If all the police did was check the captured plates against lists of cars associated with people wanted for crimes, there would be no problem. But in the era of cheap data storage, police are increasingly using the technology to amass vast pools of data tracking where people have been over time—and hanging onto it for months or even years. The question is not whether law enforcement agents should be permitted to use license plate readers: The question is how they should be permitted to use them. You can agree that license plate readers are useful for identifying wanted criminals who are driving around, but disagree that the government should amass vast pools of data about everyone, given that most of us are not criminals. This technology can be abused -- and it has been abused. In New York, police in cars equipped with plate readers drove by mosques to record each attendee -- a major burden on the freedom of religion that many of us hold dear. In the UK, the police put the plate number of activist John Catt, in his late 80s, on a hot list because he'd attended a large number of lawful protests. (He was known to sketch the protesters.) Federal funds are being spent to push this equipment out across the country, a process that often bypasses the role that traditional elected representatives once played because the police no longer need funds from the city council. And the technology is more powerful year over year as the cost of computer processing plummets and storing data becomes a trivial matter. The presumption has flipped. Police departments once asked themselves: Why keep this data? But now data storage is so cheap that they ask: Why not keep it? One of the most pernicious aspects of how police departments have adopted surveillance technologies—which is really deciding how much privacy people should enjoy—has been the lack of public debate or even knowledge that these technologies are being adopted. Because police departments can get funding from the federal government, often there is no need to involve local legislative bodies, let alone the public, in the process. Sometimes this lack of notice has led to a backlash. In Seattle, the mayor instructed the police department to terminate its drone program and return the drones to the vendor after the public learned that the drones had been acquired. The public wants in on the debate about surveillance—and democratic values suggest that we ought to have this opportunity. But in the main, we know far too little about which cities and towns around the country are using powerful surveillance technologies. The time to fix this is now.","Catherine Crump: U.S. police getting surveillance equipment and anti-terror weapons .

"(CNN) -- Karen Klein is probably not the first face that comes to mind when you think of a poster child for bullying. Yet there she was, sitting in the back of Bus 784 as it rolled through the streets of Greece, New York, on Monday afternoon. Four middle school boys barraged her with verbal abuse, jabbing her about her weight, attacking her family and chuckling as they made violent and graphic threats. Except for a few even-keeled retorts, the 68-year-old bus monitor brushed sweat from her brow and remained quiet, peering up front and out her window, seemingly waiting for her hellish ride to end. Her suffering may have gone unnoticed had not one of the young teenagers posted a 10-minute video of the harassment on YouTube. By Wednesday, police were interviewing Klein and her alleged verbal abusers. And by the next day, as the video began going viral, she had become a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. Her torment became a prism through which total strangers the world round characterized her experience as symbolic of everything wrong with modern-day parenting, children and more. Beyond anger, some expressed sadness for the seemingly defenseless older woman who, they felt, bravely suffered the slings and arrows flung at her for no good reason at all. Klein ignored bullies, until suicide taunt . ""I couldn't watch the whole video -- I don't know how you live through it,"" wrote one woman, Marykate, in an online post. ""God bless, you are my hero."" Yet bad things happen all too routinely, with people abused and killed most every minute in most every corner of the world. So why did one grandmother's videotaped bus ride become so engaging and emotional for thousands of people she has never met, prompting them to issue emotional pleas to police and to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars? Count Klein among those taken aback by all the attention. After hearing from CNN's Anderson Cooper that Southwest Airlines offered her and nine others an all-expense-paid trip to Southern California to go to Disneyland, she described it as ""awesome"" but seemingly too good to be true. ""I still can't believe it,"" she said Thursday night. ""I don't feel like I've done anything."" But the reaction isn't entirely surprising to Sara Hodges, a social psychology professor at the University of Oregon. The fact the attacks are so pointed and Klein's pain so apparent makes it easy for people to identify with as she soldiers through a torrent of verbal abuse. ""It's such a clear case of somebody who is being bullied,"" said Hodges. ""She's all alone, and she has no allies. ... And what the kids are saying is so obviously hurtful. ... It's so compelling that you can't turn away."" Stranger sets up 'Kindness for Karen' Facebook page . And for all the statistics about the number of people bullied each year or perhaps news reports about elderly being targeted, people tend to respond more -- and more viscerally -- to a person being attacked and suffering with their own eyes, the professor states. ""We feel much stronger feelings for an individual than we do for ... an abstract group,"" Hodges said. Max Sidorov was one of those people moved by Klein's plight. Living in Toronto, he'd never met her but said the YouTube video ""struck a chord with me,"" a feeling that -- as someone who'd been bullied himself -- he couldn't let go of without taking action. ""I felt very sad for Karen, and I felt I had to do something to support her in this time,"" he said. His first thought was to raise money through the site indiegogo.com, hopefully enough ""to get her away from the environment and get her on vacation somewhere."" So he set up the site, hoping to amass $5,000 over the next month. By late Friday afternoon, that fund had more than $545,000. Family of bullied bus monitor asks for threats against students to stop . Donors like Marykate gave not only their money but their heartfelt support for Klein in remarks posted on the website. ""Karen, I am so sorry that these children were so mean to you,"" wrote one commenter named Mary. Added a man, identified as W. Ronald, ""I hope the recognition that thousands and thousands of people heartily dislike what those children did helps you feel a little better."" Yet many on that site, as well as CNN.com's story -- which was shared on Facebook by more than 35,000 people as of Thursday night and had more than 6,300 comments -- levied blame, as much as they offered support. Many chastised modern-day children and parenting for fostering such behavior. Some criticized the bus driver for not halting the verbal abuse, even though Greece Police Capt. Steve Chatterton stressed that it took place on the back of a noisy bus, far from the driver. And a few even singled out Klein for not being more forthright to stop it. When a bullied kid grows up . ""Children have no respect because they are not taught to respect,"" a CNN.com commenter with the handle Rahzmahm wrote. ""Ask the nearest child to you the meaning of the word and you probably would not get a sufficient answer."" Police and town leaders in Greece -- a community that has nearly 100,000 residents, three school districts and nearly 42 square miles of area yet still proudly sees itself as a town, one where things like this just don't happen -- talked about being peppered with messages from around the world decrying the episode. While condemning the outrage, town Supervisor John Auberger tried to assure people that these four boys didn't represent the entire community. He described his ""town"" as a place full of people ""who are kind, respectful neighbors and hardworking,"" much like Klein. Online and in messages to school and police officials, many demanded that the youngsters overheard in the video be arrested. Chatterton said he's ""gotten e-mails from the United Kingdom (and) from all over the United States saying prosecute, prosecute."" ""I feel it. I feel it,"" he said. ""But we have to follow the law. We can't tailor the law to meet this case because of public outrage."" Teen says bullies beat him, sues New York. schools . Police also said the seventh-graders had received death threats from people near and far. For example, Chatterton said, one of their cell phones ""had over 1,000 missed calls and 1,000 text messages threatening him. And he is a 13-year-old."" Hodges, the University of Oregon professor, said she's not surprised by the communal desire for justice. She said this could be explained through the ""just-world hypothesis,"" the belief that people think the world should be good -- and when it is not, especially when a blameless and vulnerable person suffers as a result, someone needs to be punished. ""Clearly, something is wrong, this shouldn't be happening,"" Hodges said. ""There's a sense somebody needs to be blamed. ... People feel the need to balance the scope."" One person not calling for the four boys to be thrown behind bars is Klein. The bus monitor said that, right now at least, she does not want police to pursue criminal charges. But Klein would like to see them banned from the bus and athletic activities and, most of all, wants to make sure they don't bully anyone else. ""I want to make sure that they never do this again, to anybody,"" she said. What would you do with a mean kid?","Video shows middle school boys harassing a New York bus monitor .

"New York (CNN) -- Call them the not-so-friendly skies. A flight attendant cursed out passengers, grabbed a beer then triggered an emergency chute Monday at a JFK Airport terminal, authorities say.

Share your dramatic work exit story . Police arrested Slater for allegedly triggering the emergency escape chute, a spokeswoman for the district attorney said. Slater was arrested at his home and charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass, said Helen Peterson at the Queens District Attorney's Office. The incident took place just after the Jet Blue flight landed when a passenger stood to remove a bag from the overhead bin while the plane was still taxiing, a law enforcement source with direct knowledge said. A flight attendant exchanged words with the passenger, and the conversation escalated. Slater picked up the intercom and used expletives directed at the passengers, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. It is not clear exactly what was said on the intercom. The source said that when the plane at stopped at the gate, Slater then grabbed some beer from the beverage cart before deploying the emergency slide and using it to leave the plane. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that it ""appears"" the flight attendant quit his job in a very dramatic way. ""I know the facts that have been related to me -- the plane was taxiing in, some passenger got up to take their bag down, the steward -- flight attendant -- approached, told him to not do that,"" said Kelly. ""He called him an expletive and apparently hit him or pushed him in some way. The story got on the radio based on a statement that 'I've been doing this for twenty years and I'm out of here.'"" ""It's a strange way to quit, let's put it that way,"" he said. ""I don't think he'll be able to come back."" The law enforcement source said that Port Authority police did not learn about the incident for about 20 to 25 minutes after it took place. Jet Blue public affairs would not respond to that claim. The airline also would not confirm any details of the incident but said that the evacuation slide was deployed on a plane that had parked at the gate after arriving from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The identity of the passenger involved in the altercation has not been confirmed. As a rule, passengers are required to stay in their seats with their seatbelts fastened until the pilot has reached the gate and gives the all clear sign. Peterson said the second degree criminal mischief and first degree reckless endangerment charges are felonies that could land Slater in jail for up to seven years. The criminal trespass charge and two other lesser mischief and endangerment charges are misdemeanors.

"(CNN) -- Give Miley Cyrus some credit: she's ridden this ceaseless wave of publicity all the way to No.1. Her latest album, ""Bangerz,"" is at the top of iTunes in 70 countries, and the expectation is that she's going to arrive at the top of Billboard's 200 album chart as well. While her success could be brushed off with the industry motto ""all publicity is good publicity,"" those who've closely watched the 20-year-old's development say that's not the whole story. In CNN's ""The Life of Miley Cyrus,"" which examines Cyrus' music, message and personal journey, insiders who've intimately come to know the singer/actress say that her transition from a childhood of ATVs and cheerleading to adult superstardom was no accident. Instead, Cyrus has executed her transformation with total control. Shirley Halperin, music editor for The Hollywood Reporter, tells CNN she gives Cyrus ""a lot of credit for her own street smarts and her own understanding of what consumers want."" After all, Halperin says, ""there was a time when people thought Miley Cyrus would never be on Top 40 radio, because Disney was too squeaky clean. Well ... she's certainly turned that around."" And how did she do that? By systematically shedding her reputation as a tween celebrity. Cyrus herself has never been ""squeaky clean"" -- even before she turned 18, her actual image was occasionally at odds with the image those parents paying for tickets to ""Hannah Montana"" concerts expected. According to Josh Eells, the Rolling Stone writer who went skydiving and to a tattoo shop with Cyrus for Rolling Stone's recent cover story, believes the beginning of this transition happened at 17, when Cyrus was filming the comedy ""LOL"" in Detroit with Demi Moore. ""She said that was the first time that she was really ... basically by herself. There were other(s) -- obviously the rest of the cast and crew was around -- but she was kind of living on her own,"" Eels said. ""She would go out to clubs, which she'd never really done before. I think it was probably easier for her to be anonymous or kind of fly under the radar in Detroit a little bit. She said she learned a lot from (Moore), and I think she got into hip-hop more up there."" While ""LOL"" failed to make a dent in Cyrus' rep, a certain haircut that same year definitely did. In August 2012, the singer made one of the biggest statements a young celebrity can make: she drastically changed her look with a super-short, platinum blonde haircut, a clear departure from anything she'd done before. According to Steven Peterman, an executive producer on Cyrus' old show, ""Hannah Montana,"" that sort of risk-taking is nothing new. ""The thing that makes you wonder, 'What's she gonna do next,?' I've been asking that about her since the day I met her,"" Peterman said. Photos: Child star transformations . When Cyrus was first auditioning for the part, ""she was the least likely person to get this job,"" Peterman continued. But with her combination of vocal talent and that unpredictability, she wound up winning the creative team over to her side. ""There was something about her that was so alive and so fearless, and that's what we all talked about in the room,"" Peterman said. ""That's part of who she is. And it's part of, as an artist, what she probably needs to be. It means that she's going to, at times, make mistakes. But I think she's strong enough to get through it all and come out the other side."" Of course, as Cyrus has peeled off the layers of adolescence -- along with several layers of her actual clothes -- many have ""tsked"" at her seemingly new image: There are the references to marijuana (super lemon haze is said to be her strain of choice); the sexually suggestive music videos; the risquÃ©, semi-nude photos - not to mention her ""Wrecking Ball"" video - both courtesy of Terry Richardson. And then there's that tongue. But, Eells suggests, ""the things that we see that seem crazy are very calculatedly crazy. Pharrell (Williams) phrased it in a very long text message that he wrote to her: 'You're not a train wreck, you're the train pulling everyone else along.' (Cyrus) seems to be totally together and with it and knows exactly what's going on."" Halperin agrees, noting that it isn't easy to simply wake up and decide to aim for the top of the hot singles chart. ""That requires a great deal of planning to say, 'Here we are in 2007, by 2010-2011, we want to be on top 40 radio. It takes four years to develop an artist like that,"" she said. ""And that's what we've seen. We've seen her development. And it's not an accident; it is very strategic."" In order to build any longevity, Halperin explains, ""we need to see her go through these musical phases and these stylistic changes, too. We can look back at any (act) -- Justin Timberlake or 'N Sync -- and laugh at what they wore, what they sang. But at the moment, it was perfect for what the audience was looking for. (Cyrus) knows what her audience wants. Right now, Cyrus knows that her audience wants honesty -- sometimes of the naked variety. And with ""Hannah Montana"" getting farther in her rear view, frank vulnerability is what the pop star can offer. With ""Bangerz"" and all the changes it has brought, Cyrus told CNN that she's now ""able to be just more honest as an artist. And that's really what my record is about.""","""The Life of Miley Cyrus"" explores the star's development .

"(CNN) -- An act of civil disobedience 55 years ago -- Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of a city bus -- made the seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama, a pivotal symbol in America's civil rights movement. Wednesday marks the 55th anniversary of the civil disobedience on December 1, 1955. Parks did not intend to get arrested as she made her way home from work that day. Little did the 42-year-old seamstress know that her acts would help end segregation laws in the South. That evening after work, Parks took a seat in the front of the black section of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The bus filled up, and the bus driver demanded that she move so a white male passenger could have her seat. But Parks refused to give up her seat, and police arrested her. Four days later, Parks was convicted of disorderly conduct. The events triggered a 381-day boycott of the bus system by blacks that was organized by a 26-year-old Baptist minister, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The boycott led to a court ruling desegregating public transportation in Montgomery, but it wasn't until the 1964 Civil Rights Act that all public accommodations nationwide were desegregated. Parks, who died five years ago in Detroit, Michigan, at 92, still has the power to inspire. ""I think that she, as the mother of the new civil rights movement, has left an impact not just on the nation, but on the world,"" U.S. Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, said shortly after her death. ""She was a real apostle of the nonviolence movement."" He remembered her as someone who never raised her voice -- an eloquent voice of the civil rights movement. ""You treated her with deference because she was so quiet, so serene -- just a very special person,"" he said, adding that ""there was only one"" Rosa Parks. Facing regular threats and having lost her department store job because of her activism, Parks left Alabama for Detroit in 1957, where she later joined Conyers' staff. Parks later co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development to help young people pursue educational opportunities, get them registered to vote and work toward racial peace. ""As long as there is unemployment, war, crime and all things that go to the infliction of man's inhumanity to man, regardless -- there is much to be done, and people need to work together,"" she once said. Parks remained active on the lecture circuit into her 80s, speaking at civil rights groups and accepting awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999. ""This medal is encouragement for all of us to continue until all have rights,"" she said at the June 1999 ceremony for the latter medal.","Parks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 .

"(CNN) -- One of the oldest existing man-made structures, more than 2,000 years old and a world-travel icon that ranks alongside the pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge -- the Great Wall of China should be on every traveler's bucket list. To make the most of your visit, take some advice from these dos and don'ts. DO choose a section of the wall that's right for you. Most travelers visit one of these sections from their hotel base in Beijing: Juyongguan (closest to Beijing but less interesting than most other sections); Badaling (close but crowded); Mutianyu (farther away but less crowded and set among gorgeous mountains); and Jinshanling and Simatai (farther away still, but perfect for adventurers). Note: Simatai is currently closed for site improvements. Travel + Leisure: World's most-visited ancient ruins . DON'T spend less than two or three hours exploring the wall. You'll need at least that much time to get the true flavor of the centuries-old structure. DO go in the spring or fall, when the weather is fine and the crowds are few. Summertime is often too hot, and winter can be treacherous. DON'T forget plenty of water, sunscreen and a hat if you visit during the blazing summer. You'll need it all. Great Wall much longer than previously thought . DO consider signing up for a day tour at your hotel's activities desk. It's the simplest way to go. Tours cost around $30 per person and include mini-bus transportation with an English-speaking guide and driver. DON'T visit the wall on weekends or holidays, when it is most crowded. Remember, it's not just foreigners who tour the Great Wall. Chinese love to visit as well on their days off. Travel + Leisure It List: World's best new hotels . DO visit either Badaling or Mutianyu if you have mobility concerns; they both have aerial cable cars. Mutianyu also has a ski lift, but only Badaling is wheelchair accessible. DON'T expect clear skies. The awful smog that often afflicts Beijing can spread to the wall itself, lending a dull haze to the surroundings. If possible, do try to visit on a breezy day or after a rainstorm. DO take a ride on the wild, mile-long toboggan track that leads down from the wall at Mutianyu to the village at the base of the wall. DON'T believe that you can see the wall from space. Apollo astronaut Alan Bean said he tried to spot it, but that no man-made object is visible once you leave the Earth's orbit. Travel + Leisure: London insider's guide .

"(CNN) -- Call it the big tease. We already knew ""That '70s Show"" co-stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were parents. The couple had a baby girl on Tuesday, People magazine reported. Now we know the little girl's name. It appeared on Kutcher's website Thursday night along with a bunch of baby pictures. ""One of these is Mila and Ashton's baby....and her name is Wyatt."" This is where the mystery beings. Underneath are eight photos -- six different newborns, a dog and some undetermined critter. Take your pick, one of them is the new Kutcher kid. ""Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world,"" a website post by the proud new daddy says. ""May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy. ""Can you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute."" Signed, ""Ashton."" Mila Kunis to men: Stop saying you're pregnant . While Kunis, 31, and Kutcher, 36, have stayed pretty quiet about their pregnancy and engagement, Kunis told W magazine in July that she was ""excited about being a full-time mom."" In the same feature article, Kunis revealed that her first kiss was with Kutcher while filming ""That '70s Show."" After the show ended, the A-list actors followed different journeys for some time. The two rekindled their relationship in 2012 -- shortly after Kutcher separated from his then-wife, Demi Moore, and became engaged in early 2014. This is the couple's first child together.","The couple were co-stars on ""That '70s Show""

"(CNN) -- A bad breakup: Nothing can be as emotionally tumultuous for a young heart. Except maybe finding out via your Facebook newsfeed that your college ex is dating someone from your fraternity. That was the defining moment that eventually led Brolin Walters, 24, to ultimately break up with something else: Facebook. ""I didn't want to see what was going on with them,"" said Walters. ""So I deactivated my account."" With a website that boasts 901 million active users and is launching an IPO on Friday, it seems unlikely that once you get on Facebook, you'd ever leave. But deactivating from the social networking site is not that unusual. Close to half of Americans think Facebook is a passing fad, according to the results of a new Associated Press-CNBC poll. More and more people are stepping away from the technological realm and de-teching. There are even sites where they can pledge to delete their Facebook accounts. And tech writer Paul Miller from The Verge decided to leave the Internet for a year to reassess his relationship with it. We asked whether any of you had left Facebook, and the responses urged in. From privacy issues to a need for more face time, the reasons for choosing to live without Facebook ran deep. Maintaining a professional image . Although Walters, now a consultant, initially left Facebook for social reasons, he says he was also thinking about his career. ""You don't want a future employer to find something that they would deem questionable,"" he said. Job prospects and personal privacy compelled high school student Alexander Clark, 18, to deactivate his Facebook account as well. Ever since he can remember, Clark has wanted to join the Air Force. Now, as he comes closer to making that dream a reality, he says he wants to maintain a professional image. ""There are things on Facebook that I don't want my employer to see, and what I was told was 'what's on Facebook stays on Facebook.' "" Despite leaving the site for privacy reasons, Clark considers Facebook to be a pioneering company. ""I would totally buy their IPOs if I had the money, but I'm just not [as] into Facebook as I used to be, and I think it is from the life decisions I have made,"" he said. Focusing on ""real"" communication . Putting in the effort to make a phone call: That's what Shiela O'Dea does now after deleting her Facebook account. O'Dea's move off Facebook was gradual and started when she found the site went from being fun to being habitual. ""I was literally on it all the time,"" she said. ""When I first logged off for good, I would think about getting back on. But the more I stayed away from it, the more I realized I didn't need it."" O'Dea says after deactivating from the site, she makes a greater effort to socially engage with others. ""It's funny, it's called a social networking site, but we are sort of disconnecting,"" she said. ""It is mass communicating, but we are losing something -- we are losing our interpersonal skills."" Chris Andrus says he started feeling the content on Facebook became impersonal and irrelevant to his life. So he and his wife deactivated their accounts after five years on the site. He says their social lives improved after leaving Facebook because now they focus on more in-person connections. ""We feel like we have strengthened relationships with close friends and family that are truly important to us, and not concerned ourselves with the other hundreds of 'friends' that really aren't important,"" he said. Shedding an emotional burden . A study from Utah Valley University says there is a direct correlation between the amount of time spent on Facebook and the way people perceive their lives. Users that spent more time on the site reportedly thought their Facebook friends had better lives than themselves. That definitely rings a bell for Andrea F. (who didn't want her last name used). She says Facebook made her perceive herself differently, and she felt pressured to be a certain way. The 28-year-old deleted her account 10 months ago when she realized how self-conscious Facebook made her feel. She started caring too much about what people she barely even knew thought about her profile and status updates, she explained. ""To make myself feel important, I made up exaggerated posts to garner attention from friends,"" she remembers. ""Does that make sense ... no, but maybe I was not aware that I was unconsciously doing that until I got off [the site]."" Avoiding a time-waster . The average Facebook user spends more than six hours a week on the site. For some, that's just too much time. As a young mother, Evelyn Bateman, 30, said Facebook transformed into a time-waster for her. ""I would sit on the computer, logged onto Facebook, looking at photos of my high school friends' baby pictures and I would think to myself, 'Wow I haven't talked to these people -- there are people I haven't spoken to in 10 years,"" she said. After deactivating her account, Bateman found time to sit down with classic novels and spend more them with her young children. ""It is so easy to lose an hour of time on Facebook,"" she said. Bateman's friends and even her husband are still on the site. After deactivating from Facebook, she now notices that people are not as engaged with their real lives because they are so entranced with their cyberlives. ""My husband would get these updates of his friends at a bar, and they would be updating their Facebook with photos and he said, 'I wonder what it must be like to hang out with someone that is constantly updating,' "" she said. Maintaining personal privacy . Privacy was the biggest reason behind Tom Martin's deactivation from Facebook in 2011. The 23-year-old says that although the site is free to use, people are paying a price by providing their personal information. He says Facebook is swiftly making profiles more public, and he does not want to compromise his privacy. ""I do not want to be a part of this apparent mission to alter the norms of society,"" Martin said. ""Facebook has frequently changed its privacy settings in the past and will do so again, always in favor of less privacy."" Despite his adamant stance on maintaining his deactivation from Facebook, Martin admits to missing the occasional social outing or party by not being a member of the site. ""There is somewhat of a social price to be paid for rebelling against the trend,"" he says, but he believes the people who really care about him will make the extra effort to stay in touch. A downside to de-teching? Although de-teching is emerging as a trend, some people noticed a negative stigma attached to not having a Facebook account. O'Dea says people usually can't believe it when she tells them she is not on the site. ""They are shocked that I no longer communicate using Facebook, almost like there is something seriously wrong with me,"" she said. Martin highlights similar experiences when people discover he is not on the social networking site. ""Once in a while a person will respond as if you've attacked their religion and indignantly start defending the site and trying to convince me how great it is and why I should use it,"" he said. Walters says he gets the ""I can't believe you're not on Facebook"" remark often. But he prefers face-to-face conversations much more than the digital, fleeting responses he would get via Facebook. Even though he has noticed his social life change after Facebook, he says overall he is happy with his decision to deactivate. ""My network is smaller but stronger,"" he says. CNN's Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","It's the unlikeliest of tech trends: Deactivating from Facebook and social media sites .

"(CNN) -- Wondering how to get the most of your smartphone camera? Is there more to mobile photography than filters to make your pictures look better than they really are? Multimedia journalist and iPhone street photographer Richard Koci Hernandez recently joined the CNN iReport community on Facebook for a chat about how to become a better smartphone photographer. ""People do not understand the unbelievable opportunity that mobile photography is giving photographers,"" Hernandez said. ""It's a golden age."" Hernandez offered these tips: . 1. It's all about the light. ""Photographing in the right light -- early morning or late evening -- has the potential to make the most 'boring' situation into a spectacular one!"" 2. Never use the mobile zoom. ""It's terrible and the first step to an unsuccessful image. If you want to get close, zoom with your feet! Get close and your images improve,"" he said. 3. Lock your exposure and focus. Your photos will improve 100%, Hernandez said. ""With the default camera app, you can tap and hold on the screen to set where you want your exposure and focus. Once the box ""blinks,"" it's locked. You can also use other apps like ProCamera to separately set and lock the exposure and focus. 4. Silence your inner critic. ""See if you can go one day of shooting every time your inner voice says, 'I'd like to take a picture.'"" 5. Edit, edit edit. Restrain yourself from sharing everything. Post only the best, and your audience will grow. ""We don't need to see all 10,000 of your ugly children,"" he said. ""I try and pick my least ugly. it's hard to choose and very personal."" 6. Technical proficiency is overrated. ""Exercise your power of observation. Learn to look and see deeply."" 7. Filters don't replace a good eye. ""You still need the basics. Look for the moment and light and subject. If you choose to add a sepia, black and white or other nostalgic or creative filter later [with an app such as Instagram or Hipstamatic], that's OK, but remember lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig."" And if it's for journalism, he added, ""then it needs to be unfiltered."" 8. Shoot from the hip for better candids. ""Hold the phone about waist-level and tap away. Your friends and family will not know what you're doing. Be sneaky about it. The moment they know you're shooting, the images become less candid. You'll get a lot more bad shots, but when you get a good one, you'll want to hang it on the wall!"" 9. Give yourself assignments and deadlines. Take 20 images of one thing from different angles. You'll begin to see the world differently, even if it's just walking around the bowl of fruit on your kitchen table and observing how the light falls on it from different angles. 10. You have to know what you want to see before you can see it. ""Make a list of things you want to photograph today and find them! If you know my work, then you know the No. 1 thing on my list are men in fedoras! Or any hat for that matter!"" 11. Study other photographers. ""I spend an unhealthy amount of time looking at images. It's the only way to get better, in my humble opinion. My favorites are Roy Decarava, so happy we discovered Viviam Maier, and on Instagram, a dude named Daniel Arnold out of New York is just killing it!"" 12.  Always be ready. ""You want to make sure that when your mind and heart says 'shoot,' you have no excuses, like, Oh, my camera was in my purse, pocket, or, gasp, your camera wasn't around. It's one of the main reasons I love mobile photography -- my camera is always with me.""","iPhone photographer Richard Koci Hernandez shares 12 tips .

"(CNN) -- The Catholic church can't have it both ways on gay rights. Either it must take steps to accept gay and lesbian people as part of its flock -- including them as full members, embracing their unions, decrying Catholic schools that fire gay and lesbian teachers and calling for the full protection of LGBT people around the world. Or it can go back to emphasizing its condemnation of homosexual acts as ""intrinsically disordered,"" as it does in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The current middle ground -- with church leaders saying ""homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer the Christian community,"" but not fully embracing them as equal humans in the church and under the law -- is unsustainable and dangerous. Gay rights groups cheered on Monday when a draft document from a group of bishops and priests suggested the church could be more welcoming to the gay community. ""Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community,"" they wrote. ""Are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities? Often they wish to encounter a Church that offers them a welcoming home."" But on Tuesday the Vatican backtracked from its statements, saying it did not want to create ""the impression of a positive evaluation"" of same-sex relationships. A generous reading of this flip-flop would be that a divided church is wrestling with a sensitive social issue, on which its members and clergy disagree. My sense is that the church wants to be seen as tolerating gay people -- and therefore not out of touch with the modern world -- without actually embracing them. That sends a potentially dangerous and confusing message to young LGBT people, who look to the church for moral guidance, and who are more likely to fall prey to homelessness and even to commit suicide than their straight peers. (One report from the Williams Institute at UCLA found 40% of all homeless kids identify as LGBT.) These kids like that are looking up to Pope Francis, who famously said it's not his place to judge gay and lesbian people. To his credit, Francis -- the people's pope, the guy who drives a old car and lives in a modest apartment -- is setting the right tone. But the church needs to follow his lead and move quickly toward real inclusion and acceptance of gays, not just tolerance. Here are three simple ways it could do so: . 1. Make a serious push for LGBT rights in Africa . The Catholic church wields significant influence in sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to 171 million Catholics, according to a Pew report. Some countries on the continent are known to persecute LGBT people -- including giving them prison sentences. Catholic leaders have spoken out against the death penalty and violence being used against LGBT people. But they should go further. In their statement, church leaders said on Monday that it is not ""acceptable that pressure be brought to bear on pastors or that international bodies make financial aid dependent on the introduction of regulations inspired by gender ideology."" However, those very tools should be used to push for equality where it's needed most. Catholic leaders in Africa not only should speak out forcefully against discrimination and violence against LGBT people but also should work toward guaranteeing their safety and acceptance. 2. Embrace same-sex marriage . Catholic people are relatively welcoming to the idea of same-sex marriage or civil unions -- especially in the United States. According to a 2010 survey of 1,015 American Catholic adults, three-quarters support those practices. A poll last week found 42% of American Catholics support same-sex marriage, specifically. Globally, 30% of Catholics support same-sex marriage, according to a poll released this year. The church, meanwhile, in its report on Monday, continues to assert that ""unions between people of the same sex cannot be considered on the same footing as matrimony between man and woman."" Catholicism isn't truly welcoming to gay people until it updates that policy. Regardless of public opinion, it's the inclusive and fair thing to do. Meanwhile, the church acknowledges ""it has to be noted that there are cases in which mutual aid to the point of sacrifice constitutes a precious support in the life of the partners"" in same-sex unions. To hold that belief, it needs to act on it. 3. Stop the firings of gay teachers . It's become a sadly common occurrence for gay and lesbian teachers at Catholic schools to be fired when the administration learns that a man in Seattle has a husband or that a woman in Michigan becomes pregnant while in a same-sex relationship. ""The discharged teachers, of course, are the most seriously injured, but so are all the people associated with the schools -- students, graduates, parents, and staff,"" Charles J. Reid, Jr. wrote for the Huffington Post. ""The Catholic school system is diminished in the eyes of the public. And the church as a whole is made to suffer."" Again, the emphasis should be on the students. What are they to think of institutions that would fire their role models simply because of who they are? There are signs of hope. Nuns from Marian High School, in Michigan, where a lesbian teacher was fired, say they are rethinking their policies. ""Pope Francis has brought a sense of hope to our lives and encourages us to look at our Church with new eyes,"" Sister Mary Jane Herb says in a letter posted on Facebook. ""No, it is not likely that doctrine will change; however the Pope emphasizes that the values of mercy, inclusion and compassion need to be included in our response to complex situations."" It's unclear, however, whether the fired teacher, Barbara Webb, will be reinstated. A Change.org petition in her support has 72,000 signatures. More-inclusive dialog should be celebrated, sure. But it shouldn't be conflated with actual acceptance.","The Catholic church issues a new statement on the inclusion of gay people .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy's oldest nuclear aircraft carrier has given a piece of itself to one of the younger carriers in the fleet. Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding said this week that its workers had transferred an anchor from the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), the Navy's first and oldest nuclear carrier, to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), a Nimitz-class carrier launched in 1988. The Enterprise, which was launched in 1960, was inactivated in 2012 and is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2016. Once its nuclear fuel and reactors are removed, it will be cut up for scrap. It has been at the Virginia shipyard for the de-fueling process. The Lincoln is in the same shipyard for what is called a refueling and complex overhaul. ""During this multi-year process, every inch of the carrier is updated or refurbished, including its two massive anchors,"" the shipyard said in a statement. When it was found that one of the Lincoln's 30-ton anchors needed to be replaced, crews turned to the Enterprise, which had an exact match that would have been headed to the scrap heap with the rest of the five-decade-old ship. ""With this anchor, both ships will be linked, and Lincoln will carry Enterprise's spirit as it returns to the fleet,"" Chris Miner, Newport News' vice president of in-service aircraft carrier programs, said in a statement. That anchor move may assuage some Navy enthusiasts, who have pushed for a new Navy vessel to carry the name Enterprise once the current ship finally leaves the fleet. The carrier now docked in Newport News is the eighth American warship to carry the Enterprise name. The Naval Vessel Register, the service's official list of ships, shows the Enterprise name assigned to hull number CVN-80, a proposed aircraft carrier yet to be authorized or funded by Congress. The Lincoln's overhaul is expected to be complete in 2016, when the ship is scheduled to head out for sea trials, according to a shipyard statement. Meanwhile, the Enterprise will be towed down the East Coast and all the way around the tip of South America and up the Pacific Coast, with a final destination of Puget Sound, Washington. There its nuclear reactor will be removed and buried at a disposal site on the former Hanford nuclear production complex on the Columbia River.","Aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in shipyard to have nuclear fuel removed .

"(CNN) -- You feel worse by the hour. Your joints ache; your head feels heavy; you can't stop coughing. You're freezing, even as your temperature keeps climbing, and your stomach is upset. Even your eyes hurt. Face it: You have the flu. Now what do you do? Most flu patients should not go to an emergency room, said Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. They will likely be sent home, as there is very little that can be done for them. A fever as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit is common for the flu, he said. Patients with normal flu symptoms should get a lot of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches, Zich said. And while you might not believe it today (or tomorrow, or the next day), ""In five to seven days, you're going to be feeling yourself again,"" he promised. Better flu vaccine on the horizon . But there are scenarios in which going to a hospital is necessary. If a patient is short of breath or can't keep fluids down because of nausea, these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention, Zich said. Excessive vomiting or sweating from fever can lead to dehydration, which is serious and requires treatment. The antiviral medications Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) can reduce the severity of symptoms and the length of illness, but the drug has to be taken within 48 hours of the first appearance of symptoms -- you know, the ""I will not get sick"" phase -- to be most effective. Antiviral treatment is recommended mostly for people at a higher risk of flu complications. That would include people younger than 2 or older than 64; those with chronic diseases; patients with suppressed immune systems; and people of Native American or Alaskan Native heritage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It won't help to take Tamiflu or Relenza as a preventative, because they are designed to treat symptoms, Zich said. All they are likely to do for a healthy person is cause an upset stomach. Getting a flu shot while you're healthy won't give you 100% protection, but it is your best bet. Read more: 5 ways to protect your child .

"Beijing (CNN) -- When I first came across a ""virtual lover"" service on e-commerce site Taobao, China's version of Amazon, I thought it was hype. For an average of 20 yuan ($3) per day, it claimed you could hire a boyfriend or girlfriend to talk on the phone or chat online to make you feel like you're in love. The service varies but it includes wake-up calls, text and voice messages, phone calls and goodnight wishes. As the largest online shopping platform in China, Taobao vendors sell anything they can think of as long as it's not illegal. Usually I would be skeptical about such a service but I was drawn to a comment left by one ""virtual girlfriend"" enthusiast. ""It was awesome -- she shared my happiness and cheered me up when I was down. She has a beautiful voice, and an intelligent mind... I so don't want to leave her."" This glowing review got me interested in having my own ""Miss Right"" on my smartphone. I contacted the Taobao vendor and she asked if I had any preferences. Options included ""doll-like girls"" and ""mature women,"" while ladies had the choice of different types of ""boyfriends,"" including ""comforting man,"" ""funny lad,"" and ""understanding uncle."" I said that I'd like the girl to be cheerful but not too ""doll-like."" Then she asked for my WeChat number, an instant messaging app with 450 million users, and told me there was no refund if I changed my mind. 'Journey of love' It wasn't long before I got my first voice message from my own virtual girlfriend, called Maopi, outlining the terms of our relationship: ""Hello, this voice message is to prove that I'm not a boy, nor a robot. Also, please leave out anything erotic in our conversations. I'm very much looking forward to our journey of love,"" she said in a business-like voice. She told me she was a college student majoring in design, liked painting and hated pineapples, although she didn't know why. Then she briefly lectured me on some ground rules of the game: No private information, no photos and no video chat. Normally, I would much rather have a conversation with my date across a dinner table but her voice was intriguing and I spent a few hours chatting with her about food, music, relationships and our favorite TV series. Confidence boost . A virtual girlfriend may sound seedy but psychologist Paul Yin says this kind of service appeals to men who don't have the confidence to enter a real-life relationship. ""They can gain confidence and feel loved through this experience and there's no risk in getting frustrated from setbacks,"" he told CNN. ""Many young men can't find enough courage to approach girls they find interesting because they fear to be rejected."" I also wondered whether a person could really make a living from being someone's virtual boyfriend or girlfriend and asked Maopi to share her side of our virtual love story. She said people sign up with her for different reasons: Some feel lonely and want to have someone to talk to, some seek comfort after breaking up with lovers, and many just sign up out of curiosity. ""I've had some quite dedicated 'lovers' who would sign up for months just to chat with me,"" she said. She said business had been good since she started working as a virtual girlfriend in July. However, she said she couldn't remember how much money she made. For her, the job is more about hearing different stories. Pleasant surprise . The next morning, I woke up to find 24 unread messages. It was my girlfriend's attempt to wake me up. We exchanged a few more voice and text messages but it didn't feel long before my day-long ""virtual love affair"" came to an end. If you want to know how it feels to have a virtual relationship, I'd say if you're lonely or heartbroken from a recent break up, finding a virtual lover might work better than boozing all night and drunk dialing your ex-lover at three in the morning. And for those who want to ""get lucky"", I guarantee you'll have better luck with the first person you dance with at the nearest club. Though my virtual love affair was platonic, I still enjoyed her company. And I was pleasantly surprised when she asked to exchange photos and keep in touch after our day was up.

"(CNN) -- A homeless hitchhiker who achieved Internet celebrity by acting as a Good Samaritan with a hatchet was arrested at a Philadelphia bus depot Thursday in connection with the murder of a New Jersey attorney, authorities said. Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, 24, known on Facebook and YouTube as ""Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker,"" is facing a murder charge in Union County, New Jersey, authorities said. McGillvary was arrested Thursday evening at the Greyhound terminal by Philadelphia police after New Jersey authorities issued a public call for help in finding him, said Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow. ""I am grateful for the overwhelming response and dedicated effort by the public and law enforcement that led to this arrest,"" Romankow said in a statement. ""I believe that everyone is a little safer with this person off the streets."" Earlier Thursday, Romankow acknowledged the Internet fame surrounding McGillvary, who is crediting with saving two lives in California. ""This man was well-known. That doesn't mean he did not or could not become involved in a crime,"" Romankow told reporters. ""We believe he has murdered someone -- an attorney by the way who was in the county, was well respected, well regarded for well over 40 years. ""As far as we're concerned, I don't care who he is. We're looking for him,"" the prosecutor said. McGillvary is wanted in the death of attorney Joseph Galfy Jr., authorities said. McGillvary and Galfy exchanged text messages over the last few days, Romankow said. ""It's more like 'Come pick me up' and 'I'll be there at this time,' "" Romankow said. ""But not anything of a personal nature."" But investigators believe McGillvary and Galfy had a sexual relationship, Romankow said. ""There has been some indication of that on Facebook,"" the prosecutor said. Romankow didn't know why the two men were in contact with each other. Investigators also don't know what the motive was for the murder, but they know that the two men were together Sunday evening, the prosecutor said. Galfy was found dead Monday morning in his Clark bedroom, wearing only underwear and socks, Romankow said. ""He was severely beaten,"" Romankow added. McGillvary received national attention after CNN affiliate KMPH interviewed him about a February hitchhiking experience in which he used a hatchet to subdue the driver who claimed to be Jesus and struck a utility worker with his car, then grabbed a woman as she provided help at the scene in Fresno, California. Romankow said Thursday that McGillvary has been known to use the back end of a hatchet. The utility worker underwent surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, and the driver, who stood more than 6 feet tall and weighed at least 300 pounds, was arrested, the affiliate said. With long hair sweeping out of a bandana, McGillvary provided a dramatic account of the rescue and gestured how he wielded the hatchet against the rampaging motorist in a ""Smash! Smash! Sa-mash!"" manner, he told the affiliate. He spoke in the patois of a surfer. The female bystander, apparently not injured, confirmed the incident in an interview with KMPH. McGillvary's Facebook page says that ""Kai saved a woman's life by cleaving a man in the head, with a hatchet, after he had just hit someone with his car."" McGillvary's story was featured on ""The Colbert Report"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" the affiliate said. The murder charge against McGillvary carries a bail of $3 million, Romankow said. Galfy lived alone, and he wasn't married and had no children, Romankow said. McGillvary also goes by the names Kai Lawrence, Caleb Kai Lawrence and Kai Nicodemus, authorities said. He has cut his hair to alter his appearance and was last seen at a light rail station in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Romankow said. McGillvary is homeless but calls himself ""homefree,"" authorities said. ""Authorities believe that McGillvary relies on the generosity of strangers for food, lodging and transportation,"" the prosecutor said in a statement. ""He is considered to be armed and dangerous.""","NEW: Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, aka ""Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker,"" is arrested .

"Washington (CNN) -- Had it not been for Rosa Parks and others of her era, President Barack Obama said he wouldn't be unveiling a bronze statue of the civil rights icon in the U.S. Capitol. ""We can do no greater honor ... than to carry forward her principle of courage born of conviction,"" Obama said at a ceremony on Wednesday. Fifty-eight years after she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks became the first African-American woman to be honored with a full length statue in National Statuary Hall. The statue shows Parks sitting with her hands folded neatly in her lap, reminiscent of the day of her arrest. Her action echoed Martin Luther King Jr's notion that civil disobedience could be effective in challenging segregation. ""The tired feet of those who walked the dusty roads of Montgomery helped a nation see that to which it had once been blind. It is because of these men and women that I stand here today,"" Obama said. ""It is because of them that our children grow up in a land more free and more fair. A land truer to its founding creed, and that is why this statue belongs in this hall."" Obama was joined at the unveiling by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite rising acrimony between Obama and congressional Republicans over the forced government spending cuts set to go into effect on Friday, Obama kept his remarks focused on Parks' legacy. He praised her courage and the lasting effects of her actions. Congressional leaders did the same. The National Statuary Hall Collection consists of two sculptures gifted from each of the 50 states. They honor distinguished people throughout U.S. history, including several presidents. Parks' statue was authorized by a special act of Congress that was introduced two days after her death in 2005.","Rosa Parks is first African-American woman to be honored with a statue in Statuary Hall .

"Washington (CNN) -- Using some of the most dramatic language yet by a U.S. official, Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday called on world leaders to contribute far more to the international Ebola response. Kerry warned that, absent a concerted effort by the international community, ""Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades."" The secretary made these remarks to a room of foreign ambassadors at the State Department in Washington. He called on them to use their influence to bring stronger commitments to the Ebola fight, which has plagued Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia for weeks, and has spread as far as the United States and Europe. Rand Paul: Ebola is ""not like AIDS"" ""There is no country that is exempt from being able to do something to be able to contribute to this effort and help make a difference,"" Kerry said. ""And everything we do depends on how we coordinate our efforts as partners in how we contribute together."" Kerry praised a handful of countries for their contributions to the effort, including Cuba -- a historical foe of the U.S, that more often finds itself under criticism by the State Department. ""Cuba, a country of just 11 million people, has sent 165 health professionals,"" Kerry noted in his remarks, ""and it plans to send nearly 300 more."" The United Nations has called on the international community to give $1 billion to the Ebola response effort over the next six months. So far, Kerry noted, only about a third of that need has been met. ""We live in a world of a lot of close calls, tough decisions on a daily basis -- difficult and contentious issues where you can have an honest disagreement about what the best course of action is, or about what the facts are, or the results of your decision may be,"" Kerry conceded, adding, ""Ebola is not one of them."" So far, more than 4,000 people have died from the epidemic in West Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that there will be between 5,000 and 10,000 new Ebola cases per week there by the first week of December.

"(CNN) -- An Arkansas inmate seeks to exercise what he says is a key tenet of his faith, but corrections officials cite security concerns in their refusal to accommodate. The issue comes down to a half-inch beard, and this claim of religious liberty within prison walls will now be debated by the Supreme Court. The justices will kick off the first week of their new term with a one-hour oral argument Tuesday. The case will be another major test of the government's ability to justify a range of policies that might restrict religious accommodation -- from the Obamacare health law to workplace hiring. Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, is a Muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the high court. He cites rights under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. The state responds that inmate beards could pose a security risk to guards and the public: Prisoners who escape could shave their facial hair, altering their appearance. And weapons and other contraband could be hidden in heavy beards or inside their cheeks, covered by facial hair. Current Arkansas prison policy allows only a ""neatly trimmed mustache."" The Obama administration is backing Holt, and some legal analysts say that could ultimately sway the justices, who have traditionally been deferential to the security judgments of prison officers. ""It's all about whether or not there is a compelling government interest that's being put forth in the least restrictive way possible,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive legal think tank. ""And here, maybe Arkansas hasn't met its burden for saying it can limit a person's ability to grow a beard when his religion compels him to do so."" The beard case is one of three high-profile disputes over religion that will be heard by the justices in coming weeks. One involves a federal law allowing American citizens born in the holy city of Jerusalem to list the county of origin on their passports as ""Israel"" or ""Palestine."" Right now, those passports list no country, a reflection of the disputed control over the region. President Barack Obama and his predecessor have resisted the congressional mandate, saying it interferes with his executive power to recognize independent sovereigns. And the court will hear arguments over whether local governments can impose stricter regulations on temporary church signs than on other noncommercial displays, such as lost-dog posters and political campaign banners typically displayed along streets in the weeks before an election. The tiny Good News Community Church is challenging a Phoenix suburb's ordinance, saying it hurts efforts to attract new members to its services in a rented facility. Prison safety vs. religious freedom . Administrative Directive 98-04.D of the Arkansas Department of Correction permits beards only for those ""with a diagnosed dermatological problem."" But in his self-initiated plea to the justices, Holt complained that he and fellow Muslims were forced ""to either obey their religious beliefs and face disciplinary action on the one hand, or violate those beliefs in order to acquiesce"" to the facial hair policy. He cited the Hadith -- literary traditions and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed -- which says, ""Allah's Messenger said, 'Cut the mustaches short and leave the beard (as it is).' "" Holt said he offered to keep his beard to a half-inch as a ""compromise,"" but that was rejected. The U.S. Justice Department has offered its support, saying more than 40 states and the federal correctional system allow beards of varying lengths. ""When Congress enacted RLUIPA, it made clear that courts should accord deference to prison administrators' considered judgments about how to run safe and efficient prisons,"" Obama administration lawyers told the court in a written brief. ""Congress also made clear, however, that such deference is not due when a prison justifies a restriction based on exaggerated fears or mere speculation."" The state obviously sees things differently. Holt is housed at the Varner Supermax, a 468-bed, ultra-maximum security section of the correctional facility in Grady, Arkansas, near Pine Bluff. Officials point to Inmate 129-616's self-admission as a ""Yemen-trained Muslim fundamentalist"" with a violent criminal past. He had been indicted by a federal grand jury for threatening to harm then-President George W. Bush's two daughters. A few years later, he was convicted in state court and sentenced to life in prison for breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend and severely wounding her, slitting her throat and stabbing her in the chest. Law enforcement officials say he threatened to wage ""jihad"" against anyone who helped convict him, both at trial and later behind bars. So state leaders had a simple message for the courts: Allow us room to decide which restrictions work best within each institution's unique circumstances. ""Prisons are dangerous places ... officials create rules intended to strike a delicate balance between safety and security, on the one hand, and giving inmates a sense of dignity and achieving rehabilitative goals, on the other hand,"" said the Arkansas brief to the high court. Corrections officials take ""religious freedom seriously,"" but they also take seriously their ""paramount interests in safety and security, too."" Hobby Lobby case connection . Holt is being defended in court by the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, the same nonprofit group that backed two Christian families in a separate high court challenge earlier this year. At issue there was whether a federal law permitted closely held family-owned corporations the discretion to deny contraception coverage in employer-funded insurance plans. The conservative court dealt a setback to the White House and Obamacare supporters in the so-called Hobby Lobby dispute, saying those with ""sincerely held"" religious beliefs had a limited right to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. The Beckett Fund noted that groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League, along with Catholic bishops, are now backing the inmate. ""The across-the-board support for Mr. Muhammad shows that religious liberty remains one of the bedrock ideals of America,"" said Eric Rassbach, the group's deputy general counsel. ""Whether we treat prisoners with basic human dignity -- including the freedom to seek God -- speaks volumes about who we are as a nation."" Some conservative groups noted that the federal government was supporting Holt in the religious liberty fight while opposing the Christian business owners in the ""Hobby Lobby"" appeals. ""The question is do we hold that religious freedom applies even when we don't agree with the religious principles of the person here,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network. ""The Obama administration doesn't necessarily have as consistent a position. They were against it when it came to the Hahn and Green families exercising their religious freedom, and they're all for it with prisoner beards."" The Supreme Court has debated the issue of body grooming and liberty before. In 1879, Justice Stephen Field struck down San Francisco's Queue Ordinance, which required an inmate's hair in the county jail be cut to a ""uniform length of one inch from the scalp."" Ho Ah Kow, a Chinese immigrant laborer, had been arrested for living in overcrowded tenement conditions, a misdemeanor offense designed to reduce unsanitary, dangerous living spaces. His pigtail was cut, and Ah Kow protested, saying the policy violated ""the religious faith of the Chinese"" natives. Field agreed, concluding that the ordinance on long braids went against the Equal Protection Clause by ""acting with special severity upon Chinese prisoners, inflicting upon them suffering altogether disproportionate to what would be endured by other prisoners."" The current Arkansas dispute is Holt v. Hobbs (13-6827). A ruling is expected in a few months.","Arkansas inmate Gregory Holt cites religious freedom, says the law allows him to have a beard .

"Washington (CNN) -- Here is an unofficial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court if Mitt Romney is elected president in November. This list was compiled from a number of sources, including those serving as informal advisers to the Romney campaign. The Republican nominee has not specified publicly on favorites for the court. Many names mentioned are relatively young judges named to the federal bench by President George W. Bush. Elections raises stakes for possible high court vacancies . Paul Clement, former U.S. Solicitor General . Born 1966. Considered by many as one of the best lawyers of his generation. The Wisconsin native went to Harvard Law School where he was a classmate of President Barack Obama, and later clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. He served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and earned raves for his persuasive, conservational style at oral arguments. Now a private attorney, he has become the go-to guy among conservatives to lead appeals on a variety of hot-button issues: health care reform, same-sex marriage, immigration enforcement, and gun rights. He personally argued seven cases in the 2011 term, including the health care petitions. He has been strategically coy about his chances for the high court, saying he would be honored but remains focused on his law practice. Supreme Court possibilities if Obama is reelected . Judge Brett Kavanaugh, U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit . Born 1965. Began his job May 2006 in a court that has seen several of its former members make the jump to the Supreme Court. A former top official in the George W. Bush White House. His nomination to a federal appeals court for the D.C. circuit was held up for three years by Democrats. Senators Patrick Leahy and Richard Durbin later accused Kavanaugh of misleading the Judiciary Committee during his confirmation over whether he helped formulate policy on the detention and questioning of accused terrorists held overseas by the U.S. military. He is relatively young and considered one of the brightest conservative legal minds. He co-authored the Starr Report investigation of President Bill Clinton and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy and conservative appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski. Judge Diane Sykes, 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Milwaukee . Born 1957. A former private lawyer, county judge, and justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Named to current post in 2004. She is a Federalist Society member and her profile has been increasing among many conservatives. Being a woman and from the Midwest may be seen as pluses if Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were to step down. Wrote a 2011 opinion affirming firing ranges were protected under the Second Amendment, tossing out enforcement of a city ban in Chicago. Toobin: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? Sen. Mike Lee, Republican from Utah . Born 1971. The youngest U.S. senator. The rising GOP star may have the best credentials of any lawmaker to be a justice. Like Romney, he is a Mormon. Lee is a former appellate and constitutional lawyer in Utah and Washington, who twice clerked for Justice Samuel Alito, on both the federal appeals court and later the Supreme Court. His father, Rex, is a former U.S. solicitor general and founding dean at Brigham Young Law School. Lee faces re-election in 2016, and may feel politically obliged to complete his first Senate term before considering a judicial seat. Judge Steven Colloton, 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, works in Des Moines, Iowa . Born 1963. Appointed by George W. Bush and former law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He is a former Justice Department lawyer, U.S. Attorney in Iowa, and lawyer in the Starr Independent Counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton. Judge Neil Gorsuch, 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Denver . Born 1967. Appointed by George W. Bush. Harvard law School graduate who clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. He went into private practice in Washington before joining the Bush Justice Department. His mother, Anne Burford, was the first woman to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. He wrote the book: ""The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia."" Judge Jeffrey Sutton, 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, works in Columbus, Ohio . Born 1960. Appointed by George W. Bush. He once clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. He was the state solicitor in Ohio. Considered a conservative intellectual force on the court. But Republicans may not forgive him when Sutton became the first Republican-appointed judge to back the health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Judge Janice Rogers Brown, U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit . Born 1949. Former California Supreme Court justice, who was among the first African-Americans appointed to that bench. Regarded as a strong reliable conservative in GOP circles. Her father was a sharecropper and she attended segregated schools before moving to Sacramento. She worked in the state attorney general's office, was Gov. Pete Wilson's legal secretary, and a state appeals judge. A former liberal and considered iconoclastic with strong religious convictions. Her nomination to the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit was held up by partisan wrangling. That and her age would be factors against high court consideration. Judge Allyson Duncan, 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, works in Raleigh, North Carolina . Born 1951. Appointed by George W. Bush. First African-American woman on that court.

"(CNN) -- Ola Orekunrin was studying to become a doctor in the UK a few years ago when her younger sister fell seriously ill while traveling in Nigeria. The 12-year-old girl, who'd gone to the West African country on holiday with relatives, needed urgent care but the nearest hospital couldn't deal with her condition. Orekunrin and her family immediately began looking for an air ambulance service to rapidly transport the girl, a sickle cell anemia sufferer, to a more suitable healthcare facility. They searched all across West Africa but were stunned to find out there was none in the whole region. ""The nearest one at the time was in South Africa,"" remembers Orekunrin. ""They had a 12-hour activation time so by the time they were ready to activate, my sister was dead. ""It was really a devastating time for me and I started thinking about whether I should be in England talking about healthcare in Africa, or I should be in Africa dealing with healthcare and trying to do something about it."" Orekunrin did the latter. Motivated by the tragic death of her sister, the young doctor decided to leave behind a high-flying job in the UK to take to the Nigerian skies and address the vital issue of urgent healthcare in Africa's most populous country. Read this: Private jets spread their wings in Africa . A pioneering entrepreneur with an eye for opportunity, Orekunrin set up Flying Doctors Nigeria, the first air ambulance service in West Africa, transporting victims of medical emergencies, including industrial workers from the country's booming oil and gas sector. ""There was a situation in Nigeria where there were only two or three very good hospitals and they were sometimes a two, three, four-day journey away from the places where incidents happened,"" says Orekunrin. ""We also have a huge oil and gas industry and at that time there was no coordinated system for moving people from the offshore environment to a hospital to receive treatment."" Currently in its third year, the Lagos-based company has so far airlifted about 500 patients, using a fleet of planes and helicopters to rapidly move injured workers and critically ill people from remote areas to hospitals. ""From patients with road traffic trauma, to bomb blast injuries to gunshot wounds, we save lives by moving these patients and providing a high level of care en route,"" says Orekunrin. ""Many of our roads are poorly maintained, so emergency transport by road during the day is difficult. At night, we have armed robbers on our major highways; coupled with poor lighting and poor state of the roads themselves, emergency transport by road is deadly for both patients and staff."" Flying helicopters, speaking Japanese . At 27, there isn't much Orekunrin hasn't achieved. Born in London, she grew up in a foster home in the charming seaside town of Lowestoft in the south-east of England. Aged 21, Orekunrin had already graduated from the University of York as a qualified doctor. She was then awarded the MEXT Japanese Government Scholarship and moved to Japan to conduct research in the field of regenerative medicine. After moving back to Europe the young doctor looked set for a promising career in medicine in the UK. But her desire to improve healthcare services in West Africa brought her back to her roots. Orekunrin quit her job, sold her assets and went on to study evacuation models and air ambulance services in other developing countries before launching her ambitious venture, which enables her to combine her ""deep love for medicine and Africa"" with her growing passion for flying -- Orekunrin is also a also a trainee helicopter pilot. ""I wanted to find a way that I can facilitate people who were critically ill,"" she says. ""Get them to see a doctor, and not just any doctor -- I wanted to facilitate getting the right patient to the right facility, within the right time frame for that particular illness, and that's why I came to start the air ambulance."" Last month, the World Economic Forum recognized Orekunrin's achievements by naming her amongst its prestigious Young Global Leaders class of 2013, a group it describes as the best of today's leaders under the age of 40. ""It came as a surprise to me actually,"" she says of the honor. ""I'm really flattered and really happy."" Trauma epidemic . Nigeria, Africa's second-biggest economy, is the continent's top producer of oil, boasting huge petroleum and natural gas reserves. The industry's potential, coupled with a growing financial services sector, is expected to help drive further demand for companies such as Flying Doctors Nigeria, which works on a retainership basis with the public sector, wealthy individuals and oil and gas companies. Yet Orekunrin says that there are still several challenges that need to be navigated to successfully run a company like hers in the West African country. ""The aviation business is very expensive in Nigeria,"" she says. ""Keeping costs down is always a challenge,"" she adds, noting that red tape and bureaucracy are also testing small businesses' endurance. But despite the challenges, Orekunrin remains determined to bring about change in Nigeria's healthcare system. ""I want to achieve a proper use of the healthcare sector in Nigeria,"" she says. Read this: One woman's mission to fix water crisis . Looking ahead, Orekunrin says her goal is to continue improving access to treatment while focusing on the pre-hospital and in-hospital management of injuries. She says that whilst much attention and funding is directed toward infectious diseases, Africa is also facing a big problem treating physical injuries and wounds. ""Eighty percent of the world trauma occurs in low-middle income countries just like Nigeria,"" she says. ""I feel there should be more focus on the trauma epidemic that Africa currently faces."" ""In the UK, I would see one gunshot wound every three or four years. In Nigeria, I see one gunshot wound every three-four days. Add in the road-traffic trauma, falls from heights, industrial injuries, stab sounds, injuries from domestic violence and you see a huge problem that definitely needs addressing.""","Ola Orekunrin, 27, is a medical doctor, helicopter pilot and entrepreneur .

"(CNN) -- Facing anger from families of Flight 370 passengers, Malaysia's Prime Minister said Thursday his government will release its preliminary report on the plane's disappearance. In a TV exclusive, Najib Razak told CNN the report will be available to the public next week. ""I have directed an internal investigation team of experts to look at the report, and there is a likelihood that next week we could release the report,"" Najib said. Later in the interview with CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest, he gave a more definitive statement, saying the report will be released next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week, his office said. In the CNN interview, Najib discussed why he is not yet officially declaring the flight -- and the 239 people on board -- lost. The report has already been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.N. body for global aviation, but not made available to the public. The ICAO told CNN about a safety recommendation in the report: Malaysia said the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after the Air France Flight 447 disaster in 2009. The Prime Minister's comments didn't convince Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was a passenger on the plane. She accused Najib of ""political maneuvering,"" shirking responsibility and deflecting blame in his interview with CNN. ""I spent most of the morning with my jaw basically scraping the floor,"" Bajc told CNN's ""AC360."" ""I'm just so astounded by this new shift that the Prime Minister is taking. ... He's reading from a script sheet that some qualified, professional PR person has put together for him."" Malaysian authorities need to do a better job of communicating with the families and answering their questions during briefings, she said, rather than treating passengers' loved ones ""as if we are the enemy, as opposed to an interested party in helping to solve this mystery."" ""Actions speak louder than words,"" she said. ""The briefings are a joke. ... The patience level of the families group is just gone."" Malaysia has insisted it has nothing to hide and is working to find answers. A committee representing some of the Chinese families have posted 26 questions on the Chinese social media site Weibo. Families plan to demand answers from Boeing . The missing flight is a Boeing 777. While pushing Malaysian authorities for answers, ""we're also extending our reach now,"" Bajc said. Some of the questions the families have, including technical questions, ""we will be bringing directly to Boeing. Boeing has a shareholders meeting next week. And if we're not getting information directly from Malaysia Airlines and from the Malaysian government, we might as well try to go directly to the source. ""Boeing is a publicly traded company in the United States, and that puts them in a position of a little bit more fiduciary responsibility,"" she said. Asked for a response, Boeing sent CNN a written statement: ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with the families and loved ones of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Boeing continues to serve as a technical adviser to the U.S. National Transportation (Safety) Board, and in that role we have been an active and engaged party to the investigation."" Ongoing search . As an underwater drone keeps going up and back down, so do hopes that evidence of the plane may be found. A metal object that washed ashore in Western Australia and sparked the curiosity of investigators Wednesday turned out to be unrelated. And while the Bluefin-21 plunged into the Indian Ocean for its 13th mission Friday, no one was certain the drone would find anything new. The underwater probe has already scanned 95% of the designated search area, with no significant results. Friday marks day 49 of the search for the plane, which disappeared on March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What's next? Malaysian and Australian authorities are mapping out a long-term strategy for the search, which could go on for months or years. An expanded search area might include the last 370 miles (595 kilometers) of the plane's flight path, ocean search specialist Rob McCallum said. ""If the idea is to go more strategic and investigate the entire aircraft flight path, maybe 15 miles or so either side, then you need a more strategic tool, and something like a deep-towed sonar that can provide a very large range indeed -- at the expense of resolution."" The use of a deep-towed submersible device called the Orion is overdue, said Geoffrey Thomas, managing director of AirlineRatings.com. ""That should be brought in as quickly as possible, again, from the United States."" He said it may be time to go back and revisit the calculations of where the plane may be, although officials have already been doing that. ""This is not an exact science,"" Thomas said. ""We have to understand that."" Why so private? Malaysia has not been known as a model of transparency. The same political party has ruled the country for the past 50 years, and the media is not completely free. For its part, the Malaysian Cabinet has agreed to have an international team investigate the disappearance of Flight 370, the country's acting transportation minister said. Hishammuddin Hussein said the names of the members will be announced next week. He also said the team will not be looking into the criminal aspects of the investigation, which remain under the Royal Malaysian Police. ""The main purpose is to evaluate and determine the cause of the accident,"" Hishammuddin said. The question no one wants to ask: What if Flight 370 is never found?

Fans of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and Bale's dark portrayal of the Caped Crusader immediately rejoiced, convincing themselves that Bale's previous denials and his desire to pass the torch to another Batman could quickly be erased by cold hard cash. Perhaps that will eventually be the case. But not today. The recent online buzz erupted after the London Sun reported that ""Bale is facing extraordinary pressure"" to return to the character for a huge payday. The Sun's sources, however, aren't exactly Warner Bros. insiders or members of Bale's inner circle. Instead, the tabloid was blindly relying on a new ebook titled Beyond Batman: The Unauthorized True Story of Christian Bale and His Dark Knight Dilemma. It's a 27-page mini-book from an author named Vincent Russel, who's also written an unauthorized biography of WWE superstar CM Punk. EW: Warner Bros. reveals plans for a Batman/Superman film at Comic-Con . In Beyond Batman, Russel writes about a New Year's Eve 2012 conversation about a potential Justice League movie that he had with a friend who worked at Legendary Pictures during the making of the Dark Knight films: . ""'Why would Christian Bale walk away from what is certainly going to be either the first or second highest grossing movie in the history of cinema,"" he asked, when the subject of Justice League was raised. ... 'He could probably make $50 million for being in the movie 20 minutes,' my friend observed. 'And it would be worth every penny to the studio.' ... Sources close to Christian Bale have reportedly begun expressing their suspicions that Bale now views the Batman films in the same light that Robert Downey, Jr. views the Iron Man films. Although Downey has appeared as Tony Stark in four films in less than a decade, he's hardly typecast as only Iron Man. Downey has balanced his action film escapades with other projects that have harnessed his talents and earned critical acclaim in the process. ... Christian Bale's future success as a Hollywood draw may need Batman every bit as much as the Batman franchise needs Bale for a few more rounds. ... It goes without saying that Bale's managers, friends, and representatives are all telling him the same. And as anyone who has ever worked with Bale will admit, the actor is incredibly sharp, business savvy, and perceptive. As a result, it seems highly unlikely that Christian Bale will bolt from Batman when the bat signal is still glimmering above the Hollywood sign with such tangible fervor."" Got all that? A ""former colleague"" of Russel's told him seven months before Man of Steel even opened in theaters that Bale could probably get $50 million for appearing in a subsequent Justice League movie. Now, let's assume Russel's former colleague is a top Legendary executive and that everything he said accurately reflects the company's thinking... That still doesn't equate into what's being reported by many outlets today. There is no $50 million offer, based on a speculative conversation that took place eight months ago. The confusion isn't necessarily the fault of Russel â€” who relied on ""exclusive interviews, online research"" for his $2.99 ebook â€” but the number of outlets that hurriedly ran with the news, most likely because of their steadfast belief that this type of announcement is inevitable. Of course Warner Bros. is going to make a final push to get Bale back, goes the thinking. And $50 million seems about right (I guess?) Reportedly, director Zack Snyder wants a slightly older, wearier Batman to battle Cavill's younger Superman. That would be Bale, who's only 39, but he certainly pulled that off in The Dark Knight Rises. Warner Bros. and Bale's rep both declined to comment about the newest speculation, but that could mean anything or nothing. EW: Zack Snyder looking for an older Batman? For those who want to go down the rabbit-hole, Bale starts shooting Exodus, his Moses epic with Ridley Scott, this fall, but he's not yet officially booked for anything in early 2014, when Batman vs. Superman is tentatively scheduled to shoot. So he's potentially available. Bale also wouldn't be the first actor to feign disinterest in order to secure a better payday. He's either completely content with walking away from the franchise, or he's playing this non-negotiation negotiation perfectly. Or both. Conceivably, he could return as Batman for one epic battle with Superman, really die the noble death he faked in Dark Knight Rises and then hand the keys of the Tumbler over to his new successor, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, for the subsequent Justice League movie â€” STOP!!! See, I understand why we care and why we were so willing to believe the $50 million offer report. But the fact is, Warner Bros. is still looking for its Batman, and last we heard from Bale on the matter, he said, ""I enjoy looking forward to what somebody else will come up with."" Admittedly, that was in July, but that was also seven months after the sketchy conversation that launched the $50 million rumor. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- ""We're ready to take control"" confirms Bob Fraser, a well-seasoned pilot who has been flying for 37 years. ""And proceed,"" replies flight test engineer Duncan Casey. Fraser and Casey are looking at computer display screens, tracking the position of a modified BAE Jetstream 31 aircraft flying north towards Scotland -- but there is one vital difference. Casey is high in the sky while Fraser has his feet firmly on the ground. Casey is one of the flight test engineers onboard the test aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art drone technology along with the two pilots in the cockpit for the take-off and landing phases. After taking-off and climbing to an altitude of 7,000 feet, the pilots hand over to the flight test engineers who in turn hand over to Fraser. Fraser is responsible for navigating the aircraft on a pre-planned route. Calmly in front of his computer, he taps in coordinates to make the plane turn left and right, clearing it with air traffic control as any other pilot onboard would do. ""Flying an unmanned vehicle is not as much fun as flying a normal aircraft, however it has a lot of similar challenges,"" explained Fraser from the comfort of his armchair cockpit. See also: The rise of zombie airports . BAE Systems granted CNN exclusive access to one of their test flights in early July, allowing passengers aboard for the first time in the process. At the time of filming, the plane had already racked up 480 flight hours using specialist drone technology developed over the past six years as part of the $94 million ASTRAEA program. The project has brought together a consortium of six companies, BAE Systems, QinetiQ, Thales, Rolls Royce, Cobham and AOS. With increased automation in the cockpit, hopes are high that planes like those controlled by Fraser can fly further and longer. For those at the cutting edge of the industry, this is an exciting milestone. ""It's probably the next major step in aviation, it's a bit like introducing the jet engine,"" said ASTRAEA program director, Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal. ""It's a new branch of aviation all together."" ""(Next) we've got to find ways of introducing technology to replace the man on the aircraft and indeed amending the regulations. All the (current) regulations assume a pilot to be onboard the aircraft and that's the way it's been for the past 100 years or so."" BAE Systems and partners need to prove to regulators that it is possible for unmanned aircraft to fly safely in commercial airspace. ""As industry, we'd like a full set of regulations to build something to. The regulators would like us to show them a product. The problem is, because there is a big gap between our understanding of manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft, we somehow have got to work together to bridge that gap and that's what the ASTRAEA programme is all about,"" says Dopping-Hepenstal. However unmanned passenger flights are unlikely to be taking-off in the near future at least. Instead, Dopping-Hepenstal believes the technology could first be adopted for cargo flights and for aircraft operating during hazardous emergencies such as wildfires. These developments could then be fed back into military design and used to make commercial aircraft safer. See also: How to travel using apps not maps . The technology tested by BAE Systems could also be transferred to other industries outside aviation. ""We are only limited by the power of our imagination with this technology and capability,"" said Ruth Mallors, Director of the Aerospace Knowledge Transfer Network (AKTN). ""What is important (is) that drones are not just airborne, they are water and land based too .... the Mars Rover is an autonomous vehicle in many aspects. ""There are many capabilities that are crying out for this technology -- agriculture, surveillance, inspection regimes -- but the breakthroughs will be where we discover applications of the technology not yet thought through."" For seasoned pilots such as Fraser, however, the potential of this technology is about far more than the prospect of a profitable new industry. "" I think there will be a number of people for instance who can't fly (now) -- they're airsick or wheelchair-bound -- they're not capable of being in the air. For them this will be an exciting future.""","CNN goes aboard a modified BAE Jetstream 31 test aircraft as it flies above northern England .

"(CNN) -- Hawaii health officials are asking stores to pull a fat-burning supplement from shelves after officials linked it to cases of liver failure and acute hepatitis in 29 people. Two people have undergone liver transplants and one person has died, according to the Hawaii State Department of Health. Twenty-four of the people who fell ill reported using OxyElite Pro before being diagnosed; the patients had no other medication or supplement in common. While the investigation is ongoing, health officials advised people to ""discontinue use of the product at this time."" Hawaii investigators are working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Anyone who develops symptoms such as abdominal pain or discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and/or vomiting, and yellow skin or eyes should consult their doctor immediately,"" Health Director Loretta Fuddy said in a statement. OxyElite Pro is sold nationwide. Because it is a dietary supplement, it did not have to be approved by the FDA before going to market. USPlabs, the company that produces OxyElite Pro, said it stands by the safety of all its products, but ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the company is stopping domestic distribution of OxyElite Pro with the purple top and OxyElite Pro Super Thermo Powder. ""The company continues to believe these versions are safe and are not the cause of the cluster of liver toxicity that has occurred in Hawaii,"" USPlabs said in a statement. USPlabs informed the FDA that counterfeit versions of OxyElite Pro have been circulating in the United States, according to an advisory issued by the FDA. The agency is investigating whether counterfeit products are linked to any of the hepatitis cases. USPlabs once also produced a product called OxyElite Pro with DMAA, but that has not been manufactured or distributed since earlier this year, the company said. In April, the FDA said it was using ""all available tools at its disposal"" to eliminate supplements containing the stimulant dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, from the market. The agency said DMAA can cause increased blood pressure, shortness of breath, chest tightening, cardiovascular problems and even heart attacks. FDA spokeswoman Tamara Ward told CNN at the time that 11 companies had received warning letters from the FDA over the past year asking them to stop marketing products that contain DMAA. All but one -- USPlabs -- agreed to stop using DMAA in supplements.","Hawaii health officials link OxyElite Pro to 29 cases of liver failure and acute hepatitis .

"(CNN) -- Jamie Ordonez is one of the lucky retail employees who will enjoy Thanksgiving Day without having to rush to work. But a brother-in-law who works at Medieval Times isn't as lucky. The Lyndhurst, New Jersey, castle is open for a 5 p.m. show on Thanksgiving Day, which means Ordonez's family is eating dinner around noon to accommodate his schedule. And, it's not the only Thanksgiving Day joust on the calendar; shows are scheduled in all nine Medieval Times castles in North America, with most offering discounted tickets. ""He enjoys his job, and he knows working nights and weekends and some holidays is a part of it,"" said Ordonez, a 30-year-old resident of Belleville, New Jersey. ""But it affects his family, too, and it's not fair to us, either."" It's the same sentiment behind a handful of petitions, Facebook groups and social media gripes about people being called in to work on Thanksgiving -- not only in retail but in the service industry and entertainment. Ordonez created a petition on Change.org asking Medieval Times to cancel its Thanksgiving and Christmas shows so employees can spend the holidays with their families. ""Your employees, from servers, to performers and management, come together five days a week as a team to bring a great show to your patrons. Do you not feel that your hard working employees deserve these holidays to spend with their families?"" she said in the petition, which has earned nearly 2,500 signatures since launching in late October. Medieval Times did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The petition is one of several on Change.org this year challenging what's known as the ""Black Friday creep"" into one of the busiest shopping days of the year. While most of the petitions target retailers, Ordonez's petition highlights the plight of nonretail workers who also work on Thanksgiving. Other petitions target malls and shopping centers on behalf of retail employees as well as maintenance and security workers who also have to report to work on holidays. It's no surprise why businesses keep opening early. The National Retail Foundation expects shoppers to spend $602.1 billion in November and December, a 3.9% increase from last year's holiday shopping season. But, just as the creep gets earlier each year, with Kmart announcing plans to open its doors at 6 a.m. and others opening later in the day, consumers began rallying earlier this year. You've probably seen the evidence on Facebook, with friends pledging to ""Say No To Shopping on Thanksgiving"" through badges on their walls and in profile pictures starting in October. The eponymous Facebook group responsible for the badges launched in mid-October, earning more than 40,000 likes in less than a month. Shoppers pledge to boycott Black Friday Thursday . Their motivations tend to intersect around fighting ""corporate greed"" and ""reclaiming Thanksgiving"" for families. Posts on the page refer back to the ""good old days"" when stores were closed on Thanksgiving and holiday shopping sales didn't start until after Thanksgiving. It's a cause that Jim Sullivan of Watertown, Massachusetts, feels passionately about even though his shopping options are limited thanks to Massachusetts blue laws that restrict business openings on holidays. What bugs him are the Christmas decorations and holiday sales that start well before Thanksgiving has even begun. ""Retailers are doing an end run around Thanksgiving, extending Christmas back because that's the mercantile holiday,"" said Sullivan, a fan of the Say No To Shopping on Thanksgiving Facebook page. ""They've found out that you really can't sell much through Thanksgiving itself. The most you can sell is the bird."" Sullivan says he is doing what little he can by pledging not to shop on Thanksgiving and encouraging others to do the same through his own Facebook group, Thanksgiving Comes First, which has more than 1,110 followers. The goal isn't to ""bring big corporations to their knees,"" he said wryly, but to postpone holiday shopping until after Thanksgiving. ""I'm not looking to do anything serious or harmful to the American economy, I'm just looking to scale it back,"" he said. Ordonez is also realistic about her goals. The Medieval Times shows will go on this Thanksgiving, and a show is still scheduled for Christmas Day, which has become the new focus of her efforts. ""It's not retail, it's not an essential business,"" she said. ""Why can't they have one day off?""","Sentiment grows online against working on Thanksgiving .

"(CNN) -- Brazil might be the biggest country most of the world doesn't know a whole heckuva a lot about. This is beginning to change as financial fortunes for some have soared in recent years, helping lift some 50% of the country into the middle class. Of this figure, 40 million were added to the middle class between 2004 and 2010, under the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But success hasn't come without problems. The mass June demonstrations over chronic economic disparity and dissatisfaction with the federal government united poor and middle classes alike, exposing a troubling social reality. Still, if there's one thing Brazil is known for worldwide it's a gregarious and energetic population. World's coolest nationalities: Where do Brazilians rank? Now that Brazil will be hosting the World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2016 (massive public expenditures that many here deeply oppose), it's time for a crash course in all things Brazilian. There are no introverts in Brazil . Or at least none you can find without a private detective. It's a vivacious culture that can bring you out of your shell, help you unwind and have the best time of your life. It can also jack up the decibel count. Brazilians like to express themselves and don't have many restraints on the volume with which they do it. That goes not just for conversation, but car horns, TV pitchmen and sound trucks blasting advertisements through the neighborhood from 16 speakers. English isn't spoken widely . As Portuguese speakers on a Spanish continent far from the English-speaking world, Brazilians have been a linguistic universe unto themselves. Not many Brazilians speak English, particularly outside Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo. They've seen all the American movies and know all the Adele songs, but the premium has traditionally been on getting a good education in Portuguese, still difficult in a land where education is far down the list of priorities. Brazilians are hospitable, though, and most will figure out a way to communicate. It's helpful to come prepared with a good phrasebook. Key phrases to master: Todo bom? (How are you? All good?), Eu nao entendo (I don't understand) and futebol (you'd better know this by now). If all else fails, go with the all-purpose Brazilian sign that everything is cool: stick both thumbs in the air and pump them up and down. Ahead of the Brazil World Cup, free English classes planned for prostitutes . The juice bars are amazing . Maybe because they're surrounded by so many varieties of exotic fruits the rest of us have never heard of -- caju, camu-camu, pitanga -- Brazilians are experts in the creation of especially tasty fruit drinks, or sucos. Just about every other street in Rio has a juice bar. Even delicatessens whip up outstanding juices and smoothies, such as graviola, which comes from the spiky, green graviola fruit. It's a great thirst quencher on a hot day, subtle, not overly sweet, a kind of natural Squirt -- it's also a good digestive aid. The Brazilian banana is the tastiest in the world, far superior to the bland Central American version (say Brazilians), and it makes for super savory drinks. Brazil is an outdoor world . From the sidewalk cafes of Rio, to backyard barbecues, to beaches up and down the long coast, to the wild interior, Brazil is a place to be outside. Brazilians revel in an outdoor culture, as befits a tropical land, and they have world-class natural environments to play in. Beaches, jungles, waterfalls -- it's here, often on an epic scale. One of the largest wetlands in the world, the Pantanal, spans 70,000 square miles in southwestern Brazil. It's home to a thousand species of birds and 300 different mammals, from the South American tapir to jaguar. For scale, it's hard to match the immensity of the Amazon rainforest, the largest in the world, or the power of Iguazu Falls, which is the second widest and in volume in the world. Brazil's Northeast Coast: The next tropical paradise . There's an enormous gap between rich and poor . In world rankings for the gap between rich and poor, Brazil has the 11th biggest gulf, coming in after a group of impoverished African countries. Even though living standards have risen over the last decade and a number of Brazilians have entered the middle class, there's still a huge chunk of the population living day to day. Some 6% of Brazilians live in the favelas (slums), according to the 2010 census. These mountains of bricks, rising in intricate forms, border the country's largest cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Hospitals, schools, security and an end to police abuse have been the principle demands of recent protestors from this social sector. Combine this with drug problems and crime syndicates infamous in the favelas, and you have a massive crime problem. Tourists aren't usually the targets, but it's smart to do what you would in any place where safety is a concern. Stay in a safe area, don't carry more money on you than you can afford to lose, keep your valuables in the hotel safe, use taxis vetted by your hotel, don't take van taxis and make sure you know what part of town you're in at night. One of its biggest cities is in the middle of the Amazon . The seventh largest city in Brazil sits halfway up the Amazon River, where the Rio Negro intersects the great river. An obscure outpost home to rubber barons in the 19th century, today it's an industrial titan of 2 million residents that produces goods from mobile phones to motorcycles to CDs. Why make products as far away from the point of sale as you can get in Brazil? Tax incentives. The Free Economic Zone of Manaus was created to spur economic growth in the isolated Amazon region. It's cheaper to make some products in the Amazon than other parts of the country, where taxes are legendary. Today, the city of Manaus has gleaming office buildings and modern factories and is growing faster than many other parts of the country. The docks of the Rio Negro still show vestiges of an older way of life -- double-decker ferryboats that carry people and products up and down the two behemoth rivers. Parties are important . Brazilians produce two of the biggest bashes the world has known in Carnival and the New Year's Reveillon celebration. But the festivities continue throughout the year, thanks to an abundance of regional celebrations, cities that promote the arts and a stockpile of religious holidays. In Rio de Janeiro, the city puts on free music fests, with top bands performing on stages across the city, while in Recife, at the city's outdoor concert stage across the street from the beach, free concerts range from rock to forro to an event featuring every drummer with a drum kit in the city, more than 100 of them playing in unison. The Northeast of Brazil has a lot of festivals. The Bumba Meu Boi festivals in Sao Luis, in the northeast state of Maranhao in July mix the folkloric traditions of Africa, indigenous Indian and Europe together into a party unlike any other in Brazil. It's Carnival time in Rio . Rhythm is king . The Brazilian knack for improvising on any musical theme makes this country unrivaled in the quantity and quality of different musical rhythms and styles. The outside world knows bossa nova, a slowed-down samba mixed with American jazz and French impressionism; and samba, a blend of African drum circles and European marches. But Brazil dances to the beat of many different drummers, reflecting its diverse population. The top Afro-Brazilian styles range from afoxe, ceremonial soundtrack for the religious processions of candomble, to lundu, maracatu, axe, ijexa, and frevo, the latter of which comes with a feverishly playful dance. Keeping track of all the different beats has made Brazilian percussion the most sophisticated in the world, with a slew of drum instruments found nowhere else, such as the comical cuica, which sounds like a dog in heat. The Northeast of Brazil has its own country-style beats -- embolada, baio, xote and forro, which is also a hugely popular dance in Brazil. The rural folk music of the south gave rise to musica sertaneja, a romantic ballad style that is the most popular music in the country today. Kissing strangers is customary . Getting to know people in Brazil is a fast-track process. Since they don't place much stock in personal space, Brazilians have an easier time of breaking through the emotional space, too. It's customary for a male introduced to an adult female to provide a kiss on both cheeks -- and on leaving, too. A day heavy in meet-and-greets can lead to a lot of cheek nuzzling, which for some makes Brazil a wonderful thing and for others a place of more colds and flus. Body language is as important as Portuguese here. Guys aren't afraid to put an arm around another male to emphasize a point. Placing a hand on a shoulder or providing a robust bear hug and a salvo of air kisses is part of an intricate social dance that results in a welcoming vibe for travelers. Piranha won't eat you if you fall in an Amazon river . It's burned indelibly into every movie fan's mind -- the fiendish feeding frenzy of piranha stripping a human down to dental work. It turns out these pint-sized demons aren't nearly the sociopaths they're cracked up to be. Piranha live in the major river basins of South America, and the Amazon tributaries of Brazil are well-stocked with them. They do have nasty choppers that bite Brazilians swimming in rivers, but they don't strip them to the bone. Some trace the origin of that legend to a visit by early 20th-century President Teddy Roosevelt. Locals blocked off a river and filled it with starving piranha, and then tossed in a cow to guarantee a good show for the President. It set off the famous piranha swarm, embellished later by newsreel and movie makers.

"(CNN) -- The best photographs work on multiple levels, capturing what's happening on the surface while transcending two-dimensions to invite viewers to dig into whatever's pictured. That's literally the idea behind Nick Veasey's x-ray photographs. He uses five x-ray machines to take probing photos that provide an intimate, even eerie look into everything from robots to firearms. ""Sometimes I think about [the process] as a metaphor for life,"" he says. ""You are often attracted to people by their physical appearance, but you fall in love with them because of who they are. It's what's on the inside that counts. Same thing here."" 13 of the year's best infographics . The English photographer makes most of his photos in an 800-square-foot studio with concrete walls 30 inches thick. The lead door weighs 1,250 kilos, or more than 2,700 pounds. The heavy fortification is necessary because Veasey is constantly bombarding his subjects with radiation. He says the machines he has emit a type of radiation that doesn't contaminate the object after it's been x-rayed. His studio isn't large enough to photograph an airplane, obviously. Anything that won't fit inside is disassembled and photographed in pieces; Veasey then combines all those images into a composite using Photoshop. How a radical new teaching method could unleash a generation of geniuses . There are other tricks involved. Instead of shooting the entire fuselage of the Boeing 777 — which is 242 feet long and has a wingspan of almost 200 feet — Veasey shot one curved section and duplicated it in Photoshop. And he shot just three rows of seats because compressing dozens of rows would have made the photo too crowded. ""I try to be as accurate as possible, but I'm also working within certain constraints,"" he says. Twitter founder reveals secret formula for getting rich online . Even with these tricks, Veasey says he shot more than 1,000 pictures of the airliner to create the final image. If one of the pieces of the plane was too big for the 14 x 17-inch X-ray film he uses, he had to combine multiple exposures. The skeletons featured in some photos were captured in one of two ways. For some of the photos, Veasey used a cadaver, preserved in a pressurized suit, borrowed from a nearby college. Others relied upon skeletal models radiology technicians use to train on. The best map ever made of America's racial segregation . Veasey is working on several new projects at the moment. One is about famous guns like the M16 and Walther PPK. Another project looks at robots. He chose robots because they're getting more sophisticated by the day and he wants to look inside to see what makes them tick. A third, and larger project, focuses on classic cars, including the Ford Model T, the Mercedes-Benz 300SL ""Gullwing"" and the iconic Mini. To get around the problem of disassembling the cars — something the owners almost certainly would frown upon — Veasey has tracked down an X-ray machine in Germany big enough to shoot them intact. Apple's fingerprint ID may mean you can't 'take the Fifth' He chose older cars because he's a classic car fan. But he also favors classic cars because modern vehicles are packed to the gills with technology with would muck up his shot — air bags, electronics, etc. Classic cars are simpler, more elegant and would make for far more interesting photos. ""All these cars are beautiful things in the flesh, but I also want to celebrate the engineering that went into making them,"" he says. Veasey is currently looking for classic car owners who would like their cars photographed. To contact him, please send an email to nick@nickveasey.com.

"(CNN) -- If Paul Revere had owned a pair of sneakers, he undoubtedly would have laced up and gone on a midnight run instead of a midnight ride through the streets of Boston. Boston is sneaker city, especially this year, on the heels of the Boston Marathon bombing anniversary. Everybody is a runner -- in reality or in spirit. Turn a corner in this handsome, historic town, and you'll stumble upon at least one -- usually a pack -- of neon-garbed runners navigating their way through Boston's cobblestone streets and parks. You can improvise and create your own running route or follow one of these five running pathways -- some for nature lovers, others giving a nod to Boston's storied past. Whichever route you choose, you'll be swept up by ""Boston Strong"" -- the slogan for a proud town with running in its DNA. Boston is also a town that likes to celebrate its running, so we have suggestions later for where to hoist an after-run brew. On your mark, get set, go . The Charles River/Esplanade: This popular running route loops around the Charles River, taking in Cambridge and Boston. You'll have opportunities to cross several footbridges and other spans, including the BU Bridge, the Longfellow Bridge and the Mass Ave Bridge, depending on how far you want to run. On the Cambridge side of the river, you can dash by the Museum of Science, cross over the Longfellow Bridge and run along the Esplanade, passing the Hatch Shell where the Boston Pops perform on July 4. For a 4-mile loop, cross the Mass Ave Bridge to Cambridge, run along the Charles, cross over Longfellow Bridge, back along the Esplanade in Boston. Or, go for it, and run the entire 17-mile path all the way out to neighboring Watertown. Emerald Necklace: Frederick Law Olmsted of Central Park fame designed this gem, a lanky chain of nine green parks that stretches for more than seven miles covering 1,200 miles of parkland, including the flowery Arnold Arboretum. The Emerald Necklace begins at Boston Common in the heart of downtown, and dangles to Franklin Park (home to a zoo). Along the way, expect plenty of shade from tree-lined paths, some hilly, mostly paved. Run the whole stretch or just sections; the ""T"", Boston's subway, has stops along the way. (emeraldnecklace.org) Castle Island: This South Boston (Southie) loop has a lot going for it -- historical Fort Independence, ocean breezes and views of Boston, the Boston Harbor Islands and planes coming in for a landing at nearby Logan Airport. The run is a 3-mile loop or, for a 7-mile loop, include a run around the 'Sugar Bowl"" (manmade Pleasure Bay), which is connected to Castle Island. Chestnut Hill Reservoir: Another beauty designed by Olmsted, this 1.6-mile trail hugs the reservoir in Cleveland Circle, on the outskirts of Boston, and is a nature nut's nirvana -- serene water vistas, wildlife and inspiring sunrises and sunsets. If you're ambitious, run up nearby Heartbreak Hill, the appropriately named hill that's a game-changer for many runners in the Boston Marathon. To get here, take the ""T"" to Cleveland Circle. The Freedom Trail Run: Sightseeing with a twist, this 5K run begins at Boston Common and takes you along the famed Freedom Trail, stopping at 16 sites along the way including Paul Revere's house and the Granary Burial Ground (John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Revere and other notable Bostonians are buried here.) An easy, breezy way to get in your run -- and see the sights, too. The run ends at Charlestown Navy Yard where runners get a complimentary sports drink and board the inner harbor ferry for a ride back to Boston. (freedomtrailrun.com) A leg up on after-run refreshments . Aw, Shucks: Belly up to the oyster bar at Union Oyster House, Boston's oldest restaurant, where Paul Revere and the Founding Fathers tied one on and slurped oysters. Or, head upstairs to settle into a booth. True, this is a tourist's bucket list spot, but also a fun spot to channel history and grab a post-run beverage, oysters and a meal. (unionoysterhouse.com) Home run: One of Boston's many Irish pubs, McGreevy's is especially popular for sports fans and music lovers (it's home base for Celtic punk band, Dropkick Murphys.) Expect a fun-loving scene, with floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto Boylston Street in nice weather. If you love baseball as much as running, this bar has a huge Red Sox following -- after all, it claims to be 1,200 steps from Fenway Park and channels Red Sox history with memorabilia. (mcgreevysboston.com) Run and a pint: Another Irish pub, not far from MIT in Cambridge, Asgard is a popular runner's cool-down bar, especially after a nearby Charles River run. Sit at one of the wooden communal tables or pull up a seat on the outside patio. (classicirish.com) Jog your memory: You've exercised your body, now grab a beer and flex your mind at Mass Ave Tavern. Casual and friendly, with an entire wall of board games (Scrabble, anyone?), this downtown location is a popular spot for runner group meet-ups.

"Howrah District, India (CNN) -- Rukhsar Khatoon is too young to fully grasp the significance of her life: that she is a last in a country of 1.2 billion people. She has become the greatest symbol of India's valiant -- and successful -- effort to rid itself of a crippling and potentially deadly disease. Rukhsar, 4, is the final documented case of polio in India. Her face has appeared in newspapers and on television. She's been invited to national events by Rotary International, the organization that led the effort to rid India of polio. She is a literal poster child, an inspiration, a symbol of a feat that no doctor or health official thought possible even a few years ago. But on Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially certified India as being polio-free. Apart from the publicity, though, Rukhsar's life has hardly changed, her future still a question mark. She is used to seeing health officials and reporters arrive on foot at her home in Shahpara, a village in the Indian state of West Bengal. On the day we visited, she dressed herself in a long green printed dress, marred only by a tear at the shoulder. She oiled her hair and pulled it back with plastic barrettes. She did it all herself when she learned we were on our way. Her parents, Abdul Shah, 32, and Shobejan Begum, 30, blame themselves for their child's suffering. They had their other children vaccinated, but not Rukhsar. She was a sickly child, in and out of hospital with liver infections and diarrhea. They thought it safer not to subject her to more medication. It wasn't until little Rukhsar's right foot swelled and twisted in early 2011 that her parents took her to a hospital in nearby Beleghata for tests. She was just 18 months old when doctors confirmed the worst: Rukhsar had polio. Polio is caused by a virus that attacks the brain and spinal cord cells that move joints and muscles. About one-third of those who contract polio in India are left paralyzed -- as was Rukhsar. ""Everything was our fault,"" explains her father. ""I thought she would never walk again."" 'Hell of a big deal' When a global effort to end polio was launched in 1988, the disease crippled more than 200,000 children every year in India. Almost two decades later, in 2009, India still reported half of the world's new cases -- 741 out of 1,604. India has millions of poor and uneducated people. The population is booming. Large areas lack hygiene and good sanitation, and polio spreads through contaminated water. Many health experts predicted India would be the last country in the world to get rid of polio. They were wrong. Since Rukhsar's diagnosis three years ago, India has not seen another new case of polio. With the eradication of polio in India, WHO formally proclaimed another one of its global regions -- Southeast Asia -- free of the disease. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria are the only three countries that have not eradicated polio, leaving the Eastern Mediterranean and Africa the last two WHO regions with the disease. The last time WHO made a similar announcement was in 2002, when the European region was declared polio-free. Rotary International says the declaration is a milestone for a nation that was once the epicenter of the disease. India's journey from 200,000 to zero has not been easy, says Deepak Kapur, a businessman who heads Rotary's polio campaign in India. ""It's a tremendous achievement,"" he says. ""India is a hell of a big deal."" Kapur has been at the helm of India's campaign since 2001. When he started, he was told India was holding the world hostage, that the planet could not be polio-free until its second most populous nation had eliminated the disease. The western part of Uttar Pradesh state was the worst, Kapur says. At one time, scientists documented that the single worst pocket of polio, the city of Moradabad, had exported the virus to every continent. Now, Kapur says, the three remaining nations where polio still exists can learn from India. Three keys to success . Western nations conquered polio so long ago that its name is unknown to younger generations. America experienced the height of polio in the 1940s and '50s, when about 35,000 people became disabled every year. Fear and panic spread and parents were known to warn their children to not drink from public water fountains, avoid swimming pools and stay away from crowded public places like movie theaters. Perhaps the most famous case of polio in America was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the first president with a significant physical disability. The development of the Salk and Sabine vaccines helped lead to eradication of polio in the United States in 1979. In India, too, vaccination was critical. ""There were three keys to our success,"" Kapur says. ""Immunize, immunize and immunize."" But the challenges in India went way beyond getting 170 million children vaccinated each year and needing 2 million health workers on the case. They went beyond securing $2.3 billion in government funding. The oral vaccine must be kept cold, and many places in India do not have electricity -- and even those that do experience frequent power cuts. Each vaccine costs only 12 cents, but refrigerating them was a major problem, says Dr. Mathew Varghese, an orthopedic surgeon who runs India's last dedicated polio ward at St. Stephen's Hospital in New Delhi. India was able to come up with innovative ideas -- like refrigerators powered by kerosene -- to get vaccinations to remote villages not unlike the one where Rukhsar lives. And then there was the campaign to educate. Rumors had spread in Muslim communities about the polio vaccine. Some Muslims believed it made women infertile and that the Indian government was using it to curb a minority population. To combat such false beliefs, health workers began a dialog with clerics. They were able to build trust and persuade the clerics to put drops of the vaccine in their own grandchildren's mouths so their followers could see nothing bad would happen. For Varghese, all this means that the makeup of his polio ward has changed. The patients tend to be older now since there have been no new cases reported since 2011. Varghese has operated on thousands of twisted and mangled bodies, on patients who are forced to crawl on all fours. Polio, he says, robs a person of dignity. ""It's terrible to have a childhood ruined,"" he says, inspecting the progress of Haseen Jahan. She's lived with polio 23 of her 25 years. She used to press her hand to her thigh when she walked, to keep her left leg down. Her left foot used to point outwards. In her dreams she walked upright. In her dreams, she danced, even wore pants, something she was not able to do before because of the way her limbs were bent. Varghese straightened her leg with his orthopedic surgical skills. ""I'll be able to walk straight,"" she says, laughing, ""just like you."" Varghese moves on to the other polio patients occupying the 16 beds reserved for them at the missionary-run hospital. Some had knees that had twisted upward to their hips. Others could not even stand. When they leave here, they will embark on lives that were previously unimaginable. ""I would be happy to go out of business -- this kind of business,"" he says, though he knows he will be seeing polio patients until the day he retires. Half of India's 21 million physically disabled people are that way because of polio. Varghese has never met Rukhsar. But he is relieved to know she is the last. Poster child . In Shahpara, Rukhsar plays with her brothers and sisters and other children on the bone-dry earth, the dirt forming clouds beneath their feet. The effects of polio were not severe as they could have been, and after exhaustive therapy, Rukhsar is able to use her legs. She is not unlike the other barefoot children in this village of palms and ponds except that she has a limp. Her right leg is shorter than her left, a condition that is common with polio patients. She complains that her right foot hurts when she runs and jumps. Learning from their own mistake, Rukhsar's parents have become advocates for polio vaccinations in their part of the world. Shah is thankful his daughter was not left immobile, but still, he worries for her future. He is a poor man, and like most men and women in this village, he makes about $40 a month embroidering saris -- far less than the brocaded and beaded garments sell for. He knows he must save money for future health care needs and do all he can to make sure Rukhsar is educated. He is certain he will face obstacles in finding a groom for a daughter with a disability. America, too, had poster children for polio at a time when the country was racing to stamp out the disease. In the 1950s, two girls in matching gingham jumpers appeared in an anti-polio campaign. Pam was shown loosening her sister Patricia's leg brace. They were faces, just like Rukhsar, of a disease that now is on the brink of global eradication. There is no cure for polio, but the two American sisters were able to overcome the crippling nature of the disease. Now it's Rukhsar's turn to lead a full life. Without the interference of polio.

"(Martha Stewart Living) -- What was once considered, well, brassy, is now something to covet and keep. From small moments to large statements, today's brass is tasteful and elegantâ€”with gorgeous patina to spare. Brass is back. With the appetite for nickel and chrome at its saturation point, brass is returning to the forefront of the design world. ""People are rediscovering how beautiful it is,"" says Martha Stewart, who has amassed an impressive collection of brass treasures, particularly trays, from all over the globe. ""I am always searching for new pieces,"" she says. Martha Stewart Living: 19 tips for perfect laundry every time . But shopping for the ""mellow metal,"" as she calls it, doesn't have to feel like an exhausting treasure hunt anymore. Thanks to the renewed interest, both mainstream design shops and specialty boutiques now stock brass wares. And with good reason: The metal, an alloy of copper and zinc, is strong; it won't rust; and it can be forged into a variety of shapes. Plus, it's relatively inexpensive. ""I jokingly call it the poor man's gold,"" Stewart says. Unlike the perpetually shiny lacquered brass that was popular in the 1970s and '80s, most pieces today are left unfinished. They may require occasional polishing, but the goal is no longer that blinding glossiness. In fact, not only is brass that shows its age acceptableâ€”it's downright desirable. ""It's the patina that makes it beautiful,"" says decorating director Kevin Sharkey. Martha Stewart Living: 35 pantry staples for healthy eating . ""Brass is timeless, warm, and inviting. There's a reason people are drawn to it. Adding it to a room is like crowning the space with an amazing jewel."" How to clean brass . Don't overlook a brass find simply because it appears blackened beyond repair. ""Removing the tarnish is like discovering gold,"" says Kevin. Martha polishes her brass pieces about once a year; every three years, she has them professionally cleaned. For basic maintenance and to make unlacquered brass shine without stripping away the patina, Anthony Cassano of Greenwich Metal, in Stamford, Connecticut, recommends using polish-soaked cloths, such as Cape Cod metal polishing cloths. Martha Stewart Living: 21 ways to decorate your home on a budget . Stronger, more abrasive cleaners, like Brasso, are best used on heavily oxidized pieces. Test on a small area first, advises Cassano. Lacquered-brass items, meanwhile, should be cleaned with a soft cloth, mild dishwashing soap, and tepid water. Removing lacquer . Worn-away lacquer may be to blame for brass's formerly bad rap. The clear coating (made of lacquer, epoxy, or urethane) preserves a shiny finish and eliminates the need for polish, but it doesn't wear evenly, resulting in blotches of tarnished metal against the bright lacquered parts. The tarnish cannot be properly cleaned off unless you get rid of the existing lacquer. Martha Stewart Living: Curb your food cravings with yoga . To do so, Cassano recommends a paint-stripper paste like Klean-Strip. Brush it on evenly to remove all kinds of clear coating. As always, test on a small patch of your brass item before applying the paint stripper, and consult a professional before removing lacquer from any large or valuable piece. Fast-tracking patina . Left on its own without any intervention, unlacquered brass will begin to darken in about a month and will continue to take on a deeper patina with age and use, says Jamie Gregg of Colonial Bronze in Torrington, Connecticut. To accelerate this process, he recommends placing the item in hot water, which speeds up the oxidation. Martha Stewart Living: 15 kitchen shortcuts that will change the way you cook . Another trick, says Cassano, is to place an open can of traditional latex paint next to the unlacquered brass item in an enclosed area for at least 24 hours. The fumes from the paint will quicken the patination process. Where to find brass . Flea markets are a great place to nab vintage brass goods, but if you'd rather shop from the comfort of your own home, check out these websites. From hardware to furniture, eBay offers the widest on-line selection of brass items. Search terms: vintage, raw brass, unlacquered brass. Martha Stewart Living: Don't shelve these clever bookshelf decorating ideas . For even more finds, expand your search abroad: Try looking in England. And if you know French, go to eBay's French site. High-end furniture with brass accents, including midcentury-modern pieces by Edward Wormley, Dunbar, and Paul McCobb, can be found at 1stdibs. Auntie Oti is a valuable source for vintage brass bowls, tumblers, canisters, and bells from India. Storing brass . How you view aging brass depends on your taste: One person's patina is another's tarnish. Whatever your preference, you should store your treasured objects properly to prevent them from oxidizing so much that they practically become black. Cassano suggests stowing brass trays, bowls, or tumblers in flannel bags, such as those made to protect sterling silver, or wrapping them in acid-free tissue paper before sealing them in plastic bags. Avoid keeping them in high humidity, and do not use newspaper, he advises, which has acidic ink that will cause oxidation.","Brass is back, and better than it was in the 1970s and '80s .

"(RollingStone.com) -- A sad ""Game of Thrones"" spoiler alert ahead: Everyone's favorite friendly giant, Hodor, and his best buddy, Bran Stark, will not appear in the show's upcoming fifth season, according to actor Kristian Nairn. ""We're not actually in season five, by the way,"" Nairn told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""We have a season off. We have a year's hiatus ... Solely because, I imagine, our storyline is up to the end of the books."" ""Game of Thrones"" just began filming its fifth season in Europe, though Nairn â€” who is also a DJ â€” remains in Australia. He's been traveling around the country presenting his Westeros-inspired DJ tour, the aptly titled, ""Rave of Thrones."" 10 Most Dramatic 'Game of Thrones' Deaths . While his trek down under runs through September 7, Nairn hinted that he might be taking the tour elsewhere now that he's on a break from ""GoT"": ""I get a year off now to do 'Rave of Thrones' and gallivant all over the world."" So even if there's no Hodor holding up Bran on screen, there just might be a Hodor holding down the ones and twos in nightclubs across the globe. Despite the absence of Hodor and Bran in season five, ""Game of Thrones"" did add a number of new characters over the summer, including British screen vet Jonathan Pryce (""Brazil,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean""), who will play the High Sparrow, a religious leader who comes to Kings Landing to serve the city's poor.

"(CNN) -- At the end of ""22 Jump Street"" -- a sequel that made fun of the concept of sequels -- the film cheekily proposed humorous possibilities for yet another follow-up. Looks like it may happen, whether that was the idea or not. A source at Sony with knowledge of productions confirms to CNN that ""23 Jump Street"" is in the works and that Rodney Rothman is writing the script. Deadline.com first reported the news. Rothman was one of the writers of ""22 Jump Street."" Deadline also reports that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who directed ""22,"" are overseeing the process but haven't decided whether they'll return to direct. Neal Moritz and stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are also producing. Despite ""22 Jump Street's"" puckishness, Sony must have loved the idea of another film as soon as it saw the box office. ""22 Jump Street"" has made $191 million domestically and another $129 million overseas, a particularly good return given the $50 million budget. It's also well in front of the first film's take. ""21 Jump Street"" made about $200 million worldwide. The first film starred Hill and Tatum as cops who went undercover at a high school; the second placed them at a college. No word on where ""23 Jump Street"" will take place, but if ""22 Jump Street's"" closing credits are any indication, they have plenty of choices.

"(CNN) -- In 1834, Illinois voted whether to adopt Christmas as a legal holiday. Among those voting ""nay"" was the young Abraham Lincoln. In 1834, Lincoln had not yet grown out of his atheist phase, but the young Lincoln's lack of faith in God -- and his lifelong disbelief in the divinity of Christ -- does not explain his vote. In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote. Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834. Lincoln marked his first Christmas as President, in December 1861, by holding a Cabinet meeting in the morning and a dinner party in the evening. The Lincoln family never had a White House tree and sent no Christmas cards. Nobody was much shocked by these omissions. The public Christmas as Americans know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century. George Washington issued a proclamation on Thanksgiving, but he never made any statement about Christmas (or Easter for that matter). The first state to recognize Christmas as a holiday was Alabama, in 1836, but the North and especially New England resisted. Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday. The federal government took until 1870 to follow. There's debate on the point, but it seems that Benjamin Harrison was the first president to allow a Christmas tree inside the White House in 1889. The tradition of lighting a tree on the White House grounds commenced with Calvin Coolidge in 1923. Dwight Eisenhower sent the first White House Christmas cards. Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly ""seasonal."" It waited until John F. Kennedy in 1963 to send a card that depicted a nativity scene. This late flowering of Christmas observance reflects two facts about Christmas that seldom get much attention in our public debates about the ""war on Christmas."" In its first century, the national government practiced a separation of church and state far sharper than anything Americans would accept today. One example: From its founding in 1775, the federal post office delivered mail on Sundays. As evangelical forms of Christianity spread after 1800, the new denominations demanded an end to this desecration of the Sabbath. Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations. In response, Congress voted in 1810 to require all postmasters to work at least one hour on Sunday, on pain of losing their positions. The Americans of the founding generations insisted upon separation of church and state not because they were irreligious, but precisely because so many of them were so very intensely religious. Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences. Calvinists and Baptists, Methodists and Catholics, the grandest Boston rector and the rawest frontier preacher disagreed, sometimes to the point of outright violence. Anti-Catholic riots ripped apart Boston, Philadelphia and Bath, Maine, between the 1830s and 1850s. These contending denominations could, however, agree at least that they did not want a remote government in Washington favoring some religious practices over others. Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath. Better to issue no religious proclamations than let presidents pick and choose which holy days to mark and how to mark them. A second fact also explains the coolness of the early national government to Christianity: the keen awareness of many 19th century Christians of the non-Christian origins of many Christmas traditions. Christmas is celebrated near the date of the old Roman holiday of Saturnalia. Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition. The Christmas tree, the hanging of wreaths and house-to-house caroling hark back to the pre-Christian German holiday of Yule. Calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on Christmas observance on the late 17th century. But many Protestant denominations retained a lingering suspicion of the holiday until deep into the 19th century. Two changes made possible the coalescing of an official Christmas holiday over the 40 years from Calvin Coolidge's outdoor Christmas tree to John F. Kennedy's sacral Christmas card: The fading of distinctions between Christians and the decline of theology within Christianity. The once all-crucial distinctions between Calvinists and Arminians (whose beliefs came from Dutch reformist Jacobus Arminius) and between even Protestants and Catholics have blurred. The once-vivid mistrust of trees and tinsel and burning logs has vanished, as American Christianity evolved away from a creed in which people believed and into a set of practices that people did. If Christians decorate trees, then tree decorating must be Christian -- no matter how or why the custom started and what the custom meant to the people who started it. Devout Christian believers can still be counted in the millions of course. Surrounding them, however, is a larger and more nebulous group for whom what was once a faith has become a folkway. For them, a Christmas tree or a nativity scene is less a declaration of individual belief than it is an expression of group identity. Many Americans feel this group identity to be under threat by changes in recent years. When they champion ""Christmas as it was,"" they do not mean ""Christmas as it was for George Washington or Abraham Lincoln"" and much less ""Christmas as it was for Martin Luther or Jonathan Edwards."" They mean, ""Christmas as it was when I was young."" That is why we have eruptions such as last week's flap over the whiteness of Santa Claus. If your Christmas celebrates the appearance of God Himself in the form of a human baby, it won't have a lot of room for a gift-giving elf and flying reindeer. But if Santa is at most tangential to the Christmas of faith, he is utterly central to the Christmas of folkway. It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about ""the war on Christmas."" The Christmas of Santa and Rudolph, and trees and stockings, and candy canes and ""Merry Christmas"" greetings began to be most publicly celebrated in the United States only after -- and only because -- the religious impetus for the holiday had already dwindled away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Lincoln, like many in 1834, didn't observe Christmas as an official holiday .
He says in late 19th century, Americans began to observe Christmas as a public holiday .
Early Americans kept a sharp separation of church and state, Frum says .

"(CNN) -- Ray Rice was an idol for many a football fan, old and young. But in my town of New Rochelle, New York, he wasn't merely a Pro Bowl running back who ran on average more than 1,000 yards for six seasons. No, Ray Rice was a hometown hero. The city of New Rochelle held an annual Ray Rice Day, where he returned to the local high school (his high school) and taught hundreds of kids the basics of football. He was revered at city hall. The Boys and Girls Club made him the honored guest at the annual fundraiser. I attended that event, and fell in love with him. He wasn't merely a football star—he was a normal guy who refused to forget his roots and gave back to the community. He truly inspired kids to work hard and stay in school. At one of the charity events, I bought my children a Ravens helmet with Rice's signature in gold pen. My kids loved it. They took turns visiting with the helmet, and keeping it in their rooms. I felt great supporting a charity and bringing Ray Rice closer into our lives. This week, the full video of Ray Rice slugging his fiancée (now wife) in an elevator, and then dragging her unconscious body out and leaving it on the floor, became public. Suddenly I feel duped, dirty by association. I want that helmet exorcised from my house. But I can't just do that. I helped build Ray Rice into the good guy/role model to my kids and now I have to explain to them why I am not proud of him. Heroes have fallen before Ray Rice. Lance Armstrong. Mark McGwire. Pete Rose. Tiger Woods. Michael Vick. All once adored, all with glory stripped when the public learned of their transgressions. With Ray Rice, though, it feels different. We have never before had a video of a hero's horrendous behavior available in such graphic, undeniable detail. With almost every middle- and high-schooler having a cell phone, the Ray Rice video went viral before the kids came home on the school bus. How does an 11-year-old interpret this: a big, strong football player knocking out his girlfriend, then barely lifting a finger to help her? How can a 16-year-old high school running back reconcile the unheroic man in the video with the guy on the poster on his bedroom wall? This very complicated, very uncomfortable story offers parents an opportunity worth taking. Who wants to sit down at dinner to discuss domestic violence? You should. Parents must have this conversation. It's important. Here are five points to touch on, for starters: . • Call it what it is. Your kids should know the video depicts domestic violence. Many kids won't know what this means. Explain that it is when people in an intimate relationship become physically violent or emotionally cruel to their partner. There are any number of potential reasons: Ray Rice and Janay Palmer appeared to be involved in a heated argument; maybe he has a short fuse; maybe it was some other reason altogether. None of this matters. There is nothing a person can say or do that would make it OK to hit that person. Hitting a spouse, a partner, is unacceptable; it's never justified. It's assault and is against the law. • Why would Ray Rice become violent with his girlfriend? The answer is: We really don't know. Domestic violence is a learned behavior. It isn't due to genetics, addiction or mental illness (This is why this conversation is so important). A person's willingness to act on the urge to abuse a loved one may have roots in his family life growing up, his observation of the way intimate relationships among relatives, friends and others in the community are conducted, behaviors he's observed in the media, and personal experience, especially if that included praise for aggression. • Why did she marry him after he abused her? Every case is different, but there are a few reasons that crop up repeatedly in research on domestic violence. Men who batter are often—and this is hard to comprehend—very charming. After an incident of abuse, they are often contrite, apologetic and overtly loving, vowing never to repeat the behavior. However, abuse is cyclical. Statistics show that most likely, without extensive treatment, an abuser will do it again. And time and time again, the victim will forgive the abuser. But as time passes the abuse will become more violent and more frequent. • Is he a bad guy? Ray Rice did a very bad thing. Not because it was caught on tape but because he hit her, and no one has any right to hit another person. It is never a solution in a conflict. People are not necessarily good or bad. They are complex. Ray Rice has shown that he needs help. With counseling and perhaps other treatment-- and the desire to change--many abusers can become good partners. But it takes work and commitment. Time will tell. • Will he go to jail? Ray Rice will probably not go to jail. He was given the opportunity to go to a program to help people on their first offense. If he isn't caught again, he will stay out of jail. Parents should end the conversation by explaining some of the signs that a person is experiencing domestic violence or in a potentially dangerous relationship. Tell them that if your partner isolates you, repeatedly puts you down, tries to control what you do and who you are with, or if you are sometimes afraid of getting hurt, it's very important to share this with a parent, counselor or friend. Ray Rice video prompts stories of #WhyIStayed, #WhyILeft . Domestic violence happens in all communities, in every religion and in every socioeconomic group. It can happen in married relationships, unmarried relationships, among the elderly, and in teen romances, too. Make sure your children know, by watching you, what a loving relationship looks like. Lastly, continue the conversation long after Ray Rice has faded from the spotlight. When your children start thinking about dating, make sure to continue to let them know what a loving relationship is, what you expect from them, and what they should expect from a partner.","Catherine Pearlman: Ray Rice was hometown hero in her town of New Rochelle .

"(CNN) -- In the one-sided battle between pedestrians and the automobile, the first shot was fired in London in 1896 when 44-year-old Bridget Driscoll became what is believed to be the first pedestrian victim of a petrol-driven car. Struck down by an automobile doing just 4mph during a demonstration at Crystal Palace, the grim sequence of events was so unfamiliar that one witness riding in the car told the inquest she felt a ""peculiar sensation"" as the car swerved to avoid Mrs Driscoll. At the time, the coroner at the inquest expressed the hope that an incident of this type ""would never happen again."" Fast forward 118 years and more than 270,000 pedestrians are killed on the world's roads every year. Striking a balance between the rights of the pedestrian and the car driver was once the preserve of the traffic cop -- a human being that could judge traffic flows, calibrate changes and react to circumstances as they occur. But as traffic volumes increased and the task became automated with traffic lights, the frustrations all too familiar to pedestrians -- lights that seem never to show the ""green man"" -- are now tolerated as a normal part of urban life. London, however, is set to trial a new system that aims to use the latest technology to regain the fluid responses of the traffic cop. Called Pedestrian SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimization Technique), it is the first of its kind in the world and uses state-of-the-art video cameras to detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings. When the cameras count a critical mass of pedestrians, the technology transmits data that keeps the ""walk"" sign lit for longer to allow more people to cross the road. Similarly, when fewer people are waiting to cross the road, the traffic is given a longer set of green lights. The SCOOT system already regulates London's traffic flows and has been credited with cutting delays by 12% in the capital. It is in use at 3,000 junctions in the British capital, with a further 1,500 earmarked for SCOOT upgrades by 2018. The Pedestrian SCOOT system, however, would be the first time the technology has been used as pedestrian pinch points in the capital. ""Our SCOOT system has been used around the world for many years use to optimize and coordinate the traffic signal junctions and we've done that currently and historically for vehicles,"" explained Mark Cracknell, team leader of the Technology Delivery Group at Transport for London. ""We have inductive loops in the road that detect vehicles, do clever analysis of the traffic patterns and then coordinate the junctions to try to make the progress through the city as smooth as possible."" Currently pedestrians at many crossings in London get a standard six seconds to get onto the road -- known as the ""green man"" time -- before countdown technology takes over telling pedestrians how long they have left to get across the street. What SCOOT technology aims to do is dynamically change that ""green man"" time. ""If there's only a few people waiting we'll just go for the standard six seconds to cross, but if we've got 100 people waiting to cross we can increment that up to the appropriate time. ""What we're avoiding is the scenario where we don't have enough time to get everybody on the crossing and then pedestrians have to wait for another cycle of the traffic signals to get across."" Cracknell said the system would have the most value where the pedestrian traffic is variable, for instance outside a school or a tube station. ""During the day there might be a low flow and you don't want to be fixed with a high crossing time when there's no one there,"" he said. ""There are technologies out there that can detect whether a pedestrian is waiting, but the technology we use actually quantifies and counts the number of people. ""We're not aware that this is in use anywhere else in the world."" At the heart of the technology is a stereoscopic camera that allows the sensors to detect and count crowds of people in three dimensions. ""They're vision-based systems, the idea being traditional vision systems just have a single camera and there are a number of inherent flaws with that -- things like shadows, puddles and changing light conditions can cause problems. ""The stereoscopic camera allows us to get a sense of depth -- discount the puddles and the shadows -- and just get a picture of the people standing there."" Despite this it's not all one-way traffic. Pedestrians that press the button on a set of lights and then change their minds and walk away are another challenge to the free flow of traffic. Transport for London is trialing new technology that would detect when a pedestrian has changed their mind and strolled off or crossed the road before the ""green man"" signal. ""This is what we call 'call cancel' technology and we're trialing it at different locations in London -- it's the combination of both SCOOT and 'call cancel' which we are looking at,"" said Cracknell. Ultimately, however, developing technology that brings back the function of the human traffic cop is the Holy Grail for Transport for London. ""We're trying to be more intelligent with what we're doing. Rather than just tweaking the splits of the vehicles, we will be catering for everybody,"" Cracknell said.

"Shenzhen, China (CNN) -- In a brightly-lit Shenzhen restaurant, 21-year-old Zheng Liqiang, a migrant worker from the inland province of Sichuan, describes his life in this southern Chinese city as ""bu kai xin"" -- glum. He says his working hours are too long; his salary too low and he has no personal life. ""I feel lonely in this big city,"" he says. For the past three years, Zheng has been fixing photocopy machines at various factories in China's manufacturing heartland. His monthly salary of 3,500 to 4,500 yuan ($580 -$740) -- depending on overtime -- is higher than the average wage, but only because his job requires more risks -- the ink has toxic fumes. Yet, he worries about losing a job he loathes. In fact, he says he feels constantly anxious -- a state of mind made clear by a habit of cracking his knuckles and jiggling his leg as he talks. If he were able to speak to a psychologist, it's possible he would be diagnosed as suffering from anxiety disorder, a common problem among migrant workers, according to Professor Cheng Yu at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. ""Their mental health is far more worrying than we originally thought,"" he said. Emotional burden . Cheng and his colleagues interviewed 807 migrant workers in the Shenzhen area and had in-depth conversations with 60 of them. Their research suggested that 58.5% of those surveyed suffered from depression, 17% from anxiety and 4.6% had considered the idea of suicide. His team found that the majority of those surveyed, half of whom were under 30, bore a heavy financial and emotional burden as they left behind aging parents or young children. They felt guilty for being unable to care for them and, at the same time, felt pressure to provide for their families. Cheng said he first noticed this issue five years ago when he conducted research on the mental health of sex workers in the region, most of whom worked at factories before turning to prostitution. In 2010, the issue made international headlines after a spate of worker suicides at Foxconn, a large electronic manufacturer that assembles many Apple products, making the professor determined to find out the root causes of the workers' mental health problems. Loneliness and a sense of isolation were reported to be among the reasons that drove the workers to jump off factory and dormitory roofs. Though the focus of Cheng's research was in the southern province of Guangdong, the mental health of migrants is likely to be similar elsewhere in the country. Some 260 million Chinese farmers have left their villages and to work in cities, according to the China Labour Bulletin. Despite their contribution to China's economic miracle, the social status of these migrant workers remains low. It's not a phenomenon unique to China. Throughout the world, research suggests that migrant workers are more likely to experience mental illness than those who stay behind as they adjust to a new environment without their families and social support groups. In China's case, the hukou system -- or household registration system that divides the population into two distinct categories of the urban and the rural -- makes things harder for the migrants, who don't enjoy the same access to healthcare and education as other city residents. They are often discriminated against in terms of salary and treatment. Better-educated and internet savvy, younger migrants like Zheng suffer more from this urban-rural divide than their elders. Zheng's parents left home with one goal in mind: making money in the city and then returning home. 'Toad who eats swan meat?' Zheng, however, aspires to become a true urbanite and wants to be an interior designer. He tries to study the subject on his own but struggles to find time to do so. His parents -- who work in Shenzhen as a small time trader and a domestic helper - laugh at his efforts, calling him ""a toad who dreams of eating swan meat."" ""The glaring gap between what they desire and the harsh reality intensifies the anxiety and depression for some young workers,"" said Cheng. Many workers' lives are confined to production lines and dormitories. They may change jobs -- indeed they change more frequently than their parents did -- but their chances of climbing up to the next level to become, say, a designer, are limited. Having grown up with his grandparents in his hometown in Sichuan, Zheng doesn't have much to say to his parents. He is aware that he should consider himself lucky to have his family around, but he nevertheless feels lonely in Shenzhen. He has only a few friends here, all young migrants from Sichuan. Constrained by time, money and changing shifts, they are unable to meet often. One day, he hopes to settle in Chengdu, the capital of his province where he spent two happy years studying at a technology college. The government recently announced plans to relax the control over hukou system in a bid to narrow the gap between rural and urban areas and to help migrants assimilate better into the city life. But the process will be a long and slow one. ""We just have to pay more attention to mental diseases as they can lead to suicide,"" said Cheng. He recommends compulsory mental health testing in the workplace and a practice he calls ""positive psychological intervention"" -- setting up hotlines and counseling services and providing workers with more opportunities to socialize. It is a big question when, if at all, professor Cheng's ideas may be turned into reality. For young Zheng and millions like him, the struggle is likely to continue.","China has more than 260 million migrant workers .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, scenes of the Arab Spring broadcast across the globe showed women who appeared to be equal participants in the revolutions and their aftermath. These images of women taking such public positions -- from Tunisia to Egypt, Libya and Yemen -- took much of the world by surprise. But not Arabs. Despite the stereotype of them as an oppressed group, Arab women have a long history of participating in the region's upheavals, dating back at least to the anti-colonial movement when women emerged from the confinement of the household to take up crucial organizational positions. Today, as the world grapples with this challenging and tumultuous moment in the region, it is important to pay close attention to the voices of Arab women and their plight. But rather than confining the story of women to an issue of religion or culture, it is important that the world uses what is happening to them as a barometer of the trajectory that individual societies are on. After all, how a country or a region treats its women in many ways tells the story of the future political direction of that country. The trouble is that this trajectory is in too many cases not particularly encouraging. In the Arab Spring's aftermath, there have been plans to lower the legal marriage age, support expressed for polygamy after years of being regulated, restrictions on women's mobility and political participation, a massive increase in sexual harassment and assault on the streets with police failing to intervene, and the use of virginity tests on women arrested for participating in a demonstration, as seen in Egypt. But young women now are not willing to back away from their demands, and they are speaking out in spite of public harassment. And while many women have been beaten and imprisoned for making their voices heard, they have crossed what is often described as the line of fear. In doing so, their message to the older generation of feminists is that the rights of women must be included in the civil rights discussion of societies more broadly. The hope is that the voice of women might also have more influence on the direction of policy in the region, perhaps offering a path that encourages calm in a part of the world too often wracked by violence. Ultimately, what young women in the post-Arab Spring are saying is that they are seeking out a new form of identity, one that is inclusive of both their religious identity and their desire for civil liberties. It is with this view in mind that my partners Abby Disney, Gini Reticker and I announced our commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative 2014 to launch ""The Trials of Spring,"" a multimedia initiative that focuses on the voices of Arab women, their plight and their dreams for the future. The world can no longer treat women's issues as if they are somehow separate from everything that goes on in, and defines, a country or region. Indeed, women should be seen as the bellwether for the direction of society at large -- where women thrive, so do opportunities for all. Where women are oppressed, oppression of all dissenting voices typically goes hand in hand. Above all though, women's issues should not be discussed as if they are somehow relevant only at the margins of a society. Instead, they should be considered front and center, and an international priority. And the first step toward making them such a priority is listening to what they have to say in the first place.","Arab women have a long history of participating in the region's upheavals, Zainab Salbi says .
Situation has deteriorated for many women in Mideast since Arab Spring, she says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Time to brush off the veto stamp. For someone who's only used it twice, President Obama may need some reacquainting with the last remaining weapon in Democrats' arsenal. He last rejected a bill from Congress in 2010. But he's had blocking from a Democratic Senate majority until now. They've stood in the way of bills most Democrats would oppose. Things are likely to change in January, when Republicans take charge of the Senate. If Senate Republicans follow the path of their House counterparts, he could be faced with proposals to repeal Obamacare and budgets that cut entitlement programs - the type of bills that will meet a quick end at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Obama to voters: ""I hear you"" ""Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign. I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like. That's natural. That's how our democracy works,"" Obama said at a news conference Wednesday. So what's left for either side to achieve? Here are four things that Obama can -- and can't -- do with the new Congress: . Immigration - He can sign an executive order . Republicans and Democrats both want to reform the nation's immigration system. But that's about as far as the White House and the House GOP have gotten in hammering out an agreement that would increase border security and ease deportations. Related: 2016 starts now . The White House says the House had its chance on immigration reform when it balked on taking up a measure that passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis. Instead, Obama plans to announce an executive order that most speculate will drastically reduce the number of yearly deportations. Initially meant for the end of the summer, the announcement was pushed until after the midterms -- much to the chagrin of immigration reform supporters. Now the White House says it'll happen before the end of the year. But while the action may enrage Republicans, it can't go nearly as far as legislation would. When the next Congress begins, the Senate bill praised by the White House becomes null -- any potential new law would have to pass the Senate again. Related: Obama delays action on immigration executive action . Obama's executive order would likely forestall any hope of getting Republicans on board, though Obama reiterated Wednesday his order would be nullified if Congress takes action. ""You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away,"" was his message to GOP leaders. Based on public statements from Senate Republicans, however, the chances of a bill after Obama's executive action are small, meaning any legislative fix to immigration would come in the next Congress -- after Obama leaves office. Climate change - He can add to limits on carbon emissions . If Obama wasn't getting anywhere with the last Congress on stemming carbon emissions -- and he wasn't -- he certainly won't gain any traction with the new one led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, who defeated his opponent partly by framing her as an ally in Obama's ""war on coal."" The president has already put forth executive actions curbing emissions from coal plants and putting new limits on emissions, which angered Republicans who claimed it amounted to executive overreach. The White House says more unilateral moves to combat climate change are on the docket ahead of an international climate change conference in Paris next year. Related: Obama says climate change deniers are ""serious threat"" But like immigration, any major new laws designed to curb emissions would meet a quick end in the Republican controlled Senate. And with Republicans -- some of whom deny that man-made climate change even exists -- chairing key committees with oversight over Obama's Environmental Protection Agency, the prospects for lasting change appear to have dimmed. Closing Gitmo - His options are more limited . The chances of shuttering the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba through legislative action haven't changed -- they were slim before Tuesday and they're slim now. Republicans and Democrats alike on Capitol Hill are wary of signing off on a law that would permit Obama to transfer detainees from the facility to the United States. While other countries have agreed to accept certain prisoners, others are deemed too dangerous to release. The administration wants to find places in the U.S. to house them so the reviled Guantanamo Bay prison can be closed. Without Congress' approval, Obama would have to use his own executive authority to push through a change, a move that would undoubtedly prompt cries of overreach by lawmakers. But it would fulfill a promise that extends back to his first campaign for president. Economy - He needs help from Congress . It's two areas of economic policy -- trade and tax reform -- the White House believes could present the most potential for cooperation with a Republican Senate. But even there chances of new deals appear slim. Two major trade deals, with Europe and about a dozen Asian countries, have been stalled while Senate Democrats refuse to offer so-called ""fast track"" authority to Obama to get the pacts hammered out. They're worried the trade measures could ship jobs overseas. Republicans, however, have been more amenable to the plans as potentially a boon to U.S. business. Whether they and Obama can agree on the final plans depends largely on the two sides' willingness to work together. Likewise, tax reform is an issue both sides at least agree needs to be addressed. Obama and Republicans want to lower corporate rates and simplify the code. At one point, the White House and House Republicans were casting the issue as the key area of agreement should Congress fall into Republican hands. But some key players are no longer around: Rep. Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and someone who was open to a tax deal with Obama, is retiring at the end of this Congress. That leaves open whether or not there's still an opening to find a deal. If there is, it would form a major part of Obama's legacy. On Wednesday, Obama insisted the agenda he's set for himself was still operative. ""The one thing that I'm confident about is that I'm going to be pretty busy over the next few years,"" he said.","Republicans will take over control of the Senate in January .
President Obama will lose the Democratic majority that has spared him the need to veto ."
"Philadelphia (CNN) -- After a campaign season marked mainly by Democrats fleeing his shadow, President Barack Obama embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign Sunday, hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular. Obama headlined afternoon campaign rallies for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one Senate candidate and a handful of governors. His diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining high-dollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods, mostly on the coasts, where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in Tuesday's midterm elections. In tight races across the country, Democrats have distanced themselves from his policies, declaring themselves independent from the White House as Republicans worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold. The President himself has fueled that effort at times, saying during an economic address in October that his ""policies are on the ballot"" and telling Al Sharpton during a radio interview that vulnerable Democrats are ""all folks that vote with me."" Obama, whose presidential campaign drew massive crowds of young people and African-Americans in 2008 and 2012, has been working to propel those voters to the polls. Democrats have little chance of keeping control of the Senate unless traditional Democratic voting blocs turn out in force. That was Obama's goal Sunday in Philadelphia, where he revved up a majority black crowd at a rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf. ""We've got some work to do. Because two days from now, you get to choose your future,"" he said, reminding the 5,500 attendees that the historic battle for the right to vote must be honored by casting ballots in midterm elections. Obama reiterated that theme in Connecticut earlier Sunday at a rally for Gov. Dannel Malloy. ""Your vote matters,"" he told the 1,900 supporters who came to see him speak in Bridgeport. ""Don't let people tell you it doesn't."" The crowd in Connecticut was largely enthusiastic about hearing from the President, but his speech was interrupted multiple times by protesters for immigration reform who carried signs with messages such as ""DREAMers demand bold, broad, inclusive relief."" Each time protesters interrupted Obama, they were shouted down by the crowd. On at least one occasion, members of the crowd ripped the signs away from a group of protesters, who were ultimately escorted out by security. The campaign effort over the weekend amounted to Obama's biggest push for Democrats this cycle. His reduced role is the outcome of record low approval ratings and policies unpopular in many parts of the country. The restricted campaign role isn't necessarily where Obama wanted to be during the final congressional contests of his presidency, though past second-term presidents have similarly dragged down their party's candidates. ""I'm not on the ballot this time, and this is the last election cycle in which I'm involved as President,"" he said in Maine on Thursday. ""It makes you a little wistful, because I do like campaigning. It's fun."" He was originally scheduled to campaign in Connecticut last month, but canceled shortly beforehand for meetings on his administration's Ebola response. The president's rescheduled appearance comes at a potentially critical point for Malloy. The one-term governor is polling neck-and-neck in his re-election battle against Republican nominee Tom Foley, a former U.S. ambassador to Ireland who lost to Malloy by only 6,400 votes in 2010. A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday had the two men at 43% each among likely voters. A third candidate, Joseph Visconti, is polling third with 7% in the same survey, with 6% undecided. Despite these poll numbers, Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman Ian Sams said Sunday he believes a heavy emphasis on voter turnout will bring Malloy a win on Tuesday. ""I think with President Obama coming here today, we're going to see a lot of interest from base Democratic voters,"" Sims told CNN. ""If they come out to vote, turn out in full force, Gov. Malloy's confident he's going to win this campaign."" Connecticut is a reliably blue state, but not totally averse to GOP governors -- Malloy himself succeeded two Republicans when he took office. In Pennsylvania, Wolf has led the GOP incumbent Tom Corbett for most of the race, and while polls have narrowed recently, he still maintains an edge.","NEW: President Obama heckled by immigration protesters in Connecticut .

"Washington (CNN) -- One of the first things President Obama did after Republicans seized control of the Senate was to announce his intention to seek new Congressional authority for military action against ISIS in Syria and Iraq to replace those passed more than a decade ago to wage the war on terror. The President said he would begin consultation with lawmakers on an Authorization of the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, while Democrats still control the Senate. But he added, ""it may carry over into the next Congress."" The new found enthusiasm for engaging Congress could be viewed as either olive branch to the incoming Republican Senate to answer accusations he doesn't consult enough, or a belief Republicans will be more forward-leaning on granting authority that has made some members of his own party nervous. But it precludes what is sure to be a bolder role for Republicans in U.S. foreign policy. Here are some of the things to watch as Republicans take over the Senate majority in January: . THE PLAYERS - The three Senate committees with oversight over foreign policy will now be chaired by Republicans. DEFENSE -- John McCain ascends . Sen. John McCain is widely expected to head the Armed Service Committee. He has long sat on the committee and also been its ranking member, but this will be his first time being in charge of it. As one of the staunchest critics of President Obama's Syria strategy, the gavel gives McCain a greater platform to push for more aggressive military action against but ISIS and President Bashar al-Assad. McCain would also play a key role in writing the defense authorization bill, which sets policies on everything from defense spending to weapons systems to military base closers. Although the appropriations committees control the purse strings, McCain would have a larger say in how the Pentagon spends its money. The Navy veteran has blasted the Pentagon about what he considers expensive, outdated and ineffective weapons systems, and is expected to be outspoken on reforming Pentagon spending, he has pressed to replace defense budget cuts under sequestration. Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said despite McCain's criticism on the administration's handling of foreign policy issues, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel enjoys a ""strong and productive"" relationship with McCain. That relationship would exist despite the public ringer McCain put Hagel through during his 2013 confirmation hearings. Despite his reputation for blunt talk McCain is also known for reaching across the aisle and officials believe restoring the failed 2008 Republican presidential nominee to a position of power could see a return to the statesman-like McCain of years past. FOREIGN RELATIONS -- Corker is a deal maker . Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee is likely to replace New Jersey Democratic senator Robert Menendez, who wasn't seen as particularly friendly chair to the Obama administration. Corker has criticized Obama for being an ""unreliable ally"" and blasted the president for withdrawing his request to launch military strikes last year. Corker also wants the administration to get tougher on Russian President Putin. Despite his conservative credentials, Corker is known for his willingness to work with Democrats on issues foreign and domestic and has a good relationship with Menendez, the current chair. During an editorial board with his hometown newspaper the Tennessean, Corker laid out a thoughtful argument for broad US engagement in the world and suggesting he would support an increase to the US foreign aid budget. INTELLIGENCE -- A fresh start with Burr . Sources say Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina will likely take the gavel from Diane Feinstein, who has had a rocky relationship with CIA Director John Brennan. Their disagreement is over the agency's meddling into a Senate investigation into Bush-era interrogation techniques and a long-awaited report on the issue. The administration could actually find a friendlier chair in Burr on the interrogations report, as well as on surveillance programs and the use of drones. He also expected to be less forceful on pushing for reform of NSA data collection called for in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations. Burr will also likely dive into the threat posed by ISIS, including improving weak intelligence on the number of foreign fighters who may have U.S. passports. SYRIA and IRAQ -- A debate on the use of force . Republicans supported President Obama's decision to order airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria this summer. And incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he is open to a Senate floor debate on a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). Discussion is likely to intensify over what the GOP considers a tentative and ineffective campaign against the terrorist group. Republicans charge that President Obama, by not acting sooner, contributed to ISIS growth. They have argued that defeating the group now will require more boots and Special Forces on the ground, increased airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and a no-fly zone and buffer zone in Syria. Republicans also want to more forcefully confront Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. There is also sure to be scrutiny of the administration's plan train moderate rebels. The White House has asked Congress to train 5,000 voted Syrian rebel troops to take on ISIS, and the current authorization for that program expires at the end of the year. Incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday the Republicans want to revisit the discussion with the president on his strategy. That strategy could include cooperation with Iran, which would create a new sideline debate on Captiol Hill. President Obama wrote a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader pointing out the two countries both oppose ISIS. But the ongoing and troubled nuclear talks between Iran and the West stand in the way. IRAN'S NUKES -- Opposition to Obama's strategy . The deadline for an agreement between Western nations and Iran to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for easing some sanctions is weeks away. It's resolution is far from certain. President Obama said Wednesday world powers presented a ""framework"" to Iran for a deal. Senate Republicans are opposed to any agreement allows Iran to continue enriching any uranium and could now pass anti-Iran legislation which would effectively derail a diplomatic solution. If a deal is reached the White House could choose to bypass Congress entirely. President Obama has the authority to suspend U.S. sanctions without congressional approval, a move which could force Republicans to more forcefully confront Iran. Republican senators Corker, John McCain, and Marco Rubio have already proposed legislation that would compel President Obama to submit any deal with Iran to a full up-or-down vote, and Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina said he would not ""tolerate"" a deal with Iran without such a measure. President Obama demurred when asked on Wednesday, saying if there was a deal on the table he would engage Congress. ""I think that we'll be able to make a strong argument to Congress that this is the best way for us to avoid a nuclear Iran."" Democrats could also make things difficult for Obama on Iran. Proposed legislation enacting even stricter sanctions against Iran is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. The Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013 would expand the number of blacklisted sectors of Iran's economy, expand the number of senior officials in Iran and penalize foreign institutions that do business with Iran's blacklisted entities. The White House fears such legislation would push Iran away from the negotiating table, alienate it's international partners and effectively kill the and deny President Obama what he had hoped could be one of the most important foreign policy achievements of his presidency. RUSSIA and UKRAINE -- More help for Ukraine? There may be little practical effect of a new Republican Senate on policy toward Russia. President Obama has already taking a tough line against President Putin over his actions in Ukraine. Republicans, particularly McCain, paint Putin as a dangerous enemy who must be contained and are likely to push against any future engagement with Russia and a return to a Cold War Stance. Republicans could also increase pressure on the White House to provide arms to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression and increase support for Georgia and other emerging democracies in Eastern Europe. GUANTANAMO -- More difficult to close . President Obama campaigned in 2008 on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, calling it a stain on America's reputation around the world. Those hopes are now all but gone. Congressional restrictions prohibit the administration from spending any Pentagon money for transferring detainees for imprisonment or trail has tied the president's hands. Republicans are the most passionate opponents of closing Gitmo and are likely to continue to thwart the closure of the facility, pressing the administration to try alleged terrorists before military tribunals. TRADE -- Possible new partners . For the White House, this could be a potential silver lining of a Republican-controlled Senate. Two key trade deals are being negotiated. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is an expansive free trade agreement between Asian and North and South America. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a broad free-trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. Republicans could make those negotiations smoother by giving the president ""fast track"" negotiation authority, eliminating the need for amendments Democrats are seeking on behalf of labor. While Republicans may be reluctant to hand President Obama what would be considered major accomplishments, both trade agreements could result in greater U.S. economic growth and jobs which are Republican priorities.","Obama has signaled interest in engaging Congress on the use of military force abroad .

"Washington (CNN) -- The parents of slain American journalist James Foley said Friday the U.S. and other governments will eventually have to negotiate with the Islamist group that beheaded their son in August. ""Eventually I think we're going to have to negotiate,"" John Foley said in an interview on French radio. ""This situation is not going to be solved by military intervention and money alone. So at some point in time, people are going to have to talk."" Foley's mother Diane agreed that ""we need to talk with them"" and that ISIS needs ""to be understood by our world."" She said in the interview with Europe 1 that the U.S. should ""reevaluate the policies about negotiation with terrorists"" and Foley's father conceded that while a ransom may not have saved his son's life, ""it wouldn't cost anything to negotiate."" Foley's mother said Friday she believed the U.S. government tried ""very hard"" to try and free her son, but in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper last month, the bereaved mother said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by how the U.S. government handled her son's abduction. ""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance,"" she said in September. Foley's parents have since established a foundation, the James W. Foley Legacy Fund, which aims to support families of U.S. hostages, conflict reporting organizations and educational groups and institutions. Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case . And the parents were adamant in their belief that journalists should continue to cover conflict around the world to reveal atrocities. ""If we allow the terrorists to prevent journalists from going into these areas then atrocities continue and the world is unaware, we look the other way and evil continues,"" John Foley said in the interview.

"(CNN) -- KYRA PHILLIPS: The president said Ebola is a national security priority. How are you responding to that? GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, it is a national security priority. I'd be happy to explain why. But let me speak to how we're responding to it. We're responding to -- I actually held a roundtable months ago because I -- a very bright staff officer on the Joints staff came to me and said this is different. This outbreak is different. It's different because it's urbanized, it's different because it's a third strain of the disease. It's different before of the fragility of the infrastructure, of the governments in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. And so we brought in a panel of experts and we started talking about how this could evolve. And we did some parallel planning. That's what we do, right, we plan. So AFRICOM, General Dave Rodriguez began planning for what we could do to empower and enable civil authority. You know, this is not a mil -- it's not a military threat. But the military has some pretty unique capabilities to deal with all kinds of issues. We can provide command and control, that is to say, a central location with communications and computers and bandwidth that can help people see the situation. So command and control. Secondly is logistics. We've got the finest logistics infrastructure in the world. So we've got a command and control headquarters in Monrovia. We've got an -- an intermediate logistics staging base in -- in Dakar, Senegal. We're building a training center in Monrovia. Now, you might say, why are you building a training center? That's another thing we do very well, we run good boot camps. So we're going to run a boot camp for health care workers coming from all over the world, using the Medicine Sans Frontieres program of instruction, to give those health care workers confidence that they know what they're up against and how to follow the proper medical protocols when they're in the hot zone. We actually are not going to play soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen in contact with patients, but we're putting an architecture around them that will allow the health care workers to do what they've got to do. Related: Get up to speed on the Ebola outbreak . PHILLIPS: So how are you going to protect the U.S. military troops that are there and prevent them from bringing this home? DEMPSEY: Yes, that's a great question. And we're going to -- first of all, we're not going to wait until they're there. So we also know how to train. And so we've got a -- we've got a system of training events prior to deployment, during deployment and during deployment, we tier them in terms of the -- the risk that they may be in contact with somebody with Ebola. So the logistician sitting in Senegal is highly unlikely to be in contact with anyone from -- from Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia. So they're in a lower risk category. And we manage them differently. Those in a high risk category, we manage them better. when they get ready to come back, there will be a period of observation before they come back. And then when they come back, there will be a 20 wait -- a 21 day period of observation when they're back here. Now, here's what sets us apart. Most everybody else self-monitors, right? There's nothing self-monitor about the way the military treats our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, coast guards. We'll be -- we have a chain of command. There are some staff sergeants, some 32-year-old mean as a snake staff sergeant who every day is going to look his soldiers -- I'll use soldiers, but it's the other services, too -- in the eye and make sure that they're not in any way exhibiting symptoms related to Ebola. And so we will use the chain of command to monitor, supervise monitoring from the time they leave until the time they come back and beyond when they come back to make sure we're giving our -- our -- our young men and women the best possible chance to protect themselves and also avoid the -- to avoid but not eliminate entirely the possibility that they would bring something back. Related: U.S. troops assisting in Ebola response may be quarantined . PHILLIPS: Big picture, I'm just going to throw it out there. DEMPSEY: Yes? PHILLIPS: With this Ebola situation and -- and all the major gaps in the system that we've seen, even the CDC director said that the agency should have taken control of that Dallas hospital, what does that tell you about the US' -- the US' capability to respond to a bioterror attack? DEMPSEY: Well, we -- this won't surprise you, that we, through NORTHCOM, Northern Command, we have a command in the continental United States, it sits in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Its mission is to support the home -- well, it has a defensive mission to the homeland related to long-range aviation, to missiles and rockets and -- but it also has a very important mission to provide direct support to civil authority. And we have a contingency plan for managing pandemics, that is, things that would begin to exceed the capability of a particular community or a state even to deal with it. And we update it periodically. And this is one of those cases where we're -- we're dusting it off. We're very closely in contact with all -- National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Agency for International Development for the stuff going on overseas. We are in the planning business and we're deeply into it with regard to this. But it's very much a mission assigned to civil authority. PHILLIPS: So what do you say to all the Americans that are looking at this Ebola situation and are in absolute panic? DEMPSEY: Well, I say a couple of things. One, the -- Ebola is a, to use a sports metaphor, this needs to be an away game. And that's why the United States military is involved. We want to keep this -- we want to help international health organizations, service organizations and non-governmental organizations. We want to help them keep this in isolation inside of those three countries. But there is a risk that if we -- if we, collectively, the international community, failed to keep it isolated, that -- that it could become actually -- you've heard all the experts. I don't need to compete with them for, you know, to sound like I slept at a Holiday Inn Express last night. But I have studied this thing. And there is a risk that it -- that the -- the rate of reproduction, the -- the ability of one patient to affect first two and then four and then eight and then it becomes exponential. so we've -- we've really got to be aggressive about the isolation and treatment matters that we're taking up. Inside the homeland, again, we're in support of those. But I can promise you that the United States military will do its part, with civil authorities, to keep this thing from coming to our homeland. And then inside of the United States, we've got to count on the civil organizations that are responsible for health care. PHILLIPS: Are you, General Dempsey, worried about Ebola here in the U.S.? DEMPSEY: I've been worried about Ebola globally for about 90 days. And I have had some on my staff that were probably a little more worried than I was even a few weeks or months before that. PHILLIPS: Why? DEMPSEY: I'm worried about it because it -- because we know so little about it. You know, you'll hear different people describe whether it could become airborne. I mean if you bring two, you know, two, uh, doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room, one will say, no, there's no way it will ever become airborne, but it could mutate so it would be harder to discover. It actually disguises itself in the body, which is what makes it so dangerous and has that incubation period of about 21 days. Another doctor will say, well, if it continues to mutate at the rate it's mutating and if we go from 20,000 infected to 100,000, the population might allow it the opportunity to mutate and become airborne. And then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem. I don't know who's right. I don't want to take chance, so I'm taking it very seriously.","The Pentagon is updating it's plan for an emergency pandemic .

"(CNN) -- CBS began to introduce the next host of the ""Late Show,"" Stephen Colbert, by having current host David Letterman interview him and take a selfie together on Tuesday night. Letterman called Colbert ""always entertaining,"" ""the new kid"" and ""my friend."" What Letterman was saying, implicitly, was that he supported CBS's pick for his successor. CBS announced that it had signed Colbert to a multiyear deal back on April 10, one week after Letterman revealed that he intends to retire in 2015. The unspecified timing of the transition came up during the chat between the two comedians. When Letterman asked about family matters, Colbert, who has three kids, said, ""They're getting ready for me to hang around too much."" He pointed out that he'll be signing off his Comedy Central show ""The Colbert Report"" at the end of the year, ""and then there's -- I don't know -- when are you leaving? I should have asked!,"" Colbert said as Letterman laughed. ""I should have asked."" ""The thing is,"" Colbert said, getting back to his family, ""they get nervous, they get nervous. I think they like me, but they get nervous when I'm around too much."" Colbert appeared as himself, not as his ""Colbert Report"" character. Tuesday's ""Late Show"" visit is likely to be the first of many media appearances that introduce the ""real Colbert"" to viewers. Colbert also styled himself differently than he usually does on the ""Colbert Report,"" further distinguishing between that show and his next late-night act. Instead of glasses with invisible frames, he wore hipster frames, for instance. ""You look good,"" Letterman said as Colbert came on stage. ""You look right at home."" Colbert showered praise on Letterman, and remarked at one point, ""I'm gonna do whatever you have done."" When Letterman responded with mock disapproval, he added, ""It seems to have gone pretty well, Dave!"" ""It's, it's gone ON,"" Letterman said. During the two-segment interview, Colbert talked about how he applied to be an intern on the ""Late Show"" in 1986 and submitted a writing sample for a job in 1997. ""I was unemployed at a professional level,"" Colbert quipped. By the time he heard back from the ""Late Show,"" though, the show that became ""Strangers With Candy"" -- which Colbert co-created and starred in -- was in the works. True to ""Late Show"" form, Colbert read what he said was his actual writing sample from 1997: a ""Top Ten List"" titled ""Top Ten Cocktails for Santa,"" with inventions like ""Mama Said Nog You Out,"" ""Scrooge Driver"" and ""Jack Frost.""

"(CNN) -- News that U.S. President Barack Obama is planning to attend next week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing has been extremely welcome. China is thrilled to have President Obama as one of our guests, especially as the success of any initiatives that emerge from APEC rest squarely on cooperation between China and the United States. Such cooperation is as important as ever, and this meeting -- an event I have been involved in for many years -- offers an opening to ending confusion among neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region while setting the stage for vigorous economic cooperation and integration in the coming decades. The reality is that without strong participation by China and the United States, APEC would not have made such remarkable progress. When China and the United States find ways to work together, all nations benefit. But shared economic growth cannot come through the decisions or actions of a single country. Instead, economic integration should be seen as a vital driving force for economic growth and prosperity in the region. For example, there have been at least 70,000 jobs created in the United States as a result of Chinese investment, according to the Rhodium Group, a New York-based economic analysis think tank. These ventures have been characterized by shared goals and a spirit of trust and cooperation. Meanwhile, the realization of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, which was first initiated by the United States at APEC in 2006, has grown ripe with economic potential. How? The FTAAP would open a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region. No existing mechanism incorporates both the United States and China, the two largest economies in the world, into a free trade agreement framework, something that would be remedied by the FTAAP. If we put FTAAP into action, the income gains for the United States could approach $202 billion by 2025, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Such enormous economic activity across the Pacific would in turn translate into more jobs for Americans, among other benefits. Another key factor if we want to boost economic growth across the region is infrastructure. Right now, there is a huge gap between how things stand and the growing demand for greater connectivity and infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region. This shortfall is acting as a bottleneck for further development of the regional economy, a fact underscored by the Asian Development Bank, which estimates the region needs $8 trillion for infrastructure development between 2010 and 2020. To help eliminate this bottleneck, China has proposed the establishment of a new, internationally funded and managed bank -- the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Such a body would offer efficient financing for badly needed transportation, telecommunications and energy projects across the region, and it could be a strong, complementary source of financing development to institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. We therefore hope this idea will secure the necessary support as the United States and other nations recognize the need to fund such critical projects. Finally, innovation is vital if we are to boost the overall prospects for the region, and the United States and China have a unique opportunity to find ways to combine their expertise and experience to find innovative ways of enhancing our economies, as well as those of our friends in the region. Chinese tech company Alibaba offers an example of what such teamwork can look like in practice. In September, Alibaba's initial public offering listing on the New York Stock Exchange was priced at $68 per share, raising $21.8 billion for the company and investors and making it the largest U.S. IPO in history, with Yahoo the largest U.S. investor. In this case, China provided an innovative business model in Alibaba, and the U.S. provided a financing platform -- a clear example of the benefits for both nations of working together, and something we need to do more of. When I started working closely with APEC, I could not have imagined that it would develop into such a leading forum for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Fast forward more than 20 years, and it is now clear the group is ready to shape and inspire future partnerships for all of us.","Chinese ambassador to U.S.: China is thrilled President Obama will be attending APEC .

"(CNN) -- The mystery of Kim Jong Un's whereabouts deepened Friday after the North Korean leader appeared to have missed a ceremony to pay tribute to his late father and grandfather on what is an important national anniversary. Kim's name was absent from the list of attendees at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang on the 69th anniversary of the Workers' Party of North Korea, issued by state news agency KCNA on Friday. The Workers' Party, founded in 1945, is North Korea's political party and is considered one of the country's most crucial institutions alongside the military. According to KCNA, flowers were presented at the shrine in Kim's name, but the most senior official to attend was Hwang Pyong So, North Korea's second most important leader, who recently attended the closing ceremony of the 17th Asian Games in South Korea. Kim hasn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It's his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, said NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea. Analysts are puzzled and speculation is running rampant about why Kim has been out of the public eye. State media attempted to explain his absence by saying Kim was experiencing ""discomfort."" He had been seen hobbling earlier in the summer, prompting theories ranging from weight gain to gout. There have also been questions about the possible meaning behind his absence: Is he genuinely sick, or are there machinations within the North Korean power circle? Is Kim Jong Un's sister in charge? North Korea as Rorschach test . ""Whenever someone doesn't show up in the public, we tend to speculate something of a power struggle,"" said Han Park, author of ""North Korea Demystified."" Because not much is known about North Korea's internal politics, observers scrutinize public functions and ceremonies to see who appears and who does not. ""We're always operating on this incomplete info,"" said Joshua Stanton, a North Korea observer who created the website One Free Korea, which is critical of the regime. Drawing conclusions about what's happening in North Korea has been likened to a Rorschach test -- it's a reflection of the views of whoever is drawing the conclusions, rather than an informed analysis based on facts. And the facts in the reclusive country are murky at best. ""People have a tendency to see the things they want to see,"" Stanton said. ""We should default to skepticism."" Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge . South Korean official: Kim probably near hospital . South Korea's defense minister told reporters in Seoul on Friday that he ""has reason to believe that Kim Jong Un is probably staying in one of his homes"" near an exclusive hospital in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, with his wife and sister. The facility named by the official, Bongwha hospital, is known to be an exclusive facility catering to high-ranking members of North Korea's ruling party. It wasn't immediately clear why the defense minister said he thought Kim was staying near the hospital. U.S. officials downplay Kim's absence . Senior officials in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration said Friday they believe there's no indication that Kim has been sidelined or is in very bad health. While they acknowledge there is little information available, the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kim is believed to have non-life-threatening medical problems, citing the limping seen this summer. ""He is overweight, smokes and drinks heavily and doesn't do any exercise,"" one senior U.S. official said. ""He can't be in good shape, but there is no indication of serious trouble in terms of health or stability."" With Kim out of sight, North Korean top brass visit South . The sources downplayed Kim's absence at Friday's tribute and said there was nothing to substantiate speculation that other members of the regime had marginalized him. ""We don't believe fundamentally there is anything afoot,"" a second senior U.S. official said. ""There is nothing affecting our policy choices in any way."" The officials noted that previous North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il disappeared for long stretches of time, only to re-emerge and cast aside rumors about their leadership. ""It's a dictatorship,"" the second U.S. official said ""But it gets them attention and makes the ultimate big reveal that much more newsworthy."" North Korea's diplomacy efforts . With its top leader missing in action, North Korea has extended its diplomatic efforts with the outside world. One of its officials said the regime was ready to restart the six-party nuclear talks, which include Russia, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. It has also reached out to the European Union and South Korea. High-ranking Pyongyang officials visited South Korea on Saturday, but just days later, the two countries were exchanging fire at a disputed maritime demarcation line. North and South Korea exchange fire . The mixed messages reflect Pyongyang's ""state of constant and ever-shifting cost-benefit calculation to maximize its national self interests,"" said Jasper Kim, founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group. ""Every move North Korea makes is a negotiation attempt to see which states will accede and offer something of value in exchange for some level of stability. This has and always will be North Korea's dominant negotiation strategy."" Longest absence . Kim made only one official appearance in September. This has happened only once before, in September 2010, and that was the month in which Kim made his first official public appearance alongside his father at Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, NK News said. Before this absence, his longest disappearance from public view as Supreme Leader was a 24-day period between June 7 and July 1, 2012. His second longest absence ever was for 29 days between July 28 and August 27, 2011 -- while his father was still alive, NK News said. Kim's sole public appearance in September was at a Moranbong Band concert at Pyongyang's Mansudae Art Theatre, reported by state media on September 4. He was accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, his sister Kim Yo Jong and several top officials including Hwang Pyong So. CNN's Elise Labott, Paula Hancocks, KJ Kwon, Michael Martinez, Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell and journalist Jung-eun Kim contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. officials downplay Kim's absence at Friday tribute .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to facial hair, there are few more passionate advocates than Phil Olsen. As the ""founder and self-appointed captain"" of Beard Team USA, he was responsible for bringing the sport of competitive bearding to the United States in 2003. Since then, things have, well, grown. ""It really is quite amazing,"" Olsen said from his home in California. ""Interest in bearding worldwide has taken off. ""You see more and more facial hair everywhere you look, and every time, it feels like a little victory for me. Men are finally liberating themselves."" The weird world of 'competitive bearding' Olsen is one of the ""bearders"" behind the World Beard and Mustache Championships, which took place in Portland, Oregon, this weekend. Hundreds competed in categories including ""full beard natural,"" ""full beard styled mustache,"" ""imperial"" and ""freestyle."" World's most frustrating objects . ""Men are competitive. It's in our very nature,"" Olsen said this month. ""So why shouldn't we compete over our beards? It is our uniquely masculine quality, the one thing we can do that most women can't."" The scale of this event is emblematic of the huge resurgence in beard cultivation over recent years. For Olsen -- who himself sports a 12-inch sculpted Wookiee of a thing -- this burgeoning masculine hairiness is driven by sexual politics. ""For centuries, men have been pressured by women to scrape their faces daily so that they would look more like women,"" he says. ""Finally, we have come around to realizing that we should express our masculinity in the natural way, by growing a beard."" So how does he feel about men who shave? ""I don't despise the clean-shaven,"" he said magnanimously. ""I just feel sorry for them, because they're not experiencing the majesty of realizing one's full masculine potential. ""As for the stubble people, they still have to go through the almost daily humiliation of keeping it at stubble length. But at least they've taken the first step and are not completely emasculating themselves."" The beard as social statement . This militant pogonophilia may seem rather extreme. But according to Allan Peterkin, the Toronto-based author of ""One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair,"" the beard has always been a powerful, and often controversial, social symbol. What we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors . ""It's only recently that men had a choice about their facial hair,"" he said. ""In the Victorian period, certain beards or sideburns were the badge of a gentleman or maybe a sportsman. It was a known quantity."" In earlier periods, the climate was even more severe. Alexander the Great banned the beard so that it would not be grabbed in combat; several rulers, including King Henry VIII, Elizabeth I and Peter the Great, enforced a ""beard tax,"" making it a rigid indicator of affluence and social status (in early 18th-century Russia, bearded men had to carry a ""beard token"" to prove they had paid up). ""Traditionally, men have taken their grooming cues from authority figures, such as the king, politicians or clergymen,"" Peterkin said. ""We were told by authority figures what it is to be a man, what that should look like. ""There were lots of arbitrary declarations about facial hair, saying it is sinful, or virtuous or whatever. ""It was always for reasons of control. Men wore their allegiance, and an indication of their class, on their faces."" In many parts of the world, this is still the case. The beard is of vital importance in most Islamic societies, for example, and in Turkey, the size and twirl of a mustache shows one's political affiliations. How facial hair can be used to rebel . For these reasons, facial hair, or the lack of it, can traditionally also signify subversion. The whiskys selling for six figures . ""Oscar Wilde was clean-shaven when all his contemporaries had a big Victorian beard,"" Peterkin said. ""Just by doing the opposite, you make a statement. These days, having a beard is a bit rebellious because it departs from convention."" In the postwar period, the military requirement to shave denoted respectability. Then came the Beatniks and the Hippies and the Freddy Mercury mustache of the '70s, followed by '80s designer stubble and the '90s grunge-style goatee. ""Then all hell broke loose,"" Peterkin said. ""In this postmodern period, anything goes, from trim professional beards to hipster madness. ""Men in the West are freer to do whatever they want and keep their jobs, which was just not the case for our fathers and grandfathers. We can express ourselves in all kinds of ways and grow our facial hair in more ways than ever before."" These days, many men grow a beard to reflect transition in their lives, such as a change of career or divorce. Al Gore, for instance, grew a beard after he lost the presidential election in 2000. By doing this he was changing his public face, demonstrating that he was becoming an academic where beards are welcome. How does a beard change how you are perceived? But despite the increasingly hirsute-tolerant atmosphere, studies have demonstrated that having a beard dramatically alters how you are perceived -- and not necessarily for the better. It has been argued that a bearded man appears more confident of his strength (since a ""grabbable"" beard is a disadvantage in a fight) and immune system (PDF) (since a beard can encourage parasites, bed bugs and sand fleas). He is also perceived to have a higher social status. A number of studies, however, have suggested that a beard makes a man appear more masculine and aggressive; older; and, generally speaking, less attractive to women. ""Wearing a beard is a bold statement, even today,"" Peterkin said. ""That's why it evokes so much emotion. And it is why you so rarely see a politician or a banker with a beard. They can't afford to alienate a sizable portion of the population."" The strange world of toilet architecture . Olsen strenuously disagrees. ""I'm a lawyer,"" he said, ""and I've never had a negative comment about my beard, not from any client, judge or opposing counsel. ""It has not been a hindrance but an asset at work. It's a distinction, something that helps people remember me. ""It demonstrates someone who is willing to be an individual, to stick his neck out, to take a risk, to be bold. In many professions, that should increase one's esteem within the community."" Have we reached 'peak beard'? Where now for the beard? Peterkin believes that the nature of fashion is such that every peak will be followed by a trough, and we shall soon see a decline in the level of enthusiasm for facial hair. Olsen, however, thinks the revolution is only beginning. ""People need to realize that not all beards are created equal,"" he said. ""There is a beard to suit every face. They can be groomed, they can be cleaned, and they can be tamed. ""As soon as people start to realize that having a beard isn't the same as not brushing your teeth or taking a shower and that there's something for everybody, the sky's the limit. ""Men need to break free. I would like to see the beard championships grow and eventually become on a par with the Olympics.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering how to best regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products. While some regulation is needed, the current proposal entails a huge paperwork burden that will create a barrier to entry into the market for all but the biggest players -- namely, Big Tobacco. Specifically, the FDA has indicated that it may require e-cigarette manufacturers to complete a long paperwork process before it will consider a product for approval. Many industry watchers believe that only very large manufacturers (i.e., Big Tobacco companies) would have the financial resources to meet the requirements, which could demand an estimated 5,000 hours per application, with every product combination requiring a new application. According to the Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association, only 25 products among thousands currently available would eventually be licensed. The tobacco industry will then be able to buy the small e-cigarette makers that are unable to meet the FDA's requirements. Big Tobacco will then get to decide which products are sold such that it can manage its own transition from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, or end e-cigarettes as a product category entirely, whichever better serves its financial interests. In other words, the tobacco industry will be given a monopoly over the first new product to come to market that genuinely stands a chance of disrupting the business of selling smoked tobacco. Needless to say, the tobacco industry's primary concern is not the health interests of the public. The World Health Organization has assessed that ""effective tobacco control and the commercial success of the tobacco industry are fundamentally incompatible ... accordingly, the tobacco industry can be expected to seek to avoid, prevent, weaken and delay effective policies and programs, which are against its interests."" Electronic cigarettes, also known as vapor products, are designed to mimic the experience of smoking. By heating up liquid nicotine in battery-powered devices, vapors -- rather than tobacco smoke -- are released. While it's too early to predict the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, some experts say they are a safer alternative to regular cigarettes, which produce myriad toxic chemicals. For many smokers who have trouble quitting, e-cigarettes are a viable substitute. The e-cigarette industry is young, thriving and innovative. There are hundreds of online suppliers, many of which have been pioneers in developing next-generation vapor products known as ""mods"" or ""vaporizers."" Unlike traditional retail outlets -- such as gas stations, large grocery store chains and pharmacies -- where point-of-sale data is collected and monitored by financial analysts, growing sales at vape stores and online websites are not being tracked. Dedicated vape stores have sprung up nationally. The numbers have grown from around 10,000 one year ago to about 16,000 today, according to Ron Tully of Smoke Free Alternatives Trade Association, an advocacy organization for the vapor industry. Vapor products are increasingly attracting consumers. In Britain, an estimated 700,000 people (5% of all smokers) have transitioned to vapor products, mostly in the past two years. In France, e-cigarettes have helped reduce tobacco smoking according to one survey. These data show an impressive decline in tobacco smoking. Since the surgeon general issued its landmark 1964 report on the dangers of smoking, public health officials have tried to combat it. However, high-profile researchers believe that e-cigarettes have the potential to save millions of lives among populations of tobacco smokers. All consumer products are regulated, and e-cigarettes should not be an exception. Consumers need to feel confident that they are purchasing safe, high-quality items. But the regulation of e-cigarettes needs to be proportionate and not discriminatory, especially considering the potential they offer for eliminating the scourge of tobacco-related diseases. In the United States, e-cigarettes have become a top choice for smoking cessation according to a survey. Meanwhile, Big Tobacco is muddling along, rolling out its vapor products with their underpowered batteries and limited capacity for e-liquid. Yet, almost unbelievably, their one salvation has arrived in the form of the FDA. How the regulation of electronic cigarettes play out would have huge repercussions on public health and medical drug policies. The FDA should consider creating a tailored regulatory framework, one that would allow the e-cigarette industry to continue innovating to the point that smoked tobacco is made redundant, which could help save many lives worldwide. And what would this framework look like? In lieu of its proposed regulations, the FDA should begin by requiring e-liquid and e-cigarette makers to register the ingredients and designs of their products. The agency should work closely with expert third parties -- manufacturers and scientists -- to develop strong product standards. The FDA should also conduct epidemiological research to make sure that e-cigarettes are contributing positively to smoking rate decline. It's about burdens. If you start from the precautionary principal -- treat something as bad until proved good -- you miss the context that e-cigarettes are designed to replace one of the most dangerous consumer products invented. The FDA cannot afford to miss this opportunity to get it right on e-cigarettes.","The FDA is considering how best to regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products .

"(Health.com) -- A popular pain-relief treatment that uses electricity to stimulate nerves isn't likely to benefit the millions of Americans who live with chronic low back pain and shouldn't be recommended for that purpose, new guidelines say. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, or TENS, is delivered using a small battery-operated generator connected to a set of electrodes. The generator, about the size of a BlackBerry, transmits a weak electric current through the electrodes, which are attached to the skin at the site of chronic pain or at other key points. Despite their popularity, there is little evidence that these devices are effective for chronic low back pain, according to the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology, which were published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. ""Physicians are advised against ordering TENS for patients with chronic low back pain since it is proven not to work,"" says the lead author of the guidelines, Richard Dubinsky, M.D., a professor of neurology at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas. Health.com: How yoga can relieve back pain . Dubinsky and his colleague based the guidelines on a review of past studies that compared TENS with a sham TENS procedure (a mock treatment equivalent to a placebo) for chronic low back pain, which is defined as pain lasting three months or more. They turned up just five studies in all. Two high-quality studies found that TENS produced no benefit; the other studies had mixed results, but they were considered to be less reliable. Health.com: All the right moves to avoid back pain . The relative dearth of research on TENS and chronic low back pain suggests that the new guidelines shouldn't be accepted as gospel, according to Andreas Binder, M.D., and Ralf Baron, M.D., neurologists at Christian-Albrecht-Universität Kiel, in Kiel, Germany, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new guidelines. ""[A]bsence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" they wrote. Although the research on TENS may be thin, they added, ""there seems to be considerable empirical evidence that, at least in some patients, TENS is useful."" Binder and Baron point out that, unlike opiates and other pain medications -- which carry a risk of side effects, including abuse and addiction -- TENS is a safe, fast-acting, and user-friendly treatment that has very few side effects, doesn't interact with medications, and can be stopped at any time if it isn't effective. Health.com: Is chronic pain ruining your relationship? The treatment is also relatively affordable. TENS units can be purchased for less than $100, although some models cost several hundred dollars or more. There certainly is a market for the devices. Back pain is the second most common cause of disability in the U.S. after arthritis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Eight out of 10 adults will experience low back pain at some point in their lives by some estimates, although 95 percent of those cases will get better within three months. Charles Cranny, the director of outpatient physical therapy at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, says that because of the treatment's upside, TENS may still be worth recommending to patients with chronic back pain for whom other treatments have come up short. ""We use TENS as a last resort in people with chronic back pain who are not improving with other measures,"" he says. ""I say, let's give it a try in these patients. We have had some who swear by it and a lot who say, 'It worked for a couple of weeks, but then I returned it to the vendor.'"" Health.com: 5 natural fixes for back pain . Exactly how TENS works -- or whether it does work -- isn't known. Experts believe that the electrical current may overstimulate the nerves that sense pain, confusing the brain in the process and blocking out the real pain signals. ""TENS likely has a placebo effect, but its safety and side effect profile makes it an ideal tool in approaching chronic pain syndromes,"" says Derk Krieger, M.D., Ph.D., a neurologist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In contrast to the findings on low back pain, the new guidelines state that TENS may be useful in treating nerve pain associated with diabetes, which affects up to 70 percent of people with the disease. Two studies have found that TENS has some positive effects on diabetic nerve pain, but because neither of them compared TENS with any other treatment options, it remains unclear when TENS is most appropriate to use in such cases, the guidelines say. Health.com: Diet tips for pain patients . ""No recommendations can be made about when to use TENS compared to other treatments for diabetic nerve pain,"" says Dubinsky. Cranny says that, in his experience, TENS has indeed proven effective for diabetic nerve pain. ""This is a whole different type of pain than typical low back pain, and my patients with diabetic nerve pain swear by it,"" he says. ""If they don't use TENS they will have a bad day, and if they do use it they will feel better."" In the new guidelines,  Dubinsky and his colleague call for more studies of TENS, particularly in people who have never used the devices before. Future studies should also try to determine the optimal way to administer TENS, they write. In the meantime, says Cranny -- and the new guidelines notwithstanding -- patients have little reason not to try TENS. ""Try it, see if it works; if it doesn't, return it,"" he says. ""It's worth a shot, because there aren't too many significant side effects."" Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation doesn't help back pain, study finds .

"London (CNN) -- Gas prices might have breached the $4 per gallon mark in the U.S., but there won't be much sympathy for the American plight in Europe. In fact, that U.S. price of £2.52 a gallon looks highly affordable compared to the UK's current average cost of £6.22 ($9.85). In some places here you'll pay an eye-watering £7.27 ($11.52) for a gallon of super unleaded. And prices throughout the rest of Europe are similarly high. But it is worth sparing a thought for the hard-pressed Norwegians who'll pay £7.28 ($11.54) for a gallon of the regular stuff across their country. If the price of oil was the only factor to dictate the expense of gas it wouldn't be such a bitter pill. But it isn't. The government decides how much we're going to pay per gallon. Surprise, surprise, it also decides that the majority of it should be diverted to their coffers. So of our £6.22 average, £3.74 ($5.92), or a bit over 60%, ends up in the Treasury's back pocket. The government isn't the only guilty party. Fuel producers take 36%, which goes some way to explaining Shell's obscene £18.1bn ($28.6bn) profits from last year. What's the highest price you've seen? And of course unrest in the Middle East including sanctions against Syria and simmering discontent over Iran isn't helping. But every time the price of oil goes up, the British Government is quids in. Its second tax, VAT (Value Added Tax, similar to U.S. sales taxes), is levied on the final cost, giving us an inescapable double whammy. Hardly unsurprisingly, all this money grabbing has had a noticeable effect on the cars Europeans drive. People now discuss their motors in terms of miles per gallon rather than miles per hour. Owning a car that does a mere 35mpg seems so last century. And no one will be impressed unless your mpg figure starts with a six. Would I like to be smoking about in a dirty great beast with a dipsomaniac's thirst for the hard stuff? Of course I would. But if I could afford to buy such a car, running it would be akin to having a mistress who drinks champagne rather than chardonnay. At first I felt deep resentment at being forced into a small car. But you know what? Today's small cars are big in benefits. The Volkswagen Polo I now drive is the same size as the first ever Golf. The difference is it's comfier and has more features, including a petrol gauge that moves in slow motion. Fuel is a drug the U.S. has long since needed weaning off. Admittedly Americans have to cover greater distances than Europeans. But you don't need a glorified double bed powered by a throbbing great V8 to do that. A sensibly-sized car with a two-liter turbo will do the job just as comfortably. And with developing nations such as China, Brazil and India demanding ever more fuel, the planet can't put up with anyone's penchant for gas-guzzling monsters any more. But if the European experience is anything to go by, the $4 gallon isn't going to alter driving habits dramatically. America needs petrol prices to double if people are to permanently park up their 15mpg pick-up trucks. Maybe then it'll elicit a bit of sympathy from over here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Foxall.","In the UK, a gallon of gas can easily come to around $10, says writer, compared to around $4 in the U.S.

"Princeton, Indiana (CNN) -- President Barack Obama brought his midterm economic message -- that the economy is better but not better enough -- to a steel plant here Friday, noting a strong jobs report and taking partial credit for the nation's economic recovery. ""This progress that we've been making -- it's been hard,"" he said at the Millennium Steel plant in Princeton, which provides a nearby Toyota factory with parts. ""It goes in fits and starts. It's not always been perfectly smooth or as fast as we want, but it is real, and it is steady, and it is happening. And it's making a difference in economies all across the country."" The White House believes the nation's economic recovery could help propel Democrats to wins in November, though polls show Americans are still pessimistic about how far the nation has come since its recession-era depths. While jobs have returned -- as evidenced by a report Friday showing the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest point since July 2008 -- many Americans are still struggling to find full-time work or positions that pay pre-recession wages. ""There is a lot of good stuff happening in the economy right now,"" Obama said Friday. ""But as we all know there there are still challenges."" That's the message Obama and fellow Democrats plan to sell to voters in the month left before midterm elections, though Obama himself has yet to campaign for a candidate running in November. Even when he visits states with competitive races, Democrats on the ballot have been reluctant to appear at official events with Obama. Friday's event, in far southwestern Indiana, was covered heavily by media outlets from nearby Kentucky, where Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is battling Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. That race that's become a referendum of Obama's own policies, which McConnell has crusaded against on Capitol Hill. The line likely to make the local newscasts: Obama's defense of new power plant rules that McConnell and other Republicans have lambasted as a ""war of coal."" ""The real war on coal is natural gas,"" Obama said, noting cheaper alternatives to coal had led to problems for the industry. ""Obviously causes some hardship in communities that traditionally relied on coal,"" he conceded, saying he was working to find ways to burn coal in ways that emit less pollution.","Obama touts manufacturing gains at a steel plant in Indiana .

"(CNN) -- Atlanta-area authorities are investigating the death of Chris Kelly, half of the 1990s rap duo Kris Kross, as a possible drug overdose, Fulton County Police Cpl. Kay Lester said Thursday. Kelly, 34, died Wednesday at an Atlanta hospital after he was found unresponsive at his home, police said. After paramedics took him to the hospital, a woman who identified herself as Kelly's friend told an investigator that Kelly had taken a mixture of heroin and cocaine Tuesday night, and that she had brought Kelly home ""to recover from his drug use,"" according to a police report. Betty Honey, with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, said that an autopsy showed no signs of trauma or foul play. A toxicology report is expected to be complete in three to four weeks, at which point, a cause of death will likely be determined, she said. Kelly, together with Chris Smith, shot to stardom in 1992 with ""Jump,"" which spent eight weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. A #TBT in honor of Chris Kelly . The duo opened for Michael Jackson that year on his Dangerous World Tour. Their penchant for wearing their clothes backward was, at least for a time, widely emulated. ""I'm wearing my clothes to work backwards tomorrow,"" Michael Skolnik, edito-in-chief of the hip hop site Global Grind said, when he learned of the death. Leslie Tookes, a CNN project coordinator, lived next door to Kelly. Like others, she was saddened by his untimely death. ""We often heard him playing classical music and the piano,"" Tookes said. ""He was a low-key type of person who was very talented and courteous, friendly and wonderful to our 5-year-old twins. ""Indeed, gone too soon."" His family also mentioned the notable wardrobe adjustment in a statement mourning Kelly's passing. ""To millions of fans worldwide, he was the trendsetting, backwards pants-wearing one-half of Kris Kross who loved making music. But to us, he was just Chris -- the kind, generous and fun-loving life of the party,"" Kelly's family said in a statement. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived . Discovered at a mall . Kelly and Smith were 13-year-olds when they were discovered in 1991 at an Atlanta mall by producer Jermaine Dupri. Going by the stage name Mac Daddy (with Smith known as Daddy Mac), the pair followed up their smash ""Jump"" with the single ""Warm It Up."" Together, the songs pushed their debut album, ""Totally Krossed Out,"" to multiplatinum status. Next came 1993's ""Da Bomb."" But the album failed to find the following of the duo's debut, in large part because the boys had hit puberty and they were marketed with a tougher image. Their career never again reached the heights of their debut, but they continued to make music. In 1996, the duo released the album ""Young, Rich and Dangerous."" The pair reunited for one night in February for a 20th anniversary party for Dupri's So So Def label.

The two raced, and as Conan darted for the finish line he slipped, fell, and got a concussion. Oops. But don't worry -- he was back to joke about it the next night. 2. Martha Stewart partied hard on Conan . One of my favorite Conan memories ever: when Martha Stewart visited the show and brought burritos from Taco Bell and Olde English 40-oz. beers. The Frisky: 12 reality TV stars who died unexpectedly . 3. Coco's gaga for Gonzo . American ""Beat Generation"" novelist, essayist and spoken word performer Hunter S. Thompson and Conan O'Brien had a special bond. The famously reclusive author did several interviews with Conan before he passed away -- including one where he had Conan to his farm to drink whiskey and fire guns, in that order. Cursing and shooting stuffed gorilla bears: classic. 4. Jennifer Garner was checked by Conan . Jennifer Garner got a little snippy with Conan during an interview, scolding him that ""'Snuck' isn't a word. You went to Harvard, you should know that."" So it was pretty funny when Conan pulled out a dictionary on the spot and turned out to be right. Burn. The Frisky: 12 stars posing using their hands as bras . 5. Tom Hanks shows his funny side . Way back in 2000, Tom Hanks visited Conan's show before Christmas and Conan tried to get him into the holiday spirit by dumping a huge amount of snow on him. Then Conan gave Tom his very own special Christmas present: the skeleton of Tom's former co-star [dog] Hooch! When Conan took over ""The Tonight Show"" in 2009, Tom returned and made another memorable appearance where he talked about his love of meteor showers, and then Conan cued a giant meteor that knocked Tom out of his seat backwards and made his shoe fly off.

"(Mashable)  -- In one of his most candid interviews ever, Microsoft founder Bill Gates (the world's second-richest man) revealed personal details never heard before, along with a little tidbit that he was probably supposed to keep secret. We encourage you to read about his fascinating interview with the Daily Mail -- it's a rare look into the psyche of one of the most interesting people in the world -- but if you'd like a condensed version, here are 10 key personal details and insights Gates revealed in the wide-ranging talk: . 1. His kids like to tease him by singing the song ""Billionaire"" by Travie McCoy and Bruno Mars. 2. He's now given $28 billion to charity. 3. His three children, currently aged 15, 12 and nine, will reportedly inherit $10 million each (although Gates wouldn't disclose that amount in the interview), a slender sliver of his $56 billion net worth, because Gates says, ""I don't think that amount of money would be good for them."" 4. Did U2 star Bono invite Gates backstage when U2 was performing in Seattle? Not necessary, because Bono was staying at Bill's house that night. 5. Now dedicating his career to his $37.1 billion charitable foundation, Gates says when asked if he'll return to Microsoft full-time: ""No. I'm part-time involved. But this is my job now."" 6. Why try to cure malaria instead of cancer? Says Gates, ""The world is putting massive amounts into cancer, so my wealth would have had a meaningless impact on that."" 7. He haggles for good prices on vaccines: ""We are super-smart about what we pay. We get price reductions. We can track how many kids get the vaccines."" 8. People in Third World countries have no idea who he is. ""They don't know who I am, because it doesn't relate to their world. I went to one place with the chief minister and someone said, 'Who is this guy?', and the chief minister said, 'This is a white-skinned guy I brought with me.'"" 9. He has a Twitter account, but had a problem with Facebook: ""... Because the friend requests got out of hand."" 10. And the secret: Gates inadvertently revealed that his friend, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, is engaged to longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan. During the interview, Gates was talking about Zuckerberg and referred to Chan as Mark's ""fiancée Priscilla."" Oops. It could be that Bill was wrongly assuming the couple was engaged.

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced the Defense Department would lift the ban on women serving in combat, marking another significant milestone for equality in our nation. Taking this critical step forward to include women in combat strengthens our military by reducing the burden of the disproportionate number of soldiers who are making sacrifices. I sincerely hope that this will spark a national debate about who is fighting our wars and whether all of America can say that we're sharing the sacrifice. Since January 2003, at the height of the debate on the possible unilateral strike against Iraq, I have advocated for a reinstatement of the military draft to ensure a more equitable representation of people making sacrifices in wars in which the United States is engaged. In the past decade, more than 2 million soldiers have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Iraq war took more than 4,422 lives and wounded some 32,000 in nine years; to date, 2,168 American soldiers have died and 18,215 have been wounded in Afghanistan. Opinion: Women in combat a dangerous experiment . Currently the burden of defending our nation is carried by less than 1% of the American population. The 2.2 million members of the armed forces in active duty, the National Guard and the Reserve have become a virtual military class that makes the ultimate sacrifice of laying down life and limb for our country. As a result of high combat exposure, combined with multiple deployments, we have seen unprecedented incidences of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and veterans committing suicide. Since we replaced the compulsory military draft with an all-volunteer force in 1973, our nation has been making decisions about wars without worry over who fights them. I sincerely believe that reinstating the draft would compel the American public to have a stake in the wars we fight as a nation. That is why I wrote the Universal National Service Act, known as the ""draft"" bill, which requires all men and women between ages 18 and 25 to give two years of service in any capacity that promotes our national defense. Opinion: Will infantry men accept women as peers? I commend President Barack Obama for allowing women and members of the LGBT community to serve our country. I was pleased to hear in the inaugural speech on Monday of his commitment to ending a decade of war and to using diplomacy as a means to promote peace in the world. Inevitably, however, as in the past, there will be times in the future when America will be faced with the question of whether we need to place thousands of our young men and women in harm's way. When that time comes, I hope all of America will be forced to stop and think twice about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rep. Charles B. Rangel .","Charles Rangel: Allowing women in combat is a critical advance that bolsters military .

"Washington (CNN) -- You probably recognize Sen. Rob Portman from his tireless campaigning for Mitt Romney in 2012. He was even on the short list to be Romney's running mate. He's been a leading Republican voice on economic issues for four decades. Now, the prominent Ohio conservative will be known for something else: reversing his hardline position against gay marriage. He invited CNN to his Senate office to reveal the news. ""I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry,"" Portman told CNN. Portman stirs mixed reaction with same-sex marriage reversal . It has to do with another revelation, one deeply personal. His 21-year-old son, Will, is gay. ""I've come to the conclusion that for me, personally, I think this is something that we should allow people to do, to get married, and to have the joy and stability of marriage that I've had for over 26 years. That I want all of my children to have, including our son, who is gay,"" said Portman. Will Portman told his father and mother he is gay two years ago, when he was a freshman at Yale University. ""My son came to Jane, my wife, and I, told us that he was gay, and that it was not a choice, and that it's just part of who he is, and that's who he'd been that way for as long as he could remember,"" said Portman. What was the Republican senator's reaction? ""Love. Support,"" responded Portman. The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage . And complete surprise. He told CNN that he never suspected that his son was gay. Portman says his son, now a junior in college, helped him work through his decision to announce his change in position on gay marriage and blessed the idea of publicly announcing Will Portman's sexuality. ""I think he's happy and, you know, proud that we've come to this point, but he let it be my decision just as you know, it's going to be his decision as to the role he plays going forward in this whole issue,"" said Portman. Until now, this was a secret to most people in politics, but not everyone. Last year, when Romney was vetting Portman to be his running mate, the Ohio Republican informed both Romney and his top campaign advisers that he has a gay son. Activists hail watershed moment in the gay rights movement . ""I told Mitt Romney everything,"" said Portman with a laugh. ""That process is, intrusive would be one way to put it. But, no, yeah, I told him everything."" Portman, who was ultimately passed over as the GOP vice-presidential candidate in favor of Rep. Paul Ryan, said the fact that his son is gay was not the deal breaker for Romney. How does he know? ""Well, because they told me,"" said Portman. Portman told CNN he sought counsel from a Republican who did serve as vice president: Dick Cheney, the highest-ranking Republican with an openly gay child, his daughter Mary. 5 turning points in gay marriage debate . ""I spoke to him personally; I actually met with him,"" said Portman. He said Cheney's advice was simple: ""'Follow your heart.'"" ""He was a good person to talk to because he also was surprised by the news, in that case, you know, his wonderful daughter, who he loves very much. And it forced him to re-think the issue too, and over time, he changed his view on it,"" said Portman. ""I followed his advice. You know, I followed my heart,"" he said. Though he is a staunch conservative, Portman was never outspoken against gay marriage. But he consistently voted against it. Top Republicans sign brief supporting same-sex marriage . While in Congress, he supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and voted for a bill prohibiting gay couples in Washington from adopting. In 2011, 100 University of Michigan law school graduates walked out of Portman's commencement address to protest his position on gay rights after circulating a petition trying to get him removed as the event's speaker. ""The decision to host a graduation speaker who is openly hostile to LGBT rights is deeply unfair to the LGBT students who will be in the audience this year celebrating their graduation,"" read the petition. Portman admitted that when the protest occurred, he already knew his own son was gay. ""It was a little odd. Look, and to be honest with you, it didn't affect that decision-making much, because it was, I didn't think it was appropriate,"" Portman said. ""But look, they had their freedom of speech rights to be able to do what they wanted to do."" Will Portman 'especially proud' of father . ""But you know, what happened to me is really personal. I mean, I hadn't thought a lot about this issue. Again, my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career,"" said Portman. Asked about why he is announcing this change of heart, since his son revealed it to him two years ago, Portman cited two reasons. He just recently became comfortable with his decision to shift his position on gay marriage, and also he said he knew the Supreme Court is considering a pair of gay marriage cases, and reporters would likely ask him for his position. ""I thought it was the right time to let folks know where I stand so there's no confusion, so I would be clear about it,"" said Portman. What would Portman say to gay constituents who may be glad he's changing his position on gay marriage, but also wondering why it took having a gay son to come around to supporting their rights? ""Well, I would say that, you know, I've had a change of heart based on a personal experience. That's certainly true,"" he responded with a shoulder shrug. Obama on same-sex marriage: Everyone is equal . But he also repeated a reality. His policy focus has been almost exclusively on economic issues. ""Now it's different, you know. I hadn't expected to be in this position. But I do think, you know, having spent a lot of time thinking about it and working through this issue personally that, you know, this is where I am, for reasons that are consistent with my political philosophy, including family values, including being a conservative who believes the family is a building block of society, so I'm comfortable there now."" To be sure, Portman was anything but comfortable discussing something as private and personal as his son's sexuality, even noting how foreign it felt for someone with his Midwestern upbringing and sensibilities to talk publicly about such issues. At times, the press-savvy politician even seemed to tremble a bit. But it was also clear he was willing to endure the discussion in order to publicly tell his son that he is proud. ""He wanted to tell us that there's something about him that we didn't know,"" Portman said, reflecting on the day two years ago his son Will first told his parents he was gay. Portman quickly added that it ""of course hasn't changed our view of him at all."" Read the latest news on CNN.com . Do you have a close friend or family member who has come out of the closet?

"(CNN) -- You'll flip head over heels for this summer's bumper crop of new roller coasters. ""It's going to be a crazy good year,"" says Dave Lipnicky, an economist and volunteer public relations director for American Coaster Enthusiasts, an international group with 5,000 members. Along with a couple of petrifying new record-breakers (highest, fastest and other superlatives go with coasters like tracks and inversions), U.S. amusement parks are also investing in new technologies and family friendly thrill rides. ""In the '70s, parks were pulling out their kiddie rides to make room for the teen-drawing bigger, faster, stomach-tightening rides,"" Lipnicky says. ""This summer, there are plenty of those, but we're also seeing a nice balance in the major installments."" Here are 10 top new roller coasters you'll be screaming about for a long time: . Goliath . Six Flags Great America, Gurnee, Illinois . This new wooden coaster that debuts May 24 breaks three -- count 'em, three -- world records. It has the longest drop, the steepest drop and goes faster than any other wooden coaster. It also flips riders head over heels in two inversions that could make the inevitable air-time and 180-degree zero-G roll seem kinda tame. Daredevil riders, with bated breath, have been keeping tabs on construction via the Goliath Cam on the park's Facebook site. sixflags.com/greatamerica . Bells and whistles: . Length: 3,100 feet . Speed: 72 mph . Height: 165 feet . Insanity: A 180-foot vertical drop that plunges 85 degrees into an underground tunnel . Best places to experience Native American culture . Banshee . Kings Island, Mason, Ohio . Like the mythological creature whose screams break glass, this new $24 million coaster with the same name is sure to terrify anyone who gets near. Banshee, which opened April 18, is billed as the longest inverted coaster in the world. And, yes, inverted means upside down. It also has a curved drop, a dive loop, a zero-G roll, a batwing, an outside loop spiral and an inline-roll. After months of watching a live videocam of the purple coaster's death-defying construction, eager fans have already raised some $65,000 for a Cincinnati charity supporting kids with life-threatening illnesses by signing up for the two-hour marathon the night before the park officially opens for 2014. visitkingsisland.com/banshee . Bells and whistles: . Length: 4,124 feet . Speed: 68 mph . Height: 170 feet . Insanity: Seven inversions and a 170-foot heartline finale . Verruckt, Schlitterbahn . Kansas City, Kansas . Ever since October 1901, when a 63-year-old Michigan school teacher survived a plunge down Niagara Falls in a wooden barrel, daredevils have been dreaming up schemes to ride down the 167-foot monster waterfall. On May 23, Schlitterbahn Kansas City is unveiling a waterslide/hypercoaster that's actually several feet taller. And while it's illegal to mount an expedition down Niagara these days (park officials didn't particularly enjoy dealing with mangled bodies), anyone with the guts to climb the 264 stairs can make the 17-story drop on the Verruckt, which means insane in German. The new attraction will be the world's tallest water slide. theverruckt.com . Bells and whistles: . Length: Straight down with a second five-story slope . Speed: 65 mph . Height: 17 stories .

Living up to its name, this hair-raising new coaster that opened February 18 has a turn that banks to the outside, an unheard of gravity-defying feature, even among coaster collectors. Eleven-year-old Benjamin De Los Santos of St. George, Utah, who won a contest to be one of the first four passengers, said, ""I was out of my seat more than I was in it. The first drop was so crazy I accidentally said a bad word.""

Luna Park in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York . Just when you thought it was safe to go back to Coney Island, a new $10 million steel Thunderbolt is opening on the site of the original wooden Thunderbolt that terrified thrill seekers from the 1920s through the '80s. If you saw ""Annie Hall,"" it was the coaster under which Woody Allen's fictional character grew up. Thunderbolt 2.0 is the park's first to be built since the famous, still-in-operation Cyclone. The Thunderbolt, opening in May, starts with a jaw-dropping 90-degree vertical drop, followed by a 100-foot vertical loop, an 80-foot, zero-G roll, a 112-degree over-banked turn and a custom heartline dive. LunaParkNYC.com . Bells and whistles: . Length: 2,233 feet . Speed: 55 mph . Height: 115 feet . Insanity: A 90-degree plunge . Flying Turns . Knoebels Amusement Resort, Elysburg, Pennsylvania . Most parks would have given up years ago. But this family-owned amusement park was so determined to recreate the legendary wooden coaster that British barnstorming pilot John Norman Bartlett brought to America in the 1920s that it spent 7Â½ years melding its old-school thrills (read, laxer safety standards) with today's high-tech safety regulations. Judging by the stunned reaction from riders in last October's sneak preview/soft opening, it was well worth every trip back to the old drawing board. On April 26, the park opens for Flying Turns' much-anticipated full debut season. knoebels.com . Bells and whistles: . Length: 1,200 feet . Speed: 24 mph . Height: 50 feet . Insanity: You're in a wooden chute without any tracks making very tight turns. FireChaser Express . Dollywood, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee . Dolly Parton herself was there to cut the ribbon on this new coaster that debuted March 22. Although it's classified in coaster parlance as a ""family ride"" -- and indeed riders need only be 39 inches tall to board the splashy red fire trucks -- this innovative new ride includes explosions, fireworks, more twists than an Agatha Christie novel and enough special effects that it could get nominated for that category in next year's Oscars. dollywood.com . Bells and whistles: . Length: 2,427 feet . Speed: 34.5 mph . Height: 12 stories . Insanity: Once Big Bertha explodes, you ride backwards all the way to the station. Lightning Run . Kentucky Kingdom, Louisville, Kentucky . After a five-year hiatus and a $50 million renovation, this amusement park, formerly a part of the Six Flags brand, debuts May 24 with the new steel Lightning Run. Joining Stella and Lola, the Twisted Twins that were originally called the Twisted Sisters until the rock group of the same name threatened to sue, Lightning Run has a sleek new car design that sends riders on a negative force camelback that will have them screaming, ""Mommy!"" kentuckykingdom.com .

You might be tempted to sniff at the stats (it IS, after all, an all-ages coaster), but this new steel coaster at Disney World's New Fantasyland does a lot more than defy Newton's laws. According to Disney Imagineer Dave Minichiello, the ride's creative director, this roller coaster-plus has music and interactive elements, goes outside through a forest and inside through the dwarf's mine and is unlike any ride Disney World has ever seen. disneyworld.disney.go.com .

Bad? Not so much. But when you figure that the Story Land customer base is 12 and under (oh yeah, and their parents), a brand new wooden roller coaster that catches air is pretty extreme. And because Roar-O-Saurus' numerous twists and turns are built into such a tight space and because it moves at a surprisingly frenetic pace, Lipnicky, of American Coaster Enthusiasts, claims this new dinosaur-led coaster packs an impressive wallop. With 100 inches of snow in New Hampshire this year, fingers are crossed that Rory, the dinosaur, and his team will be ready to rock and roll by the park's opening on May 24. storylandnh.com .

"(CNN) -- Rolling Stone has announced its choice for the best album of 2014. And it may also be the most hated album of 2014. The honor goes to U2's ""Songs of Innocence,"" which annoyed many listeners in September when it was automatically sent to the accounts of 500 million active iTunes users, without their consent, as part of an Apple promotion. Although the album was free, some users grumbled that the distribution method was invasive. Frontman Bono later apologized, saying the band ""got carried away with ourselves."" ""There was no bigger album of 2014 -- in terms of surprise, generosity and controversy,"" Rolling Stone's editors said Monday in defending their choice. ""Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. put their lives on the line: giving away 11 songs of guitar rapture and frank, emotional tales of how they became a band out of the rough streets and spiritual ferment of Seventies Dublin."" Much of the Internet, however, howled in laughter and protest. ""U2 actually just appeared on the Rolling Stone AOTY list and RS didn't know how to delete it,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""In case anyone was wondering if Rolling Stone's opinions on music were still relevant, they named U2's new album the best of the year, so..."" said another. As a pop-culture magazine founded in the 1960s, Rolling Stone is often viewed as being less daring in its tastes than online rivals such as Pitchfork, which gave ""Songs of Innocence"" a 4.6 out of 10. Although U2 remains one of the biggest artists in the world, the band's popularity has slumped over the past decade. ""Songs of Innocence"" has received little airplay and mixed responses from critics, reflected by its score of 65 out of 100 on Metacritic, which aggregates reviews. In ranking their top 50 albums of the year, Rolling Stone chose U2 over high-profile releases from Bruce Springsteen (#2), The Black Keys (#3), Taylor Swift (#10) and others. Many of 2014's top sellers, including releases by Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith, did not make the list.","Rolling Stone names U2's ""Songs of Innocence"" the best album of the year .

"(CNN) -- ""Pediatrics Group Backs Gay Marriage, Saying It Helps Children,"" proclaims a headline in The New York Times. But the advocacy group presented no new studies, no new data, to support this claim. And the studies the group cites have been shown to be insufficient to come to this conclusion about same-sex parenting. Turns out the press release, picked up nationwide, was a PR stunt aimed at influencing the Supreme Court. The nine justices are set to hear oral arguments Tuesday and Wednesday in two cases about the constitutionality of marriage laws. Today, 41 states define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Marriage is at the center of an intense national debate, a family-by-family, state-by state conversation that CNN substantively encourages by making room for varying perspectives and supplying state-based data. However, CNN risks obscuring that conversation about what marriage is by framing the issue as measurable by an ""LGBT rights calculator."" This writer is for equal rights for all Americans. But no one has the right to redefine marriage. It's important to future generations that Americans understand what marriage is, why it matters, and the consequences of redefining it. The Supreme Court shouldn't truncate the debate and redefine marriage by judicial decree to include same-sex relationships. So what about that release from the American Academy of Pediatrics? Two eminent political scientists, Leon Kass (a professor at University of Chicago) and Harvey Mansfield (a professor at Harvard), filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court cautioning against accepting politicized science: ""Claims that science provides support for constitutionalizing a right to same-sex marriage must necessarily rest on ideology. Ideology may be pervasive in the social sciences, especially when controversial policy issues are at stake, but ideology is not science."" Kass and Mansfield urge the court not to redefine marriage based on new, inconclusive research. The academic studies on same-sex parenting purporting to show ""no differences"" are, they argue, ""subject to severe constraints arising from limited data"" and a lack of ""replicable experiments."" The professors contend: . ""Even if same-sex marriage and child rearing by same-sex couples were far more common than they now are, large amounts of data collected over decades would be required before any responsible researcher could make meaningful scientific estimates of the effects."" Although we still have much to learn about the impact of same-sex parenting, we do know quite a bit about marriage and child well-being. We have decades of rigorous social science data confirming that children do best with a married mother and father. In another amicus brief submitted to the court, a group of social science professors explains: . ""It is not simply the presence of two parents ... but the presence of two biological parents that seems to support children's development. ... Experts have long contended that both mothers and fathers make unique contributions to parenting."" Indeed, scholars have known this for quite some time. Professor David Popenoe of Rutgers University explains: . ""We should disavow the notion that 'mommies can make good daddies,' just as we should disavow the popular notion ... that 'daddies can make good mommies.' ... The two sexes are different to the core, and each is necessary—culturally and biologically—for the optimal development of a human being."" These statistics have penetrated American life to such a great extent that President Barack Obama can refer to them as well understood: . ""We know the statistics—that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves. And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it."" Fathers matter, and marriage helps to connect fathers to mothers and children. But how can the law teach that fathers are essential if we redefine marriage to make fathers optional? Redefining marriage denies the importance of mothers and fathers, and same-sex parenting arrangements, as the social science professors note, ""by definition, exclude either a mother or a father."" The concern is not whether same-sex couples can make ""quality and successful efforts in raising children."" The concern is that there ""remain unique advantages to a parenting structure consisting of both a mother and a father, political interests notwithstanding."" Marriage policy should place the needs of children before the desires of adults. It should respect the rights of children to the care of the man and woman who created them as much as the rights of adults to live and love as they choose—which adults can do, without redefining marriage for the entire nation. One thing CNN's calculator makes clear is that, wherever they live, Americans are in the middle of a national conversation about what marriage is, why it matters, and the consequences of redefining it. The Supreme Court shouldn't make marriage policy for the entire nation. Rather than cut short democratic deliberation, the court should uphold the constitutional authority of citizens and their elected officials to make decisions about marriage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ryan T. Anderson.","Ryan Anderson: Some social scientists cite research to support same-sex marriage .
He says the studies don't support that conclusion about same-sex parenting .
It will take a long time to answer the question rigorously, he says .

"(CNN) -- HBO television actor Robert Brown filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the New York Police Department and Macy's Inc., accusing them of racially profiling him, according to court documents. Brown filed the lawsuit as a class-action complaint, on behalf of himself as well as similarly situated individuals of color, according to the documents filed in federal court in New York. Most known for his starring role in HBO's ""Treme,"" Brown went to Macy's in New York in June to buy a graduation gift for his mother, the documents said. After buying a $1,300 Movado watch, Brown was shopping for a pair of sunglasses for himself when he was stopped in the middle of the store by three men, whom he believed to be NYPD officers. They accused him of committing credit card fraud, according to the documents. ""They cuff me, parade me around the store, all the while maintaining, we do this all the time, it's a fake card, you're going to go to jail,"" Brown said on October 29 while recounting the incident on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Hollywood couple stopped by police, say they were racially profiled . The documents state that Brown was put into a holding cell enclosed by metal bars for more than an hour and ""berated and mocked by these men."" Once the officers learned of Brown's television and film credits, he was released, but not before the men attempted to drive Brown to his mother's graduation ceremony, the documents said. Brown is the fourth person to say they were targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race this year, and the second to cite Macy's as the store in question. The other two said they were racially profiled at Barney's. ""This suit seeks to bring a halt to this disgusting, discriminatory pattern and practice,"" the document said. Elina Kazan, vice president of media relations for Macy's, said on Wednesday the company cannot comment on pending litigation, but it does ""not tolerate discrimination of any kind, including racial profiling.""

"Foss Lake, Oklahoma (CNN) -- It began as routine training with new sonar equipment on an Oklahoma lake. But what highway patrolmen found from their boat was macabre. It was a car. And, as they were to discover later, there were bones and skulls inside. Then, equally surprising, they found another car. And it had bones inside it, too. Rusted and caked with mud, a 1952 Chevrolet and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro held as many as six bodies. The recovery of the vehicles and remains Tuesday have residents near Foss Lake, a reservoir about 110 miles west of Oklahoma City, wondering whether two mysteries -- involving disappearances that the town of Sayre never forgot -- can finally be put to rest. Investigators say they believe one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970, and the other car could be linked to the disappearance of a man in the 1960s who a federal official says was with a sibling and a friend, officials told CNN and its affiliates KFOR and KOCO. Darrell Splawn, a diver with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, was sent down on Tuesday, one week after the sonar located the corroding vehicles. They were right next to each other, at a depth of 12 feet and 50 feet from a marina. Visibility was almost nil. He, like others, had no idea how the vehicles -- which faced in different directions -- came to be in the lake. Splawn located an open door and felt a shoe. ""It didn't really cross my mind as to a body being there. It could have just been a shoe,"" the trooper told CNN on Wednesday. Skeletal remains were seen when the car was brought to shore. Now authorities are trying to positively identify the remains, a process that could take years, and try to learn what happened. So much time has passed in the two cases that the son of one missing person is now 85 and struggling with dementia. Young motorist was supposed to go to football game . Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples told KOCO that one of the cars, the Camaro, may have belonged to 16-year-old Jimmy Williams, a Sayre teenager who disappeared in 1970 with two friends: Thomas Rios and Leah Johnson, both 18. Rios had just moved to Sayre from Oklahoma City with his mother and stepfather about four months before his disappearance, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System website said. The three teenagers went missing the night of November 20, 1970, when they went for a ride around Sayre in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization helping law enforcement in solving cold cases. Williams was supposed to be going to a football game in Elk City, but he may have instead gone hunting on a road called Turkey Creek with Rios and Johnson, the Doe Network website said. The website includes photos of the Camaro and cites Williams' family as its source of information. The three teens never returned home. The car was never found, and its vehicle identification number never surfaced on any databases. Williams' Social Security number was never used, the Doe Network said. Sayre residents were horrified after the disappearances and held a candlelight vigil for the teens as recently as four years ago. ""A lot of people showed up, and it brought awareness,"" said Dayva Spitzer, co-editor and publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat weekly newspaper. ""It was very nicely done."" Police Chief Ronnie Harrold told CNN that local residents have been making up their own theories about what became of the three teens for the 26 years he's been there. A grandfather disappears and leaves no trace . Debbie McManaman said she believes the older car contains the remains of her grandfather, John Alva Porter. Porter, then 69, was traveling in a green Chevy with a sibling, Alrie Porter, and friend Nora Marie Duncan, 58, on April 8, 1969, when they all went missing, said Mike Nance, regional system administrator for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. ""It's been so long -- 44 years. There are a lot of things in between there we can't answer, because we don't know,"" McManaman told CNN on Wednesday. ""His bank account was there, his house was locked up. Utilities were on. He just walked away."" John Porter used to ride bulls and take part in Wild West shows. At the lake, Ervie Porter, the son of John Porter, watched as investigators crawled around the cars. Now 85, the younger Porter suffers from dementia. He told CNN he has spent a long time searching for his father. ""Still looking for him. But this is going to help me a whole lot."" Divers search in, around vehicles . After the two cars were pulled out, dive teams with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol scoured the lake bottom again. ""The divers then went back in the water and searched around,"" said spokeswoman Betsy Randolph, ""and found a skull."" Splawn said he found a skull, femur and some smaller bones during the additional search. ""This is the first time this has ever happened to me,"" he said. After thorough searches, both vehicles were towed away Wednesday evening. Trooper George Hoyle was operating the sonar equipment that last week spotted the two vehicles. Foss Lake is down substantially because of a drought and that could have been a factor in the discovery, officials said. Hoyle said he hopes families now will receive answers. ""It feels very good to us to be able to help them get that closure so they can have some resolve and serenity in their own lives,"" he said. Taken: The oldest cold case ever solved . Identification of remains will take time . The Oklahoma chief medical examiner's office will examine the remains once they are removed from the vehicles and ""will possibly try to match DNA of those remains with known surviving family members,"" a Custer County Sheriff's Office statement said. The remains will be first evaluated by using any identification cards, jewelry and teeth found on the bodies, said Chief Medical Examiner Eric Pfeifer. A muddied wallet, a purse and two corroded rifles were among the items recovered. Authorities cautioned Wednesday, however, that positive identification could take years. The state anthropologist, Angela Berg, will examine the remains. ""Scientific identification of these remains will be attempted using anthropological and if necessary, forensic pathological methods,"" Chief Administrative Officer Amy Elliott said in a written statement. ""Depending on the features of these remains and their state of preservation, identification can take anywhere from days to years. In some cases, if the DNA is degraded, positive identification using scientific means may not be possible. Evidence in killing of former beauty queen points to ex-priest . In December, state anthropologist Berg coincidentally began looking into the cold case of the Porters and Duncan and then contacted Nance after she discovered that another cold case existed about a second vehicle with three missing teens in the same area, Nance told CNN. When authorities discovered the two cars and remains of six people, Berg called Nance for information on the six missing persons, which the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System maintains, he said. NAMUS recently coordinated with law agencies the collection of DNA from the family of Duncan, the woman who went missing along with the Porters, and the federal agency posted her name on its website, Nance said.

"(CNN) -- Andrea Sloan is dying of ovarian cancer. Having exhausted all standard treatment options, her doctors say her best hope now is a new class of cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors. The California pharmaceutical company BioMarin makes one version of these drugs called BMN 673. Earlier this year, the company presented very early data on this experimental drug at a large cancer conference. Initial results in women with breast and ovarian cancer were encouraging. Sloan says there are doses of BMN 673 sitting on shelves in the same hospital where she's seeking treatment: M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. But she's not getting the treatment because the company is refusing to give it to her. That's because this drug she wants is still in clinical trials, and the company says hasn't been proven effective. BioMarin points out that to date their drug has been tested in fewer than 30 patients with ovarian cancer like Sloan. ""It would be unethical and reckless to provide end-stage refractory ovarian cancer patients outside a clinical trial with BMN 673 at this early stage of development,"" says company spokesperson Debra Charlesworth. ""If we did, we would be exposing an experimental drug to a large group without adequate testing. There have been previous circumstances where early access to large groups has resulted in adverse consequences that were worse than the course of the disease."" But Sloan says she's willing to accept the risks -- to roll the dice now that her doctors have tried everything else they can to save her life, including multiple rounds of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation since she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2007. And her doctor supports her. She has the help of a PR firm, working pro bono, to bring attention to her case, and a change.org petition for her cause has collected more than 150,000 supporters. It will likely be years before BMN 673 is on the market, but Andrea says she does not have that long to wait. PARP inhibitors work by preventing DNA repair in cancer cells, and are thought to work especially well in patients with a particular gene mutation. ""One of the reasons she's such a great candidate for PARP inhibitors specifically is because she has a BRCA mutation,"" says Dr. Charles Levenback, Sloan's oncologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ""She has a hereditary form of ovarian cancer, so we believe she has a much better chance of responding to PARP inhibitors than patients with a nonhereditary type of ovarian cancer."" Levenback says Sloan doesn't meet the eligibility requirements for any open clinical trials to the best of his knowledge. If she did, he would not be seeking compassionate use for his patient in the first place, he says. BioMarin is conducting more clinical trials, but in breast cancer only, not ovarian cancer. The standoff between Sloan and BioMarin raises the question: When should patients get access to experimental drugs? Under ""Compassionate Use"" or ""Expanded Access"", the Food and Drug Administration allows an unapproved drug still in development to go to a patient with few alternatives remaining, also absolving the drug maker of liability should the drug not work or cause harm. The FDA has said Sloan qualifies to seek compassionate use of BMN 673, but BioMarin won't provide it and they don't have to. ""You have the FDA saying, 'Look we'll approve compassionate care.' You have the doctor who is the specialist saying: 'This is the right thing to do.' And you have a corporation protecting its wallet at the expense of Andrea possibly dying,"" says Newt Gingrich, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire,"" who has been gathering support for Sloan's case. ""If you want to know why big companies often get bad names, it's explaining that clerical support to fill out FDA paperwork is too difficult when you can save a life."" BioMarin says it does provide ""expanded access"" to patients for another drug which is further along in the clinical trial process, and that the company expects to spend $50 million or approximately 10% of its revenue in 2013 on providing free drugs to patients. BioMarin also notes that other drug companies are developing PARP inhibitors too, so they're not the only potential source for Sloan. The company points to an AstraZeneca clinical trial currently enrolling ovarian cancer patients, but Sloan's doctor says she doesn't qualify. ""We're focused on BioMarin because initially that is the one that one of my doctors had the most direct experience with and recommended,"" says Sloan, whose doctors at M.D. Anderson also participate in BioMarin's clinical testing. ""The compassionate use policy exists for exactly this situation, and this is how patients lose: I lose if BioMarin is able to say 'Well you need to go ask for it from one of the other three',"" says Sloan. Art Caplan, professor of Bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, says the scatter-shot way in which individual patients are left to petitioning drug companies for access to experimental drugs creates an unfair process. ""One problem in this country is we haven't set up a system. Right now what we've got is a squeaky-wheel lottery; if you can figure out what your options are, if you know how to use social media, if you know how to have a bake sale, if you can hire a PR firm -- you can have a shot at an unapproved drug,"" says Caplan. ""But that's all obviously inequitable relative to the number of people who might want to seek compassionate use."" Caplan says that without more safety and efficacy data on BioMarin's drug, it's too early in the process for a compassionate use exception for a different form of cancer than the one BioMarin is targeting. There's still a big risk that the drug could harm Sloan, speeding her death, as much as it helps her, he says. Sloan's doctor agrees the system needs changing. ""My own belief is that the drug companies, the manufacturers, the insurance companies, the providers like my hospital M.D. Anderson, the individual medical professionals, the investigators, the patients -- everybody wants the same things. Safe, effect, novel therapies for as many people as it's appropriate for,"" says Levenback. ""Even BioMarin, I believe. I don't think this is like 'Let the masses eat cake.' I think they're on the same mission. But the whole system is giving this dysfunctional result."" Levenback says the window for Sloan is closing. If it's going to be effective, she will need the new drug soon. Knowledge of that fact has put Sloan on a mission, and she says she's not giving up.","Andrea Sloan, 45, has ovarian cancer .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- ""Have you been to Koreatown yet?"" my friend asked eagerly over the phone. It was my third week as a resident of Los Angeles, and I could no longer claim the pure shock of moving to a city so sprawling, so overwhelming, as the reason I had yet to explore its most interesting neighborhoods. But I had to answer ""no."" In a city as vast as Los Angeles, Koreatown seemed especially impenetrable, a huge warren of restaurants, markets, strip malls and residences. As much as I knew that it held a treasure trove of food, culture and nightlife, I was intimidated to even get started. Now, almost a year later, Koreatown is one of my favorite things about living in Los Angeles. It's like having an entire other city within a city, a gloriously foreign one at that. There are places in Koreatown where you look around and swear you are in Asia. And yet, it's also 100% Los Angeles: a strange, sprawling melting pot full of hidden delights. Here are eight things to know about Koreatown, things that I hope will help make discovering this neighborhood a little less daunting. 15 things to do around Los Angeles . It's big . Koreatown is west of downtown and south of Hollywood and is considered part of the Mid-Wilshire district. Its borders are somewhat amorphous and have shifted over time, but the neighborhood's generally accepted area is around 3 square miles and has one of the densest populations in Los Angeles. In the 1920s and '30s it was very much a swinging spot for Hollywood celebrities, and was the location of the Ambassador Hotel, which hosted the Academy Awards in the '30s and '40s (and was also the site of the Robert F. Kennedy assassination). Though the Ambassador was torn down in 2005, you can still see some remnants of that old glamor in other buildings scattered among the newer strip malls and construction. The ever-changing flavor of L.A.'s Koreatown . The neighborhood has seen turmoil . Heavy Korean settlement in the area cemented the neighborhood as Koreatown in the 1970s, when many South Koreans immigrated to California. In 1992 Koreatown bore the brunt of much of the violence and looting that happened during the L.A. riots, and many Koreans fled to the suburbs after the riots. But renewed development in the early 2000s, plus a new subway line with stations in the neighborhood, led to a revitalization of the area. Most of the residents are Latino . This is a tri-lingual neighborhood: Wherever you go, you will hear Korean, Spanish and English, and often times a mashup of all three. This blend of cultures has led to some of L.A.'s most recognized food, such as Roy Choi's Kogi tacos, the original Korean taco truck. Choi, who is Korean but grew up surrounded by L.A.'s Latino influences, channels a completely authentic experience of America's melting pot. While L.A. has the nation's largest Korean population and Koreans make up the largest nationality in the neighborhood (22%, according to demographic analysis) most of the residents of Koreatown are Latino: 58%. But you can also find Bangladeshi, Brazilian, Vietnamese, Pakistani and all manner of South American residents, businesses and eateries in the area. Koreatown never sleeps . Twenty-four-hour restaurants are just the beginning. Koreatown is home to more nightlife than many other entire cities can claim, from dive bars to high-end cocktail speakeasies, from karaoke clubs to establishments that must be a business of some sort, on the second level of a strip mall with a sign in Korean and people coming and going at 4 a.m. There's a lot of mystery here, but also a lot on full display. A few spots to get you started: In the dive bar category there's Hangover bar (3377 Wilshire Blvd.) with all you can drink beer and soju for $21.99. Lock & Key (239 S. Vermont Ave.) is a new speakeasy where you have to try different doorknobs from the foyer to get in. Inside, it's all Korea meets 1920s Hollywood glam. The tucked-away spot is fronted by Stall 239, a walk-up restaurant serving international snacks late. Koreatown is said to have the highest concentration of restaurants and nightclubs in Southern California. My Koreatown nightlife of choice? Karaoke. Most karaoke clubs here have private rooms, so you and your friends can sing your hearts out without having to deal with a bunch of drunk strangers' off-key wailings. Try Palm Tree L.A. (3240 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 401), a swank club with private rooms and songs in Korean, Japanese and English. If strangers' off-key wailings is what you're in the mood for, you can hit up Brass Monkey (3440 Wilshire Blvd.), a more American karaoke dive bar that's good for sloppy fun. There is a LOT of good food here . Koreatown is home to some of the country's best Korean barbecue (check out Park's and Genwa for high quality meat as well as fantastic banchan, or small side dishes served with rice), but there's so, so much more to explore. Soup, porridge, raw fish salads, stews -- every Korean specialty you can imagine exists in this neighborhood. It's hard to even begin to list favorites -- every Angeleno has a Koreatown hole in the wall they want to rave to you about. The fun is in getting out there and finding your own personal must-try dish. Korean food isn't all that's on the menu . Koreatown is home to more than just Korean -- for instance, Guelaguetza, one of the city's best Mexican restaurants, lives in the heart of Koreatown. Expect amazing moles, live music on weekends, a ton of families sharing huge platters of grilled meats, and fun fruity tropical mezcal cocktails. Beer Belly, a newer craft beer bar, finds its home in an odd building behind one of Koreatown's strip malls and serves killer bar food along with one of the best beer selections in the city. And the rest of the neighborhood's diverse population means tremendous eateries are tucked throughout. For more on the neighborhood's food, check out some of Anthony Bourdain's recent culinary stops in the gallery above and tune in for ""Parts Unknown"" on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. $15 spa day? Yes, please . Korean spas are a lovely and affordable way to pamper yourself, and Koreatown has a whole slew of options. Natura Spa offers an all day pass for $15, which gains you access to the saunas, steam rooms, hot tubs and cold pool, with extra options like body scrubs available. Wi Spa is open 24 hours and has a kid's area as well as a mud spa. Korean spas generally have Korean cafes within, and many of those serve really great food, making them perfect all-day immersions. Stinky, spicy souvenirs abound . There are some amazing kimchi purveyors in Koreatown, stores that sell jars of fermented cabbage and other delicious banchan. Seek out artisan producers like the folks at Kaesung Market (1010 S. St. Andrews Place) where owners have been making kimchi for 35 years.

"Boston (CNN) -- A man who'd been prepared to testify in the trial of reputed Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger was found dead -- a day after, a friend says, he learned he was dropped from the prosecution's witness list. Massachusetts State Police are investigating the death of Stephen Rakes, 59, the Middlesex County district attorney's office said Thursday. A jogger reported finding Rakes' body Wednesday in Lincoln, west of Boston, said Stephanie Guyotte, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. An autopsy to determine cause and manner of death was conducted Thursday by the chief medical examiner's office and no signs of trauma were found, according to Guyotte. Results are pending toxicology tests, which generally takes several weeks to complete. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he terrorized South Boston as the head of the Irish mob. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm . Rakes had alleged that Bulger forced Rakes to sell his South Boston liquor store to him in the 1980s. Steve Davis, a brother of one of Bulger's alleged murder victims and a friend of Rakes, said that Rakes learned Tuesday that the prosecution had dropped him from its list of potential witnesses. ""I was upset for him ... because he was looking forward to"" testifying, said Davis, who said he'd become close to Rakes in the months leading to Bulger's trial, which began in June. Davis said he tried to reach Rakes on Tuesday but his call was not returned. Asked whether Rakes was upset about being dropped, Davis said: ""I think it was real devastating to him."" Last Monday, former Bulger associate Kevin Weeks testified that ""it wasn't your regular extortion,"" adding that Rakes offered to sell his store to Bulger. Weeks explained to the federal jury that Rakes was willing to sell his liquor store Stippo's for $100,000, but tried to back out of the deal at the last second. Weeks, who on the stand repeated over and over ""I don't like Rakes,"" said that Bulger had forced the store owner to take the deal. Expletives fly between Bulger and Kevin Weeks . Rakes later told the media that Weeks was a liar and that his liquor store was ""never for sale."" Weeks turned state's evidence after he found out Bulger was an FBI informant and led law enforcement to a quarry of shallow graves in Boston tidal marshes. He pleaded guilty to assisting in five murders in 2000 and served five years in prison in exchange for cooperating against Bulger. A representative of the U.S. attorney's office that is prosecuting Bulger declined to comment Thursday on the death. Rakes ""showed up at court every day for this trial,"" Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen told ""CNN Newsroom."" He said he last saw Rakes at the trial on Tuesday. ""He's been waiting decades to tell his story,"" Cullen said. Michael Connolly, a lawyer who once represented Rakes, told CNN on Thursday that he was shocked to learn of Rakes' death. ""I saw him a month ago, and he looked fit, healthy, and was in good spirits,"" Connolly said. ""He was looking forward to testifying at the 'Whitey' Bulger trial."" CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Stephen Rakes, 59, is found dead in a Boston-area town .

"(CNN) -- Remember Netflix, that little video rental outfit that sent you DVDs via the U.S. mail? The one whose red envelopes would arrive with dulling regularity and sit near your television for months on end as you attempted to catch up on your DVR recordings? It's playing with the big boys now. Netflix is, of course, no longer just a DVD rental service. It also streams movies and TV series -- including its own. On Thursday morning, Netflix received the ultimate recognition. One of the company's original series, ""House of Cards,"" was nominated for best drama for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Another, ""Arrested Development,"" received a nod for actor Jason Bateman. A third, ""Hemlock Grove,"" got two nominations. See the complete list of nominations . ""House of Cards"" is going up against veterans such as ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Mad Men,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Homeland"" for Emmy's most prestigious award. The series earned nine nominations overall, including lead acting nods for Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. The broadcast networks may want to take notes. Not a single show on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox or the CW was nominated for best drama, though network sitcoms such as ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Modern Family"" and the now-defunct ""30 Rock"" were nominated for best comedy along with HBO's ""Girls"" and ""Veep"" and FX's ""Louie."" It's a trend that's been developing for years, as the broadcast networks have opted for franchising (""NCIS,"" ""CSI,"" ""Law & Order"") and reboots (""Hawaii Five-O"") over the complex, often serialized dramas that the cable networks have used to get publicity and establish a foothold in the medium. Nevertheless, it's surprising that such hits as ""Scandal,"" ""The Good Wife,"" ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Person of Interest"" failed to earn enough support to nudge their way into the category. Original programming was a major gamble for Netflix, which had noticed how people had started ""binge-watching"" shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" -- watching entire seasons of popular series in one or two gulps. The service invested $100 million in ""House of Cards,"" based on a British series from the 1990s. The bet paid off with increased subscriptions and a huge amount of media coverage -- coverage that was multiplied when Netflix decided to put ""Arrested Development"" back into production. Despite its cult following and major critical success, ""Development"" had been canceled after just three seasons on Fox in the early 2000s. (Creator Mitch Hurwitz had famously begged TV audiences to watch his low-rated show after it won a best comedy Emmy in 2004.) Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer said, ""We are overwhelmed with 14 nominations and honored by a warm welcome which corroborates what we have always believed, that great television is great television regardless of where, when and how it is enjoyed."" Of course, ""Arrested Development"" supporters can argue the show still gets no respect. The show didn't get a nomination for best comedy, though star Bateman did get a nod for best actor in a comedy. The show got three nominations overall. ""American Horror Story: Asylum,"" the follow-up to the well-received ""American Horror Story,"" led all programming with 17 nominations, followed by HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" with 16 and ""Saturday Night Live"" with 15. (The HBO movie ""Behind the Candelabra"" also got 15 nominations.) Perennial Emmy leaders ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Mad Men"" also did well, nabbing 13 and 12 nominations, respectively. ""The Amazing Race"" was nominated for best reality competition show for the 11th consecutive year. The show has won the category every year except 2010, when ""Top Chef"" -- also up in the category -- won. ""Behind the Candelabra"" earned nominations for best TV movie or miniseries. Both lead actors, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, earned nominations for their performances as Liberace and Liberace's partner, Scott Thorsen. HBO's ""Phil Spector"" did well, with nominations for stars Al Pacino, Helen Mirren and the film itself. ""Downton Abbey,"" PBS' juggernaut about an early 20th-century group of fraying British aristocrats, earned 12 nominations, including lead actor recognition for Hugh Bonneville and Michelle Dockery. ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" and ""The Colbert Report"" are up for outstanding variety series. ""Honored to be nominated for an Emmy this morning,"" said Jimmy Fallon, who scored a nod for his ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" ""Takes the sting away from being snubbed by the ESPYs last night."" There were a handful of surprises. Vera Farmiga picked up a best actress-drama nomination for ""Bates Motel,"" the A&E series based on characters from ""Psycho."" Betty White -- now 91 and more popular than ever -- received a nomination for hosting her comedy-reality show, ""Betty White's Off Their Rockers."" ""Mad Men's"" Elisabeth Moss was nominated for both that show and the miniseries ""Top of the Lake."" And ""Scandal's"" Kerry Washington -- rising quickly on the chatter of her much-talked-about series -- received a best actress-drama nomination. HBO led all networks with a whopping 108 nominations. NBC and CBS tied for second; both got 53. And Netflix, though down the list, got 14. With the service rolling out more series -- ""Orange Is the New Black"" just got started, and another season of ""House of Cards"" is on the way -- expect many more in the future. The Emmys will be broadcast Sunday, September 22. The show will air on CBS.","Netflix's ""House of Cards"" in Emmy race .

"Lahore, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani city of Lahore is known as the heritage capital of the country. It's scattered with ancient mosques, majestic 16th century mansions and antique minarets. Lahorites are proud of their cultural legacy. It's old, it's timeless but it's changing. In the midst of this old city, a vibrant technological revolution is taking place that is buzzing its presence onto the Internet and beyond. Groups of dynamic young tech entrepreneurs are converging on the city to invent mobile apps that can change the way Pakistan can do business with the rest of the world. Pakistan has 30 million Internet users, that's almost four times the population of New York City. About 15 million Pakistanis are accessing the Internet via their mobile phones opening up a whole new stream of consumer possibilities for savvy business people. Young entrepreneurs like Ali Rehan, 26, are now exploiting this potential. Rehan and his team at Eyedeus Labs has created ""Groopic,"" a new smartphone app that lets you take a group picture -- and put yourself in it. This way, the photographer will also be included in the picture. It's easy to use and it's making waves in the tech world. Rehan told CNN about how the Internet as a medium is a ""paradigm shift for all the companies working in Pakistan."" Citing his company Eyedeus Labs as an example he said: ""We worked on a product online, we launched it online, we marketed it online. We got featured by all these big blogs and we were contacted by smartphone companies."" Picked up by Google, Rehan's team was flown out to Silicon Valley for a mentoring program to develop its product. Now Rehan says that major mobile phone companies like Samsung, Huawei and LG are courting Eyedeus Labs. But they're not the lone rangers in Pakistani tech talent. Companies in the country are making mobile apps for Fortune 500 companies in the United States, said Badar Khushnood, from Google Pakistan. These are companies that had previously been ""very reluctant to come to Pakistan"" because of the security situation, Khushnood said. In the country, both the private and government sectors have come up with financial solutions to provide assistance to gifted young whiz kids who are down on their luck. For example, Plan 9 is a business incubator in a swanky skyscraper in the heart of Lahore. Founded by Dr. Umar Saif and funded by the government, its main goal is to transform young tech talent into budding businesses. ""The world is becoming flat,"" said Saif, vice chancellor at Information Technology University-Punjab. ""The geography, the political situation, the security situation is becoming totally irrelevant in a country like Pakistan."" Thirteen teams at Plan 9 are developing apps and products like ""DrivePal"" - which alerts relatives and emergency services about a car crash and ""iTrak,"" an optic mouse for paraplegics that was inspired by an 18-year-old who lost his limbs and wanted to continue studying. Meanwhile location based app ""LocPro"" adapts your phone's privacy settings depending on where you are. It can even remind you to pick up milk when you walk past the supermarket. The next big app you download on your smartphone may have been made in Pakistan.","Young tech entrepreneurs converge in Lahore to invent new apps .

"(CNN) -- They barely slept. That's the case for an unusual number of black bears in western Nevada, where an abnormally warm and dry winter has spurred them to halt their hibernation and head out for food. ""They may be sleeping under a deck or under a house in a crawlspace, and they will emerge when it is a garbage day and raid some garbage cans and then go back to a sleep for a while,"" explains Chris Healy, a spokesman for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Mother Nature can take credit for these bears' abbreviated slumber. Whereas parts of the Midwest and Northeast are now buried in snow and shivering in cold, that's not the case in many communities around Lake Tahoe and elsewhere. The National Weather Service's forecast for Incline Village, Nevada, for instance, calls for high temperatures heading to or well past 50 degrees for the next week at least, with nary of snow flurry in sight. What's with this weather? Hot is cold and cold is hot . It's not just Nevada: Nearby Northern California is also seeing an abnormal number of black bears, with CNN affiliate KXTV showing images taken from Yosemite National Park and Lake Tahoe's Heavenly Ski Resort. Healy said ""a disastrous winter"" -- adding ""we need the snow"" -- and relatively mild temperatures have thrown off some black bears that live in more settled areas, where they can readily access human garbage. ""We documented this and, in the past 15 years, it occurs sporadically,"" the spokesman said. ""A lot of it is dictated by the weather conditions."" Even in a typical winter, black bears don't hibernate completely as some might think, usually taking a few weeks for their metabolism and body temperature to wind down. They will occasionally wake up, roam a bit, but won't eat, drink, urinate or defecate, according to SierraWild.gov, a cooperative website of the federal U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management that covers the Sierra Nevada mountain range, including Lake Tahoe). Bears in this range typically ""den"" between mid-December into March or the beginning of April, SierraWild.gov notes. This is less than the seven and a half months for some black bears that live in colder climes, but still well beyond what's being seen in parts of Nevada. In the past, ""lighter winters"" have been correlated to ""bigger bears that live among humans in Incline Village in the Lake Tahoe basin,"" notes Healy. But it's not like every black bear is cutting short hibernation and heading out on the town. Healy notes, ""Bears in the backcountry -- truly wild bears -- don't partake in this."" ""They eat nuts and berries and things that are not found in nature right now,"" he said, in contrast to the relatively ever-present trash rummaged through by other bears. ""So they wouldn't wake up to eat, they wouldn't find anything."" It has also been ""unusually warm"" this winter in much of Alaska. But state wildlife official Riley Woodford said that bears coming out of hibernation early hasn't been an issue there yet. That's because the winter started off, around November, normally. Even though it's warmed up, the bears climbed up to 1,000 feet to den in snowy and icy spots that's cold enough to keep them in, he says. Still, the state Department of Fish and Game admits that, hibernating or not, the weather has been weird. It's not even forecast to go below freezing -- even at night -- in Juneau for at least a week. And last week, it was even raining 3,000 feet above sea level in one ski resort around the Alaskan capital, Woodford recalls. Historic California drought forces rancher to thin herd of horses . CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Black bears in the Sierra Nevadas typically ""den"" from December through early spring .

"(CNN) -- Elon Musk wants to revolutionize transportation. Again. The serial entrepreneur envisions a future where mag-lev trains in enormous pneumatic tubes whisk us from Los Angeles to New York in 45 minutes. Need to be in Beijing tomorrow? No problem. It's a two-hour ride away. As crazy as it sounds, Musk is merely updating an idea that's been around since the early 1900s, and at least one company is working on a functional prototype. But according to Wired sources, his involvement won't be nearly as hands-on as Musk's other endeavors at Tesla Motors and SpaceX. The engineering behind the Hyperloop is similar to the old-school pneumatic tube systems used by banks to suck your deposit to the teller at the drive-through. But naturally, it's more complicated than that. A massive vacuum tube — mounted either above ground or even under water — would be combined with a magnetic levitation system used on conventional bullet trains. That means no friction, no wind resistance, no chance of collisions, and insanely high speeds. Musk described the Hyperloop as ""a cross between a Concorde, a railgun and an air hockey table,"" at AllThingsD's D11 conference earlier this year. And in an interview with PandoDaily, Musk said the Hyperloop could form a fifth tent pole of modern transportation, joining cars, planes, trains, and boats, adding that because of its low energy usage and ability to get juice from solar power, it could generate more power than it would consume. Elon Musk: Our future in space depends on reusable rockets . But up until now, he hasn't elaborated on his involvement. Musk's interest in the idea was sparked after researching California's new high-speed rail project and realizing that it will be the slowest and — at $70 billion — the most expensive system on the planet. To his mind, there's a better solution. The Hyperloop is it. And one firm unaffiliated with Musk is in the early stages of development. ET3, a company based in Longmont, Colorado, is working on a Evacuated Tube Transport (ETT) system, which it describes as ""space travel on Earth."" It uses two tubes — one for each direction — with 400-pound, passenger car-sized capsules that could house six people, each accelerated by linear electric motors. According to ET3, state trips would average speeds of around 370 mph, while international trips would hit that insane 4,000 mph mark. The company, which calls itself an ""open consortium,"" claims that it's working with partners in China and has sold nearly 100 licenses for the technology. But ET3′s claims pose more questions than answers, particularly when considering you can buy your own license for the bargain basement price of $100. But the idea for a vacuum-sealed high-speed transit system isn't anything new. The ""vactrain"" concept was floated in the early 1910s and a paper written by physicist R.M. Salter and published by the Rand Corporation in 1972 titled the ""Very High Speed Transit System,"" or VHST, describes something very similar to what ET3 is developing. But where Musk fits in remains a question. Sources close to the Tesla co-founder and CEO say he believes ET3 is on the right track, but is missing some key components, and that Musk has his hands full with Tesla and SpaceX, and would rather have some involvement in the development, with another entity taking the helm. That lines up with a few responses Musk made on Twitter when asked about patenting the technology. ""I really hate patents unless critical to company survival,"" Musk tweeted. ""Will publish Hyperloop as open source."" When asked about partners, Musk said he's ""happy to work with the right partners. Must truly share philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & w/o wasting money on BS."" We'll have to wait until August 12th to find out more.

"Washington (CNN) -- The abortion issue is far from settled. It's just as contentious today as it has ever been in the United States. Wednesday's 41st anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which upheld legalized abortion before about 24 weeks, ignited the polarized, emotional battle. What's happening? In sum, the Pope tweeted, thousands gathered, politicians pontificated. Anti-abortion activists have a bigger megaphone as it has come to remember the day they say the unborn lost their rights. Thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the National Mall in the annual ""March for Life"" rally that drew buses of activists. This year they braved the snow that fell Tuesday and below freezing temperatures that followed. Pope Francis showed his solidarity, tweeting ""I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable."" Politicians sent releases, including Sen. Ted Cruz. ""Every human life is a precious gift from God, and our law should protect innocent human life,"" the Texas Republican said. What's changed? In the abortion debate, each side tries to out maneuver the other. But the game is becoming more intense, complicated and consuming. Opinion: Why progressives should be pro-life . Both sides are working at the local, state and federal level to pass laws. Obviously the anti-choice advocates want laws that restrict access to abortion while pro-choice proponents are working for measures that increase access to abortion care and options. Both sides are focusing on the court system, too, working to place judges that have a tremendous amount of clout in shutting down or allowing abortion-related laws. Who's winning? The answer is not so cut and dry, but last year was a big year for anti-choice advocates. Even the president of one of the largest women's rights groups admitted that the anti-choice side made some inroads. ""Things are in a crisis,"" Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said. ""The number of bills that have moved in the state legislature are definitely concerning."" According to the group, 24 states adopted 53 anti-choice measures in 2013, including one in North Dakota that outlaws abortion as early as six weeks of gestation. Effectively outlawing abortion as many women don't know they are pregnant at six weeks. On the flip side, 10 states have adopted only 16 pro-choice measures, mostly involving access to care and contraception. What's Congress doing about it? Not much. But efforts are in motion. After Republicans gained the majority in the House in 2010, they have been working to roll back access to abortion. Republican lawmakers launched a comprehensive attack on Planned Parenthood, women's health clinics that provide abortion services, working to cut their federal funding. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, caused major debates over abortion as opponents said it allows federal funding to be used for abortion services or providers who offer them. Supporters disagree as Democrats agreed to tighten language. The House passed the ""Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act"" that restricts abortions at 20 weeks, citing evidence that fetus feel pain at that time. But the measure is stalled in the Senate and President Barack Obama has vowed to veto it should it reach his desk. Obama to visit Pope Francis in March . Does politics have anything to do with it? Everything. While it won't make a campaign, it can surely break it. The Republican National Committee, which is holding its annual conference this week, put its events on hold and encouraged members to attend the ""March for Life"" rally. Abortion is a key topic of this year's meeting as a coalition of RNC members are introducing a resolution that encourages Republican candidates to ""support Republican pro-life candidates who fight back against Democratic deceptive 'war on women' rhetoric by pointing out the extreme positions on abortion held by Democratic opponents."" First on CNN: GOP urges candidates to stand ground on abortion . It spurred Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' campaign. The issue launched her to political notoriety after she mounted a filibuster in the Texas legislature opposing restrictive abortion measures. But since she launched her candidacy, she's had to talk about a lot more than the abortion. Democrats are willing to highlight the issue when it frames Republican positions on abortion as extreme. ""Last year, the GOP said they needed to reach out to women, but instead they've decided their plan is to spend more time fighting to restrict the rights of women to make their own health care choices,"" Democratic National Committee chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. Rarely do candidates run on the issue and win. But the issue can doom candidates who make controversial remarks. In 2012, Missouri Senate hopeful Todd Akin's campaign took a nose dive after the Republican, who opposes abortion in all circumstances, made incendiary remarks. Democrats have worked to optimize Republican stances on abortion. They say the Republicans have launched a ""war on women"" and pounded the issue in campaign ads and stump speeches. Do people care? Yes and no. While it's a topic that evokes strong opinions, it's unlikely that people will pick a candidate solely on the issue. According to a May CNN poll, 25% of people thought abortion should be legal in all circumstances compared to 20% thought it should be legal in no situation. A Gallup Poll released last week found that respondents thought abortion was one of the least important issues that the government address. It came in 17 out of 19 topics. What's next? The Supreme Court is hearing three cases involving the issue, including McCullen v. Coakley, which challenges the buffer zone law in Massachusetts that creates a safe space around reproductive health care facilities. And there's also the Hobby Lobby case, which will be heard this spring. The chain store has asked the court to exempt it from providing contraception and ""abortion-inducing drug"" health coverage to their workers, which is required under the Affordable Care Act. And lawmakers will continue the battle around the country.","This week is the 41st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision .

"(CNN) -- The combination of a gun and a surprise gone wrong left a beloved 18-year-old track star dead, authorities in Longmont, Colorado, say. The incident happened Friday when Premila Lal and her 12-year-old cousin decided to play a joke on Nerrek Galley, a close family friend, according to Lal's father. The Lal family had recently moved, and Galley had been keeping an eye on the recently vacated home. Lal and her cousin snuck into the house just before 8 p.m. unbeknownst to Galley, who was playing video games with Premila's 15-year-old brother, Pranil. Galley and Pranil heard a noise and went to check it out, the brother told CNN affiliate KUSA on Sunday. ""We thought maybe there was an intruder in the house and maybe some people knew we moved, and they were coming to check if we got everything so we started clearing the house,"" Pranil told KUSA. But the intruder turned out to be Premila, who jumped out of a closet as a harmless joke, according to her family. ""The door opened and she kind of, like, screamed and then Nerrek pulled the trigger,"" her 12-year-old cousin told KUSA. Authorities say the family's description of what happened is consistent with their investigation. ""All the witnesses had consistent statements,"" Commander Jeffrey Satur of the Longmont Police Department told CNN Sunday. A neighbor told CNN's affiliate KDVR that she saw the group rush out of the home, screaming. Lal was admitted to a hospital and was pronounced dead about an hour later. Galley is being held on charges of reckless endangerment, child abuse and providing a gun to a juvenile because Lal's 15-year-old brother had access to the gun, police say. So far Galley has not been charged in Lal's killing. A court hearing was scheduled for Monday. ""We lost a daughter, so we don't want anybody else to lose their son, you know, especially when it was accident,"" Premila's father, Praveen Lal, told Denver TV station KCNC. Galley's attorney was not available for comment Monday. No public statement has been made on his behalf. Pranil told KUSA that Galley ""is devastated right now."" Police said they do not suspect the involvement of alcohol or drugs. The teen's death was ""unintended and extremely tragic,"" police said in a statement. Lal was honored at a weekend cross country meet at her alma mater, KDVR reported. Her family described her as an athlete, popular girl and strong student. Longmont is a former farming community at the foothills of the Rockies. More recently, the community of just under 90,000 has developed high-tech jobs. The town was already stunned by a murder-suicide a day earlier. An 80-year-old man shot his 72-year-old wife before killing himself, police say. Before last week, Satur said, he can't remember when the last shooting was. ""It's been a tough weekend.""

"(CNN) -- The time was always going to come when society would need to face the pointy end of the voluntary euthanasia debate: Those hard cases that would challenge most people's support for the issue, the cases and circumstances which constitute never-before trodden ground. While in most Western countries polls repeatedly show strong community support for a terminally ill person's right to obtain medical assistance to die, the results would likely be quite different if the person involved was not an adult, was not of sound mind or was not, in the strictest sense, terminally ill. As Belgium decides whether to extend the right to euthanasia to those who have Alzheimer's and to children, the sharp end of the debate is staring us all in the face, regardless of where we live. The euthanasia argument is about to escalate to heights unknown: We will all be challenged about how to have a good debate, a rational debate as members of the human race, and in being challenged, we must guard against the moral panic that this issue will inevitably throw up. The issues on the table are too important for hysterical indignation and fundamental religious dogma. We are all grown-ups. The debate we are set to have -- some two decades after the world's first right to die law was passed in Australia's Northern Territory -- should be grown-up too, even if some of the stakeholders we are about to discuss are not. Historically, children and people with Alzheimer's are two segments of the community that have been viewed as having little or no agency, something that is referred to as 'capacity' in legal terms. Generally speaking, neither group has been held to be competent to make decisions that would be in their best interests. Yet this is what the Belgians are now planning. The opposite view: Euthanasia - we can live without it... For many in the ageing population, there are few fears which top that of getting dementia. Anyone who has watched a loved family member sink into the abyss of confusion and disorientation will know the utter terror that can accompany the process, as the person in question tries to juxtapose moments of clarity with the awfulness of knowing one's grip on reality -- and with it one's dignity and sense of self -- is slipping. In New Zealand earlier this year, the Labor Member of Parliament Maryan Street paved the way with her private members bill which, if passed, would allow New Zealanders to include an assisted suicide in their Living Will. For those who may find themselves with Alzheimer's in future, this inclusion would be a valuable pre-planning tool: ""If I do get dementia, at least the children will know what I want. I can now rest assured that my wishes not to live ""like that"" will be respected."" Within the membership of Exit International, this is a common sentiment. So too is the wish not to waste government money keeping the demented elderly alive in the nation's care homes if that is not how, when they could communicate, they said they wanted to spend their last days. On the topic of children, the debate is a little easier. Some children do develop terminal illnesses and do die well before their time. It is not impossible for such young people to have a well-developed sense of their own mortality. While the Belgians will likely structure legislative developments in this area with stringent safeguards, it is the practice of forcing terminally-ill children to battle on in spite of an appalling prognosis, trying to make it to 18, that is driving the agenda. For both groups, the Belgians are bravely tackling difficulties emerging in their existing legislation, current laws that are quite obviously inadequate, even cruel, in certain circumstances. Unless modern medicine has a cure for Alzheimer's and any number of the terminal illnesses that confront children, the current situation is that they will keep suffering. If suffering cannot be relieved, the question then becomes: what should the State do? Should we all be forced to live on regardless of the quality of life that confronts us? Or, should legislation be extended to ensure dignity and choice for all? At Exit International our motto is ""a peaceful death is everybody's right."" Somehow the tagline ""a peaceful death is everybody's right unless you are a child or a teenager or have dementia, in which case tough luck!"" doesn't have the same appeal or the same logic. The Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking and acting -- in the cold light of day, the morality of their intentions is not that challenging when the alternatives are considered. As a son to my aged mother and as a grandfather to my son's three boys, I welcome the type of society that the Belgians are proposing. Of course, I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws. But I draw great comfort from knowing they are there all the same. The opposite view: Euthanasia - we can live without it... Interactive: Euthanasia and the right to die around the world .

"Washington (CNN) -- 45 years ago, while on patrol in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, Dennis Joyner was suddenly faced with his own mortality. He never heard the explosion that destroyed his legs and left arm, but be clearly saw what had happened to his body. ""Let me die"" -- was his immediate reaction. But it was his sergeant who reminded him of his family and all he had to live for. On Sunday in Washington, Joyner was able to thank Sgt. Ed Reynolds as he looked out on the only memorial to honor the living disabled veterans of America's wars. The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, located just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, was dedicated Sunday in a ceremony that focused on life after war and the many sacrifices disabled veterans still make. President Obama spoke at the ceremony of the cost of war and the painful legacy it leaves behind. ""Each of you endured a moment that shaped the arc of your lives and that speaks to our debt as a nation,"" Obama said. ""It was the moment that binds each of you forever, that moment of realization that life would not be the same."" Joyner, who served in the 9th Infantry Division, was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for his service. While recovering, and learning how to function in his new body, Joyner worried about how his family would react. ""I can't image the fear, the terror, that must have been in my family's hearts and minds that day they received a telegram explaining the severity of my injuries,"" Joyner told the audience at the memorial's dedication. ""Trying to think of what to say seeing me for the first time, minus three limbs."" The memorial was designed as a space for disabled veterans and those they love to find quiet reflection. A ceremonial flame hovers over a reflecting pool, surrounded by granite and glass walls and a grove of trees. ""What we gave, what our families gave, and what we continue to give, will be forever remembered here in our nation's capital,"" Joyner said Sunday. ""We are not unique in our story, we are just one example of the thousands of lives affected by the lifelong disabilities that are the terrifying consequences of war."" Those consequences weigh heavily on the recent maneuvering of U.S. military operations in the fight against terrorist group ISIS. The President's refusal to send ground troops to the Middle East was echoed in his comments Sunday. ""Let's never rush into war, because it is America's sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives,"" he said. ""Let us only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary. And if we do, let's always give them the strategy, the mission and the support that they need to get the job done."" Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald and veterans advocate and actor Gary Sinise -- who played the character of Lt. Dan in the movie ""Forrest Gump"" -- also spoke at the ceremony. A long journey . Lois Pope was visiting the Vietnam War memorial when she was first struck by the need for a special place to honor disabled veterans. Pope saw a veteran in a wheelchair struggling to lay flowers on another veteran's grave. ""That was the catalyst that sent me on this 16-year quest to build this memorial so that our nations disabled veterans could earn the respect and the recognition that they so deserve,"" Pope said. In 1998 Pope joined forces with Art Wilson, who was the national adjutant for Disabled American Veterans at the time. The two worked with former VA Secretary Jesse Brown to make the memorial a reality. ""Until this day, this very day, we have not remembered those who lived and whose lives were forever changed by the sacrifices they made in uniform,"" Wilson said at the ceremony. ""Without their stories and the experience of their loved ones, we as a people cannot know the cost of war."" 9 simple ways you can help veterans . Life after battle . For disabled veterans, the end of active military service is not the end of the battle, said Pope. ""The cost of war does not end when guns are silenced, for every day disabled veterans continue to battle with their physical and mental disabilities."" Obama also underscored that not all veterans' injuries are visible. ""No matter what war you served in -- and whether they called it 'shell shock' or 'battle fatigue' or the '1,000-yard stare' or post-traumatic stress -- you know that the unseen wounds of war are just as real as any other, and they can hurt just as much, if not more."" ""You are not alone"" Although the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has recently admitted to mismanaging the care of veterans, the President emphasized the government's responsibility to provide care and support. ""When our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery, we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit, every single bit of care that they have earned, that they deserve,"" he said. Obama also spoke of the responsibility ordinary citizens have to honor the sacrifice that veterans have made. ""If they're hurting and don't know if they can go on, we need to say loud and clear, as family and friends, as neighbors and coworkers, as fellow citizens, and as a nation: You are not alone,"" Obama said. ""If you're an American, and you see a veteran -- maybe with a prosthetic arm or leg, maybe burns on their face -- don't ever look away,"" he said. ""Do not turn away. You go up and you reach out, and you shake their hand, and you look them in the eye and you say those words every veteran should hear all the time: 'Welcome home, thank you. We need you more than ever. You help us stay strong, you help us stay free.'""","The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial was dedicated Sunday in Washington .

"Bonne Terre, Missouri (CNN) -- Joseph Paul Franklin is unblinking and empty as he talks about his victims. Do you know how many people you murdered? ""I'd rather not mention it,"" he says flatly. By my count, it's 22 people.  ""That's approximately it."" And those two young boys, just 13, 14 years old. ""Yeah, I regret the fact that I shot them now,"" he replies. Franklin has been away from the civilized world for more than 30 years, serving several life sentences behind bars. We're meeting at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri, where he is on death row. States scramble for lethal injection drugs . A glass partition separates us, and we're speaking via a closed line telephone. The prison guard has put a wireless microphone on Franklin, who is shackled at the ankles, his wrists cuffed to the chain around his waist. Franklin's hair is wild and alive, unlike his expressionless answers when he speaks about his murder victims. This is one of the last interviews this serial killer will give. ""I felt like I was at war. The survival of the white race was at stake,"" he says. Franklin compares himself to a U.S. soldier in Vietnam, trained to be a sniper in the war. The enemy, he explains, were Jews, blacks and especially interracial couples. ""I consider it my mission, my three-year mission. Same length of time Jesus was on his mission, from the time he was 30 to 33."" What was your mission? ""To get a race war started."" Franklin spent 1977 to 1980 trying to accomplish that goal, committing more than a dozen bank robberies in addition to the murders. He stalked his victims, usually finding a sniper's nest yards away, looking down the scope of a high-powered rifle to kill his targets at will. Alaska serial killer may have killed missing woman . Finding comfort in 'Mein Kampf' He explains his hate was bred from his origins and upbringing. Franklin's birth name was James Clayton Vaughn and he was born in Mobile, Alabama. He grew up in poverty and lived a childhood of abuse, he says. ""My momma didn't care about us,"" he explains, saying it affected him emotionally and stunted his mental development. He says he was locked up and not allowed to play with other children. He claims he was fed such a poor diet that it affected his development. ""I've always been least 10 years or more behind other people in their maturity,"" he says. Young man linked to 79 killings in Mexico . He found a family and comfort in the white supremacy groups of the American South in the 1960s. Hitler's autobiographical manifesto, ""Mein Kampf,"" moved him from hate to action. ""I had this real strange feeling in my mind,"" he says. ""I've never felt that way about any other book that I read. It was something weird about that book."" At 26, he changed his name to Joseph Paul Franklin. Joseph Paul in honor of Paul Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of propaganda, and Franklin after Benjamin Franklin. He tattooed the grim reaper into his right forearm as a ""symbol of my mission,"" he explains. He shows it to me, the ink now faded green blue, the image blurry and difficult to see. ""It used to be blood there, red dots falling from it,"" he points out. Franklin explains he asked the tattoo artist to draw the words ""Helter Skelter"" on his other arm in red, with blood dripping down. Helter Skelter references '60s serial killer Charles Manson and his desire to start a race war from California. The tattoo artist refused, Franklin said, worried about law enforcement reprisal. Franklin says he was obsessed with killing by example. ""I figured once I started doing it and showed them how, other white supremacists would do the same thing."" Do you think you're a hero to those hate groups? ""Well that's what they tell me,"" he says, finally laughing. ""I'd rather people like me than not like me, like most people. I'd rather be loved than hated."" Even if they are hate groups? ""Yeah, and they're not the only ones who love me, though. There a lot of Jews who love me, too."" It's a preposterous notion, but I can't resist delving further. Why do the Jews love you? ""When you commit a crime against a certain group of people, a bonding takes place. It seems like you belong to them,"" he says. Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers . The crime that put him on death row . Franklin is talking about the crime that put him on Missouri's death row, the murder of Gerald Gordon. On October 8, 1977, Franklin was outside the Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue in St. Louis. Some 200 guests were leaving a bar mitzvah. Franklin had hammered 10-inch nails into a telephone pole to use as a makeshift gun rest for his hunting rifle. As the guests were leaving the synagogue, Franklin fired, killing Gordon in front of his wife and three children. There would be other victims across the country. Franklin was convicted of killing Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwean in Madison, Wisconsin, merely because they were an interracial couple. Franklin confessed to police that college student Rebecca Bergstrom enraged him because she said on spring break, she once dated a Jamaican man. He shot her dead. In Cincinnati, Franklin had been lying in wait for an interracial couple but 13-year-old Dante Evans and his cousin 14-year-old Darrell Lane came walking down the road. Franklin shot them both from his sniper's nest, striking them twice to make sure the boys were dead. Joseph Deters, who prosecuted the Cincinnati case said of Franklin, ""He's just a creep. There's no other way to describe him. And what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible."" Franklin also wanted to strike high-profile targets, stalking civil rights leader Vernon Jordan Jr. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, Franklin sat outside Jordan's hotel and waited. As Jordan returned from an event, Franklin shot him. Jordan was seriously injured but was not killed. Death row diary offers rare glimpse into a morbid world . Sickened by Hustler and out for Larry Flynt . But Franklin hoped one of his biggest trophy killings would be Larry Flynt, publisher and founder of Hustler magazine. Flynt's crime according to Franklin? ""I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,"" he says. Franklin is referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler that featured several photos of a black man with a white woman. ""It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy."" On March 6, 1978, Franklin was almost successful. Flynt was in Lawrenceville, Georgia, facing charges of obscenity. As he returned to the courthouse, two shots struck Flynt. Flynt would barely survive, and he was paralyzed from the waist down. In a strange turn, Larry Flynt has filed a last-minute legal motion with the American Civil Liberties Union to halt Franklin's impending execution. Do not confuse this with mercy, Flynt explained to me days before I would meet with Franklin. ""The government has no business at all being in the business of killing people,"" he said. Flynt is strongly anti-death penalty, pointing out the inmates on death row are ""minorities and underprivileged people, not wealthy white kids."" Flynt believes it's ""much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection."" Flynt said he never thinks of Franklin or cares about him, it is merely on principle the publisher is fighting to spare his life. When I bring up Flynt to Franklin, he breaks into a smile. ""My old pal Larry!"" he exclaims. ""Tell him I appreciate that. Thanks."" He disagrees with Flynt, though, that the death penalty is less punishment than life in prison. After 15 years on death row, freedom . 'I'm willing to accept the will of the Lord' ""It's just not a system that operates according to the Bible. The scriptures tell us when someone repents, God forgives them. Everything is forgotten, once forgiven. But the state doesn't think that way,"" he says. Franklin says he's no longer dangerous nor a racist. Do you feel any hate looking at me? I'm not white. ""I have no feeling whatsoever, no hatred to you. Especially not a female. You know what I mean?"" But you shot plenty of women. ""That's true,"" he nods, ""you got a point. But I felt they were enemies of the white race."" He's different now, he says, after poring through reams of books in prison. He's ""cured his mental illness through education,"" he claims. Do you think something lies out there for you on the other side? ""Yeah, but it's not a burning hell because I'm serving the Lord, though. It'll be the kingdom of heaven for me because I've repented."" I think we're just about out of time. ""Well let's not say that. Let's just say we're gonna part temporarily."" Time is important to you now, isn't it? ""Yeah it has been for a long time now. Maybe we'll meet again sometime."" Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Anyone who's ever read a nutrition label knows that our food supply is full of hard-to-pronounce chemicals. Most are generally recognized as safe, as the Food and Drug Administration likes to say, but a few have given scientists cause for concern. Azodicarbonamide, for instance. Subway announced last week that it would be removing the controversial chemical from its bread. Generally used for strengthening dough, azodicarbonamide is also found in yoga mats and shoe soles, according to the Centers for Science in the Public Interest. One of the breakdown products is a recognized carcinogen. Though Subway is going to remove azodicarbonamide, there's a long list of other chemicals used in its bread: calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, DATEM, sodium stearoyl lactylate, potassium iodate and ascorbic acid, according to the restaurant's website (PDF). And Subway certainly isn't alone. What other chemical additives are commonly found in your food? Here are seven, picked at random as good practice for the upcoming CNN Spelling Bee (just kidding). 1.

When Kraft announced last year that it would be removing Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) and No. 6 from certain varieties of its Macaroni & Cheese products, advocates rejoiced. Blue 1, Green 3, Red 40 and others have been loosely linked to everything from hyperactivity in children to cancer in lab animals. Generally found in candy, beverages and baked goods, color additives are also used in cosmetics. But you knew that, right? Did you also know about the ground-up insects in your drinks? Cochineal extract is an approved artificial dye derived from a small bug that lives on cactus plants in Mexico and South America. As long as you're not allergic, you're safe to drink up, according to the Centers for Science in the Public Interest. Mmmm ... 2. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) Well, that's a mouthful. BHA is used to preserve some cereals, chewing gum and potato chips, according to the centers. It's also used in rubber and petroleum products. Butylated hydroxyanisole is ""reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,"" according to the National Institutes of Health (PDF), because of animal studies that have shown that the chemical can cause tumors in rats' and hamsters' forestomachs (something humans don't have) and fish livers. 3. Propyl gallate . Propyl gallate is often used in conjunction with BHA and a chemical called butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT. These antioxidant preservatives protect oily products from oxidation, which would otherwise cause them to go bad. Propyl gallate can be found in mayonnaise, dried meats, chicken soup and gum, as well as hair-grooming products and adhesives. Some scientists believe that propyl gallate is an ""endocrine disruptor (PDF),"" meaning it can interfere with humans' hormones. Endocrine disruptors can lead to developmental, reproductive and/or neurological problems, according to the National Institutes of Health, including fertility issues and an increased risk of some cancers. But the link between propyl gallate and the endocrine system needs to be studied further. 4. Sodium nitrite . Sodium nitrite is most often used in the preservation and coloring of meats, such as bacon, ham, hot dogs, lunch meat and smoked fish. Without it, these products would look gray instead of red. Sodium nitrite is also found naturally in many vegetables, including beets, celery, radishes and lettuce. But the nitrite found in vegetables comes with ascorbic acid, which prevents our bodies from turning nitrite into nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are considered potentially carcinogenic to humans. So some companies are adding ascorbic acid to their meat products to inhibit nitrosamine formation, according to the Centers for Science in the Public Interest. However, the American Meat Institute points out the National Toxicology Program conducted a multi-year review in which rats and mice were fed high levels of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water, and a panel reviewed the findings and concluded that nitrite is safe at the levels used and not a carcinogen. 5. TBHQ (tert-Butylhydroquinone) This chemical preservative is a form of butane that is used in crackers, potato chips and some fast food. It can also be found in varnish, lacquer and resin. It helps prolong the shelf life of food and, if it's consumed at low levels, is considered safe. In higher doses -- above what the FDA says manufactures can use in food prep -- TBHQ has been found to cause ""nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, delirium, a sense of suffocation, and collapse,"" according to ""A Consumer's Dictionary of Food Additives."" It may also cause restlessness and vision problems. 6. Silicon dioxide, silica and calcium silicate . Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is a naturally occurring material (PDF) made up of shells of tiny single-celled algae. You might also recognize it as sand, the kind that gets stuck in your suit at the beach. Silicon dioxide is used in dry coffee creamer, dried soups and other powdery foods. It is also used as an insect repellent, removing the oily film that covers an insect's body, causing them to dry out and die. The EPA concluded that the human health risk is low and ""not unreasonable."" In rat studies, high-dose exposure has caused some lung problems. Another study of Chinese workers who were heavily exposed to the chemical showed a disproportionate number of deaths related to respiratory diseases, lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Silicon dioxide has also been associated with the risk of developing autoimmune diseases -- again only after heavy exposure. 7. Triacetin (glycerol triacetate) Triacetin, also known as glyceryl triacetate, has been approved and generally recognized as safe by the FDA as a food additive. In food, it is used as a plasticizer for chewing gum and gummy candy. It can be used to keep food from drying out and in some cookies, muffins and cakes. It is also used in perfume, cosmetics and cigarette filters and in drugs like Viagra.","Subway is removing azodicarbonamide from its bread; other chemicals remain .

"(CNN) -- A transgender rights advocacy group says the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles restricted a teen's free speech rights by asking him to remove his makeup for a driver's license photo. Sixteen-year-old Chase Culpepper went to take his driver's test in Anderson in March. Chase considers himself ""gender non-conforming,"" he told CNN affiliate WYFF. He regularly wears makeup and girl's clothes. After passing his driver's test, Chase went to take his photo for his license. But an employee at the office asked him to remove his makeup. The employee told Chase he couldn't wear ""a disguise"" and didn't look ""like a boy should,"" the teen told the affiliate. CNN reached out to the state DMV and was told it had a policy specifying the requirements for the photograph. ""At no time will an applicant be photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or her appearance so that the photo would misrepresent his or her identity,"" the policy says. ""That's been the policy since August of 2009,"" spokeswoman Beth Park said. ""Stage makeup is not acceptable because it can be used to alter appearance. Regular everyday makeup is accepted because it's used to highlight or hide blemishes,"" she said. The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund is now asking that the DMV allow Chase to retake his photo. ""His freedom to express his gender should not be restricted by the DMV staff,"" the fund's executive director, Michael Silverman, said. ""He is entitled to be who he is and to express that without interference from government actors."" Transgender first-grader wins the right to use girls' restroom .

"(CNN) -- ""It was like taking a big leap of faith."" That's how Regina Agyare describes her decision back in 2012 to leave her well-paid job at a major international bank in Ghana's capital Accra to follow her dream and embark on her own entrepreneurial journey. Having worked for six years as the bank's only female IT specialist, Agyare quit everything to create Soronko Solutions, a software development company. ""My friends thought I was crazy,"" recalls Agyare. ""But I was like, 'this is it!'"" One of Ghana's first female tech entrepreneurs, Agyare had to overcome many challenges in starting her business -- beginning with breaking the gender barrier in her country. ""As an African woman, the role is you go to school, you get a job, you marry,"" says Agyare, whose startup is now building corporate websites and e-commerce portals for more than 30 businesses in Accra. ""Entrepreneurship is not something that you are taught so I never saw myself as an entrepreneur."" Last summer, out of a passion to pass on her expertise, Agyare co-founded ""Tech Needs Girls,"" a mentorship and educational initiative aiming to encourage young women to pursue a career in technology. Along with other female computer scientists, she makes time to visit places like Nima, a slum right in the heart of Accra, to teach girls how to code and develop mobile and web applications. CNN's African Start-Up caught up with Agyare to talk about her initiative and discuss the reasons why there should be more women in technology. Here's what she said. Improving technical innovation: ""Currently we are missing out on valuable perspectives that 50% of the population can bring to designing the technology of the future. Research shows that diversity improves problem solving, productivity, innovation and ultimately the bottom line -- we need the female perspective in technology."" Reducing social inequalities: ""Computing jobs are among the fastest growing and the highest paying, yet few women are benefiting from these occupations. This trend increases social inequalities and barriers to girls' future life opportunities. Girls need to have technology skills in order to thrive in the 21st century as more than 95% of all jobs have a digital component."" Teaching girls leadership skills and critical thinking: ""By learning to create technology girls learn to speak up since they have to explain their work; they must stand tall in order to be taken seriously in this male-dominated field. The process of writing software is essentially solving a problem using critical thinking and a series of steps. The girls also get to express their creativity through their software designs."" Stopping the workforce exit: ""More than half (56%) of women in technology leave their employers at the mid-level point in their careers (10-20 years). Some describe themselves as lone wolves. Personally I found technology to be very lonely since I was always the only female in the IT department."" The numbers say it all: ""In the United States, women hold less than 25% of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs. In the UK, women now make up 46% of the country's workforce, but hold only 15.5% of the STEM jobs -- this excludes medicine, which has a high representation of women. Each year the number of women studying and pursuing careers in technology goes down by 0.5% thus by 2043 at the current trend less than 1% of the global tech workforce will be female.""

"(CNN) -- Mary Lee has logged more than 16,000 miles in the past two years. She's been to Florida, Bermuda and Cape Cod. She's not a beach bum, though. Mary Lee is a 3,456-pound great white shark. You wouldn't want to run into her in the surf, but you can follow her on Twitter and track her movements online. She's one of five great white sharks along the East Coast of the United States that is actively ""pinging"" her location via satellite transmitter. An online map tracks the sharks' courses as they go, so you can see nearly real-time data. But there's no coast-is-clear guarantee for fearful late-summer swimmers. The trackers only ping when the animals surface, and sharks don't have to surface to breathe. And of course there are more than five out there. So, if the recent shark-kayaker encounter or shark sightings in Massachusetts have you worried, your best bet is to look at the stats, shark trackers say. And use common sense. ""Don't go play with the seals in the water at dawn or dusk. Other than that, enjoy life, go swimming. Because if you're worried about a shark interaction, you should be scared to death to get in the car,"" says Chris Fischer, founder and expedition leader of Ocearch, the research and educational nonprofit that tagged and tracks Mary Lee and other sharks. In 2013, there were 72 shark attacks worldwide, according to the International Shark Attack File. Of those, 10 were fatal. There were 47 attacks in the United States in 2013, with one fatality in Hawaii. Compare that with more than 33,000 fatal vehicle crashes in the United States in 2012, the last full year for which figures are available. In the first half of 2013, more than 15,000 motor vehicle traffic fatalities are estimated, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ""If you're the kind of person who's scared of sharks and wants to know if there's one around you, there's no technology for that,"" says Gregory Skomal, a biologist with Massachusetts' Division of Marine Fisheries who has tagged sharks with Ocearch. Still, the GPS transmitters with wet-dry switches that are activated when the sharks surface provide a pretty interesting picture. On Ocearch's online tracker you can see each shark's tangle of pings over several years, tracing their movements over thousands of miles. Skomal has been researching sharks for more than 25 years and has teamed up with Fischer and Ocearch three times in the past few years to tag great whites along the East Coast. He's tracking Mary Lee, Lydia, Katharine, Genie and Betsy. Lydia is a real world traveler. ""Lydia is an exciting shark. Lydia makes it look like Mary Lee is a real homebody,"" Skomal said. Lydia was tagged in March 2013 and has already logged more than 25,000 miles. Over the last six years, Skomal has tagged more than 40 great white sharks using various tracking devices. The five tagged with Ocearch provide real-time tracking, while other trackers offer data after they detach from the shark. Fischer, who is not a biologist, has led more than 20 research expeditions with scientists around the world since 2007, tagging about 80 great white sharks in total. Ocearch gathers data and tags sharks and other marine predators by taking them out of the water for about 15 minutes using a custom lift. That ability to lift sharks weighing thousands of pounds out of the water to attach tags that track their movements in real-time is what distinguishes Ocearch, Skomal says. Some of the sharks also have Twitter accounts. ""Every time a shark decides to set up its own Twitter account, it's not really up to us. We don't decide that,"" says Fischer. It's a personality thing, he joked. Mary Lee tweets occasionally, while Katharine, who's in her late teens, is a ""chatterbox"" with more than 16,000 followers. The real identity of the tweeters is a mystery. ""People were inspired to give these sharks voices, and we don't know who they are,"" Fischer said. Fischer credits the publicly shared shark tracker and the power of social media with helping to change the tone of the conversation around sharks. After all, they're king of the sea, and the marine ecosystem depends on them. One-ton shark headed to Texas coast .

"(CNN) -- Ask teens the object of social media, and they'll all tell you the same thing: to get ""likes."" Whether on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Tumblr, young users understand the coin of this realm, and are more than happy to do what is necessary to accumulate it. But is the currency value neutral, or does it come with an agenda of its own? Living for likes makes a teen's social career a whole lot easier, in some respects. Now there's a number letting kids know how popular they are, how well a photo is resonating with their friends, or whether their video stands a chance of vaulting them into the professional world of singing, skateboarding or twerking. What they may not understand, however, is that this game of likes is not taking place on a level playing field. It was constructed by companies whose multibillion-dollar stock valuations are depending on little more than generating traffic -- more likes, follows and favorites -- and then selling the data that can be gleaned from it. In a sense, major parts of our economy (or at least the inflated valuations on the NASDAQ exchange) are now depending on the social media activity of kids. I'm not sure that's a pressure worth putting on them. On the surface, it all looks pretty empowering. For the MTV generation, changing the channel via remote control was about as interactive as mainstream media got -- and that only brought a kid from one corporate media conglomerate's commercial programming to another's. Clearly, the social media universe, with its countless Facebook pages, YouTube channels, Twitter feeds and Instagram photos, offers a whole lot more choice. Instead of watching a TV channel, today's teens get to watch each other. That in itself amounts to power, freedom and agency, right? Maybe. For while all these clicks and keystrokes and photos and videos may be free, they come with a price. Kids aren't paying with money, but with their attention and their hours of meticulous profile tweaking. They're paying with their likes, their favorites, and their follows. And they get paid back with a new path to popularity or even fame. Sometimes, the exchange is explicit. Brands from soft drinks to automobiles ask kids to like an ad or promotion, all for the chance to be liked back or re-tweeted by the brand to its millions of followers. The teen gets more of those coveted likes. The companies get a real-time portrait of their potential customers and influencers, as well as all their friends. And this isn't just some virtual game. Likes really do matter out here in the real world, too. New musicians and new writers alike must demonstrate that they have social media followings in order to find distribution and sponsors. A new kind of talent agency, The Audience, has arisen to help young up-and-comers cultivate a social media presence, and then sell that network of followers to the appropriate advertisers. It's actually a science. Thanks to the immense data pools created by social media users, a firm like The Audience can find the overlaps between fans of a certain pop star and those who have interacted with particular brands. That little venn diagram is marketer's gold. And, to be fair, The Audience is helping young musicians build careers in a landscape where there are no record labels left willing to develop talent -- and no one buying music, anymore, anyway. By pairing talent with sponsors, The Audience creates a new revenue stream for artists, or at least the ones with the most viewed selfies. But it does create an oddly circular culture: Kids develop social media audiences in order to become ""stars,"" which really just means having enough social media followers to sell out to a brand for sponsorship. Perhaps more amazingly, none of them seem to mind. When I asked kids what they thought about ""selling out"" for my PBS documentary on social media, none of them could even tell me what ""selling out"" meant. They thought it had something to do with there not being any tickets left for a concert. The language barrier aside, young social media users today draw no distinction between art and commerce, culture and advertising. While kids engaged with social media have the ability to express themselves and their values to pretty much the rest of the developed world, they seem unaware of the extent to which these platforms shape the values they choose to express. As I learned from a 13-year-old skateboarder who calls himself Baby Scumbag, you get fewer likes for making videos of board tricks than you do for getting gorgeous girls to pose for you in the near nude, or just doing crazy antics in the street. He's a massive success on YouTube, where his videos often generate more than a million views. Another teenager, a girl from near San Diego, started making videos of herself singing, but is quickly learning that shots of her in her bedroom, or full body, or in a bathing suit, get her more attention. Her videos no longer include her vocals. That's the part I don't think most teens grasp. Nor do most adults have enough of a handle on this whole social media universe to fully articulate our misgivings. We know something is amiss, but saying it out loud feels so, well, out of touch. The reality here, however, is that it's our young social media users who are out of touch -- or at least painfully oblivious to the way the tools and platforms they're using in turn use them. They grew up with this stuff in their lives, and they accept these tools at face value, as features of the natural landscape. Not so. They were made by companies whose interests go far beyond helping kids express themselves and make friends. Our kids are not the customers here; they are both the product and the unwitting labor. Our social media platforms are embedded with values that shape our perspectives and our behaviors. If we live in the social media landscape without an awareness of what it really wants from us, no one is really being empowered at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Teenagers aim to get as many likes as possible .

"(CNN) -- ""Build a biscuit, put a sheepdog on top,"" @sammsy posted to Twitter Thursday morning. It could be dismissed as just another nonsensical tweet, one of many that fill the social media space. But a closer look reveals the post is followed by a hashtag -- #surrenderyoursay -- and a link to www.surrenderyoursay.com. The site is home to a new project from the Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada. ""Build a biscuit, put a sheepdog on top"" is actually a verbal tic, and it's been posted to @sammsy's feed as part of project designed to raise awareness about Tourette Syndrome. Users surrendered their Twitter feeds to the project for 24 hours -- sign-up for the project closed late Thursday. During that time, a program posted tweets containing real-life verbal tics, sent to the foundation from people who have Tourette Syndrome. These could be anything from random sounds like ""ins ins ins"" to swear words to illogical sentences. ""We were trying to think of a way to get people to experience Tourette Syndrome,"" art director Rachel Kennedy said. ""Twitter is sort of like your online voice... you're judged on the things you are saying."" People with Tourette Syndrome suffer from involuntary tics, which can be either verbal or physical. Physical tics may include jumping or twitching. People with the syndrome describe a tic like a sneeze -- impossible to hold in without extreme discomfort. Watch: 'American Idol' finalist James Durbin talks about life with Asperger and Tourette Syndrome . Many know it only as the ""swearing disease,"" but only about 10% of people with Tourette Syndrome swear, says Cathy Wylie, president of the Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada. ""The people who have Tourette are really the same as the rest of us, with just these tics added in,"" Wylie said. ""It doesn't affect anything else in their life."" Wylie's son was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome 20 years ago. Back then there wasn't a lot of information available for families. Over time, awareness has increased, but it's still not a well-understood condition, Wylie says. ""People looked at him like, 'You should behave -- why are you doing that?'"" she remembers. ""That's difficult when that's something you have no control over."" It's unknown exactly how many children living in the United States or Canada have Tourette Syndrome. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that three of every 1,000 American children have been diagnosed; other estimates are slightly higher. What is known is that males are three times more likely to suffer than females, and that white children are diagnosed more often than Hispanic or non-Hispanic black children, according to the CDC. People with Tourette Syndrome usually have an associated disorder as well, Wylie said, such as attention deficit disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety, sleep problems and learning disabilities are also common. Users did not have to give the project their password or account information, and they were still able to log in and tweet during the 24-hour period. The additional tweets -- or tics -- happened at random intervals. More than 8,900 people agreed to give up their Twitter feeds to Surrender Your Say. Many signed up before the project launched at 9 a.m. ET on Wednesday. People were very apprehensive about losing control of their online presence, co-executive creative director Helen Pak said.

"(CNN) -- It's perhaps the most iconic scene in the most iconic Hong Kong movie of all time. The slender silhouette of the beautiful heroine, Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), emerging from the darkness, revealing herself in a figure-hugging cheongsam. The man she passes, newspaper editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung), can't help falling in love with such a figure of feminine elegance. Set in the 1960s, the golden era of the cheongsam in Hong Kong, Wong Kar Wai's hit movie, ""In the Mood for Love"" (2000), which won multiple best foreign movie awards, was a powerful showcase for how elegant and sexy the classic Chinese dress can be. Wong has said 20 to 25 cheongsam alone were made for the character played by Maggie Cheung. ""A Century of Fashion: Hong Kong Cheongsam Story,"" now running at the Hong Kong Museum of History until March 3, features 130 exhibits showcasing the history and evolution of the cheongsam, particularly the eras featured in popular films such as ""In the Mood for Love"" and ""The World of Suzie Wong"" (1960). Early cheongsam a feminist statement . The exhibition is a study in the history surrounding the iconic Chinese dress that can be confusing even to Chinese -- the proper use of ""cheongsam"" and ""qipao,"" for instance. ""We prefer to call it cheongsam -- not qipao,"" says Osmond Chan, assistant curator of the exhibition. ""Cheongsam means long robe in Cantonese and actually only became a common woman's wear after the May Fourth Movement (1919), or the New Culture Movement,"" he says. ""Women started wearing men's long robes as a feminist statement and trend during that anti-Qing era. ""Therefore, it's a bit of an oxymoron to continue calling the dress qipao, which refers to the robe of the Manchu (the ruling power of Qing Dynasty)."" Early cheongsam didn't have the tight, figure-hugging shape the dress is known for today, but was originally worn loose on the body. The shape changed and became tighter in Shanghai in the 1920s and '30s, a time often referred to as the golden age of the cheongsam in Shanghai. With the rise of the Communist Party in the late 1940s and '50s, however, the dress, and the decadent Shanghai style it invoked, was restricted. Shanghai tailors fled to Hong Kong, bringing the cheongsam with them. The trend picked up quickly and Hong Kong experienced its own golden age of the cheongsam in the 1950s and '60s. Cheongsam master . Founded in 1966, Linva Tailor is one of the longest-standing cheongsam shops in Hong Kong. While it's often assumed that owner and master tailor Leung Ching-wah made some of the costumes for Maggie Cheung in ""In the Mood for Love,"" he says he can't talk about it. Leung represents the old guard -- tailors who recognize the beauty of a boar-shaped cut or a sword-shaped binding on a side slit. His wife, Joana Fung, dissects a cheongsam the way a sommelier talks about wine. ""The beauty of a cheongsam is not in the fabric -- fabrics can be purchased, but not the skills,"" says Fung. Leung started apprenticing under a Shanghai tailor when he was 16. He opened Linva Tailor seven years later. ""I spent the first few months only learning to hold a needle properly,"" says Leung. ""One can only start making a cheongsam after a year of apprenticeship."" ""In the '60s, every woman wore a cheongsam,"" says Leung. As Western culture and fashion became more influential among Chinese in Hong Kong in the 1970s, the cheongsam lost its popularity. Will the cheongsam survive? The craft is diminishing. At least in Hong Kong. All of Leung's in-house tailors are in their sixties. Many have reduced their workloads. Despite often being referred to as a sunset industry, however, Leung says he doesn't worry that cheongsam culture won't last for another century. In Hong Kong and China, the cheongsam is still popular for evening parties and company conferences. ""All brides will still don one at their weddings,"" says Leung. ""If you look at Miss Hong Kong beauty pageant, a section featuring candidates in cheongsam has been a must,"" says Chan. Most cheongsam manufacturing has moved to factories in mainland China, where more than 15 manufacturers and suppliers have an online presence. Although global sales are difficult to track, several Chinese makers advertise shops with a capacity for thousands of garments sewn monthly by staffs of 250 or more garment makers. Brands like Shanghai Tang and Blanc de Chine, which carry cheongsam priced at about $400, are making their marks with modern twists on the cheongsam. Opened in 1994 in Hong Kong with the idea of creating a modern Chinese chic style, Shanghai Tang has swelled into a multi-national fashion brand with 45 outlets. The business is expanding both in China and around the world, according to Raphael le Masne de Chermont, executive chairman of Shanghai Tang. The main elements of the dress's original silhouette -- high collar and flower buttons on the placket -- make it easy to incorporate into new designs, says Chan. Inspiration still crosses over to Western runways cheongsam designs have been included in a 2011 Ralph Lauren collection, a 2012 Gucci collection and Emilio Pucci's 2013 spring/summer collection. Unlike kimono or hanbok . Though modern, hybrid versions of the cheongsam are popular, there remains an appetite for the more traditional shapes. ""Classes teaching how to make cheongsam are offered in Hong Kong,"" says Chan, adding that the continuity of passing down the skills for cheongsam-making shouldn't be reserved for great tailors. YMCA HK's cheongsam classes for the public are conducted by Mong Kar-mo, a former tailor for the Miss Hong Kong Pageant. Linva Tailor receives five or six orders per day and Leung hasn't thought of retiring. ""I started out in this business just hoping to make a living, but then I grew to learn the beauty of cheongsam,"" says Leung. ""It's different from ethnic costumes like the kimono and hanbok, as cheongsam has a highly flexible design,"" says Chan. ""Elements like dress length, different materials and different levels of complexity make dresses suitable for a variety of occasions."" ""As one Chinese saying goes, 'cheongsam is practical enough for the kitchen but presentable for the living room,'"" says Chan. ""The reason it's been able to last for a century is because cheongsam is really beautiful on its wearer."" Ordering a cheongsam . At Hong Kong cheongsam shops, customers first choose a style off the rack before deciding on details such as fabric, flower buttons on the placket, sleeve length and slit depth. The tailor then takes measurements and customers return for another fitting after a few days. Final adjustments are made before decorative bindings and flower buttons are added and the dress can be properly finished. The entire process usually takes two months. Visitors who don't have as much time can choose a ready-made cheongsam and have it altered. The finished product can be mailed to them. Basic styles start from HK$2,000 ($260).

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has warned Syria's government that any aggression against Israeli citizens will be met with force, as a roadside bomb attack which injured Israeli troops prompted airstrikes on Syrian targets. Addressing a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes on Syrian territory targeted elements ""that not only facilitated, but also cooperated with, the attacks on our forces."" He added, ""Our policy is very clear: We attack those who attack us."" The government of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is engaged in a long-running civil war which has seen some conflict spill over into neighboring countries. Four Israeli paratroopers were injured Tuesday when the bomb exploded under their patrol jeep in the Golan Heights, near the frontier between Israel and Syria, the Israel Defense Forces said. Before the explosion, Israeli forces had detected suspicious movements near the border, the IDF said. Israeli forces responded to the blast with artillery fire aimed at Syrian military targets across the frontier, it said. This was followed by airstrikes early Wednesday. ""We will not tolerate any violation of our sovereignty and attacks against our soldiers and civilians, and we will act unwaveringly and with strength against all those that are acting against us, at every time and every place,"" said Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon. ""We see the Assad regime as responsible for what is going on in its territory, and if it continues to cooperate with terror organizations that are trying to attack Israel, we will continue to extract a heavy price from him, in a way which will make him regret his actions."" A statement from the Syrian army command, broadcast by Syrian state TV, said one soldier was killed and seven others injured in Israeli airstrikes on a checkpoint in the Quneitra area. The Quneitra crossing is the only access point between Syria and Israel and in the past has been fiercely fought over by Syrian rebels and government forces. Israeli artillery, tank shells and armor-piercing shells directed near the village of Seheit had also caused ""material damage,"" the military statement said. The Syrian army accused Israel of violating the terms of a 1974 ""disengagement agreement"" between the two nations, and of seeking to ease pressure on the ""terrorists"" it blames for the violence in Syria. ""The General Command of the Army and Armed Forces warns that these desperate bids of provocations and escalations by these continuing acts of aggressions can risk the security and the stability of the region and open up all possibilities,"" it said. Netanyahu, in his Cabinet remarks, said Israel would continue to do all it could to prevent the movement of weapons into Syria. The mountainous Golan was captured by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War against Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Syria. A peace deal was reached between Israel and Syria in 1974, and a U.N. observer force monitors the cease-fire line. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981.

"(CNN) -- The ""do-nothing"" Congress is the most misleading expression in politics. With the start of the final period in this congressional session, politicians and pundits have been writing one story after another about how little legislation is likely to pass in the coming months. ""The Do-Nothing Congress,"" ""Congress's Plan to Get Nothing Done,"" ""What the 'Do Nothing Congress' Is Doing on ISIL"" and ""Will the 'Do-Nothing' Congress Do Even Less in An Election Season?"" are just some of the headlines. Congress, they say, will sit idly and do nothing while the world burns. A recent CNN/ORC poll found that 83% of Americans don't approve of the way Congress is working. A stunning 65% believe it to be the worst Congress of ""their lifetime."" Comparisons abound with the famous 80th Congress that President Truman lambasted in 1948. Yes, few major bills will pass. But the term gives a skewed picture of the effects of obstruction. Let's stop calling it a ""do-nothing"" Congress. For reporters and politicians who use it, the term is a cop-out. By doing nothing, Congress is actually doing a lot, though the consequences are not very pretty. Inaction can make things worse. And that's exactly what's happening now. These are some of the problems that will worsen, thanks to Congress' failure: . Immigration: Doing nothing in this case means leaving millions of lives hanging in the balance. Families must continue to live in the shadows, fearful of deportation and unable to gain access to the best jobs and educational opportunities. The New York Times recently published a story featuring a mother in Ohio named Seleste Wisniewski who has been somberly watching the news about President Obama's decision to delay action on changing immigration policy since her Mexican husband -- who has been in the U.S. for over a decade and whose stay of deportation was canceled -- is at risk to be deported. Climate change: The stakes of failure to act on climate continue to grow. Respected scientists across the globe have documented the dangerous impact of our current business, environmental and energy practices and their role in enabling intolerable levels of greenhouse emissions. More carbon dioxide is getting pumped into the atmosphere, sea levels are rising, and more species are at risk. Last summer, a bipartisan group of officials, including former Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin, catalogued the immense environmental and economic effects. They urged remedies in the near future, such as the imposition of a carbon tax. Without any change, the costs will rise. ""Hope is not a strategy,"" Paulson said. Last week, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the levels of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere are higher than ever before. The National Audubon Society gave a very specific result: Half of the North American bird species are at risk as a result of the new temperatures. Presidential war power: Legislators have a lot to say about ISIS, Ukraine and military challenges overseas. At this point, however, they have not been voting on anything. Congress has limited itself to the safe role of being the Monday morning quarterback. These are the exactly the kinds of conditions that create incentives and room for presidential war power to keep growing. Indeed, New York Rep. Peter King urged Obama to do something rather than waiting for Congress to act. ""I think the president should take action and then I think the Congress should pass legislation supporting what the president does,"" he said on CNN. In no uncertain terms, Obama has said that he can act without congressional consent if necessary. Historically, the biggest check to presidential war power has been when Congress is assertive, with its power over the military budget and oversight. When it is inactive, presidents use executive authority, and they do so with impunity. This will happen again. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican congressman Frank Wolf have proposed bills authorizing the president to use military power for a limit of three years against ISIS. Congress should move forward with a vote on their legislation, putting a strong congressional imprint on the policies dictating what kind of military force will be used. Agency planning: Although not quite as sexy as the other issues, agencies suffer under the current legislative process. Over the past decade, the chaotic budgeting process that Congress has used has left agencies constantly scrambling and uncertain about what kind of funding is ahead. Long-term planning and strategic investments are difficult in this kind of environment. By holding back on spending bills and constantly raising the possibility of government shutdowns, Congress prevents federal agencies from carrying on the business of government. In this case, the ""do-nothing"" Congress places handcuffs on civil servants. Middle-class insecurity: A lot of ink (in printer cartridges) has been spilled in the past few years documenting the growing problem of economic inequality in the U.S. The rich keep getting richer, the poor keep slipping even further behind and the middle class lives in a state of peril. There are many factors behind this development, but government policy has been one of them. Tax policies that give disproportionate relief to wealthier Americans and the failure to update and strengthen social safety net programs that benefit the disadvantaged have been major culprits. Government investment in growing areas of the economy that could compensate for slow growth in older and failing sectors has not been forthcoming as the parties remain locked in a stalemate. Government won't solve the problem of inequality and insecurity, but it can certainly make conditions much better. That happened during the 1930s and 1940s, when Franklin Roosevelt rallied the public behind federal programs that produced one of America's greatest periods of economic growth. Right now, Congress is saying no to any new solutions. The result is that the fabric of the country continues to become frail. In all of these areas, and more, Congress worsens America's problems by standing still. Starting with this fall's midterm campaigns, voters must increase pressure on Congress to do something different than the current path and to offer compromise solutions to these problems. In the meantime, the media and our political leaders have an obligation to stop using a term that obscures the impact of what is taking place.","Julian Zelizer: It's a cop-out to let this Congress be known as ""do-nothing""
By failing to pass significant legislation, Congress is actively worsening our problems, he says .

He says a passive Congress fails to provide a check on presidential war powers ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The plot sounds like something plucked from today's headlines: foreign hostages, terrorism, presidential power and American diplomatic relations with the Middle East. But the nation's first war on terror was waged by Thomas Jefferson, not George W. Bush or Barack Obama. In place of al Qaeda or ISIS, Jefferson was fighting the Barbary pirates. In Jefferson's time, European powers conceded to terrorism by paying annual tribute and ransom to groups like the Barbary pirates, according to Robert F. Turner, co-founder of the Center for National Security Law and professor of American Foreign Policy. Once the American colonies gained independence from Britain, their ships were left without protection from piracy at sea. As American commerce began to increase, the Barbary states targeted American merchant vessels that traveled the seas without a strong naval defense. Ransom payments . Jefferson believed paying ransom to terrorist organizations was a sign of weakness as a nation. ""Some leaders wanted to pay ransom to get hostages back or pay tribute so they [Barbary pirates] wouldn't take further hostages,"" Turner said. ""Jefferson was a lover of peace, but he was not one to believe that peace would be preserved by weakness. We had to show strength."" In 1801, pirates across the coast of Tripoli continued to seize American ships and use force to take Americans hostage. ""Jefferson learned of how brutally Western prisoners were being held. They were kept in chains, dungeons, their life span was not long, and a lot of them were dying in prison,"" Turner said. The pirates of Tripoli declared war on the United States in May 1801, according to a chapter written by Turner and published in The Chicago Journal of International Law. Even before his presidency, Jefferson, as secretary of state, argued that his nation should not offer money to terrorists. It's a principle that persists in America's battle against ISIS. Today, 62% of Americans oppose paying ransom to ISIS, according to a Reuters-IPSOS poll of 4,685 American adults. The U.S. government paid ransom to free Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from the Taliban, but if those type of negotiations are being held with ISIS, it has not been made public. ISIS seems to be making a statement with its hostages. Congressional vote . In a recent address to the nation, Obama told the American people that we will ""degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS."" Even though he said he didn't need it, he asked for Congress' vote of approval. In the meantime, Obama ordered military strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. A survey released by CNN indicates ""more than seven in 10 Americans think Obama should ask Congress for the ability to strike ISIS militarily. And eight in 10 Americans support Congress approving military force against ISIS."" But Congress has left Washington to prepare for midterm elections, so any special authority will come after the fact. In 1801, Jefferson sent a similar message to the American people. Without congressional approval, Turner said, Jefferson sent a small squadron of ships to the Mediterranean to battle the Barbary pirates. Jefferson ordered naval leaders to ""protect our commerce and chastise their insolence -- by sinking, burning or destroying their ships and vessels wherever you shall find them,"" according to U.S. naval documents. The first time Congress was officially notified of Jefferson's plan, which deployed two-thirds of America's naval forces into battle with the enemy, was after the fact, in his first annual message to Congress on December 8, 1801. ""Jefferson's belief was that when war is declared against the United States we don't need Congress' approval to fight back,"" said Turner. In Jefferson's address to Congress he wrote that, ""Unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go out beyond the line of defense,"" he deployed American naval forces into battle. Boots on the ground . With such a strong and pressing enemy threatening the United States, Jefferson eventually sent American naval forces into harm's way to fight. ""I'm a believer. I think we ought to be looking for a way to be getting their [ISIS'] attention. It was a widely held opinion to send ships to the Mediterranean, during Jefferson's presidency, because everyone thought, wow, this is outrageous what they're doing to us,"" Turner said. Today, Obama faces the pressures of not putting American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. While 76% favor American airstrikes against ISIS, 61% of Americans oppose putting U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria, according to a poll released by CNN earlier this month. The fight against terror is nothing new for the United States. With many similarities dating back to the early 1800s, today Obama has vital decisions to make. Although the President's strategy to defeat ISIS is gradually emerging, America's ability to grow as a nation emanates from the valuable lessons the country learned so early in its existence.","President Obama launched strikes on ISIS in Syria without congressional approval .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will announce plans Friday to nominate San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro to be his next secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a government source said. The 39-year old, three-term mayor first gained national recognition when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention -- the first Hispanic to do so. First elected in 2009 and re-elected in 2011 and 2013, Castro is the youngest mayor of a major American city. He has been widely considered a rising leader in the Democratic Party and some even say a potential vice presidential candidate in 2016. Castro would replace Shaun Donovan, who the President plans to nominate as director of the Office of Management and Budget, the source said. Donovan has been a member of the Obama administration from the start. Both men will join Obama at the White House for the announcement Friday afternoon, the source said. Opinion: Why Julian Castro said yes to Obama . A graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School, Castro began his political career at a young age. At 26, he was the youngest councilman ever elected in San Antonio. Four years later, he ran for mayor, but lost to retired judge and fellow Democrat Phil Hardberger. Another four years and Castro was in City Hall at the ripe old age of 34. Castro was re-elected in 2011 with 82% of the vote and in 2013 with 67%. He has spoken out in favor of same-sex marriage and of affirmative action, even telling The New York Times that it helped him get into Stanford. Former San Antonio mayor and HUD secretary Henry Cisneros told CNN in a previous interview that Castro is a good fit for the job, noting the current mayor's record of expanding pre-K education, revitalizing San Antonio's downtown and shoring up the city's finances. Mayors' stories out of school . With an eye on 2016, Cisneros said the mayor could ""learn the country"" as HUD secretary, arguing, ""It's a lot more likely he can get on that ticket from a national office than from a mayor's job."" Not everyone is a fan, though. ""He's a tax-and-spend liberal. He does not represent all Hispanics; we're not all the same,"" George Rodriguez, president of the tea party in San Antonio, said in 2012. Castro is the grandson of Mexican immigrants. His grandmother came to Texas from Mexico as an orphan at the age of 6. She taught herself to read and write in Spanish, eventually finding work in San Antonio as a maid and a cook. His twin brother Joaquin Castro, who introduced him at the DNC in 2012, represents Texas' 20th district, which includes parts of San Antonio, in the House of Representatives. CNN's Greg Seaby, Conor Finnegan, Sarah Aarthun, Ed Lavandera and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","President Obama will announce his plan to nominate Julian Castro as HUD secretary .

"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" will begin its 40th season Saturday, and in its first 39 years it's produced at least 39 hilarious sketches. You're probably playing them in your mind right now: the Nerds, Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, some Stefon bit with Bill Hader. Maybe even the Vomitorium. Hey, whatever floats your boat. 40 reasons why 'SNL' is still awesome . But some are just better than others, right? Now, a few caveats: . â€¢ I'm old. I celebrated my 104th birthday last week, and I remember when electricity was transmitted by horse-drawn train car. So if these choices skew older, that's one reason. Prefer more contemporary sketches? Add your opinion in the comments -- or, better yet, head on over to iReport and write up your own thoughts. â€¢ Memory is selective. It's not that I don't appreciate ""D**k in a Box,"" Tina Fey as Sarah Palin, Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal as Frankie and Willie or ""The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise,"" but the shock and hilarity of some sketches are just stronger than others. Your mileage, of course, may vary. â€¢ Comedy is subjective. It makes you laugh or it doesn't. These made me laugh -- and also, sometimes, gasp. So here's one guy's opinion of ""SNL's"" five best sketches (short films included). And sorry to disappoint you, but ""More Cowbell"" isn't among them: . ""The Final Days"" (first season, 1976) The Watergate saga was still part of the everyday news cycle when this skit, based on the Bob Woodward-Carl Bernstein best-seller, made its appearance. Dan Aykroyd was at his Nixonesque best as the 37th president, a paranoid figure taking his anger out on Henry Kissinger (John Belushi) and the paintings of presidents on the White House walls. The truly scary thing is that Al Franken and Tom Davis, who wrote the skit, didn't have to change that much from the book. ""White Like Me"" (season 10, 1984) Eddie Murphy, who had risen to stardom as an ""SNL"" cast member, returned as host for a December 1984 episode. In this short film, he went undercover to ""experience America as a white man."" He finds that we do, truly, live in two distinct countries. His stiff-legged walk alone is worth watching. ""President Reagan, Mastermind"" (season 12, 1986) To his critics, Ronald Reagan was an infuriatingly disengaged president -- but, as ""SNL"" producer Lorne Michaels has observed, he was a hard president to criticize because he was so sunny and optimistic. Finally, Jim Downey and Franken came up with this sketch, with a cutting Phil Hartman as Reagan. Who knew he could speak Arabic? ""Schmitt's Gay"" (season 17, 1991) Beer commercials have long followed the same formula: Surround male schlubs with good-looking women in impossible scenarios. ""Schmitt's Gay"" was a fake ad that turned the formula around, with Adam Sandler and Chris Farley as two guys who crack open some beers -- and are immediately surrounded by hot men. You'll never watch a beer ad the same way again. ""Tom Brokaw Pre-tapes"" (season 22, 1996) Tom Brokaw is going on vacation, and his producer wants to make sure every option is covered -- which includes the obituary of Gerald Ford (who was very much alive at the time). But you can never be too prepared when it comes to possibilities. What if the president is eaten by wolves?","""Saturday Night Live"" celebrates 40th season Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Glasgow Rangers, the one-time giants of Scottish football, have been humbled in their debut at the basement of the country's football league. The club only managed a 2-2 draw in their first game away at Peterhead, a team without any full-time players which has spent much of its time in the bottom division which Rangers have now joined following their collapse with debts of over $200 million earlier this year. In what could have been an embarrassing start to Rangers' life in the lower leagues, Peterhead overturned an opening goal against them and lead 2-1 for most of the second half. The Glasgow side had eight internationals on the pitch and they dominated possession, yet struggled to do anything with the ball until the 90th minute, when Andrew Little tapped home a rebound after Kevin Kyle's header hit the bar. A record crowd of 4,485 packed into the tiny Balmoor stadium -10 times the average attendance at the ground. After the game, Rangers manager Ally McCoist told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I felt we defended appallingly to be honest. We didn't match their aggression and if our boys at any time thought this was going to be a cakewalk they know where they are now. ""I am not going to start panicking but overall I still think we will play better and we'll certainly pass the ball better but enormous credit must go to Peterhead."" Feature: Why Rangers' financial meltdown should worry European football . Cash-strapped Rangers went into administration earlier this year and a new company was formed to allow them to continue as a professional team. They were subsequently expelled from the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and had to turn to the lesser SFL for next season. Rangers have been regulars in the European Champions League since its inception. They won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and as recently as 2008 were runners-up in the UEFA Cup (Now Europa League). SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster and his Scottish Football Association counterpart Stewart Regan both lobbied for Rangers to be placed in the SFL Division One so they could secure a quick return to the top flight, but their pleas were ignored. Rangers went into administration on February 14 this year following court action from UK tax officials. Businessman Charles Green purchased the assets of the club for Â£5.5 million ($8.55m) and they were transferred into a new company in June.","Club which once dominated Scottish Premier League posts a draw against part-time side .

"(CNN) -- The original ""pop-up restaurants"" were secretive affairs. Called ""supper clubs,"" they were hosted in private homes, the locations of which were revealed at the last minute via social media or guerrilla advertising. These underground gatherings of complete strangers were inspired by a love of food and seen as an act of rebellion against the established restaurant trade. Are celebrity chefs stealing the show? Today, the idea is increasingly hijacked by celebrity chefs and big corporations. Everyone from Pierre Koffmann to Rene Redzepi to Gordon Ramsay are ""popping up"" in locations away from their home turf. Exclusive and expensive pop-up dining clubs, membership for which can run into thousands of dollars, have also evolved out of the pop-up idea, to become part of the world's high-end dining scene. The latest interpretation is from molecular gastronomy chef Heston Blumenthal, who'll be transporting his three Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant from a village in England to a casino in Melbourne, Australia for six months in 2015. Other celebrity chefs jumping the pop-up bandwagon include: . • Rene Redzepi, head chef of Copenhagen's Noma restaurant. He ran a pop-up at the swanky Claridges hotel in London for 10 days. At nearly $330 a head, his menu featured dishes like live ants and flowers. Opinion was divided about whether his restaurant, which focuses on locally foraged food, had traveled well. • Celebrity chef Jean-Christophe Novelli. He braved accusations of selling out by creating a one-day pop-up restaurant in London to showcase ingredients from discount supermarket chain Aldi. • Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster in Harlem, who opened a two-month pop-up in June at The Fairmont Hamilton Princess in Bermuda. • One of the most unusual pop-ups was on the London Eye. A capsule on the giant ferris wheel was transformed into a dining room with menus from the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Ireland's Richard Corrigan. So are celebs and big money enterprises cashing in on and corrupting what should be an authentic, fun foodie experience? Or are pop-ups a natural training ground for future stars and novel dining experiences? A sign of the times . Pop-up restaurants have their roots in Latin America where illegal, privately owned eateries called paladares (meaning palate) sprang up after the Cuban Revolution. The trend spread to the East Coast in the United States and London in the UK in the 2000s, run by foodies in their homes and unknown chefs in venues like disused warehouses or pubs. Supper clubs gave the hosts a chance to experiment with cooking and guests loved the risque feel. A chance for rising chefs . Pop-ups offer rising chefs the chance to get their name known without all the investment and risk of opening a physical restaurant. Many now-famous chefs cut their teeth on temporary restaurants. Ludo Lefebvre of Trois Mec in Los Angeles previously ran Ludobites, a series of pop-ups across the city selling affordable, high-end food. Tom Collins of Bistrotheque ran the UK's first ""guerilla"" restaurant in a converted brewery in east London in 2006. Pop-up pioneer and food blogger Kerstin Rodgers, aka Ms Marmitelover, started one of the first supper clubs at her home in London in 2009. ""I was cooking in various cafes and didn't have the money to start my own restaurant,"" she says. ""This was a way to cook without having to pay for premises and staff and without taking all the risks of opening a new restaurant."" Her first event cost just $16 -- now she charges $67 for themed suppers and can cater for 20 people in her living room. ""It's good for tourism because people from abroad can come and eat in a Londoner's home. It's good value food cooked from scratch, which can't be said of many restaurants nowadays,"" she adds. Stealing the show . ""I'm an original punk and I think there are parallels between the punk movement and supper clubs,"" says Rodgers. ""Punks hate all these bloated rock stars sitting in tax exile in their mansions and in a sense supper clubs were a reaction to bloated and overpriced restaurants."" Posh dining clubs and celebrity chefs are the antithesis of the pop-up movement, she believes. ""What I find disappointing is there have been a lot of opportunists who don't understand the roots of it, piling in with their big backers and marketing teams and pretending to do the same thing, and they're not."" Social side . Unlike some modern dining clubs, which require a big annual fee and a recommendation to become a member, the original supper clubs were open to an eclectic mix of people. Stephanie Biden runs a Thai-themed supper club in her home in southwest London. She saw Jamie Oliver visit a New York supper club on TV and thought she'd try it. ""One of the great things is that if you invite friends around for dinner you tend to spend time thinking about who would be a good combination of guests to invite, and on the night your attention is divided between hosting and cooking. ""With a supper club you don't have to worry about that. You can focus on the cooking and preparing the best food you can,"" she says. ""It's been a great way of getting friends and acquaintances from different parts of your life to meet one another. The dynamic is unique, lively and informal -- it's neither like a dinner party, nor like going to a restaurant."" Exclusive club . But supper clubs are becoming increasingly commercial enterprises. Tamsin Lonsdale runs The Supper Club. It has 1,000 members who pay $3,000-4,000 each for an annual membership offering access to monthly dinner parties in New York, Los Angeles and London. Uma Thurman, Christian Slater and Naomi Campbell are just some of the celebrities joining other personally vetted guests at her lavish events. ""It's good to have something for everyone. The pop-up scene has more variety in it nowadays especially in America,"" she says. ""Some are bring your own, some are very foodie-orientated. I try to marry the food, chef and the people. The suppers are structured and organized but our members like that structure -- they can't just drop everything at a moment's notice. ""Of course I'm in it to make money but I genuinely love meeting new people and it's a relationship thing -- you can't put a price on that. Her role is to ""curate"" a dinner party, she says, similar to an art exhibition. She brings together different people. The only criteria is they must be ""shining stars"" in their field, whether surgeon or entrepreneur. Testing food trends . A different kind of pop-up club is Dinner Lab, which tests out cutting-edge food concepts in pop-up restaurants in 10 cities across the United States. The aim is to discover the latest food trends and offer undiscovered chefs the chance to experiment, says 20-something CEO Brian Bordainick. It costs $100-$175 to become a member and then $60-$80 per event which includes food and alcohol, in venues ranging from helipads to piers. ""For most chefs, the restaurant decides what they will be cooking. Artists like having a free rein to be creative and we give them a platform to do it,"" says Bordainick. ""We help them get out of the shadow of the head chef and hone in on which concepts could be a success. We're trying to figure who and what's next."" Every course is rated by up to 120 guests, and the aim is to eventually open permanent restaurants using the research. ""We're experimenting in a way where we throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks,"" says Bordainick. ""It allows people to try out experimental dishes in a very approachable way. ""Pop-ups are no different from any type of trend, it's only a matter of time before it makes its way into big organizations who try to homogenize it. But I say, different strokes for different folks."" Future . It was always going to be hard for underground restaurants to stay underground forever. Celebrity chefs and big business cashing in on the scene don't seem to have dented the popularity of temporary restaurants ranging from home-cooked grub in someone's living room to innovative cuisine in an aircraft hanger. Expect the pop-up to keep popping up. Claire Hu is a wine, food, culture and travel journalist based in South Africa.","Celebrity chefs like Noma's Rene Redzepi and Heston Blumenthal are cashing in on the pop-up restaurant trend .

"(CNN) -- What's Spanish for ""twerk?"" Mexican officials are in no hurry to find out. This is one U.S. import our southern neighbor wants nothing to do with. Ditto for Miley Cyrus, the controversial singer known less for her music than for her over-sexualized on-stage spectacles intended to get attention and shock the senses. Cyrus accomplished both on the Diez y Seis de Septiembre -- better known, on this side of the border, as September 16th. North of the Rio Grande, that day is like any other, as insignificant as the Fourth of July is in Canada. However, in Mexico, the day is awfully important. It's Independence Day. And since Mexicans are a proud people who put a high value on respect, it's probably not a good idea for Americans -- or anyone else for that matter -- to go to Mexico on Mexican Independence Day and show disrespect to, oh, the Mexican flag. That's what Cyrus and fellow performers did last week during a concert in the northern city of Monterrey in a stunt that gives new meaning to the phrase ""ugly Americans."" As Cyrus ""twerked"" onstage, while wearing -- yes, you read this right -- a giant prosthetic butt, her backup singers whipped her with rolled up pieces of cloth that turned out to be miniature Mexican flags. It was a trifecta of bad judgment -- the wrong thing to do, the wrong country to do it in, and all of it happening on the wrong day. Before you could say international incident, outraged Mexican state legislators asked the federal government to fine the pop star for desecrating the Mexican flag. Under a law that prohibits abuse of ""national emblems, the flag and the national anthem,"" such a transgression can normally earn someone a $1,270 fine as well as, in some cases, a couple of days in jail. The legislators are asking that Cyrus get locked up for 36 hours. Mexican authorities are investigating. There are those in this country who will claim that the singer is being singled out because she is an American. But actually, in this case, equal treatment would call out for some sort of punishment. It's a good time to send a message. In 2008, Mexican pop star Paulina Rubio was fined $4,000 for appearing in a Spanish magazine, clutching a Mexican flag wrapped around her naked body. What the 21-year-old Cyrus and her crew did was tasteless and thoughtless. And whether or not Mexican officials decide to formally charge her with desecrating the Mexican flag, she ought to apologize -- in person, and on Mexican soil. Having said that, Mexican officials need to be careful not to overplay their hand and protest too much, lest they turn legitimate concerns about professional decorum in the entertainment industry into dinner theater. The initial response was not encouraging. Speaking to CNN, Mexican State Rep. Francisco TreviÃ±o said this: ""I am truly offended and annoyed by the fact that a foreign artist feels like she can come here and make fun of and mock our national flag on Independence Day, September 16th."" Seriously? Trevino can't really believe that the stunt was intended as a direct assault on the Mexican flag. An assault on decency and good manners, maybe. Does he think this was some sort of political statement? He is probably giving Cyrus and her backup dancers too much credit. Finally, is this really an attempt to mock the flag? The dancers used it as a prop, but the idea was clearly to draw attention to Cyrus -- not the flag. As a Mexican-American, I realize that, in Mexico, my grandfather's homeland, the second-most popular sport -- after soccer -- is American bashing.

"(CNN) -- Nine U.N. peacekeepers were killed in an ambush Friday in Mali, a U.N. spokesman said. Their convoy was attacked near Menaka, in the country's eastern Gao region, by heavily armed men on motorcycles, said Olivier Salgado, a spokesman for the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Mali. The nine dead were from Niger. The United Nations does not know who is responsible, Salgado said. The attack was the deadliest yet of several against the forces in the country, the U.N. mission said on its Facebook page. Air assets were immediately deployed with the aim of making the area safe and helping the peacekeepers, the statement said. Arnauld Akodjenou, deputy special representative of the secretary-general in the U.N. mission, called for an end to violence. He said he was horrified by ""this cowardly and hateful act of terrorism"" and the loss of more lives in pursuit of peace in Mali, adding that these crimes must not go unpunished. In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said such attacks constitute a violation of international law, and called on armed groups operating in the area of promises they have made to cooperate with the United Nations. The latest attack comes a little more than two weeks after five U.N. peacekeepers from Chad were killed and three others injured when a U.N. vehicle struck a homemade bomb in northern Mali. The September 18 attack took place on a road between Aguelhok and Tessalit, the U.N. mission said. Other attacks have also killed or injured U.N. peacekeepers in the Kidal region. The U.N. mission is there to guard against militant Islamists who in early 2013 threatened to move on the West African nation's capital, Bamako. More than 8,000 military personnel and nearly 1,000 police were deployed under the peacekeeping mission as of the end of August. It was set up in April 2013 following a U.N. Security Council resolution. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: Attack is deadliest yet against peacekeepers in Mali, United Nations says .

"(CNN) -- I fell for ""The Giant Korean"" at a weekend-long destination wedding. I couldn't yet pronounce either of his real names (Seung or Yong) and although his friends called him ""Sing,"" I stuck with the catch phrase my girlfriends and I had coined the first time I met him because, frankly, my nickname captured his presence better. I had come around to a slight Americanization of his real name by the first time we exchanged ""I love yous,"" but it seemed of little consequence when Seung then added that I would never be welcome in his family's home. Seung had been told, all his life, more or less, that he was not allowed to marry someone like me. Pronunciation aside, it hadn't occurred to me that Seung and I made a mismatched couple. Mixed-race yes, but I couldn't fathom that my race could make me the ""wrong kind of girl"" for anyone. Yes, it was white privilege that blinded me to the fact I might be the bottom of the barrel on someone else's race card. Perhaps even more so because I have been listening to the dialogue about how to make America more post-racial -- mostly as it pertains to black and white culture -- for so long that it never occurred to me that an Asian immigrant family might cry foul when their son fell in love with an all-American girl like me. But truthfully, I was blindsided for personal reasons, too. Years before this I had fought with my own mother over our family's prejudices when it came to love. I had more than one black boyfriend in my twenties, and a few others in shades between olive and dark brown. When my parents said that one of them shouldn't be invited to our holiday table, I stopped showing up also. That particular boyfriend and I only lasted six months, but I did not visit home for nearly two years until my mother and I agreed that unconditional love meant accepting anyone, of any race, who I chose to spend my life with. I don't think I took such a stance with my family because I am Joan of Arc incarnate. Rather, aside from this flaw, my parents are kind and generous people. Parents often have a favorite child . I knew their prejudices came from the ignorance of confusing economics, education and opportunity with culture. But they simultaneously taught me that I had a right to speak up for what I believed and to defend my choices. I only had the gumption to fight them and eventually end their narrow-mindedness because they showed me so much love. So I found it particularly saddening to be back in the same mess, 15 years later, dressed in different robes. Even though Seung Yong's family is educated, well traveled and chose to raise their kids in the States. And even though, more to the point, Seung Yong was a grown man. ""You've never told your parents that you get to pick who you love?"" I thought this but I didn't say it out loud. Not at first, anyway. Instead, when he told me his parents would never let him be with a white girl, I stared into his eyes and smiled. Not because I was feeling his plight but because I'd become cautious of him. This man I had woken up with earlier in the day now seemed like a stranger to me. Specifically, he seemed like someone of another culture that I didn't know or understand. Which was in fact true, because as much as we had in common, I was completely unaware of what it meant to grow up Asian-American -- both in his home and in the outside world. But Seung kept talking and what he was saying didn't allow me to recoil for too long. He wanted to be with me, no matter what. He had a plan for how he would address this issue with his parents and he wondered if I was willing to take the leap with him. His words shut off the alarm bells in my head and I agreed to follow him into the racially slurred forest where we would attempt to change what his parents, and so many, say in private to their kids about a mixed-race marriage. That turned out to be the most measured discussion Seung and I ever had about his family's belief that marrying me might degrade them by watering down their culture or bloodline. Because it was the only one in which I stayed silent. Using my words, gently and respectfully, in many, many, many subsequent conversations about how I felt did in fact lead Seung Yong and I to marry -- with the full support of all our parents. But it was only through continuous dialogue -- at the dinner table with friends who could advise us, and using calm voices in the bedroom with one another, and keeping an open mind on the couch at the therapist's office -- that we were able to find a way to make our familial cultures meet in the middle at our mutual American one. Seven years later and three half-Asian/half-Caucasian children deep, the discussion of race rarely comes up in our home. But only because we worked so hard to make sure the inconsistencies we were both taught in our parents' homes about what kinds of people were worthy to love would never be a part of our home or life together.

"(CNN) -- We've been netiquette'ing for more than a year and a half now, and when we ask friends/acquaintances/the gaping maw of the Internet for their burning questions and column suggestions, one anxiety pops up again and again and again. Here it is, in Mad Libs form: . ""My [aunt/boss/elderly neighbor] sent me a friend request on Facebook, and I don't want to accept because [she still thinks of me as a squeaky clean 11-year-old/I don't want him to see pictures of me in a bathing suit/he is freaking OLD]. But I know he or she will notice if I don't accept because [she only has 13 other friends/he said something about it at work/he is weirdly obsessed with me]. What do I dooo?"" -- Every Young Person Ever . Well, EYPE, today is your lucky day. You've got several options, and we're going to present them all to you right here, rapid fire, so you can stop freaking asking us about it already. With that, we give you: The Ultimate Guide to the Unwanted Friend Request: . Option 1: Ignore . Freud was totally on to something with that whole repression thing. Treat this friend request like all the other vaguely uncomfortable social issues hovering around your shoulders like miniature dementors (the implied ask-out from that weird girl at work! That college student's persistent requests for an informational interview! The voice mails of murmured Fiona Apple lyrics you keep leaving on your ex-girlfriend's phone when you've been hitting the sauce!) and sweep the whole thing under the rug. Facebook even makes this the default now -- instead of totally rejecting a request, you simply hit ""Not now,"" relegating it to the realm of ""hidden requests."" Hey, maybe your clueless would-be amigo will just think you never log into the ol' Book of Face. Option 2: Accept -- with caution . If you don't feel comfortable relegating your contact to Friend Request Limbo, you can instead send him or her to the halfway house of your limited profile. Then you tell Facebook to, for example, not let certain people read the stupid things your friends post on your wall. Mark Zuckerberg, of course, made this way more difficult than it needs to be. OK, deep breath: If you don't already have a Limited Profile list, click on ""more"" next to ""Lists"" in the left-hand column and then click ""Create a list."" Name it ""Limited Profile,"" ""Professional contacts,"" ""Creepers,"" whatever. Now surf on over to ""privacy settings"" under the arrow that's always on the upper right. Now [another gasp] click on Privacy settings, ""edit settings"" next to ""How you connect,"" and, next to the last option (""Who can see Wall posts by others on your profile?""), click ""custom"" and then provide the list name under the option ""Hide from."" Now accept your frenemy's friendship, hover your mouse over ""Friends"" and select your stealth list from the drop-down menu. This just takes care of others' wall posts -- you have to go through a whole 'nother rigmarole to block your photo albums, for example. Well, now that we're exhausted and in need of more caffeine from writing that all out, I think we can all acknowledge that Facebook privacy settings suck and this is probably the least time-efficient solution. But hey, if your boss really will freak out if you don't hit Accept, it may be worth the trouble. Option 3: Reject, and speak up . Sometimes, a little apologetic explanation will soothe the sting of rejection. Give the person you just turned down a legit-sounding excuse the next time you see them in person (or get them on the phone). ""As a rule, I'm not really Facebook friends with people I know professionally, but let me add you on LinkedIn"" is a perfectly reasonable thing to say, for example. Just do the explaining in an oh-by-the-way tone (NOT in a Facebook message or e-mail -- too awkward) and the person will mirror your niceness. We hope. Option 4: Clean up, already . Cue the Mom Voice: If you're really not happy with the sloppy disaster of a profile you're presenting, it might be time to clean up your image. Remember, recruiters and employers have an almost uncanny ability to find pictures and updates that you thought were private. (Mind-blowing actual exchange in Facebook's official Q&A: I set my photo album to Friends, but others are seeing, liking and commenting on my photos. The FB team responds with the digital equivalent of a dismissive wave of the hand.) And snap after snap of you passed out next to a toilet (or updates gleefully recounting your vomitacious episodes) are just, well, trashy. Rule of thumb: Don't put anything on Facebook that you wouldn't want your aunt/boss/creepy neighbor seeing, even if you give them the big Reject.","One of the ways to get around accepting a Facebook friend request is ignoring it .
There's a lengthy yet effective process for limiting what info friends have access to .
Another possible way to politely avoid someone is to reject them and give an explanation .

"(TIME.com) -- As with so many other things in life, exercise may work best if you follow the Goldilocks rule: exercise neither too little nor too much, if your goal is to shed extra weight, a new study finds. Previous research has shown that exercise alone doesn't reliably lead to weight loss -- without accompanying restrictions in diet -- a dismaying fact that many hopeful weight-losers know firsthand. But a recent Danish study suggests that physical activity can indeed help shrink your pants size, so long as you hit the sweet spot -- perhaps somewhere around a half-hour a day, at least for young men. For the study, researchers at the University of Copenhagen recruited 61 sedentary and moderately overweight men, mostly in their 20s and early 30s, and randomly assigned them to one of three groups: a control group that remained sedentary with no changes to diet or activity; another group that took up a 30-minutes-a-day routine of moderate exercise like jogging or biking (each participant worked out for either half an hour or until he burned 300 calories); or a third group that exercised more vigorously, for an hour a day or until they burned 600 calories. TIME.com: Should you drink if you're training for a race? Before launching into the 13-week exercise regimen, all the men underwent a baseline checkup to gauge their overall health and fitness: all were overweight but not obese, and they were metabolically healthy. During the 13 weeks, the men were instructed not to make any purposeful changes to their eating habits; they also kept food diaries that the researchers checked later, and on certain days they wore motion sensors to track how much activity they were engaging in outside of their exercise routines. By the end of the 13 weeks, the results were both expected and unexpected, the researchers reported. Not surprisingly, the sedentary group saw no changes in their weight. The men in the high-intensity exercise group lost an average of 5 pounds, but while weight loss was expected, the researchers said these men lost about 20% less than they would have anticipated, given how many extra calories they were burning. Even more surprising were the results from the moderate exercise group: these men lost an average of 7 pounds each, 83% more than what the researchers would have guessed based on calorie expenditure alone. TIME.com: Your iPod can help you run faster and harder . So, what happened? It's not entirely clear from the study, but lead researcher Mads Rosenkilde had some theories, according to the New York Times. First, the intense exercisers were probably compensating for their extra activity by eating more food. Although the added consumption noted in their food diaries wasn't enough to explain their smaller-than-expected weight loss, Rosenkilde thinks they were likely eating more food than they jotted down. In addition, data from the motion sensors showed that the men who exercised the most were sedentary when they weren't working out; they spent most of their free time sitting, probably because they were tired, Rosenkilde said. In contrast, the men who exercised for 30 minutes at at time became more active throughout the day, probably opting to take the stairs instead of the elevator, for instance, and moving more in general, Rosenkilde said. ""It was little things, but they add up,"" Rosenkilde told the Times. Overall, Rosenkilde concluded, people who exercise less may end up burning just enough calories to lose weight, but not enough to feel compelled to replace them, either by eating more or remaining sedentary otherwise. Those who exercise a lot, on the other hand, may feel more drained, which prompts them to compensate. TIME.com: 5 common mistakes you're making at the gym . The findings are intriguing, but it's hard to say how generalizable they are to groups other than young, healthy men. It's also not known how exercise may impact weight loss over the long term. The Times reports: . ""The study also was short-term, and the results might shift over the course of, say, a year of continued exercise, Mr. Rosenkilde says. The men working out for 60 minutes were, after all, packing on some muscle, while the 30-minute exercisers were not. ""That extra muscle offset some of the vigorous exercisers' weight loss in the short term -- they sloughed off fat but added muscle, decreasing their net loss -- but over the longer term it could amp up their metabolism, aiding in weight control.""

"(CNN) -- The undocumented immigrant population in the United States rose to an estimated 11.7 million in 2012, up from 11.5 million in 2011, according to report released by the Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends Project. The number includes those who crossed U.S. borders illegally, as well as those who came in with temporary visas but stayed past their expiration date, Pew said Monday about its estimate, based on U.S. government data. Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at Pew and co-author of the study, says the data available cannot point to a particular cause for the increase, but he says the improving U.S. economy could be a factor. According to Pew, in 2007, there were an estimated 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the United Sates. The number decreased to 11.3 million by 2009, breaking a rising trend that had held for two decades. One reason for the decrease could have been the recession. In 2009, the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank that seeks a ""pro-immigrant, low-immigration vision,"" said Census data indicated that more than 1 million undocumented immigrants left the previous year, a departure that began even before the nation's economy took a turn for the worse. Immigrants from Mexico are still the largest group within the undocumented population -- 52% as of 2012 -- but the number of recent Mexican immigrants has decreased at higher rates than the general group. That signals a shift in the demographic makeup of those entering illegally into the United States. ""They are coming from all parts of the world other than Mexico. Central American immigrants are a part of that, but so are immigrants from Asia and Europe,"" Lopez said. ""The report points to border apprehension trends, too -- the number of Mexicans apprehended at the border by the border patrol is down in the last year or so."" Pew estimated there are now about 6 million Mexican undocumented immigrants in the United States. Lopez said that Southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina have seen an increase in undocumented immigrants because their economies have fared better than California since the 1990s. Texas, a state that weathered the recession better than others, was the only state that didn't see a drop in undocumented immigrants in the past few years. According to Pew, its methodology ""compares a demographic estimate of the number of immigrants residing legally in the country with the total number of immigrants as measured by a survey."" The difference is assumed to be the number of unauthorized immigrants in the survey, a number that is later adjusted for omissions from the survey. The new data could also affect the debate on a potential comprehensive immigration reform which has stalled in the House of Representatives after the Senate approved a bill earlier this year that would provide a path to citizenship to those living here illegally. CNN's Cindy Y. Rodriguez contributed to this report.","Undocumented immigrant population rose to 11.7 million in 2012 .

"(MNN.com) -- A family friend agreed to watch my dog Shiloh while I was on vacation. When I returned, he informed me that the name Lulu seemed like a better fit, so that's what he called her until the name stuck. I made a mental note to find reputable boarding facilities in my neighborhood, packed up Lulu's things and left. Even though I was upset at the time, changing my dog's name back to Shiloh never occurred to me. Perhaps that's why I was slightly amused â€” and a little baffled â€” when NFL quarterback Tim Tebow celebrated his move to the New York Jets football team in the spring by changing his dog's name from Bronco to Bronx. Sports writers flooded Twitter with jokes about the move (check out the hashtag #rejectedTebowDogNames), while some pet owners complained about the name change. But do dogs really know the difference? Each year, millions of cats and dogs are adopted from animal shelters or rescue groups. More often than not, those pets get new names to go with those new homes. ""Dogs don't have a concept of identity the way we do,"" says certified New York dog trainer Renee Payne. ""It might be confusing if you change [the name] regularly, but everyone I know calls their dogs several different nicknames. You can always add on; you just want to have some consistency. It has to be something you consistently call them."" MNN: Charismatic animals with political ambitions . Certified dog trainer Amber Burckhalter adds that a name change can be good for pets, particularly if they were abused. Consistent use of a new name helps them adjust to a new and different life. ""It would be a good idea to change their name if they were rescued and were mistreated and that name is the name that was used,"" says Burckhalter, owner of K-9 Coach dog training and boarding facility in Smyrna, Georgia. ""You don't want them to have a negative association. It should be a new life, new owners, new name."" Regardless of the situation, if you are planning a name change, here are a few tips to help you and your pet adjust. Stay positive: Dogs respond to your actions, not your words. When making a change, Payne recommends saying the new name in a happy and excited tone, preferably when there are few distractions. ""When he looks at you, say 'Good boy!'"" Payne says. ""You just want him to associate that word with looking at you."" MNN: 5 reasons why you shouldn't raise wild animals as pets . Turn over a new leaf: Pairing recall training exercises, such as fetch, with a name change can help reinforce good behavior, says Burckhalter, whose pack includes three dogs, one cat, a human child and a husband. ""If I took my dog to the dog park and yelled 'Dutch, Dutch, Dutch' and the dog ignored me, and this has gone on for several years, we may suggest you change the name to associate a new behavior,"" she says. Make it a gradual transition: To help pets adjust and make the connection, Burckhalter suggests using both names for about a week. ""If you want to call her Tallulah and her name is Lilly, say 'LillyTallulah, LillyTallulah' for about a week, then drop the old name,"" she says. If it rhymes with 'Bo,' just say no: With all due respect to White House dog Bo Obama, avoid names that mimic the word No. That applies to names like Jojo as well. ""Anything that sounds like a negative is something you want to avoid,"" Burckhalter says. ""I'm not a fan of names that sound like a correction."" Need inspiration? Bella, Molly and Oliver rank high among the 485,000 pets insured by VPI insurance company. For the past two years, Bella has ranked No. 1 for dogs; Bailey, Max, Lucy and Molly round out the top five. For cats, the names Bella, Max, Chloe, Oliver and Lucy topped the list in 2011. Based on Tebow's performance next season, Bronx just could make an appearance on the 2012 list. MNN: Outdoor cats are prolific killers, study finds . ""You don't want to change a dog's name on a whim,"" says Burckhalter. ""I don't know that Tim changing his dog's name is the best idea, but once is not bad."" Perhaps it's time for Lulu to drop a name that we both associate with less than stellar behavior. I can only hope that Shiloh does not enjoy eating my shoes. Have you changed your pet's name? Join the conversation by following Morieka and Lulu on Twitter @soulpup today.

"(CNN) -- Cirque du Soleil and a Las Vegas casino are facing thousands of dollars in citations after a performer fell nearly 100 feet to her death during a show in June. The performer, Sarah Guillot-Guyard, plunged to the floor after the wire rope from which she was suspended broke, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said in a statement Tuesday outlining the results of its investigation into her death. Guillot-Guyard, an experienced acrobat and aerialist, died from ""multiple blunt force trauma,"" OSHA said. The fall happened as Guillot-Guyard, 31, was performing in the final scene of the long-running Cirque du Soleil show ""Ka"" in front of an audience at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on June 29. During the scene, a mock battle, performers were suspended in the air on lines controlled by wireless remote controls. The wire rope Guillot-Guyard was attached to was severed by her ""rapid ascent,"" which caused the rope to come out of the pulley and scrape against a ""shear point,"" according to OSHA. She fell 94 feet to the floor, it said. Shortcomings cited . The agency said Cirque du Soleil hadn't trained Guillot-Guyard properly and had failed to adequately protect employees working for the show. Those issues were among the six citations OSHA proposed for Cirque du Soleil, with fines totaling more than $25,000. It issued three citations for the MGM Grand, with total penalties of $7,000, saying the casino's employees were exposed to hazards because of shortcomings in Cirque du Soleil's safety measures. Both companies said they would appeal. ""Cirque du Soleil completed an exhaustive review of its safety policies and procedures in the wake of the tragic accident involving Sarah,"" Cirque du Soleil said in a statement. ""We have redoubled our efforts to ensure the overall diligence and safety of our performers and crew."" MGM said that ""safety always has been the top priority for both MGM Resorts and Cirque du Soleil and we continue to work to ensure the safety of our cast and crew."" 'You could hear screaming' In the immediate aftermath of Guillot-Guyard's death, one man who witnessed her fall described the horrific sequence of events. Guillot-Guyard ""was being hoisted up the side of the stage and then just plummeted down,"" Dan Mosqueda told the Las Vegas Sun newspaper. ""Initially, a lot of people in the audience thought it was part of the choreographed fight,"" he said. ""But you could hear screaming, then groaning, and we could hear a female artist crying from the stage."" The show was suspended after the fatal accident. It resumed performances more than two weeks later. Guillot-Guyard was born in Paris, specialized as an acrobat and aerialist, and had performed for more than 20 years, according to a website for Cirquefit, which describes itself as a circus and fitness program for kids. She taught classes through that program. Nicknamed ""Sassoon,"" she was part of the original cast of ""Ka,"" Cirque du Soleil said in a statement issued shortly after her death.

"(CNN) -- In July, the world's newest vertigo-inducing observation deck opened in the mountains in Austria. It joins an adrenaline-inducing roll call of clever platforms offering spectacular views. 1. Dachstein Stairway to Nothingness (Austria) Visitors to Dachstein's Stairway to Nothingness must first cross Austria's highest bridge, which is 328 feet (100 meters) long and straddles a drop of 1,300 feet (396 meters). They then face 14 steps that descend from the cliff face and which are surrounded by glass walls. The entire structure took six months to build and was created by an engineering firm specializing in high-altitude construction. The bridge that leads to the steps is the highest in Austria. Dachstein Stairway to Nothingness, Dachstein Glacier, Austria; +43 0 3687/22042 800; admission free for children under 12, from $4 for adults . More: Insider Guide: Best of Vienna . 2. Tokyo Skytree observation decks (Japan) The Tokyo Skytree is the world's third-tallest structure, with a height of 2,080 feet (634 meters), and has Japan's two tallest observation decks: the lower one is located at 1,148 feet (350 meters) and has a section of glass flooring. The upper one, which has floor-to-ceiling windows and 360-degree-views of the city, has a height of 1476 feet (450 meters). On a clear day, Mount Fuji can be seen from the observation decks.

Kinzua Skywalk (United States) When the Kinzua Viaduct was built in Pennsylvania in 1882, it was the longest and highest viaduct in the world. In 1900 it was rebuilt to carry heavier trains, using 3,175 tons of steel and 895,000 rivets. In 2003, a tornado destroyed 11 of the 20 towers and it was decided that the remaining towers would be used to support the Skywalk. The Skywalk extends 624 feet (190 meters) into the Kinzua Gorge and glass panels allow visitors to peer into the gorge below. Kinzua Skywalk, 1721 Lindholm Drive, Mt. Jewett, Pennsylvania; +1 814 965 2646; admission: free . More: 10 easy ways to experience Navajo America . 4. AlpspiX viewing platform (Germany) At the base of Germany's Alpspitze mountain, the AlpspiX viewing platform comprises two steel beams, both of which measure 79 feet (24 meters) in length. Visitors brave enough to walk to the end of the glass-walled platforms can look 3,281 feet (1,000 meters) down into the valley. The platform remains open in winter, when the grid flooring allows snow and ice to pass through. AlpspiX viewing platform, Zugspitze, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany; admission: free . 5.

"(CNN) -- Ukraine and Dynamo Kiev striker Andriy Shevchenko is hanging up his football boots to begin a career in politics. Ahead of the October parliamentary election, the 35-year-old Shevchenko, who scored 48 goals in 111 caps for his country, is to join ""Ukraine -- Forward!"", a pro-business party, which was formed by politicians who were expelled by the main opposition coalition that used to be led by former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. ""It is certain, Dynamo Kiev is now my former club. This club, which I love with all my heart and I will always support,"" the former AC Milan and Chelsea forward told the Dynamo website.

"(CNN) -- Capt. Kirk was wrong: Space is not ""Star Trek's"" ""final frontier."" A Web-based ""Star Trek""  podcast tells the ""continuing mission"" of the USS Montana. It's the Internet. Television seems to have abandoned the 40-year-old franchise for now, leaving fans to create adventures using the Web, high technology and their imaginations. Two seasoned Web producers are rolling out an unofficial audio podcast based on the Trek universe two years after Paramount canceled its remaining ""Star Trek"" TV series and a year before producer J.J. Abrams' much-anticipated ""Star Trek"" film. ""People are hungry for new material,"" said Sebastian Prooth, co-executive producer of ""Star Trek: The Continuing Mission."" ""But they're not hungry for McDonald's. They're hungry for gourmet.""  Interactive: A history of ""Star Trek"" » . Prooth and co-executive producer Andy Tyrer plan to serve up their pilot episode ""Ghost Ship"" on Christmas Day, after 10 weeks of painstaking production via the Internet from the UK and five U.S. states. Tyrer comes to the project after producing ""WhoUniverse,"" a podcast about the long-running BBC TV series ""Doctor Who,"" and Prooth after working on the technology podcast ""Global Geek."" ""The Continuing Mission"" centers on the adventures of the USS Montana, a starship similar to Kirk's famous USS Enterprise of the original 1960s TV series. Commanded by Capt. Paul Edwards, the Montana is accidentally thrust from the 23rd century into the 24th century, about five years before the time of TV's ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" which debuted in 1987. During the coming year, Prooth and Tyrer plan to produce and post on their Web site 10 half-hour episodes. ""When we committed to this, we made the decision that we were going to treat this like a proper production,"" said Tyrer from his home in England. The drama's cast members perform their lines from studios in Los Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Greenfield, Indiana; Rochester, Minnesota;  and Knoxville, Tennessee. Tyrer records their performances at his London studio and Prooth directs from Scotts Valley, California. ""Every time an actor records his lines, Sebastian is on the Skype [audio Web link] with them, giving them directions about how he wants the scene to be played out,"" said Tyrer. Despite Prooth's distractions from his day job at a printing shop and Tyrer's gig as an IT consultant, they've produced a slick, professional-quality drama in a genre that's threatening to give mainstream TV studios a run for their money. To prove the point, an online ""Star Trek"" video series called ""New Voyages"" shocked Hollywood this fall by winning TV Guide's 2007 Online Video Award for best sci-fi Webisode -- defeating Sci Fi Channel's better-funded ""Battlestar Galactica."" ""I think it shows what can be done on a limited budget on the Internet,"" said ""Battlestar Galactica"" producer/writer Ronald D. Moore. ""The bar to distribution is much lower than it was in the past. People can, on their own, start doing programming out there that is of a quality that approaches what we can do on air -- not maybe at the moment, but if you compare those 'New Voyages' episodes to the original series, they're in the ballpark with what the original series was able to do."" The award for ""New Voyages"" is evidence that ""Star Trek"" fans have traveled light years from their days at 1970s conventions, where they traded handwritten novellas and rough-hewn screenplays based on the original NBC TV series. Three decades later, they're producing feature-length dramas complete with ""Star-Wars""-style special effects. Franchise owner CBS/Paramount has traditionally turned a blind eye to these projects as long as they remain nonprofit and don't harm copyrighted material. ""In order for 'Star Trek' to survive, it has to change,"" said Prooth. ""It has to become something else so it is relevant and people can connect with it -- where they are in 2007 -- rather than where they were in 1987 or 1966."" Moore -- who cut his teeth in Hollywood writing and producing ""Star Trek"" TV and films -- predicts Webisodes ultimately will improve programming quality at TV and film studios. ""I think it'll spur competition. They're already aware that they're in a fight for attention -- for eyeballs out there,"" said Moore. ""They're going to have to continue to supply a product that surpasses that of what startup companies, or people, can do on their own dime."" But don't expect fan-produced Webisodes to be threatening Hollywood studios anytime soon, said Robert Thompson of Syracuse University's Center for Television and Popular Culture. He predicts the Web will become a place for entertainment development. ""The Internet is one great big farm team... offering the opportunity for people to make stuff ... put it out there ... and allow some of it to rise to the top,"" Thompson said. ""Then, the best stuff will be co-opted or bought -- and the people will be hired and move into the mainstream area."" Last year, creators of the fictional video blogger lonelygirl15 won a Web deal after attracting fame online. In 2008, NBC reportedly will begin airing ""Quarterlife,"" popular Webisodes of which debuted online. It was created by the producers of TV's ""thirtysomething."" Royalties for Webisodes are at the heart of the ongoing Hollywood writers' strike, but Thompson said the television industry shouldn't be too distracted by what's available online. ""Television needs to do what made them appealing in the first place, which is good, professional storytelling,"" said Thompson. ""What television should be creating now are the next 'Star Trek' franchises -- not 'Star Trek' per se -- but the shows that Webisodes in five or 10 years will be based on.""","""Battlestar Galactica"" writer/producer: ""Webisodes"" will spur better TV, films .

"(CNN) -- No one should be surprised by the technical problems that have plagued the new health insurance exchange website, HealthCare.gov, which allows millions of Americans to sign up and buy health coverage. Angry, OK. Disappointed, of course. But surprised? Don't be. Large-scale software projects are hard. Failures or delays in schedule, budget and functionality are so common as to almost be the norm, not the exception. Sure, the website rollout could have been handled a lot better. With all the delays and warning signs, the government could have stopped touting HealthCare.gov and teasing the public with messages such as ""5 days to open enrollment. Don't wait another minute."" But the federal government has never had a fantastic track record in dealing with technology projects. This was not just an Obamacare problem. Most of the government has little experience in managing such a big, complex project, and management is a remarkably large part of the effort; building a system like this takes far more than just programming. Maybe it should have hired a general contractor to supervise the 55 contractors who worked on the website. Maybe it should have looked into launching at a later date instead of October 1. But the bottom line is that technical glitches are an inescapable part of our digital life. We see this in the private sector. When United Airlines and Continental Airlines merged, the combined reservation system didn't work very well at first. The new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport outside London was saddled with software problems. Nor are tech giants immune; Windows Vista was very late because Microsoft had myriad troubles during development. The inherent nature of software is that it demands perfection. Computers do exactly what they're told to do. Even small errors can be disastrous. For example, one of the first American space probes to Venus was lost in part because of a single missing hyphen character in a program. Testing is the next hurdle. Any project needs adequate time to make sure the software works properly and to find and correct any flaws. Time, however, was in short supply with the launch of the online insurance marketplace. If development took too long, there wouldn't be enough time to test it thoroughly. That apparently was one of the problems. And even when all of the pieces are working fine, the entire system has to be tested; that can't be done until quite late in the process. Project management also plays a big role. It's very hard to estimate how long a project will take. That means it's hard to know how many programmers to devote to the task, how much it will cost and so on. Measuring progress isn't easy, either, which means it's hard to tell how far along you are. The worst problem is probably that requirements change while the software is being developed. This may mean that you have to redo work you've already done, but the effects can be more far-reaching. It's like building a house: If the owners suddenly decide they want a big floor-to-ceiling picture window on the second floor, it may require rerouting water pipes. That may require moving the ground-floor bathroom, which in turn could affect the kitchen layout, because the bathtub and the kitchen sink share drain pipes. Part of project management's job is to say ""no"" to many change requests, but that's not always possible. What if more computers are added? That's not always a solution. If the computers have to share access to resources -- say, a database of people who have signed up -- it gets complicated. Suppose you've invited many people over for dinner, more than you've ever hosted before. You and your spouse decide to share the preparation and cooking. Maybe you have sufficient counter space, but you still have only one sink, one stove and one oven. With two people, it might be relatively straightforward to take turns, but with three or four or more cooks, it can get crazy. Finally, there's the ""system integration"" problem of combining the different components. A system like the insurance exchanges is built in parts. Eventually, like a jigsaw puzzle, all the pieces have to be put together. Do the slots and tongues line up properly? Are the right parts of the picture on the right pieces? Did all of the contractors use the same shade of green for the grass? There are standard approaches, standard tools and standard software for building large-scale websites. Using them correctly takes good planning and management. That was in short supply here. The contractors building HealthCare.gov couldn't control the budget or the timing for the regulations; those were the product of Washington politics. While there are apparent programming and design errors, it's quite likely that most are the result of requirement changes rather than incompetence. The overall failure appears to have been one of project management on the part of the government. In the best of all possible worlds, the site would have launched seamlessly to serve the entire nation. But software is hard. Inexperience doesn't help. And politics just makes things messier. The Obama administration is ""excruciatingly"" embarrassed and is working hard to get the glitches fixed. Let's hope things go more smoothly the next time around. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Bellovin.","The new insurance exchange site, HealthCare.gov, has technical problems .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stumped. Signs pointed the way to two lines: one for ""Mexicanos"" (""Mexicans""), another for ""Extranjeros"" (""Foreigners."") I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where to go. Growing up in Central California, I had been called a ""Mexican"" my entire life. It's ethnic shorthand in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as ""Irish"" or my friends in New York describe themselves as ""Italian."" Later, I settled on ""Mexican-American."" But, this was Mexico. And, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for shorthand or hyphens. I was simply an American. I speak Spanish, good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language. But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't shake my American accent. So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for Extranjeros. I thought about that moment this week when Mexican president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. On the agenda, as usual, when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade. News: Mexico's new leader measured against old party . Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States. He wants to partner with the United States and Canada, and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America. And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though he offered no specifics. For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings. Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle. But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere. So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are encroaching upon their neighbor's sovereignty. And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath. And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States. You want to talk about hard feelings? There is plenty. Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn't. The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north. And more often than not, that person fit a profile -- dark skin, little education, from a poor village, etc. We're their offspring, and we're loyal to them. Not Mexico. And even though we may now be living the American Dream, having gone to good schools and taken good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it's the American Dream we're living, and not the Mexican one. Our identity might sometimes be fuzzy, but our loyalty is clear. It's to the United States. Besides, we're aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us. The feeling is mutual. They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that isn't sufficiently Mexican. Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough. Our existence is, as they see it, all about failure. If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left. And we wouldn't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless. My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans have a firmer grasp of who they are and Mexican-Americans resent that. While she's a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries. Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're a part of either. We love listening to the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. You get the best of both worlds, but you're rooted in neither. In Mexico, we're seen as Americans. And in the United States, we're considered Mexican. Now, to complicate the relationship even further, as I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect with the Diaspora. They want to put Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift ""ambassadors"" for Mexico, representing its interest in the United States. We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. Yeah. That's not going to happen. Too many hard feelings. And, with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a great country. I'm afraid you're on your own, amigos. That's fair. If at least some Mexicans aren't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that. Hmmm. Maybe we're more ""Mexican"" than I thought. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Long, troubled history divides Mexicans, Mexican-Americans .

"(CNN) -- Paula Cooper was just 16 years old when she became the youngest person on death row in the United States. That was in 1986. On Monday, after 27 years behind bars, Cooper walked out of Indiana's Rockville Correctional Facility a free woman. She emerged around 10 a.m., said Douglas S. Garrison, chief communications officer for the Indiana Department of Corrections. Cooper had an unlikely ally supporting her release: Bill Pelke, the grandson of the woman she killed. The events that ensnared both families started when Cooper was 15 and devised a plan to steal money with her friends. Arizona woman's murder conviction, death sentence overturned . After smoking marijuana and drinking wine, they went to the home of Bible teacher Ruth Pelke, 78, armed with a knife. Cooper struck Pelke with a vase, cut her arms and legs, then stabbed her in the chest and stomach 33 times, according to Indiana court records. Their loot? Just $10. An Indiana judge sentenced Cooper to death on July 11, 1986, when she was 16. More than 2 million people signed a petition asking the Indiana Supreme Court to overturn Cooper's death sentence. Maryland legislature votes to end death penalty . Pope John Paul II personally appealed to Indiana Gov. Robert Orr on behalf of the teen. But perhaps the most surprising advocate for Cooper's life was Pelke, who said he forgave Cooper for the murder three months after she was sentenced to death. ""I became convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that my grandmother would have had love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family,"" Pelke told CNN. ""I felt she wanted someone in my family to have that same sort of love and compassion. I didn't have any but was so convinced that's what she would have wanted, I begged God to give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family and do that on behalf of my grandmother."" Exonerated inmates protest Florida death row law . He said it was ""a short prayer,"" but it was answered. ""For a year and a half, whenever I thought about my grandmother, I always pictured how she died. It was terrible,"" he said. ""But when my heart was touched with compassion, forgiveness took place. I knew from that moment on when I think about her, I would no longer pictured how she died, but I would picture how she lived, and what she stood for, what she believed in -- the beautiful, wonderful person she was."" Pelke tried to visit Cooper in 1986, but the two didn't come face to face until eight years later. The two struck up an unlikely friendship over the years, exchanging messages through the prison e-mail system every week. And in 1989, the Indiana Supreme Court reduced Cooper's death sentence to 60 years in prison. Pelke said he would like to help Cooper with her transition to life outside of prison.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration plans to announce Wednesday the creation of seven ""climate hubs"" to provide information to rural communities facing extreme weather conditions. The hubs by the U .S. Department of Agriculture will provide scientific knowledge to help farmers, ranchers and landowners battle risks associated with climate change, including drought, floods, pests and fires. ""For generations, America's farmers, ranchers and forest landowners have innovated and adapted to challenges,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. However, he said, rural communities face more complex challenges today because of climate change. ""USDA's climate hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate,"" Vilsack said. The hubs will be in Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and New Mexico. Additional sub-hubs will be set up in various other states, including Michigan and California. Climate hubs will focus on regional issues, and will equip local communities with knowledge to help them adapt. ""Sub hubs will support the hub within their region and focus on a narrow and unique set of issues relative to what will be going on in the rest of the hub,"" the White House said in a statement. Rural communities have been especially hit by climate change. In the Midwest, for example, the fire season is 60 days longer than it was three decades ago, the statement said. In addition to affecting food supply and rural economies, climate change comes with a hefty price tag. ""Drought alone was estimated to cost the U.S. $50 billion from 2011 to 2013. Such risks have implications not only for agricultural producers, but for all Americans,"" the statement said. The hubs are part of a broader commitment by President Barack Obama to make climate change a priority. Vilsack will introduce the hubs at the White House on Wednesday.","Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to introduce the new venture Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- It is about to get a bit more difficult to illegally download TV shows, movies or music online. A new alert system, rolling out over the next two months, will repeatedly warn and possibly punish people violating digital copyrights. The Copyright Alert System was announced last July and has been four years in the making. If you use AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, or Verizon as your Internet service provider, you could receive the first of one of these notes starting in the next two months. The Internet provider is delivering the message, but the legwork is being done by the copyright owners, which will monitor peer-to-peer networks such as BitTorrent. They use a service called MarkMonitor, which uses a combination of people and automated systems to spot illegal downloading. It will collect the IP addresses of offenders, but no personal information. The IP addresses are turned over to the Internet providers, which will match up the address with the right customer and send the notification. The warning system is described as a graduated response. First the Internet provider will let the customer know that their Internet connection is being used to download content illegally. The note will include information to steer them away from their life of crime, including tips on how they can download content legally. There will also be tips on securing Internet connections, just in case you were unaware that your neighbor was downloading season three of ""Dexter"" using your unprotected wireless network. ""The progressive series of alerts is designed to make consumers aware of activity that has occurred using their Internet accounts, educate them on how they can prevent such activity from happening again,"" the CCI said in its announcement today. After the educational phase, the customers will be asked to acknowledge that they received the warning. If they continue to download content illegally, the alerts will threaten mild punishments, such as forcing the copyright violator to read ""educational materials,"" or throttling their Internet connection so that it is slow, making it harder to download large files. Today's announcement claims that terminating the Internet service is not one of the options. If a customer feels they are being wrongly accused, they can ask for a review, which will cost them $35 according to the Verge. The entire system will be overseen by an organization called the Center for Copyright Information, which includes content owners, such as the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America, as well as individual members including Disney, Sony Pictures, Fox, EMI and Universal. Each ISP will have a slightly different version of the system.","A new warning system will let people know they are illegally downloading content .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Liu Jianle smiles as he spots a potential suitor for his recently divorced niece among a sea of white personal ads pegged to a board. Pencil in hand, he jots down the man's details -- 33 years old, 1.7 meters tall (5 feet 7 inches), 140 pounds, a property owner, divorced but no kids. The only wrinkle is that his salary is $800 a month, not high by Shanghai standards. No matter, says Liu, his niece has a good job. Welcome to Shanghai's marriage market. Each weekend, mothers, fathers and, in Liu's case, concerned uncles, come to a sun-dappled corner of Shanghai's People's Park to find Mister or Miss Right for their children. Some write posters by hand listing their offsprings' vital statistics -- height, age, income, education and their hukou or registered hometown -- and pin them to umbrellas or shopping bags. Others come with a notebook to see what is available. Liu is a veteran. He found his son a wife here and they've been married for more than a year. ""She's 1.69 meters tall (5 feet 6 inches) and beautiful like a movie star,"" he says. ""He was happy to get the introduction."" With young Chinese told to put education and work before finding love, many struggle to find boyfriends or girlfriends, a source of deep concern for their parents in a society which emphasizes the survival of the family line. Worried family members are joined by professional matchmakers, who try to make a living from the unusual gathering. The city even organizes an ""annual love and marriage expo"" to help young people find love that attracts 18,000. ""A lot of kids who were born after 1980, they don't have siblings. So they grow up in an environment where you don't have the experience to meet with people of the opposite sex,"" Song Li, the founder of an online dating service, told CNN at the event in May. The market has been around since 2004, says Li, who runs a professional matchmaking service from the park. With almost three times as many women looking for partners than men, it can be difficult to make a successful match. Men can register for free, while she charges a fee of $500 for her female clients. She also has an age limit; men born after 1970 can sign up, but women must be under 33. ""There's a shortage of superior men,"" she says by way of explanation. It's a similar story at Fan Dongfang's booth. He says he matches 20 to 30 people a year and brandishes a clutch of wedding invitations as if to prove it. He also has a glut of women on his books. ""There are too many leftover women in Shanghai,"" he says, using a popular term to describe an educated, single, urban women over the age of 27. ""Their standards are too high."" While the numbers stack up in favor of Chinese women -- according to the China Statistics Bureau, there are now 34 million more men than women in China -- this doesn't mean they will pair up easily. Chinese men tend to ""marry down"" both in terms of age and educational level, observers say. Plus, many of China's unmarried men live in the countryside. Distance is no obstacle to the parents' matchmaking ambitions, nor is their children's consent. One mother displays a handwritten A4-sized poster in a clear plastic wallet seeking a match for her 36-year-old daughter, who works as an accountant in Toronto. The market has an ""overseas corner"" for parents who have children living abroad. ""I can't give you my name because my daughter doesn't know I'm doing this and I don't want her to find out,"" she says. ""I just want her to find someone with a stable job, who is tolerant and open-minded.""

"(CNN) -- A lot of people don't pay close attention to midterm elections. They are not as exciting as the presidential campaigns, and most Americans are just not interested in the ups and downs of individual members of Congress. But the last midterm that a president faces matter very much. President Obama knows more than anyone that he has much at stake in the midterm elections. If Republicans are able to regain control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House in November, they will have two years to inflict significant damage on the administration's agenda and set the terms of debate for the 2016 election. Republicans have already been remarkably successful at using their standing in Congress to cause problems for President Obama. Even though Democrats have controlled the Senate, House Republicans have stood as an impenetrable barrier against almost any substantial legislation and used the lower chamber as a platform to keep public attention focused on deficit reduction. If they can grab hold of the Senate as well, their power will vastly increase. Lame-duck presidents have repeatedly seen the ways in which an opposition Congress can be used as a battering ram against the White House. During the late 1950s, the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower learned this the hard way. In the 1958 midterm elections, Democrats, who already controlled Congress, vastly increased the size of their majorities in both chambers. Most importantly, the number of Northern liberals grew to counteract the power of Southern conservative Democrats. Liberals used the next two years to put forward a huge array of proposals—ranging from medical care for the elderly to civil rights—that liberalized the political conversation. President Eisenhower, who was focused on balancing the budget and cutting federal spending, had little success holding back this idealistic bunch. Although they didn't have much legislative success before John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson arrived in the White House, congressional Democrats were able to set the agenda for the next decade, with many of their ideas culminating in the Great Society. One of the most influential presidents of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan, learned about his diminishing clout after the 1986 midterm elections, when Democrats retook control of the Senate (which they had lost in the 1980 election) and retained control of the House. Between 1987 and 1989, Democrats used their power in Congress to finally hit back against the conservative revolution. With powerful Speaker James Wright at the helm in the House, Democrats obtained a budget deal that increased taxes and preserved most key domestic spending. They also expanded Medicare and built pressure for clean air initiatives. On foreign policy, they launched a devastating investigation into the Iran-Contra scandal that severely damaged President Reagan's reputation, while working on a peace plan for Nicaragua, a country that had been a focus of Reagan's anti-Communist efforts. If anyone survived the lame-duck blues it was President Bill Clinton. In the 1998 midterm elections, Republicans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. Undeterred, they managed to impeach Clinton on December 19, 1998. In the months that followed, Clinton was able to avoid conviction because the Senate refused to move forward with the decision of their counterparts. Over the next couple of years, Republicans suffered as much as Clinton, as there was a backlash against what they had done. Clinton watched his approval ratings soar while the booming economy continued to lift the president's spirits. Nonetheless, Republicans still had considerable clout through their congressional base. They continued to keep the public agenda focused on deficit reduction and spending cuts and offered almost no space for Clinton to pursue any major domestic initiatives. Clinton's presidency—even with his popularity and a booming economy—sputtered in its final moments with Republicans making sure that no policy-making opportunities emerged at the end for him to build his legacy. Nobody understood how that lame duck period could really hurt like President George W. Bush. At the height of power after his 2004 defeat of John Kerry, Bush struggled after Democrats regained control of Congress in 2006. Democrats used the next two years to get their bills through Congress, including an economic stimulus package, ethics reform, a higher minimum wage and energy legislation that raised fuel efficiency standards. They also mounted enormous pressure on the administration to change course in Iraq -- which the President did with the announcement of the surge in 2007—and blocked any hope that existed for him to pursue spending cuts. The midterms this November will matter a great deal. If Republicans win control of the Senate, President Obama will be in for some tough times. Some Democrats have complained that the White House has not been doing enough to provide assistance in the midterms. If that accusation is true, the White House might want to rethink its strategy given the important two years that lay ahead.","Julian Zelizer: The last midterm election that a president faces matters very much .

"(CNN) -- The fiancée of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber confirmed Thursday she took part in an illegal marriage in exchange for money 17 years ago — a chapter in her life that her husband-to-be didn't know about until it came to light this week. ""This is the most painful part for me,"" Cylvia Hayes, 47, said in a news conference in Portland. ""John Kitzhaber deserved to know the history of the person he was forming a relationship with. The fact that I did not disclose this to him meant that he has learned about this in the most public and unpleasant way."" Fraudulent green card marriages are a federal offense, but Hayes said she needed the money at the time, when she was 29. The two were married in Washington state. ""We met only a handful of times. We never lived together. I have not had any contact with him since the divorce finalized in 2002,"" Hayes said in the news conference, which was recorded by CNN affiliate KPTV. Asked if Hayes could face charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon gave CNN a firm, ""No comment."" Kitzhaber is running for re-election next month, having already served three nonconsecutive terms. The Democrat was first elected in 1994 and remained in office until 2003. In 2010, he was elected to a third term, and he's now seeking a fourth in a race that he's expected to win. He won his last election with 65% of the vote. While Kitzhaber and Hayes aren't married, they've been a couple for more than a decade and engaged since this summer, according to local news reports. Hayes has been officially referred to as Oregon's first lady during Kitzhaber's latest term. The story became public after the Willamette Week local newspaper reported she had an undisclosed third marriage. Further digging into the marriage found that the groom was an 18-year-old immigrant from Ethiopia, nearly a decade her junior. Kitzhaber didn't find out about the marriage until Tuesday, Hayes said in the press conference. ""It was wrong then and it is wrong now and I am here today to accept the consequences, some of which will be life changing. And I cannot predict what direction this will go,"" Hayes said. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Oregon's first lady said she married an immigrant in exchange for money.

"(CNN) -- A manhunt for a 33-year-old sought in the disappearance of an Arkansas real estate agent ended with his arrest Monday, police say. The Little Rock Police Department arrested Arron Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, after an arrest warrant issued Sunday said he was charged with kidnapping. The warrant provided no other details, but Lt. Carl Minden with the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said Lewis was a suspect in the disappearance of Beverly Carter. Carter went to show a home in the small community of Scott on Thursday. She then vanished. Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay told reporters Monday morning that his investigators were questioning Lewis. When asked whether the suspect was talking, Holladay said: ""We will have to see how cooperative he is as the day progresses."" Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police while he was a person of interest in her disappearance. Suspect was in wreck . Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office. Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident, and ""Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,"" the report says. Another witness told police that ""the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,"" according to the report. Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says. At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Minden said. ""While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,"" the lieutenant said in a statement. The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said. Dozens of volunteers -- as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They resumed their search Monday in two areas in the southern part of the county, the sheriff said. ""At this point we don't know where she is,"" Holladay said. The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said. The Sheriff's Office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties. Official: Agent's cell phone used . The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he ""knew something was wrong."" Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the Sheriff's Office. There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Later he explained to HLN's Nancy Grace that included text messages, but he declined to elaborate on the nature of the texts. Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris. ""I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,"" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. ""She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her."" The elder Carl Carter told CNN affiliate KARK-TV that ""I would just like to have my wife back."" The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon. Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement. He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said. CNN's John Branch and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff spokesman says there were text messages sent from missing agent's phone .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has announced new initiatives to curtail what he calls ""the epidemic"" of rape and sexual assaults in our armed forces. In 2010, an estimated 19,000 service members were raped or sexually assaulted by other service members. Clearly, more resources devoted to counseling for victims and training for prosecutors and judges will help. But the incidence of unpunished rapes will continue and so will the damaging effects these illegal acts have on troop morale and preparedness. This epidemic requires an overhaul of the military justice system. The military's chain of command structure keeps most cases of rape and sexual assault from reaching the prosecution level. According to a Defense Department study, only 8% of sexual assailants are referred to military court, compared with 40% of similar offenders prosecuted in the civilian court system. The case of Army Spc. Andrea Neutzling of Ohio is a sad testimony to a justice system gone wrong. According to Neutzling, in 2002, while serving in South Korea, she was sexually assaulted by an intoxicated soldier she knew. She reported the assault to her commander, who gave the assailant a slap on the wrist punishment of five days of base restriction. Three years later in New Jersey, preparing for deployment to Iraq with a military police unit, she was again assaulted by a fellow soldier. Fearing nothing would happen if she reported the attack, Neutzling instead kept the incident to herself. A month later in Iraq, she said she was raped by two soldiers who threatened to beat her if she struggled. Although she suffered serious bodily injuries from the rape, she chose not to report it; instead she slept on a cot with her rifle pointed toward the door for the first few days after the attack. Soon, the chaplain was told about the attack by a woman in Neutzling's unit who reported that the perpetrators were showing a video of the rape to others. But her chaplain didn't believe her, later telling Neutzling, ""You don't act like a rape victim."" The commander said it was a ""they said, she said"" situation, and because she was married at the time of the incident, he threatened to charge her with adultery. The men who raped Neutzling were never charged, investigated or penalized. In the current military chain of command structure, Neutzling's commander and staff sergeant did nothing wrong. Commanders can decide whether to investigate and issue virtually any punishment or, in this case, no punishment at all -- they have complete authority and discretion over how a degrading and violent assault is handled. Marine Cpl. Sarah Albertson suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, but not because of her service in Falluja, Iraq. According to Albertson, she was raped at a California base by a fellow Marine who outranked her. When she reported the assault to her commander, she was ordered to keep quiet and to continue following her assailant's orders. The rapist was promoted, but she lost her security clearance and subsequently left the Marines. Albertson and Neutzling are two of 28 plaintiffs in a lawsuit against former secretaries of state Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates that accuses the military of failing to prevent or prosecute instances of rape and sexual assault. In the U.S. military, a woman is more likely to be raped by a co-worker than killed by the enemy. The epidemic infects every branch of the armed services, includes female and male victims, and extends to the military academies, which reported that 520 cadets and midshipmen experienced unwanted sexual contact during the 2009-2010 academic year. Male service members are not immune to rape or sexual assault. In a 2010 survey of 14,000 active-duty service men, 126 anonymously reported unwanted sexual contact by a male or female co-worker in the past 12 months. A more disturbing statistic speaks to the distrust that servicemen and women have in the military's ability to investigate and fairly prosecute alleged rapists and perpetrators of sexual assault. Only 13.5% of victims actually report the crimes. Victims deserve an impartial investigation and the opportunity to have perpetrators tried in a military court of law. My bill, the STOP Act (H.R. 3435), takes complete authority and discretion out of the hands of commanders and gives that authority to objective experts. The bipartisan STOP Act creates a new office of oversight and response to handle all possible cases of rape and sexual assault in the military, enabling unbiased personnel to determine the appropriate path of action for each report. The office would be housed in the Department of Defense and staffed by civilian and military experts trained to manage investigations of sexual assault. My proposal is not unique to modern defense forces. Several of our closest allies have instituted meaningful reforms to manage cases of rape and sexual assault in their military. The United Kingdom has largely transferred authority in military sexual assault cases to independent, impartial civilian personnel. Australia and Canada allow aggrieved service men and women to lodge complaints and access external agencies. All three countries strive to keep their internal military adjudication process independent from the influence of the military chain of command. We need to do the same. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford soon will begin chemotherapy to treat a rare and aggressive cancer, a doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital in the city said Wednesday. Dr. Zane Cohen said Ford has a malignant liposarcoma, and a second biopsy on his tumor done Monday shows it is aggressive. ""However, we are optimistic about this tumor,"" Cohen said. Ford, who recently announced he will not run for re-election, will start chemotherapy by Friday afternoon. The cancer has spread from the fatty tissue of Ford's abdomen to other parts of his body, including his buttocks, Cohen said. The doctor added that this type of tumor comprises only about 1% of all cancers and has at least 60 different types of cells, making it difficult to treat. Cohen said there would be 18 days in between chemo and there would be another 18-day break, after which doctors would reassess Ford's treatment plan. Those three-day rounds of chemotherapy might eventually be followed by surgery, radiation or both, he said. The health ailment adds to the list of struggles facing Ford, whose fall from grace began in May 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. The Toronto city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior. Ford didn't back down, though, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. The mayor apologized for ""a lot of stupid things,"" including having used crack cocaine, but he refused to resign or enter rehab. In fact, despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in Canada as well as the United States, Ford launched a bid for re-election. This past spring, after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly showed him smoking crack cocaine, Ford relented on one front: by going into rehab. He returned to work in late June, after a two-month rehab stint, saying he was ""ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated"" by some of his past actions. But he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning, saying to the voters of Toronto, ""I look forward to serving you for many, many more years."" Ford's term officially ends December 1. When he announced his decision not to seek re-election last week, Ford has asked his brother, Doug Ford, to run for mayor in the October 27 balloting. Doug Ford released a statement Wednesday on behalf of the Ford family saying of his brother's diagnosis: ""I can't begin to share how devastating this has been for Rob and our family."" ""Rob has always been so strong for all of us and now I ask us all to be strong for him,"" Doug Ford said in the statement, adding, ""Rob will beat this."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Rob Ford decided not to run for re-election after his tumor was discovered .

A question that highlighted another issue: while non-Chinese nationals can have trouble getting a cab, it can be even worse for those with darker skin. Project manager Kris Derban has lived in China for eight years. He long suspected that taxis were not picking him up because he is an African-American. Recently his suspicions were confirmed when he asked a driver why he had hesitated to take him. ""The driver said, 'I worry Africans will run off and not pay.'"" But catching a cab isn't the only problem. Another common misconception Derban has to contend with is that he is a drug dealer, he said. ""I'll be with a group of friends and someone specifically comes up to ask me if I have drugs. At first I was offended. Now I tease them and say: 'No, do you have drugs?'"" Derban laughs off such incidents, finding humor in the ignorance. Others have been less fortunate. Liberian student David Johnson moved to China just two months ago. He said he has already been subjected to several racist remarks. ""One time I was walking down the street and someone called me a stupid black c***,"" he reported. ""Maybe it was because I was with a Chinese girl and they don't like that."" Reports of this kind of racism date back to when Africans were first welcomed into China to study at Chinese universities in the 1960s. And in 1988, a violent, 300-strong mob broke into an African students' dormitory at Nanjing University and destroyed their possessions while chanting ""down with the black devils."" The number of Africans and foreigners living in China has risen significantly since then. Communities have grown up in major cities such as Guangzhou, where 20,000 Africans now live, according to official figures. Some scholars, trying to account for the number of undocumented migrants, put the estimate at around 200,000. However, ""even in those cities where there is now a concentration of black people, still most Chinese have little to no contact with them,"" said Barry Sautman, a professor of social sciences at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology who specializes in the issue of race in China. As such, their ideas about blacks are largely shaped by the media, Sautman, said, adding, ""In the media, Africa is portrayed as a house of horrors, with a huge number of people dying from diseases, wars and extremely high crime rates."" Cultural bias against dark skin . But it is not just Africans and those of African descent who report prejudices in China; others with darker skin are also affected. Hatim Shah from Mumbai in India has worked in finance in China for six years. He recalled Beijing's visa crackdown on foreigners working or living illegally in the city around the time of the 2008 Olympics. ""I was set to move into a house, but when I went with the landlord to the police station to register, he told me I couldn't live there because the police didn't want brown people in the vicinity,"" he recalled. ""My white South African roommate had no problem."" Although Shah believes the situation has since improved, he still feels that ""if you are brown here, you are not equal."" He added: ""They assume dark skinned people are doing something dodgy. If there's a white person in the room, they'd rather speak to the white person."" Paler skin has historically been prized in China and much of Asia. Even today skin-lightening products remain popular. ""Conversely, darker skin is associated with being a peasant,"" said Sautman. ""So, if you think peasants are oafish and backwards, you associate darker skin with that."" However, experts say, just because there is a historic prejudice against dark skin in China, it was never a given that this prejudice would automatically translate into prejudice against races with darker skins. Sautman believes that type of prejudice was imported from the West. ""It was imported as early as the 1880s by Chinese intellectuals exposed to the Western racist literature. During the Maoist era, expressing such ideas fell out of fashion. Instead, the state promoted the idea that the Chinese should join Africans and rise up together against the white imperialists,"" said Sautman. But from the beginning of China's reform era from the late 1970s, some Western ideas were allowed to flood back in. While the Chinese government maintains there is no racisim here-- many clearly beg to differ. But they say, given that racism seems less historically entrenched in China than in the West, there is hope it can be stamped out more easily. The 'Obama effect' Some non-Chinese nationals say the election of U.S. President Barack Obama and the growing number of black sports stars playing for Chinese teams - such as basketball's Stephon Marbury and footballer Didier Drogba - has helped change perceptions. A study conducted by Yunying Zhang at Austin Peay State University and Alexis Tan at Washington State University showed that negative stereotypes held about African-Americans-- for example, that they were 'violent', 'loud' or 'aggressive' -- were less likely to be held by Chinese people after President Obama's election. Meanwhile Africans and African-Americans living in China report that since the election, Chinese people they meet are now more likely to bring up the president or the latest athlete signed to a Chinese team than mention negative stereotypes. Real-life encounters with ordinary Africans and African-Americans also play a part in dispelling racist myths. In a study of attitudes in Guangzhou, Sautman found a correlation between Chinese people actually living and working with Africans and having a more positive attitude towards the African community there. Derban, for his part, said: ""I try to present myself in such a way that I always leave a good impression. The racism here might be blatant, but, unlike the West, because it's not hidden, I know what I am dealing with. I can openly talk to people about it and help change impressions."" Loretta Evans, an African-American who has been in China for eight years feels the same. ""Yes, I've sometimes had people stare or touch my skin, as if to see whether it's going to rub off,"" she said. ""But I think this comes from curiosity not negativity. Here I don't feel the racial tension I feel back home. I've done things, such as setting up my own geophysics company, which as I black woman I might not have been able to do in the States. ""Yes, I'm treated differently from Chinese people. But here I'm different first, black second.""","Non-white foreigners living in China report more instances of prejudice .

"(CNN) -- World-famous physicist Stephen Hawking recently said the world as we know it could be obliterated instantaneously. Basically, we would be here one minute and gone the next. Don't you love physics? When we speculate about catastrophes, we don't mess around. The physics underlying this speculation is related to the Higgs particle, whose discovery was announced July 4, 2012, at the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest particle accelerator, in Geneva, Switzerland. A leading physicist dubbed it the ""God particle"" -- a name I wish would disappear, as the particle and the laws of physics tell us nothing whatsoever about God, and God, if she exists, has not opined about the Higgs particle. So, the simplified argument goes like something like this -- the Higgs particle pervades space roughly uniformly, with a relatively high mass -- about 126 times that of the proton (a basic building block of atoms). Theoretical physicists noted even before the Higgs discovery that its relatively high mass would mean lower energy states exist. Just as gravity makes a ball roll downhill, to the lowest point, so the universe (or any system) tends toward its lowest energy state. If the present universe could one day transition to that lower energy state, then it is unstable now and the transition to a new state would destroy all the particles that exist today. This would happen spontaneously at one point in space and time and then expand throughout the universe at the speed of light. There would be no warning, because the fastest a warning signal could travel is also at the speed of light, so the disaster and the warning would arrive at the same time. We know spontaneous events do happen. The universe began in a rapid expansion called inflation that lasted only a tiny fraction of a second. We owe our existence to that sudden event. Spontaneous change is something you might have seen in chemistry class. Super-cooled water will rapidly crystallize to ice if you drop a snowflake into it, just as a salt crystal will grow when added to a supersaturated salt solution. Back to the universe. Whether the existence of Higgs boson means we're doomed depends on the mass of another fundamental particle, the top quark. It's the combination of the Higgs and top quark masses that determine whether our universe is stable. Experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider allow us to measure these masses. But you don't need to hold your breath waiting for the answer. The good news is that such an event is very unlikely and should not occur until the universe is many times its present age. Probability is the key. Many bad things are possible A large asteroid destroying the Earth. Getting hit by a bus. Having space time gobbled up by instability in the Higgs field. (For an engaging discussion of the many ways humans can be done in by the cosmos, see the marvelous ""Death from the Skies!"" by Bad Astronomer Phil Plait.) Are they likely? Humans have to prioritize by considering both outcome (death or destruction) and probability. Rare events like the collision of a massive asteroid with the Earth could destroy life as we know it and perhaps the planet itself. However, the chances of a sufficiently massive asteroid intersecting the Earth in the vast emptiness of space is pretty low. Collisions with much less massive asteroids are much more likely but much less destructive. So don't lose any sleep over possible danger from the Higgs boson, even if the most famous physicist in the world likes to speculate about it. You're far more likely to be hit by lightning than taken out by the Higgs boson.","Physicist Stephen Hawking said the ""God particle"" could destroy the universe .
Meg Urry: The chance of this particle, known as Higgs boson, obliterating us is tiny .

"(CNN) -- This week's congressional battle over the GOP move to repeal President Obama's Affordable Care Act, as well as the NAACP's boos in response to Mitt Romney's proposed elimination of what he called the ""nonessential "" Obamacare program, provides yet another reminder of how divided America has become over this issue. Other nations have avoided these rifts and built a consensus for universal health care coverage. Consider the case of Brazil. Since the early-20th century, the government and civil society have been proactive in establishing health care as a common good, while sharing the burden of paying for these services through a myriad of taxes. Still, there are several cracks in Brazil's generous health care system. While the government has certainly been committed to providing a public option, it is simply overstretched. Federal health care spending is minimal at best, failing to meet ongoing needs, while several managerial, human resource and infrastructural problems remain. Despite these limitations, it seems that there is one key lesson about health care in Brazil that we can learn from: that is, an enduring cultural belief and expectation that everyone should contribute to health care and that it is a fundamental human right. Brazil's universal healthcare system is called the Sistema Único de Saude (Unified Health System, SUS). SUS is decentralized, such that the management, formulation and implementation of policies are the responsibility of the state and municipal governments. In addition to providing free primary care, surgery and medication, SUS also provides a Family Health Program, where doctors and nurses visit households to provide services. Brazil's health care system is funded through a variety of taxes at the federal, state and municipal level. The states receive money from the federal government, while the municipalities receive funding from both the federal and state governments. What's more, the government has always been committed to levying taxes, increasing them and even tapping into the state's oil revenues to fund SUS. But why has the government been so committed to providing health care? This endeavor reflects a long history of social and political commitments to providing health care as a government and civic responsibility. After obtaining independence from Portugal in 1822, Brazil saw the emergence of well-organized social movements advocating for government intervention in health care. Supported by personal income and social security taxes, health officials agreed with these movements that health care was a government responsibility and that everyone should contribute to the system. This policy idea survived several democratic governments and military dictatorships throughout the 20th century, lasting up through the transition to democracy in 1988. It was also sustained with the help of proactive social health movements, such as the sanitaristas, comprised of medical doctors, bureaucrats and politicians. This idea of a shared responsibility in providing health care was so popular that it eventually became part of the 1988 constitution. Through the constitution's introduction of SUS, health care became an official government responsibility and human right, an issue on which liberals and conservatives could agree. Brazil's health care system seems to have paid off. Brazil's average life expectancy has improved at a faster rate than that of the U.S. since 1960, though it continues to lag behind. Life expectancy there increased from 54.49 years in 1960 to 73.1 in 2010, compared to the U.S. increase of 69.77 years to 78.24. But several challenges remain. First, notwithstanding heavy demand for health care services, the government has only modestly increased spending for SUS from 50.2 billion real ($24.6 billion in U.S. dollars) in 2008 to 61.7 billion in 2010. Second, SUS hospitals and the Family Health Program have often had a difficult time treating individuals in hard to reach areas, such as the Amazonian region while individuals often have to wait a long period of time for prevention and treatment services. Consequently, many of the poor in need of immediate care have had to purchase private insurance, or pay out of pocket for services. In fact, the percentage of individuals purchasing insurance increased from 8% in 2000 to 14.4% of the population in 2005. What's more, there is a chronic shortage of doctors and nurses, especially in rural areas. Many hospitals are also poorly managed, lacking autonomy from state governing boards. And finally, there is a high level of inequality in medical technology and infrastructure, with larger, more affluent municipalities able to provide better technological equipment and medical care. While the U.S. joins Brazil in lacking sufficient health care personnel, especially in rural areas, U.S. cities in general are wealthier and have access to the latest technology and health care infrastructure. Despite Brazil's ongoing commitment to providing health care, the government will need to ensure adequate funding, hire more personnel and strengthen its facilities before its citizens can effectively benefit from SUS. In short, government ""capacity"" must meet its unwavering passion for taking care of its people. Even so, America can certainly learn a big lesson from its southern partner. That is, Republicans viewing the ACA requirement to buy health insurance as an unfair ""tax"" versus Democrats perceiving it as a ""penalty"" should put their haggling aside and instead view the ACA as a shared responsibility and human right. Indeed the Brazilians show us that the right to health care is way too important to be mired in incessant policy debates, regardless of the innumerable challenges that generous health care systems confront, and that it is a common good that all Americans should support. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eduardo Gomez.","U.S. is divided over who should be responsible for paying for health care .

He says Brazil's life expectancy has increased at a faster rate than that of the U.S.

"Beijing (CNN) -- On the leafy campus of Beijing Foreign Studies University, one of China's most prestigious foreign language schools, graduating senior Gao Yue and her classmates go about their daily routine of studying and playing, showing little sign of anxiety over the impending dive into the real world. Gao, a 22-year-old journalism major, has long planned her future outside China ever since she spent a month in the United States as an exchange student during high school. Going overseas after college is not a question of if, but when, she says. And it's not about a higher living standard. ""Press control is quite strict in China and we're looking for free speech,"" she said. ""I think critical thinking is one of the most important things I want to pursue abroad."" ""In China, the kind of education pushes people to think the same way, to drive them to the 'right' answer -- and I think being a journalist, being critical is the most important thing,"" she added. Gao is hardly alone in preparing to leave China, despite the nation's rapid economic growth during a global slump. As Beijing embarks on a once-in-a-decade leadership change, many observers say the opaque process of power transition is adding more uncertainty to a country already faced with challenges ranging from a widening income gap, a worsening natural environment, to rampant official corruption and the lack of free speech. Nationwide, the education ministry's latest statistics show that almost 1.5 million Chinese are studying overseas, making China the largest source of foreign students for the rest of the world. The number of Chinese students going abroad has grown more than 20% every year since 2009, according to the government. Read: Why the Chinese are flocking to U.S. colleges . A likely more worrying trend for the authorities is how billionaire entrepreneurs are moving away, along with their money and talent. Hurun Report, a magazine best known for its ranking of the wealthiest individuals in China, recently surveyed 1,000 super-rich Chinese, finding 60% of the respondents either in the process of immigrating or seriously considering it. ""What we are seeing is a sense of insecurity or, perhaps you want to look at it from another side, looking for a sense of insurance policy,"" said Rupert Hoogewerf, publisher of Hurun Report. ""So they are beginning to quite actively try and get a green card in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Singapore."" The latest wave of exodus, especially among the younger generation, is helping people like Jinbo Xie do brisk business. Xie founded and runs BeBeyond, a personal development training firm with some 40 employees as well as branches in Beijing and Shanghai. His company prepares thousands of young Chinese like Gao every year to study abroad and charges them as much as $2,500 for a six-week course. Xie, 45, belongs to a group called ""sea turtles"" -- a nickname that plays on the sound of the Mandarin word for overseas returnees. When he came back to China in 2001 after studying and working in the United States for eight years, ""sea turtles"" were all the rage. The phenomenon has tapered off in recent years as China's economic growth -- though still impressive by global standards -- slows. Xie says many returnees also start to find adapting to their motherland much harder than they thought. ""In the past two years, people made up their mind to go abroad again due to the exposure of environmental pollution, food safety and other problems in China,"" he said. Xie remains unfazed himself and even did something unthinkable to most Chinese: To focus on growing his company, he gave up his American green card two years ago. ""It's very exciting here -- a lot is happening,"" he explained. ""We do have the chance to make some impact."" ""Even though we have a lot of problems, setbacks and whatever, at some point, we'll be there -- that's how I feel,"" he added.","Despite China's rapid economic growth, some desire life abroad .

"(CNN) -- Emmy-winning journalist Elizabeth Espinosa is getting a new voice -- and in a different language. For the first time in her career, the very American -- and half Mexican-Salvadoran -- journalist will be speaking to her fellow Angelenos in Spanish, as the host of CNN Latino's new show ""Sin Limites,"" an informative magazine-style show that will highlight her personal, relatable style while exploring issues affecting the Los Angeles community. ""It's almost as if I'm doing a reverse crossover, right? I can't wait,"" Espinosa, a weekend news anchor for KTLA, said in an interview. ""CNN en Español is doing something so unique and valuable for the Latino community."" CNN en Español launches CNN Latino on Monday in Los Angeles. The local Spanish-language custom bloc hopes to engage the newer generation of Latinos in the U.S., who are comfortable switching back and forth between English and Spanish. As of now, ""Sin Limites"" is the only original programming on CNN Latino and will air locally on KBEH-DT Channel 63 at 8 p.m. PT. The first 12 minutes of the show will be a live debate-style show. Experts and newsmakers from the U.S. and Latin America will join Espinosa every night to provide solutions, share different angles, and answer questions from the audience via social media. ""I understand what the Latino in Orange County is like as opposed to the Latino in San Bernardino. There are many levels of every immigration spectrum here. You have the ones that just got here and the ones that have been here for seven generations,"" Espinosa said. ""We come in so many sizes, shapes and forms. I'm that middle ground that understands both."" CNN en Español launching CNN Latino . Espinosa didn't always have her heart set on journalism. With a full scholarship for law school in hand, she was well on her way to becoming an attorney, inspired by her younger brother's medical malpractice case. But in the end, a law career wasn't for her. ""I was going to live in such misery because I wasn't going to be able to be the voice I wanted to be for this community, the way I wanted to be,"" Espinosa explained. ""God really had a different path for me. Uno pone y Dios dispone, meaning 'Man proposes, God disposes.'"" Espinosa has been an advocate for the rights of the disabled and helps community groups and nonprofit organizations, such as Ability First and Heart of Los Angeles, known as HOLA. Growing up, Espinosa was the primary caretaker of her disabled younger brother, Christian, now 29. Espinosa is 36. ""As you can imagine, Christian has really changed my life. I don't have children, but he's a child to me,"" Espinosa said. ""I think I was his mother in another life. He's given me my humanity. I receive a source of strength from him."" Her story caught the attention of Oprah Winfrey, who selected her as one of the 10 finalists for OWN's ""Your Own Show"" contest in December 2012. Espinosa was honored with an Emmy award for her 2007 special, ""Forgotten Footprints: The Hunted Children of Uganda."" She also produced and hosted a special report about disabled and abandoned children in El Salvador. Espinosa said she's keeping her day job as KTLA's weekend news anchor. ""Elizabeth is a passionate communicator,"" said Cynthia Hudson, senior vice president and general manager of CNN en Español, in a statement.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Beneath the streets of the City of Light lies a world draped in darkness and shrouded in silence. The tunnels are narrow, the ceilings are low and death is on display. The skulls and bones lining the walls, arranged in a macabre fashion, make up what is known as the Empire of the Dead -- the Catacombs of Paris. The catacombs snake below the city, a 321-kilometer (200-mile) network of old quarries, caves and tunnels. Some Parisians are drawn to this largely uncharted territory -- a hidden network of adventure, discovery and even relaxation. They are known as 'cataphiles' and the catacombs are their playground. It is a top-secret group. Catacomb entrances are known only to those daring enough to roam the networks on their own -- and break the law. Entering unauthorized sections of the catacombs is illegal and a police force is tasked with patrolling the tunnels, and caught cataphiles risk fines of up to 60 euros ($73). But for explorers like Loic Antoine-Gambeaud and his friends, it is a risk they are willing to take. ""I think it's in the collective imagination. Everybody knows that there is something below Paris; that something goes on that's mysterious. But I don't think many people have even an idea of what the underground is like,"" Antoine-Gambeaud said. For those who want to find out, but are not willing to take the risk of going in unsupervised, there is a legal, tourist-friendly public entrance to the catacombs off Place Denfert-Rochereau. Visitors from around the world will queue up to see death on display. ""I think people are fascinated with death,"" one visitor said. ""They don't know what it's about and you see all these bones stacked up, and the people that have come before us, and it's fascinating. We're trying to find our past and it's crazy and gruesome and fun all at the same time."" But experiencing the history of Paris in an orderly fashion is not the cataphiles' style. Underground, there are plaques echoing the street names above etched into the walls, helping the cataphiles navigate. Often equipped only with head lamps and homemade maps, they explore the tunnels and ancient rooms, sometimes staying underground for days at a time. They throw parties, drink wine, or just relax in a silence they say can't be experienced anywhere else. The catacombs are a by-product of Paris' early development. Builders dug deep underground to extract limestone to build Paris above ground. But the subterranean quarries that were formed proved to be a shaky foundation for the city, causing a number of streets to collapse and be swallowed up by the ground. Eventually, repairs and reinforcements were made, and to this day, the tunnels and quarries are still monitored for safety. The quarries went through several transformations throughout history. Over time, they have served as everything from hiding places for revolutionaries to mushroom farms. In the 18th century the Catacombs became known as the Empire of the Dead. Paris' dead had been buried in cemeteries and beneath churches in the city center, but the number of bodies began to overwhelm the land, breaking through the walls of people's cellars and causing major health concerns. So, beginning in the 1780s, the bodies were transferred in carriages at night to a new, final resting place in the old quarries. In those tunnels there are now the remains of more than six million people. And for the cataphiles, the life among the dead opens up new dreams and possibilities. ""It's like an alternate reality,"" Antoine-Gambeaud said. ""You don't have the same sort of social interaction with people as you do above. You are free to invent yourself again, to be somebody else.""

"Thoreau, New Mexico (CNN) -- Almost hidden in the spectacular red rock country of northwestern New Mexico is a tiny charity that educates and houses almost 200 Native American children and their families. The St. Bonaventure Indian Mission and School, affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup, mostly survives on donations, which it promises to use wisely. The need is apparent once you step onto the grounds. And that's why mission executives agreed to work with one of the world's largest direct mail companies, which solicits donations for hundreds of nonprofit and charity clients in the United States. They wanted to raise as much money as they could. They signed a contract with Quadriga Art in 2008 and, according to internal financial statements, saw more than $9 million in donations flow in over a four-year period. But almost none of the money went to the mission. Instead, school officials acknowledge that the mission owes more than $5 million to Quadriga Art. And evidence suggests that several other charities also owe the company huge sums of money . It raises questions about how much of the billions of dollars Americans donate each year actually help the intended charities, something that the Senate Finance Committee is exploring as part of its ongoing investigation into another charity linked to Quadriga. On Tuesday, the committee issued questions to Quadriga officials to explore how the company raised money for the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, it said. In response, Quadriga said, it ""volunteered"" some information to the committee and will cooperate with the investigation. In addition to the Senate inquiry, attorneys general for New York and California are investigating Quadriga for possible fraudulent practices, sources say. The company has provided documents to New York investigators, multiple sources confirm to CNN. And sources say California officials have also requested documents from key Quadriga executives. The executive director of St. Bonaventure Indian Mission and School, Chris Halter, went to New York to meet with Quadriga officials after being contacted by CNN, sources said. In an e-mail, Halter wrote that the debt was the result of a ""pilot program"" that did not succeed. ""In this effort Quadriga/Brickmill (Brickmill is an affiliated marketing services company) agreed to finance the mailings and bear the risk of any losses if the campaign did not succeed, "" Halter said in that email. ""Unfortunately, this project started just a month before the recession began and was not profitable. Accordingly, the mission negotiated with Quadriga/Brickmill to end the pilot project early and Quadriga/Brickmill concurred. As had been agreed, the mission now owes Quadriga/Brickmill nothing for this pilot project,"" Halter also told CNN. ""Quadriga has helped enable the Mission to deliver water and food services and keep its school open during lean economic times by allowing the Mission to delay repayment of part of its bills on generous, no interest payment terms."" But the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup, which has overall responsibility for the St. Bonaventure Mission, says it knew nothing of the debt until it was contacted by CNN. ""We have serious concerns about that company,"" said James Mason, an attorney for the diocese. ""And the fact that they reached out to an entity in our diocese and potentially would jeopardize these good services, educational and otherwise that are being provided."" In an e-mail, Quadriga spokewoman Melissa Schwartz wrote, ""Sometimes the program is successful, and sometimes it results in a net loss for Quadriga Art."" She added, ""We are proud of our ability to take on start-up organizations that do not have an email list, donor file or the money on hand that it takes to build a long-term, revenue-producing direct mail program."" In a web video posted by Quadriga CEO Mark Schulhof to his company's clients, he did not address directly the question of state or Senate investigations. ""Not once have we been fined; not once have we ever been charged,"" Schulhof said. ""We get inquiries all the time from states"" because forms are filled out incorrectly. Other charities . Internal financial documents show that at least 11 charities now owe the company millions of dollars, a result of direct mail campaigns failing to bring in enough money from donations to cover the cost of the campaigns themselves. In a statement, a Quadriga spokesman said the financial information was ""grossly inaccurate"" when it came to profit numbers. The company further stated that ""a complete, independent, third party audit of Quadriga's financial information has indicated that Quadriga has not made any net profit on the accounts you list."" Spokesmen for several Quadriga charity clients acknowledge that they owe the company amounts ranging from about $200,000 to millions of dollars. Leading the list of charities owing money to Quadriga is the Washington-based Disabled Veterans National Foundation. The Senate Finance Committee began investigating the foundation's tax-exempt status after a series of CNN reports broadcast in May. Florida investigators have been examining the foundation amid accusations of creating misleading representations in a direct mail campaign authored by Quadriga, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs. Documents show that the Disabled Veterans National Foundation owes Quadriga more than $15 million. As part of their investigation, Florida officials say the foundation, which says it has raised nearly $70 million in donations since 2007, has also acknowledged an extraordinary payment to another charity. According to documents obtained under the Florida Public Records Law, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation agreed to pay $325,000 to a charity called the Disabled Veterans Life Memorial Foundation. A letter from the Memorial Foundation's chief operating officer, Rick Fenstermacher, says the payment was because of a ""striking resemblance"" between letters appealing for money on behalf of the Disabled Veterans National Foundation and similar letters mailed on behalf of the Memorial Foundation. ""It appeared that our proprietary information and intellectual property rights had been violated,"" the letter stated. In the settlement agreement, Quadriga did not admit to any wrongdoing, and the veterans charity said the agreement ""speaks for itself."" The Disabled Veterans National Foundation also said the mailings in question were out the door before the settlement could be agreed upon. Despite the huge payment, nowhere in the Disabled Veterans National Foundation's mailings to prospective donors did it acknowledge that donated funds would be used to pay for a out-of-court settlement to another charity. The common denominator between the two charities is their direct-mail fundraiser, Quadriga. The memorial foundation, which plans to build a statue and memorial to disabled veterans on Capitol Hill near the Rayburn House Office Building, stopped using Quadriga in 2008, five months before the settlement agreement was reached. As for the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, it has embarked on an expensive new mailing campaign, launched after the Senate Finance Committee began its investigation. On behalf of the charity, Quadriga said, it sent 750,000 letters, each with a $1 bill enclosed, in an effort to raise more money. Roger Craver, a veteran of more than 50 years of direct-mail fundraising on behalf of nonprofits and charities, offered his opinion on the ethics and legalities of surrounding Quadriga and similar outfits: . ""The fact that (that) company puts forth money for this purpose is not unethical per se. It's not illegal per se,"" he said. ""But what is problematic is ... if the charity is promising to do something with the money that the donor sends and there's no money going to it ... if no money has gone to the charitable purpose, then that's fraudulent."" ""Big mistake"" The CEO of another Quadriga client, a Los Angeles-based charity called Help the Children, said he had made a ""big mistake"" in signing a contract with the company. Roger Presgrove said he tried to cancel the contract a year after signing it but was unable to do so. He said Quadriga told him that Help the Children owed $285,000, and the charity couldn't pay it. Ultimately, the debt was whittled down to less than $200,000, Presgrove said, which was still money he did not have. Of the roughly $800,000 raised in donations by the Quadriga campaign, Presgrove said, his charity kept about $32,000: less than 5%. ""So we had to take money out of our reserves to keep our programs going (to) fulfill what we said we would do. And in the meantime, we're the ones who are struggling, and they're the one who is doing extremely well."" Asked whether he felt that Quadriga had ""ripped him off,"" Presgrove replied, ""Oh, yeah."" But after CNN asked Quadriga for its reaction, Presgrove retracted his statements. Presgrove acknowledged that before he spoke to CNN, he e-mailed a Quadriga executive, saying that unless he was let out of his contract, he would go to CNN with his story. In less than an hour, a Quadriga executive agreed. ""I think it is in everyone's interest to end this and move on,"" the executive wrote back. Despite his agreement with Quadriga, Presgrove granted an on-camera interview anyway. Two days later, CNN received a phone call from a Quadriga spokesman, and Presgrove himself wrote CNN, saying he wanted to retract what he had said. The Quadriga spokesman also said Presgrove's interview should be retracted because he had just undergone a medical procedure and was in no condition to answer questions. Quadriga claimed that CNN had ""dragged"" him to an interview. CNN disputes that assertion. Still later, Presgrove texted CNN, asking not to air the interview: ""I have to get out of this contract and that was the deal. No interview and I'm out. Sorry.""

"(CNN) -- I was a young traveling correspondent in the closing months of the Cold War, stunned like any other visitor from the West at the cruel tyranny that had endured for so many years in so many countries, amazed at how quickly it was toppled. I remember in particular the day the Iron Curtain came down. I just didn't realize it at the time. The Iron Curtain wasn't simply a phrase made famous by Winston Churchill to describe the line separating the Soviet-dominated eastern Europe from the sovereign nations of the west. It was literally a guarded barrier that millions of people couldn't cross because they were imprisoned in their home countries. But by 1988, reformers inside the Hungarian government decided to open their border to the west and allow Hungarians to leave for Austria. The next year they began allowing East Germans on Hungarian soil to leave for Austria as well. But one thing stood in the way: Czechoslovakia. The route from East Germany to Hungary ran right through it. The government in Prague wasn't looking to the west; it was closer to the hardliners in Berlin than the reformers in Budapest. It wasn't inclined to open up. Some East Germans wouldn't wait. In the summer of 1989, they began seeking refuge in the West German embassy in Prague. By August, there were thousands of them, camped out in the cramped confines of the embassy grounds. Czech authorities let some leave the country but tried to stop any more from coming in. It didn't work. By November 4, the border was opened for East Germans, even while it still stood as a barrier to the citizens of Czechoslovakia themselves. I can recall that morning in Prague, watching Germans leave the crowded embassy grounds and board buses for their trip to West Germany. The people of Prague stopped in their tracks to watch them take that coveted journey to freedom. The Czechs around me put down their shopping bags, briefcases and packages and broke into spontaneous applause. Thousands of people, who had been prisoners, had found a safe, legal way to escape. Less than a week later, the Berlin Wall was open. The Iron Curtain had collapsed.","CNN's Jonathan Mann recalls the day the Iron Curtain fell .

"(CNN) -- Solange Knowles still isn't saying what prompted her elevator confrontation with her brother-in-law, Shawn ""Jay Z"" Carter, but she will tell you one thing: . She's at peace about it. The 28-year-old singer and younger sister of Forbes' world power Beyonce talks about the altercation in the August issue of Lucky magazine. Without going into detail about the brouhaha, which was caught on elevator surveillance video and dropped a bomb on Beyonce's otherwise composed and inaccessible public persona, Solange says that she's not dwelling on the past. ""What's important is that my family and I are all good,"" the younger Knowles says. ""What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that."" Solange, Jay Z and Beyonce break their silence on elevator incident . The now-infamous standoff occurred after the Met Gala on May 5, when Solange, Beyonce and Jay Z were seen leaving New York City's Standard Hotel. As security footage released by TMZ showed, Solange Knowles appeared to attack her brother-in-law, taking several swings at him and kicking, while her sister stood calmly next to her. The speculation surrounding the private moment could fill a book (or three), and in response, the Knowles-Carter family addressed the rumors with a statement declaring their unity. Solange and Jay Z: The Internet knows . ""(T)he most important thing is that our family has worked through it,"" the statement said of the ""unfortunate incident."" ""Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward ... At the end of the day, families have problems and we're no different."" In the aftermath of the video, much of the gossip zeroed in on Knowles' relationship with her sister, as the curious public watched closely for signs of either sibling discord or solidarity. Yet according to Knowles, she and her sister have held tight to the values that were instilled in them as kids, to love and protect one another through anything.

"(CNN) -- Make no mistake. A handshake is just a handshake. Fifty-year-old geopolitical conflicts don't turn on a dime. American foreign policy isn't an Etch A Sketch where you get to wipe the board clean in every news cycle. Between countries, as with people, grudges and hard feelings don't fade easily. These things are true no matter how eager some in the media are to give President Barack Obama's sagging job approval rating -- just 41% in a recent Gallup Poll -- a boost by likening him to Nelson Mandela. Seriously? There is far-fetched, and there is farcical. Comparing Obama to Mandela falls into the latter category. And all because of a simple handshake? Obama briefly shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro at the memorial for the former South African president. Now everyone in the media wants to know if there is a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations. The preferred narrative is that as Mandela healed the breach between white and black South Africans, perhaps Obama will now heal the relationship between the United States and Cuba. A columnist has to know his limitations. Whenever I write about Cuba, the first thing I have to overcome is my sense of ambivalence. I'm a Mexican-American living in Southern California, not a Cuban-American living in South Florida. The only Castro brothers I get worked up about -- Julian, the mayor, and Joaquin, the congressman -- live in San Antonio, not Havana. Not that I don't understand why my Cuban-American friends still hold a grudge and take a hard line against the Castro regime, just like their parents and grandparents before them. For instance, I wasn't at all surprised that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- whose Cuban-born father was imprisoned and tortured in the years before Fidel Castro rose to power and who traveled to South Africa to pay his respects to Mandela as a champion of freedom -- walked out during Raul Castro's speech. Nor was I surprised when Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba, cross-examined Secretary of State John Kerry during a congressional hearing. ""Mr. Secretary, sometimes a handshake is just a handshake, but when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant,"" she said. ""Raul Castro uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail democracy advocates."" Kerry insisted that there was no change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, and that Obama had been clear in his remarks at the memorial that all nations had the duty to uphold ""the basic human rights of their people"" and that Cuba isn't doing that. Cuban-Americans are right to keep up their efforts to draw the attention of the international community to the atrocious human rights record of the Cuban government and the systematic abuse that the regime inflicts upon its own people. Eventually, as I thought more about the handshake felt around the world, I finally put my finger on what was bothering me about the Obama-as-Reconciler-In-Chief storyline. Three things. First, aren't liberals and other Obama supporters -- the very people who are now advancing the idea that the handshake was an example of ""Mandela-style"" reconciliation -- the same folks who have spent the past few weeks focused on the botched rollout of Obamacare complaining that the expectations on Obama are too high? So now what do they do? They raise expectations even higher. This makes no sense. Next, I'm not even sure that Obama knows how to bring people together. In his five years in office, he has mastered the art of division. He pits the poor against the rich, the elderly who help run up staggering deficits against the young who will someday have to pay them off. Finally, I think of one other handshake between Obama and a Latin American leader that led, well, nowhere. In April 2009, just a few months into his presidency, Obama shook hands with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the Summit of the Americas. Chavez clashed often with George W. Bush, and so he probably couldn't have been happier to be rid of him. But, just a little more than two years later, in December 2011, Chavez attacked Obama as a ""clown"" and an ""embarrassment."" He also sent a message to Obama, telling him that he should ""focus on governing your country, which you've turned into a disaster"" and ""leave us in peace ... Go after your votes by fulfilling that which you promised your people."" What set Chavez off were comments that Obama made during an interview with the Caracas-based El Universal newspaper in which he criticized Venezuelans' business and political ties to Iran and Cuba and raised concerns about the Venezuelan government, which had, Obama said, ""restricted the universal rights of the Venezuelan people, threatened basic democratic values and failed to contribute to security in the region."" Obama was in the right. Everything he said in that interview was true. And, unlike handshakes that quickly fade from memory, the truth endures. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Make no mistake, a handshake is just a handshake .

"(CNN) -- The Great Gatsby, the film based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, shows the glamorous and decadent lifestyles of fashionable, high society Americans of the Roaring Twenties. Set in the prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922, the novel portrays the so-called ""flapper"" culture, fun-loving young women who wore their hair and their skirts short, listened to jazz music, drank and smoked in public, and were far more sexually liberated than previous generations. Watch: 'The Great Gatsby' hits Cannes . But who were the real women of the Great Gatsby era? CNN asked actresses Carey Mulligan, Isla Fisher and Elizabeth Debicki, the female stars of Baz Luhrmann's film, to tell us who gave them inspiration for their characters. Ginevra King . A wealthy debutante and Fitzgerald's first love, Ginevra King is widely believed to be the inspiration for Daisy Buchanan, James Gatsby's love interest. Fitzgerald met King in 1915 in his hometown of St Paul, Minnesota, when he was a 19-year-old Princeton student home for Christmas vacation and she was a 16-year-old boarding school pupil. Though they dated for two years before both going on to marry other people, Fitzgerald never forgot his first love, who is often described as his muse. In 2003, Princeton University acquired the letters to Fitzgerald from King's family, allowing biographers to learn details of their relationship for the first time. Carey Mulligan, who played Daisy Buchanan in ""The Great Gatsby"" film, went to Princeton to study the letters while researching her character. ""The way that she writes is absolutely incredible,"" Mulligan told CNN. ""Her way with language is so reminiscent of the way that Daisy speaks. She came from a very wealthy family and shared so many biographical [details]."" Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald . Letters between Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald also provided rich material for Mulligan's research. ""One of my favorite parts of the whole experience was the time just before we started shooting when I got to look at the people who inspired Fitzgerald,"" said Mulligan. ""It was amazing to go to Princeton and to get to read letters between Zelda and Scott, and between Ginerva King and Scott, and see where he'd directly drawn parts of Daisy to put her together."" Zelda, a Southern belle, met Fitzgerald at a country club dance, but was unimpressed with his wealth and status and refused to marry him until his first novel, ""The Side of Paradise"", was published in 1920. The newly-wed Fitzgeralds became a celebrity couple, known for their partying lifestyle. However, the party was short-lived and in 1930 -- with their marriage crumbling and Fitzgerald suffering from alcoholism -- Zelda was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and admitted to hospital, where she wrote a semi-biographical novel, ""Save Me the Waltz"". Clara Bow . Silent film actress Clara Bow was known as the ""it"" girl of the Roaring Twenties, after her most famous movie ""It"" of 1927. Despite a poor and unhappy childhood, Bow starred in 38 silent movies. Bow provided inspiration for Gatsby actress Isla Fisher, for her character Myrtle, who has an extramarital affair with Daisy Buchanan's husband, Tom. ""I was inspired by Clara Bow for Myrtle because I think that's who she would have wanted to be,"" Fisher told CNN. ""Myrtle would (have) loved to have been an actress and she would never have [had] the opportunity because of her status. ""I feel like Myrtle is living in her own theatrical world where she's the star when she is with Tom Buchanan, even though her life is so sad without him."" Louise Brooks . Louise Brooks was another great actress of the silent movie era, best known for her films ""Pandora's Box"" and ""Diary of a Lost Girl"", both filmed in Germany in 1929. Among the first to sport a bobbed haircut, it was Brooks who inspired the Australian actress Elizabeth Debicki, playing ""The Great Gatsby"" character Jordan Baker in the film. ""She is just fierce, wonderful, intelligent, and I read a lot about her,"" said Debicki. ""She really typified that woman who appeared in the 1920s, completely independent and, like Gatsby, she built herself up, created the image she wanted. ""I had photos of her in my kitchen, everywhere. When I woke up in the morning I would look at Louise Brooks.""","The Great Gatsby portrays glamorous, decadent women of 1920s American society .

"(CNN) -- Eddie Vedder has a message for his critics: ""Imagine."" The Pearl Jam frontman addressed recent criticism of his anti-war comments by playing the John Lennon classic at a solo show Friday in Meco, Portugal. ""I think it is the most powerful song ever written, which is why I have never played it. It seems like maybe there is a reason to play it,"" Vedder said, according to a video posted on the website Consequence of Sound. ""(Being) anti-war make(s) you pro many things. Pro peace, pro human, pro evolution,"" he said before introducing the song. ""Makes you pro communication, pro diplomacy, pro love, pro understanding, pro forgiveness."" In recent weeks, Vedder has made headlines, first with an antiwar rant at a concert in Milton Keynes, England, and later comments on Pearl Jam's website. ""I swear to f****** God, there are people out there who are looking for a reason to kill!"" Vedder said at the English show before singing Edwin Starr's ""War."" ""They're looking for a reason to go across borders and take over land that doesn't belong to them."" Those comments were viewed by some Israeli publications as anti-Israel, Rolling Stone reported. One Israeli DJ, who was hoping to bring Pearl Jam to Israel, said that Vedder was now ""invited not to come here."" In response, Vedder reiterated his anti-war beliefs on Pearl Jam's website in a post titled ""Imagine That -- I'm Still Anti-War."" ""Call me naÃ¯ve. I'd rather be naÃ¯ve, heartfelt and hopeful than resigned to say nothing for fear of misinterpretation and retribution,"" he wrote. ""War hurts. It hurts no matter which sides the bombs are falling on. ... I know that we can't let the sadness turn into apathy. And I do know we are better off when we reach out to each other."" He then quoted from ""Imagine"": "" 'I hope someday you'll join us,...

"(CNN) -- A U.N. panel on Friday said with 95% certainty that the effects of climate change are real and largely man-made. To which pretty much everyone in Shishmaref, Alaska, said ... Well, duh. If only they weren't so polite. The tiny Inupiat Eskimo community in near-Arctic Alaska -- which I was lucky enough to visit on a reporting trip in 2009 and which is home to some of the sweetest and most colorful people you'll meet -- has been watching climate change happen to it for years now. Locals see the sea ice forming later each year, the coast eroding and the permafrost melting. The hunting seasons have shifted and lakes have dried up. The coast had become so unstable that one house toppled off the edge of the barrier island that harbors the village. When I was there, the town was considering relocating to more stable ground. Now those plans seem to have dried up, too. Stanley Tocktoo, the mayor of Shishmaref, told me by phone Thursday that residents have tabled their plans to move the town. Money is one reason. Another is that they were unable to find a suitable location upon which everyone could agree. Potential relocation spots also are hit by the changing climate, he said. ""The island is only a quarter-mile wide by three miles (long), probably narrower now. I don't know how long we'll be able to be on this island,"" he said. ""These floods get pretty fierce now, worse than before."" It should seem laughable in 2013 that anyone would try to deny the reality of climate change, which is causing tougher droughts, stronger storms, rising seas and melting ice. The effects are scattered, to be sure. It's difficult to attribute any single storm to macro-changes in the atmosphere, for example. But it's clear things are changing. It's clear that's for the worse. And it's clear -- has been clear -- that we're to blame for that. I'm thankful the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change continues to update all of us on the latest science and evidence. But it's already obvious to everyone paying attention that we need to act in new and profoundly urgent ways to blunt the future impact of climate change, and to mitigate the changes that are already taking shape all over the world. The Marshall Islands and other Pacific nations that could be swallowed up by rising seas have banded together to try to make their economies 50% or 100% renewable. The urgency is clear to them. They fear for survival. But in the United States, we're still running around with our eyes shut. Sure, President Barack Obama has tried, between arguing for strikes on Syria and trying to resurrect the middle class, to make climate change a front-burner issue. But Congress hasn't followed suit. America remains a serious laggard on climate action. Perhaps we should open our eyes, and turn them to Alaska. There, the evidence is like a slap in the face. A wake-up call. ""The town is coming apart, getting smaller and smaller."" That's Shelton Kokeok, a 68-year-old who lives, with his wife, Clara, at the very edge of the Shishmaref coast, which has been thawing and falling into the sea. A multimillion-dollar U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project has bought Kokeok some peace of mind. The engineers piled rocks high on the shore, as if imploring the land to stay. But even the engineers know that the measures are temporary. The Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska had $45 million to deal with coastal erosion issues that are related to climate change, according to Bruce Sexauer, chief of planning for the Alaska District. That money ran out though. The rock wall in Shishmaref was planned to be nearly twice as long as it is, but money is now only available if the village can put up 35% of the cash needed to build it. I'm pretty sure a place where people hunt seals for food and harvest ice for water doesn't have millions to spare. It's a beautiful, generous village. But not a rich one. The wall, as it stands, likely will buy Shishmaref several years. But much already has been lost. When I visited him four years ago, Kokeok told me he blames the death of his youngest son, Norman, on the changes to the climate. Norman fell through a thin sheet of ice on the first week of June several years ago. That area should have been frozen solid, Kokeok said. He told me, back in 2009, that he hasn't been the same since. I was pleased to hear on Thursday that, after two knee replacements, Kokeok was able to go caribou hunting with his grandchildren and daughter this summer. That's something he hadn't done in years. The land here, and the community, means so much to him. Another community, Newtok, which was the subject of a fascinating series by The Guardian, is actually in the process of relocating now, according to Sexauer. Dave Williams, a colleague of Sexauer's, told me that the permafrost is thawing out from beneath the town, making it nearly unlivable. ""Some of the boardwalks are underwater during the summertime,"" he said. ""You can't step off the boardwalk and walk anywhere without getting wet up to your crotch and covered in muck. You can see that when it floods now, houses that were above the flood level now get water in them or are surrounded by water and (you) can't go anywhere. ... It happens slowly, over years and years."" Slowly, over years and years. But still, impossible not to notice. I could think of a few senators I'd like to send up to that village to wade in the muck. Maybe it would alleviate their nagging sense of industry-funded doubt. Or, at the very least, they'd have to make excuses in a ruined pair of pants. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","U.N. panel releases the first part of its new climate assessment this week .

"(CNN) -- When Jerry and I first started slinging scoops in 1978, we knew that it was about more than just the ice cream; it was about community. Our first scoop shop was in a dilapidated gas station that we renovated with a small loan, a little pocket change and a lot of green wood. In the summer, folks would crowd around at the picnic tables late into the evenings and lounge on the grass laughing, talking and eating ice cream. Ice cream brings people together. We might not agree on politics or religion, heck we might not agree on Chunky Monkey or Phish Food, but that doesn't mean we can't talk. And in that way, ice cream teaches us a lesson about democracy. Democracy is the triple-deluxe droolworthy idea that the people can govern and be governed in turn, that We the People are the author and the subject of the law. In America, it's the idea that we can elect representatives who will rise above self-interest and work on behalf of the common good. At least, that was the idea. These days, it looks a little different. Thanks to Supreme Court cases such as Citizens United in 2010, which trampled over the last remaining semblance of campaign finance laws, our government looks a lot more like a plutocracy: a government where the wealthy rule. The massive influx of corporate dough doesn't guarantee victory for Democrats or Republicans. But it allows wealthy donors to control the national conversation and drown out other voices, making it harder and harder for the people to be heard. It allows corporations to bully our representatives and influence their votes. All they have to do is threaten to throw gobs of cash against members of Congress who oppose them, and they can chill democratic debate. When George Washington gave a farewell address to Congress in 1796, he talked about why the U.S. Constitution deserved the people's support and confidence. It wasn't because it contained immutable, universal principles; it was because the people wrote it and the people have the power to alter it. Well, if we're going to save our democracy, we need a constitutional amendment that declares once and for all: 1) Money is not free speech. 2) Corporations are not people. The movement to amend is already making big waves. Thirteen states and more than 500 municipalities have passed ballot initiatives calling on Congress to propose a constitutional amendment. More than 150 congressmen and President Barack Obama say they would support an amendment. But change won't happen if we sit back and let other people do the dirty work. We need a stampede to rout the special interests who have corralled Congress. And that's what we're doing. The Stamp Stampede encourages people to adorn their dollars, to beautify their bucks, to put make-up on their moola, to stamp money with messages that promote a constitutional amendment to get special interest money out of politics. We know it's unusual, it's slightly subversive, but it's 100% legal (we checked into it), and it's precisely the kind of democratic action we need if we're going to win a constitutional amendment. It's not enough for people to sign a petition. We need a petition on steroids. You can open up your windows and scream ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" But if we want Congress to hear us we need to join together in a chorus. So take out your stamps and start stamping messages on your money. The average dollar exchanges hands 875 times. That means if a thousand people stamp one dollar a day for a year, the message would be seen more than 300 million times. If 10,000 people do it, the message would be seen more than 3 billion times. If we all do it, we'll flush ""dark money"" out of politics for good. The time to act is now. This is OUR democracy -- a government of the people, for the people and by the people. But if we don't stunt the influence of money in politics, we may very well lose our democracy to special interests. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.","Ben and Jerry: After Citizen United, our government looks more like a plutocracy .

"(CNN) -- Just in time for Halloween, the new season of ""American Horror Story"" has fans checking for monsters -- actually, make that clowns -- under the bed. Brad Falchuck and Ryan Murphy's acclaimed anthology series debuted its fourth season Wednesday night, this time taking viewers inside a carnival of ""curiosities"" stationed in Jupiter, Florida, in 1952. ""American Horror Story's"" previous seasons have involved a haunted house, an asylum and a coven of witches. Several of the FX series' usual players are back, including Jessica Lange as the show's ringleader; Evan Peters as Jimmy Darling, a.k.a. the housewife-pleasing ""Lobster Boy""; Kathy Bates as Ethel, the ""bearded lady""; Angela Bassett as the three-breasted Desiree Dupree; and Sarah Paulson as conjoined twins Bette and Dot -- and yes, Paulson plays both parts. ""Bringing her to walking, talking two-headed life is achievement enough. ... But the real special effect is Paulson, who invests the two sisters with such distinct personalities,"" said Time magazine's James Poniewozik in a review. ""The way the two Paulsons carry themselves and react to each other -- even argue -- is a triumph of both editing and performance. She's her own best co-star, playing her own worst enemy."" In addition to these '50s-era sideshow stars, there's someone else lurking around town: John Carroll Lynch's incredibly creepy clown, Twisty, who happens to have a penchant for murder and kidnapping. In other words, exactly what you want to see right before you turn out the lights. It was apparently a bit much for some. But reaction from critics has been more mixed. ""'Freak Show' ... still has the high style we've grown to expect,"" said the New York Times' Mike Hale. ""And it still has plenty of clever touches in word and picture ... But it's not particularly scary, and doesn't even feel that creepy or freakish, despite the sideshow setting and the obvious attempt to emulate one of the eeriest of American movies, Tod Browning's 'Freaks,' from 1932.""

"Gilchrist, Texas (CNN) -- Jesse Matthew, a suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, was questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago, authorities said Thursday. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew, said Michael Doucette, the commonwealth's attorney for Lynchburg, Virginia. According to a statement from Lynchburg police, a woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented, Doucette said, adding that there were no witnesses. On Thursday, Matthew was sitting in a Texas jail cell, waiting for Virginia authorities to pick him up and take him back to Charlottesville, where he has been sought in the Graham case on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile. He was in a Texas court twice Thursday. The second time, Judge Michelle Slaughter in Galveston asked whether he wanted to fight extradition or would agree to be sent to back to Virginia. Matthew agreed to the extradition. Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters that he thought Matthew would be moved Friday. He had no comment when asked about the 2002 case. Earlier, Matthew appeared before Galveston County Judge Mark Henry on a charge of giving false information to a Texas peace officer. Jesse Matthew's father spoke publicly for the first time Thursday since Graham disappeared about two weeks ago. He said his son would not have harmed Graham. ""For a big man, he's as gentle as they come,"" Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""The only thing I could see, him, maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out. ""To kill or hurt somebody, that's not my son."" Found camping on the beach . Authorities found Matthew on a Galveston County beach some 1,300 miles from where he's wanted in the disappearance. Deputies were tipped off to Matthew's whereabouts when they got a call about a suspicious person camping on the beach. One responded and ran the license plate of that person's vehicle. It came back as wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Matthew did not resist arrest, Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset told reporters Thursday. The sheriff added that investigators from Virginia were examining a car and a tent found at Matthew's campsite and hoped to speak to Matthew later. Mike Rodenberg, a vacationer who was fishing near the campsite when Matthew was arrested, said the big man came up to him to ask about why he was throwing some of his catch back. Rodenberg had just tossed back a red fish when Matthew approached. ""He seemed real nice. He was real soft spoken,"" Rodenberg said. ""(He) said he was down here from New Jersey and was looking for a job. I told him if I caught another red fish he could have it."" Matthew told him that his name was George, Rodenberg said. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary until the police showed up after a female caller reported a suspicious person. Lawyer: No comment at this point . Matthew's Virginia-based lawyer had little to say about his client when approached earlier outside his Charlottesville office. ""I am Mr. Matthew's attorney,"" James Camblos said. ""I was hired on Saturday. That's the only thing that I'm going to confirm at this point. The family and I -- nobody is making any statements at this point in time. We might later on, but right now we are not."" His comments came a day after authorities obtained an arrest warrant for his client, who police believe was the last person with Graham. Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, when there was no warrant for his arrest, Longo said. He asked for a lawyer. They spoke and then left, the police chief said. Authorities are now offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, a second-year student at the University of Virginia. The Northern Virginia native is 5 feet 11 inches tall with a slender build and has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was last seen September 13 wearing a black crop top and capri pants. She had an iPhone in a pink case. ""We have no idea whatsoever where she is,"" Longo said Thursday. They have received 1,500 tips so far in the case and are urging anyone with information to call the police tip line at 434-295-3851. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know . Graham was last seen in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Investigators have been looking for her since, and over an increasingly large area. ""We're asking for a broader community search with property owners,"" Longo told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Wednesday night. Specifically, he said he wants owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Authorities have previously searched Matthew's apartment and car. Although they have declined to discuss the specifics of what might have been found, potential evidence was sent to a lab for analysis. CNN's Jason Hanna, Jean Casarez, Ed Payne and journalist Betsy Kaufman contributed to this report.","NEW: Father says Jesse Matthew is a gentle man .

"(CNN) -- We found out I was pregnant in August 2012. It was time to start our family, time to start the next chapter of our lives. The next months were going to be the best time in our lives. I had an uneventful pregnancy. We went to all the regular prenatal checkups, including one with a 4-D ultrasound. We found out we were having a boy, and decided we would name him after my father, who had died of a heart attack a week after we confirmed the pregnancy. Finally, May arrived. We were prepared. We headed to the hospital and at 1:15 a.m. our beautiful boy arrived. Everything was just perfect -- until it wasn't. I couldn't see his fingers, and I couldn't make out his hand. What was this? Was he going to be OK? Nobody in the delivery room had an answer. The neonatal intensive care unit was called in and the doctor told us it was likely amniotic band syndrome. Within minutes, my son and husband were taken by ambulance to a children's hospital. I was devastated. I had waited so long for his arrival, and my boy had been whisked away. I wanted so badly to hold him. I was his mother, and I would fix this. The days after a birth are supposed to be filled with bliss. Ours were filled with scouring the Internet for any information we could find. I saw nothing to help parents. I saw nothing to help us. I had read all the baby books. I had all the tests. How could I have never heard of ABS? According to the National Institutes of Health, amniotic band syndrome is a condition where stringlike bands extend from the inner lining of the amnion, the sac that surrounds the baby in the womb. As the baby develops, its extremities may become entangled in these bands. Blood flow is restricted, resulting in stunted growth or even amputation. ""ABS is spontaneous and not genetically linked. It affects 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births,"" says Dr. Foong-Yen Lim, surgical director of the Cincinnati Fetal Center at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center. Our son was born with the bands still attached to his hand. The thumb on his left hand was severed. His first and second fingers were the size of golf balls. A band had wrapped around his right leg above his ankle. Thankfully, his leg and foot had formed normally, but the scar from the band was deep. Multiple surgeons told us to amputate his two swollen fingers, but I knew that he used those fingers. He used them to put his pacifier back in and to rub his eyes. Finally, Dr. Emily Hattwick, a pediatric orthopedic hand surgeon at Children's National Health System in Washington, told us that she could reconstruct our son's fingers. Yes, they would be small, but he would get use out of them. She showed us pictures of hands belonging to children just like my son. Colson had reconstructive surgery at just 9 weeks old, and will need surgery on his leg in the next few months to release the amniotic band above his ankle. He will need yet another on his thumb to lengthen it. He is 15 months old, and he uses his fingers to pick up food and to hold his sippy cup. He uses them just the way any other child would, only his are smaller. Our son doesn't know any different because this is how he was born. But we worry about him learning to tie his shoes. We worry about him starting school. We also worry about bullies. Since our son's diagnosis, we have found multiple places of support. There are Facebook groups for parents of children with ABS. There is also a wonderful and supportive group called Lucky Fin Project that celebrates children with limb differences. Every day he puts my mind at ease. He has a strength that is unimaginable. There is no doubt he will be able to do anything his heart desires, and we will be there every step of the way to support our beautiful, perfect boy.","Amniotic band syndrome restricts blood to a baby's limbs in utero .

"(CNN) -- ""Nostalgia"" and flimsy evidence led to guilty verdicts in the nation's oldest cold case ever solved, according to the man serving a life sentence for kidnapping and murdering a neighbor's child in 1957. In his 80-page appeal, former police officer Jack Daniel McCullough says he deserves a new trial because his mother was allowed to accuse him from the grave -- while he was kept from proving that he was elsewhere when a 7-year-old girl was abducted and killed. The appellate brief, filed Thursday by the Illinois state appellate defender, noted that nobody saw who grabbed Maria Ridulph from a street corner in Sycamore, Illinois, or witnessed how or where she was killed. No forensic evidence ties McCullough -- or anyone else -- to a crime so shocking it captured the attention of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the appeal states. Instead, the court papers say, prosecutors built their case on unreliable evidence, including inmate witnesses whose motives were suspect and others whose memories were dulled by the passage of time: . ""The evidence against Jack McCullough,"" the appeal contended, ""was so unreasonable, so improbable, and so unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder, kidnapping, and abduction of an infant."" That evidence included ""personal memories of what occurred 55 years ago; a photo identification made 53 years after the incident; testimony from jailhouse informants; innocuous statements from the defendant; and an improperly admitted and inconclusive statement from the defendant's mother while on morphine and Haldol just before her death."" The appeal cited many of the issues raised by legal experts who spoke with CNN for ""Taken: The coldest case ever solved,"" a five-part multimedia series published in August. The series was the basis for an hour-long documentary that aired on HLN. Read the appeal (PDF) McCullough was convicted in September 2012 of kidnapping and murdering Maria Ridulph 55 years earlier. The brown-eyed second-grader vanished from the corner of Sycamore's Archie Place and Center Cross Street on the evening of December 3, 1957. Her body was found the following spring in a grove of trees off a busy state highway about 120 miles away. The crime, which shook the small farming community to its core, is believed to be the country's oldest cold case ever prosecuted. Now 74, McCullough is serving a life sentence at a state prison in Pontiac, Illinois. He denied committing the crime in several letters to CNN and in a jailhouse interview last year. He also denied having anything to do with Maria's disappearance and death in a lengthy police interrogation in Seattle hours before his arrest. Prosecutors and investigators said his odd demeanor during questioning convinced them they had the right man. The DeKalb County State's Attorney, which prosecuted McCullough, declined comment and referred calls to the Illinois state appellate prosecutor, which also declined to comment on a pending case. A court clerk said both sides should finish filing their briefs by late June and arguments could be scheduled by summer. ""I think the problem with Jack's trial is, it was all emotion-based,"" said Janey O'Connor, McCullough's stepdaughter and most outspoken defender. She said she hopes his lawyers can convince the appeals court to view the case with a more objective eye. ""To find a man guilty based on conflicting stories, unconstitutional rulings and emotion and not allow Jack the chance to present the evidence that cleared his name in 1957 goes against our constitutional rights,"" she said. Testimony lasted little more than a week at McCullough's trial, which was decided by a judge brought in from a neighboring county. For the most part, the appeal focused on Judge James Hallock's pretrial rulings regarding what evidence to allow and what evidence to exclude. Hallock used an exception to the hearsay rule to let McCullough's sisters testify about a deathbed statement by their mother but excluded as hearsay police and FBI reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation. He also excluded a Sycamore police detective's investigation during the mid-1990s that concluded that another man, now deceased, committed the crime. ""In a court with murder charges at issue, the law demands more than nostalgia,"" state appellate defender Paul Glaser wrote. ""It demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt."" Glaser did not represent McCullough at his trial; he was appointed by the state to handle his appeal. The appeal noted that prosecutors ""took great effort to describe the gentle, small-town nature of Sycamore, Illinois, in 1957."" It was a time and place where the abduction and murder of a child playing in the season's first snow ""was a shocking, defining and tragic event,"" the appeal said, but criminal responsibility for kidnapping, child abduction and murder ""needed to be proven to competent evidence."" In this case, the appeal stated, the evidence presented against McCullough ""woefully failed to rise to the level of proof necessary to sustain his conviction."" The appeal criticized Hallock's rulings as a ""gross abuse of discretion"" that prevented McCullough from receiving a fair trial. Hallock declined to comment on the case, citing Illinois' code of judicial conduct. McCullough's appellate lawyers focused their attack on a hospital bed accusation by his sedated, dying mother that prompted Illinois State Police to reopen their investigation. The defense has long argued that it should never have been disclosed in court. McCullough's sisters testified that their mother told them ""John did it"" or ""he did it"" but gave contradicting testimony on what she meant by ""it."" Eileen Tessier, who was in the end stages of cancer, was sedated, ""emotionally disturbed,"" sometimes ""basically comatose"" and at other times ""pleasantly confused,"" the testimony showed. Prosecutors persuaded Hallock to allow the statement under a hearsay exception, arguing that Tessier could have faced obstruction of justice charges herself for covering up for her son all those years. But the appellate lawyers countered that criminal charges weren't a realistic possibility for a terminally ill woman. ""Instead the statement was an out-of-court accusation,"" the appeal stated, ""the admission of which should have been strictly forbidden."" Kathy Sigman Chapman was the prosecution's star witness and the last person to see Maria alive, besides the killer. Chapman, who was 8 at the time her friend vanished, was shown hundreds if not thousands of photographs as a child but didn't identify the stranger who called himself ""Johnny"" until 53 years after the crime. She was in her 60s and living in a neighboring city when an Illinois State Police detective knocked on her door and showed her a group of photographs. She picked one she had not seen before -- a recropped prom photo showing 17-year-old John Tessier, as McCullough was then known -- and identified him as the young man who gave Maria a piggyback ride minutes before she vanished. She also identified the photograph in court, but the appeal asserts that the appearance of the man in the photo differs from the description she gave in court of the man she saw on the street corner. Three jailhouse informants testified about conversations they said they had with McCullough while he was awaiting trial. They gave varying accounts of how he described killing her: with a wire, strangling her with his hands or dropping her on her head. The informants and several police detectives from Seattle, where McCullough was initially questioned and arrested, also testified about odd statements he made about Maria Ridulph. They said he described her as ""lovely,"" with big brown eyes and ""like a little Barbie doll."" While the appeal referred to those statements and vivid descriptions of a little girl he knew 50 years ago as ""innocuous,"" others have described them as unsettling, even ""creepy."" Given the circumstantial nature of the prosecution's case, the appeal asserted, the defense should have been able to expect some leeway. But, court papers say, the judge's pretrial rulings prevented McCullough from presenting his defense. He was unable to call a witness, former Sycamore police detective Patrick Solar, who concluded during the mid-1990s that another man committed the crime. And he was not permitted to present police and FBI reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation that indicated he was questioned and cleared from the list of suspects because he had an alibi. The reports indicated that McCullough spoke with military recruiters in Rockford, about 40 miles away, about the time Maria was taken from the street corner in Sycamore. They also seemed to verify his story that he made a collect call home, asking for a ride. Phone records at the time, long since lost, indicated that a collect call was placed from a pay phone in Rockford to the Tessier family home in Sycamore at 6:57 p.m. by someone giving his name as ""John Tassier."" The call lasted two minutes. Illinois law does not allow police reports and other documents as a substitute for witness testimony at trials. But in this case, almost all of the FBI agents and police investigators had died, and McCullough's defense sought to introduce the reports as ""ancient documents"" or public records more than 20 years old. Hallock, the trial judge, rejected that argument. ""The judge's decisions to prohibit Jack McCullough from introducing FBI records prepared at the time of the offense, despite their status as ancient documents and public records and their probative value in establishing Mr. McCullough's alibi, and to prohibit Mr. McCullough from presenting testimony showing another man committed the offense, amounted to gross abuses of discretion denying Mr. McCullough his fundamental right to present a defense,"" the appeal stated. By blocking the defense while allowing prosecutors to introduce ""irrelevant, but highly prejudicial evidence,"" the judge violated McCullough's right to a fair trial, the appeal stated, before delivering a final salvo: ""No rational trier of fact would have found the defendant guilty.""

"(CNN) -- A new search warrant was issued Monday for the apartment of Jesse Matthew, who police believe was the last person to see Hannah Graham before her disappearance. The Charlottesville Police Department has also issued a wanted poster for the 32-year-old Matthew, saying he is wanted for two counts of reckless driving. At the bottom of the poster, however, it says police would like to speak with Matthew regarding Graham's disappearance. The poster raised many questions -- chief among them: Do police believe Matthew is a suspect? -- but mystery has been an undercurrent of Graham's disappearance since she went missing nine days ago. Many questions remain unanswered, but here is what CNN knows and doesn't know so far: . What we know . Who is Graham? She's a second-year University of Virginia straight-A student, her parents say. ""Hannah is beyond precious to us,"" John and Susan Graham said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance. ""We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It's totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play."" Holding a stuffed bunny named BB, his daughter's favorite plush toy and ""guardian angel,"" John Graham pleaded this weekend that someone come forward with information on his daughter, who he said loved helping people. ""Last spring break, instead of hanging around on the beach, she spent a week in Tuscaloosa rebuilding houses,"" her father said. The 18-year-old Northern Virginia native is 5-feet-11 inches tall with a skinny build and has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was last seen September 13 wearing a black crop top, according to a UVA news release. Where was she before her disappearance? On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple blocks away from the party. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said Sunday. Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station -- no one appears to be pursuing her -- and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant in an area known as Downtown Mall, witnesses said. The surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 a.m. The camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, WVIR reported. At 1:20 a.m. she texted her friends to say was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself. What are police doing to find her? Longo has released the name of the man police believe was having drinks with Graham. ""I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the Earth,"" the police chief said Sunday. ""We want to talk to him."" Anyone who saw Matthew's burnt orange 1998 Chrysler coupe that night should call the police tip line at 434-295-3851, Longo said. Police had previously said they were looking for a man who did not fit Matthew's description, but rather, was a black male in his 20s or 30s with a shaved head and goatee. Matthew has dreadlocks. ""I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again because I think he can help up find Hannah Graham,"" the police chief said. They've interviewed 50 people and received more than 100 tips in the case, police said. This weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers and Virginia Department of Emergency Management officials spent the weekend searching for clues that would lead them to Hannah, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. As time passes, the search area grows, investigators say. The city of Charlottesville, UVA and the local community have contributed $50,000 to a reward for ""information leading to the cause"" of Graham's disappearance. What we don't know . Was she abducted? Though investigators have tracked down several surveillance videos, it's not clear where she's going or whether she's in trouble, Longo said. In addition to Monday's search warrant, authorities previously searched Matthew's apartment and car but have declined to say what -- if anything -- was found. Hours later, police said they had no reason to arrest Matthew. ""Is he in custody? No,"" Longo said. ""Was there probable cause to arrest him? No."" At another press conference on Sunday, Longo said he was hopeful that the crime lab analysis of evidence collected would yield new leads. Graham and Matthew were seen leaving a bar together, and Matthew drove away in his Chrysler coupe that was parked near the bar, and police told WVIR they have ""every reason to believe"" Graham was in the car, too. ""People saw Hannah and people saw him, and people saw them together,"" Longo said. Asked Monday whether he believes foul play was involved, the police chief did not mince words. ""There's no other way to look at it quite frankly at this point. There's just no other explanation but for that. I wish we knew more,"" he told CNN. Where is Matthew? Police have obtained an arrest warrant for Matthew on suspicion of reckless driving. While authorities were tracking his movement, they saw him get into a car and drive so fast and so dangerously that police were forced to back off, Longo said. Though he faces no charges in connection with Graham's disappearance, there is a warrant for his arrest. Matthew willingly went to a police station this weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, the police chief said. Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said, giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day Graham disappeared. Police executed a new search warrant at his home Monday, and Matthew's landlord told WVIR that police took two items. She also told WVIR that she hadn't seen Matthew since Thursday, and two of his roommates had moved out. The University of Virginia Medical Center confirmed to WVIR that Matthew has worked there since August 12. Are there links to other cases? The short answer is no. However, the Route 29 corridor where Graham disappeared has a peculiar history. According to WTVR, Graham is the fourth woman to disappear from the area since 2009. Morgan Harrington of Charlottesville, Alexis Murphy of Lovingston and Samantha Clarke of Orange also went missing there. All the women were between 17 and 20 years old, WVIR reported. In July, Randy Taylor, 43, was sentenced to two life terms for Murphy's 2013 abduction and murder although her body was never found, WVIR reported. Clarke's mother is still looking for answers more than four years after her 19-year-old's disappearance. Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Police have yet to track down her killer, and her family has long said they suspect there could be other victims. The T-shirt Harrington was wearing when she disappeared was found near where Graham disappeared. ""Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question,"" Longo told reporters this month. Harrington's mother told WTVR the Route 29 has an ""infamous reputation."" ""I don't know. Either there is a commonality or a crime spree,"" Harrington told WTVR. ""We have long passed a critical mass that needs looking at. If you look at the map of missing and abducted along Route 29 -- it's not a normal pattern."" CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine Shoichet, Chelsea J. Carter and Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.","Charlottesville, Virginia, police issue search warrant, wanted poster for Jesse Matthew .

"Washington (CNN) -- Five weeks before the November midterm elections, voters give Democrats an edge over Republicans, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. But the poll also indicates most of Democrats' gains are coming from the Northeast and not from the parts of the country where they're locked in tight contests that could give Republicans control of the Senate. In a generic ballot among likely voters, Democrats edged out Republicans 47-45%, a 6-point swing from a CNN poll three weeks ago when likely voters favored the Republicans by a 4-point margin. The Democrats' advantage is within the poll's 3.5% margin of error. The ""generic ballot"" question which asks Americans to choose between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican in their vote for U.S. House, suggests a shift toward the Democrats nationally, if not in key races in key states. The poll comes a week after the U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, and while poll respondents overwhelmingly think the economy is the more important issue, they gave Congress low marks for how it handled the ISIS threat and have more faith in President Barack Obama than GOP leaders to set the military policy to deal with the militant Islamist group. ""That may explain why the Democrats have gained strength on the national ""generic ballot"" question,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Democrats gained the most ground among men and independent voters, two key groups that could help Democrats in competitive races this November. Men took a 7-point swing toward Democrats from the previous poll, bringing the party within 6 points of Republicans' 49% support. ""That may be a sign that some men wanted to see aggressive action taken against ISIS and are rewarding the President's party -- or simply that the President's actions have convinced men that they don't need to send more Republicans to Washington in order to get action that they are looking for,"" Holland said. Republicans also lost support among independents as Democrats saw a 7-point bump, giving them a 44-42% advantage over rivals. And while the traction for Democrats comes in the wake of an expanded military campaign ordered by Obama, roughly two out of three Americans said the economy is more important than military action against ISIS in determining who they'll vote for in the midterms. Those numbers reveal a different mindset than in the lead up to the Iraq War, when 49% said in September 2002 the possibility of war with Iraq was a more important factor than the economy. That may be because most Americans, 59%, don't consider the conflict with ISIS to be a war, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday. Americans remain unsatisfied with Congress's handling of the situation with ISIS: 60% of Americans said they disapprove, just weeks after members of Congress absconded from Capitol Hill without a vote on military action against ISIS to campaign for reelection in their districts. But maybe that's not such a bad mark for Congress, given that 83% said in the CNN/ORC poll three weeks ago that they disapproved of how Congress was handling its job overall.","Democrats edged out Republicans 47% to 45% in generic ballot .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- In 1883, what was to become the iconic Orient Express train pulled out of Paris' Gare de l'Est on its maiden voyage to Istanbul, or Constantinople as it was known at the time. It was the creation of an entrepreneurial Belgian, George Nagelmackers, who had already founded the Paris-based parent company, the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. Now, the SNCF French national rail company is planning on bringing the Orient Express back to life and before doing so has teamed up with the Arab World Institute to bring to the public a long lost era when time had another meaning and traveling to Istanbul took four days and three nights.

It's important to make one thing clear right away: the superb new exhibit, Once Upon a time the Orient Express, thoroughly indulges in Orientalism; the exhibit celebrates the romanticized images that Westerners had of the Middle East during the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th. From the British Museum to the Tate Modern, mega-museums go big . Curator Claude Mollard and his advisers were perfectly aware that they might be accused of colonial nostalgia, and have gone about the exhibit intelligently, putting it into the historic and political context of the time. Moreover, that this world was a Western fantasy no longer becomes important when visitors board the several perfectly restored carriages of the Orient Express parked in front of the Arab World Institute: we would all have liked to be passengers on the train. Stepping back in time . The idea, explained Mollard, is to climb on board and imagine that the train has stopped in a station and the passengers have gotten out to stretch their legs, leaving their possessions in the carriages, a fur, a silk scarf or a tweed jacket draped over the seats. The first carriage is the 1929 Flèche D'Or, luxuriously decorated by René Lalique with molten glass nymphets set in panels made from Cuban mahogany. Champagne flutes are set on a table; a coat and women's scarf are thrown negligently over the back of a club chair. A copy of Le Figaro newspaper from 1883 refers to the Orient Express's first trip; photographs were not yet in use, the article is accompanied by an engraving of the train. Scrap metal find turns out to be a $33 million Faberge golden egg . On another table there is a bottle of brandy and a package of Gitanes cigarettes. The décor makes reference to the personalities who traveled in the train and often wrote about it -- French novelist Pierre Loti, Robert Baden-Powell when he worked as an intelligence officer using the cover of a butterfly collector or Mata Hari, the spy. Josephine Baker was involved in an Orient Express rail accident in 1931 when Hungarian fascists destroyed a section of a viaduct near Budapest; she gave an impromptu concert to calm the survivors. One table is set up with a Remington portable typewriter in honor of Graham Greene, whose 1932 novel Stamboul Train, later adapted to film, was set on the Orient Express. In another compartment identical to the one in scenes from the 1963 Bond film From Russia with Love, the movie is projected onto a screen. With wall panels in precious wood and door handles in gilded brass, each compartment had a matching washbasin and a built-in toiletries cabinet. Is Paris still cool? Naturellement . The 1929 Train Bleu's décor was more abstract with Lalique floral motifs in molten glass set into plane tree paneling. A salon-bar is equipped with bridge tables and armchairs; gambling was regular pastime during the journey. Cupboards are stocked with champagne and Bordeaux wine. The exhibit would not be complete without mention of Agatha Christie, whose celebrated 1934 novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" took place almost entirely on the train. Christie's place at a table is set up opposite her archeologist husband Max Mallowan with whom she frequently traveled, taking the extension of the Orient Express, the Taurus Express, which covered routes from Istanbul to Cairo, Teheran and Basra, passing through the cities of Aleppo, Jerusalem, Beirut or Baghdad. Icon of travel . The second part of the exhibit is inside the Arab World Institute and includes an exact model reproduction of the Orient Express chugging around on a long toy track. (The actual speed was 70 kilometers an hour). A section of the museum is devoted to the Arab world and the Taurus Express train extension. A large-scale interactive map helpfully points out the major historical and political changes in the region from the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Sykes-Picot agreement, the First World War, the Second World War up to the creation of the Israeli state. A gorgeous collection of Art Deco vintage travel posters is displayed, depicting the Pyramids and other Levantine monuments in vibrant colors, but also luxury hotels. The Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits opened hotels (such as the Pera Palace in Istanbul) in many of the cities the Orient Express and Taurus Express stopped in, in order to provide passengers with the luxury they were accustomed to. One of the highlights of the exhibit is a documentary made in Lebanon with two former employees of the Taurus Express. At 95 and 100 years respectively, one sold Taurus Express tickets for Thomas Cook in Aleppo, while the other was a mechanic. These men provide the link to today's world and are living proof of another epoch. The exhibit may travel next to Vienna, which was the last destination the Orient Express traveled to from Paris, to Liège, the birthplace of George Nagelmackers, and finally, Istanbul.

"(CNN) -- Before he died this year, a 14-year-old boy wanted to do something for his community. That's why Martin Romero asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to donate his wish to improve the local baseball fields that were his second home. Martin was diagnosed with stage IV brain cancer last fall, his parents told CNN affiliate KRQE. Originally, he wanted to skydive for his wish. ""Because of his tumor, they wouldn't allow that,"" mom Cindy Romero said. ""He would have had to get permission from his physicians."" When his condition worsened in January, Martin decided he wanted to upgrade the Albuquerque, New Mexico, fields where he had played baseball since he was 6 years old. Make-A-Wish donated $2,000 for improvements at South Valley Little League Baseball Field. Martin died in January, before he could see the renovated fields. His father said the new asphalt between fields makes it easier for people using wheelchairs, walkers or strollers to watch the games up close and support their teams. A painting of the young man was also added at the park. ""It's a situation where you can't even walk up and not shed a tear,"" John Romero said. ""Just remembering him on the field."" This week, the Bernalilllo County Commission will consider renaming one of the fields after him. If the commission approves the naming, a county naming and memorial committee will make the final decision.","Martin Romero was diagnosed with cancer last fall .

"(CNN) -- On World Mental Health Day, around the globe many of us, perhaps hundreds of thousands or even millions, will be raising awareness of mental health issues to challenge outdated views, and to put an end to life-limiting, and sometimes life-threatening, stigma and discrimination that's still attached to having a mental health problem in so many countries and communities. As mental health is a global issue so, sadly, is mental health stigma, shame and discrimination. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 450 million people worldwide have a mental illness. In Britain, the figures show that one in four of us will be affected by mental health problems, yet despite touching the lives of so many, people still come up against negative reactions when they disclose their illness, which makes speaking out and seeking the support they need much harder than it needs to be. In reality, nine in 10 people tell us at Time to Change that they face stigma and discrimination because of their mental health problem. What's more, over half (58%) say that stigma and discrimination is as bad as or worse than the illness itself. Managing a mental health problem can be difficult enough, just like managing a long-term physical health problem can, but imagine not feeling able to tell anyone that you've got diabetes or asthma. It's inconceivable. Talking about mental health can make a big difference and social contact -- which is where people with and without mental health problems come together to have a conversation -- is an extremely powerful approach in breaking down the taboo around the issue. At Time to Change this is at the core of our ethos and we have followed the lead of other anti-stigma programs across the world, particularly the ""Like Minds, Like Mine"" program that has been running for 17 years in New Zealand. To ensure that best practice is shared globally we are part of an International Anti-Stigma Alliance along with other anti-stigma campaigns from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Scotland, Sweden and Spain. Our latest campaign coincides with World Mental Health Day and aims to reach as many people as possible to transform their attitudes and behavior around mental health. It encourages people to have a conversation and promotes the little things that they can do to make a difference to someone going through a difficult time. As part of the campaign we are also delivering targeted work to reach people from African and Caribbean communities, and young people. We're seeing a powerful social movement for change with thousands of people taking the lead within their own communities and taking action (online and in person) to tackle stigma. There are also hundreds of employers, schools, service providers and media organizations delivering stigma-busting work. In England, a national survey showed that public attitudes towards mental illness improved significantly last year with the biggest annual improvement in the last decade and probably since records began 20 years ago. There has also been a marked improvement in intended behavior with people more willing to work with, live with, and continue a relationship with someone with a mental health problem. Change has finally arrived here in England, but we know that far more work is needed to end life-limiting stigma and discrimination; this is the work of a generation. Wherever you are on your journey to ending stigma, we hope World Mental Health Day allows you to make more progress towards this vital life-changing goal. The opinions expressed in this report are solely those of Sue Baker.","Mental health continues to carry a stigma says Sue Baker .

"(CNN) -- To some, it may sound like a strange way to spend a vacation. But for many visitors, the carefully manicured grounds of cemeteries can provide beautiful moments to remember history's fascinating figures. St. Louis No. 1, New Orleans . New Orleans is situated below sea level. Early in its history, each time there was a flood, the dead would literally rise. Residents soon learned that bodies shouldn't be buried in the ground. At the colorfully named St. Louis Cemetery Number 1 -- the city's oldest -- visitors see only above-ground tombs. Some are magnificent while others stand in various degrees of ruin. One intriguing figure said to be buried here is voodoo priestess Marie Laveau (1794-1881), who held sway over her wealthy white clients as well as the Creole faithful. Tours of the cemetery include haunted outings. 425 Basin St., New Orleans . La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires, Argentina . The first lady of Argentina from 1946 until her death in 1952, Eva Peron lies in the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery. Every day, tourists pay their respects at the black granite tomb. A public cemetery since 1822, it was only when the wealthy of Buenos Aires moved to this area that the elaborate above-ground mausoleums became common. The cemetery is home to a roll call of famous Argentineans, from presidents and military leaders to scientists and writers. Azcuénaga, Buenos Aires, Argentina . Highgate Cemetery, London . In the 1830s, parish cemeteries in central London became a health hazard, leading parliament to authorize seven new cemeteries in outer London. Highgate Cemetery was dedicated in 1839. Now listed on the English Heritage Register as one of London's great Victorian cemeteries, its most famous occupant is Karl Marx, but others buried here include novelist George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) and the parents of Charles Dickens. Guided tours are available for the East and West Cemeteries -- a tour is the only way to get into the latter. Was there ever a Highgate vampire? Readers can draw their own conclusions about reports in the 1970s and subsequent investigation by the British Psychic and Occult Society. Swain's Lane, London, Highgate . Central Cemetery, Vienna . Designed to accommodate expected population growth, the Zentralfriedhof opened in 1874 on the outskirts of Vienna. It's ""central"" in terms of significance, not location. Home to 3.3 million souls, many visitors nonetheless focus on its connection to Vienna's musical history. Composers Beethoven, Brahms and Strauss lie in rest here, while Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has an honorary monument in Group 32a, his actual grave being in another cemetery. Notably, and controversially at the time, the cemetery has a Catholic section, a Protestant cemetery, a small Russian Orthodox burial area and two Jewish cemeteries. Simmeringer Hauptstrasse 234, 1110 Vienna . Bonaventure, Georgia, United States . Located on the site of a former plantation, Bonaventure was established as a public cemetery called Evergreen in 1847. It became Bonaventure when the City of Savannah bought it in 1907. It's now listed on the National Registry of Historic Places. Notable people buried here include Confederate general Hugh Mercer, novelist and poet Conrad Aiken and singer-songwriter Johnny Mercer, who wrote lyrics for Hollywood movie songs, including ""Moon River."" The Jewish section has a memorial to victims of the Holocaust, whose ashes were brought here from a Nazi labor camp. Bonaventure's fame grew when a sculpture of the so-called Bird Girl from the cemetery was featured as the cover of the 1994 book, ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."" 330 Bonaventure Road, Savannah, Georgia, United States . Punta Arenas Cemetery, Chile . A small angel stands with head bowed and palms together in prayer, a beautiful figurine atop one of the 19th-century tombs in the municipal cemetery of Punta Arenas in southern Chile. The chapels built in the early part of the 20th century house the remains of some of the wealthiest families of the time, including Sara Braun. It's said that when she donated the money for construction of the cemetery entrance, she had but one request: that once she passed through the central doorway in death, the door would remain closed forever. And so it is till this day. 9, Magallanes and Antártica Chilena region, Chile . Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow . Adjacent to the World Heritage listed 16th-century Novodevichy Convent, the Novodevichy Cemetery is said to be Moscow's third most popular tourist site. Inaugurated in 1898, it grew in importance from the 1930s when the remains of many Muscovites, including writer Anton Chekhov, were transferred from small cemeteries that were being demolished. It's now used only for the burial of significant people. Among a host of famous Russian singers, writers, scientists, cosmonauts and generals buried here lie Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Boris Yeltsin, first president of the Russian Federation. Luzhnetsky proyezd, 2, Moscow . Woodlawn Cemetery, New York . Opened in the Bronx in 1863, Woodlawn Cemetery is one of New York's largest, with 300,000 souls at rest. It's a listed National Historic Landmark. At its entry stands a marble memorial to Civil War hero, Admiral Farragut. Within its grounds many larger-than-life figures are interred, including jazz supremo Duke Ellington, songwriter Irving Berlin, writer Damon Runyon and newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer. Many monuments and mausoleums were designed by top architectural firms and noted sculptors' talents are in evidence, such as the angel at the Angie Kinsley Monument created by Daniel French, whose credits include the seated Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial. E. 233rd St., New York . Waverley Cemetery, Sydney . They may be dead and buried but ""residents"" of Waverley Cemetery, set high on the clifftop above Bronte in Sydney's east, have spectacular ocean views. While its sculptures and architecture are fascinating, there's much to notice about the names on the graves. Among the 80,000 interments since 1877 are literary figures who helped define Australia's character, including Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar. When viewers watch the funeral scenes in Baz Luhrmann's film ""The Great Gatsby,"" due for release in 2013, they may think they're in Long Island. In fact, those scenes were shot at Waverley Cemetery. St. Thomas Street, Bronte . Père Lachaise, Paris . At the Cimetiere du Pere Lachaise, home to a million souls, lies the grave of Jim Morrison, whose visitors leave tokens of love. A crowd gathers at Chopin's grave, which is adorned by a statue of the muse with a lyre. There are kisses for Irish playwright and novelist Oscar Wilde. The list of the famous goes on. A moving site is the series of sculptures memorializing victims of the Nazis. There's a tribute to those who died in the French Resistance and a poignant sculpted figure of an emaciated victim of the concentration camps. Others place red roses on the tomb of singer Edith Piaf, whose funeral in 1963 was attended by 40,000 people. 16 Rue du Repos, 75020 Paris . Have we missed any?

"(CNN) -- A fraternity scavenger hunt at the University of Southern Mississippi was supposed to be a routine off-campus prank rushing pledges in the middle of the night: Go to the local zoo and get your picture taken next to a swan. However, the fraternity stunt at 1 a.m. Tuesday went awry when one student decided he wanted a Chilean pink flamingo instead -- to take back to the fraternity house, according to police and officials. The student climbed a 10-foot fence and threw a T-shirt over the bird, zoo officials said. What started as an innocent stunt has now resulted in the flamingo's death, a student charged with a felony, nine other suspects being investigated for conspiracy, and the indefinite suspension of the school's 65-year-old Delta Mu chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, officials said. A second flamingo later died from injuries caused by the pranksters' ""attack,"" zoo officials said. The second flamingo was a male and the mate of the first flamingo, and the male ""sustained his injuries by defending his mate,"" the zoo said on its Facebook page. Devin Nottis, 19, was arrested and charged with grand larceny, Hattiesburg Police said. He and his attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment on Friday. The case against the nine other suspects will be sent to the Forrest County District Attorney's Office for a ""grand jury to pursue an indictment,"" police said. $2,000 birds . The accusation led to a felony charge because a Chilean flamingo is worth $2,000, above the felony threshold of $500, said Richard Taylor, the executive director of the Hattiesburg Convention Commission, which operates the Hattiesburg Zoo. The fraternity members realized ""that this was a really, really bad decision"" when they saw the flamingo in their house and ""instructed that the bird be taken away,"" Taylor said. But the student accused of stealing the bird decided to leave the bird on a nearby bicycling trail, Taylor said. During that transport, one of the flamingo's legs was broken, and when the bird was found the next morning, it was unable to move and had to be euthanized, Taylor said. 'Terrible and heinous' Nottis has been placed on interim suspension from the university. None of the others being investigated had been suspended as of Friday, said Southern Mississippi Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Joe Paul. ""The university is taking swift and appropriate action in response to this incident,"" Paul said. ""This is a terrible and heinous act that has occurred, and inconsistent with the values of our institution."" The Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity said it was ""disgusted and outraged"" by the incident. ""The alleged actions by these students are inexcusable and indefensible. It is without hesitation that the chapter has been suspended. The individuals involved will also be brought up for expulsion"" from the fraternity, said the fraternity's executive vice president, Justin A. Buck. Police said they received a call at 2 a.m. Tuesday about several people possibly inside the zoo. The caller also said several young men were throwing eggs at a truck, police said. The caller said the males ""had a duck or a goose with them,"" the police report said. Responding officers, however, didn't find anyone. Zoo video breaks case . By 8:30 a.m., officers responded to a call about ""a pink flamingo on the side of the road,"" the police report said. Video footage from the zoo showed ""four subjects"" walking through the zoo about 1:15 a.m., police said. The zoo posted the video clip to its Facebook page and asked for the public's help in identifying the four people, Taylor said. A tipster told the zoo that ""there was a couple of Twitter feeds that seemed to point towards some knowledge of this, if not participation,"" Taylor said. The information was turned over to police. Death of the male mate . In the aftermath of the prank, zoo officials discovered a male flamingo was showing unusual behavior. He stood by himself, not with the flock. He also had abrasions, Taylor said. The male then died. ""We took it in for a necropsy, which revealed it had severe internal damage consistent with blunt force trauma,"" Taylor said. Some of the male's internal organs ruptured, Taylor said. ""It was trying to protect the mate and it was probably kicked or hit away in some fashion,"" Taylor said. As police continue their investigation, the zoo is evaluating whether to hire a night security officer, Taylor said.","NEW: Second flamingo is now dead from injuries defending its mate from the prank, zoo says .

"(CNN) -- The headlines about Ezra Miller may focus on him being the first openly gay actor to portray a superhero in a major motion picture -- but that's probably not exactly how the actor would phrase it. ""I'm queer,"" he told Out magazine in a 2012 interview. ""I have a lot of really wonderful friends who are of very different sexes and genders. I am very much in love with no one in particular."" Miller has been cast as the Flash in the DC Comics movie universe, presumably appearing in ""Justice League Part 1,"" which is set for 2017, before taking the lead role in ""The Flash,"" scheduled for 2018. He has attracted attention from critics and fans for his roles in dramas such as ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and ""We Need to Talk About Kevin."" Wonder Woman, Aquaman and more headed to theaters . Here are five things to know about the actor: . 1. He started young. Miller was only 6 years old when the New Jersey native would make treks into New York for a role in Philip Glass' contemporary opera ""White Raven."" The arts are in his blood, he has said. ""My mother is an artist through and through,"" he told Interview magazine.  ""She's a modern dancer. And I think the way she raised her children was with a playful, curious inquiry into the world."" 2. He's still young. Despite having longevity in the business, winning raves from respected costars like Tilda Swinton and being a bit of a darling of the indie movie world, the actor is only 22 years old. Independent film has been a perfect training ground for him. ""Everything you do as a young and budding artist will be, in some way or another, independent,"" Miller said. ""And then if you can be doing independent work that is subsidized in some way, that's a huge, beautiful leap in and of itself."" 3. Speaking wasn't always easy for him. The actor can actually thank his career, in part, for having to overcome a major challenge. Miller had such a pronounced stutter at an early age that he was introduced to singing to help overcome it. And so a career in opera was born. 4. You may have seen him locking lips with ... The actor and his ""Beware of the Gonzo"" costar Zoe Kravitz (daughter of rocker Lenny) were photographed in a make-out session that sparked speculation the pair had gotten really, really close on set. The 2010 movie about an underground student newspaper was filmed in an actual high school, which may have helped contribute to their possible summer romance. ""It was fun,"" Kravitz said of filming. ""It was just like being in school again."" 5. He's had some legal trouble. An arrest in 2011 on marijuana possession charges garnered Miller some headlines and unwanted attention, but there were at least two people who weren't surprised. He told Details magazine that his parents weren't at all shocked when they learned of the charges. ""My parents had been gritting their teeth for that phone call for a long, long time,"" he said.","Miller told Out magazine he is queer .
He will star in the DC Comics film ""The Flash""
Miller has had trouble with the law ."
"Acapulco, Mexico (CNN) -- Six suspects arrested and accused of raping a group of Spanish tourists in a Mexican resort city have confessed, a top official said Wednesday. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam declared the case ""resolved,"" although one suspect remains at large. ""There are already six arrests, confessed, totally confessed the full story of what happened, and we need only to arrest one more person identified in this process,"" he said. ""The case is solved."" The allegations last week grabbed headlines across Mexico and around the globe. Authorities said hooded gunmen stormed into a beach bungalow in the Pacific port of Acapulco and attacked a group of Spanish tourists, raping six women and tying up a group of men with cell phone cables and bikini straps. Rape case in Mexican resort city puts violence back in spotlight . Investigators have not yet determined whether the suspects arrested, one of whom is 16 years old and thus a minor, are part of a gang, Murillo Karam said. They also have not confirmed whether the suspects met the victims days before the attack, something local authorities had alleged. One suspect was arrested Tuesday and five others were arrested Wednesday morning ""after a very serious investigation,"" he said. All six have confessed, he said. Authorities in Acapulco had announced the detention of several people over the weekend, but those arrests had nothing to do with the case, Murillo Karam said Wednesday. The high-profile case in the resort city last week was a sharp reminder of significant security problems in a state that has seen violence surge even as homicide numbers in other hot spots across Mexico have started to dip. It drew renewed attention to topics that Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto had steered out of the spotlight since he took office in December.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi broke the Spanish league's all-time scoring record after hitting a hat trick in Barcelona's 5-1 victory over Sevilla. It has been a season of records for the Argentine international who, at just 27, already holds the record as Barcelona's highest ever scorer in European competition. But all eyes were on the diminutive striker at the Camp Nou stadium to see whether he cold break Telmo Zarra's 59-year-old record of 251 Spanish league goals. Typical Messi . In the end, Messi didn't just break the record: he equaled it, surpassed it and then extended it in typical fashion. His first, which tied the record, was a sublime left foot free kick which he bent over the wall into the top left hand corner of the goal. The second, which broke the record, was a surging run through the heart of Sevilla's defense that ended with Messi exchanging passes and sliding in to finish at the far post. His Barcelona teammates celebrated with him on the pitch by picking him up and throwing him in the air. But Messi wasn't finished there. He scored another fantastic goal to extend the record with a left foot shot on the run into the bottom left hand corner of the goal. ""Brutal record"" ""We are happy for everything. Obviously for Leo, it is an incredible, brutal record,"" Barcelona midfielder Xavi told AFP after the game. ""It is historic and I am very happy for him because he deserves it as a person and obviously as a player."" More importantly, however, the comprehensive victory allowed Barcelona to close the gap on Real Madrid at the top of the table who had beaten Eibar 4-0 earlier on Saturday. There were signs too that Messi's record might not stand for almost six decades, as the previous one had. Cristiano Ronaldo again scored twice, his 197th goal in just 177 matches.","Messi breaks Spain's scoring record .

"(EW.com) -- Spoiler alert! If you want to know how the ""Desperate Housewives"" series finale ended, keep reading. We break it down below. Bree (Marcia Cross): She was on trial for allegedly killing Gaby's (Eva Longoria) abusive stepfather Alejandro, which Carlos (Antonio Chavira) had actually done. Renee (Vanessa Williams) went to see her fiancÃ© Ben (Charles Mesure) when he got thrown in jail for contempt before their wedding because he refused to answer questions on the stand about an incriminating phone conversation with Bree. Renee told him she'd actually seen something the night of the murder, and the D.A., who'd been eavesdropping on their conversation, threatened to deport Ben if Renee didn't testify to watching Bree walk up her driveway looking disheveled and carrying a shovel. Bree's lawyer, Trip (Scott Bakula), finally got Bree scared enough -- and turned on enough -- that she told him the truth about what happened that night so he wouldn't be blindsided again. She told him he couldn't use the information against her friends, but fearing he'd lose the case -- and Bree -- he called Gaby to the stand. Bree faked fainting to get a recess. Carlos wanted to come forward and tell the truth, but Gaby said she'd confess because the jury would buy her doing it in self-defense but not him, a two-time felon. Carlos told her how much she'd changed, being willing to sacrifice herself for him, which is why he wouldn't let her risk it -- their girls need her around as a role model. To stop Carlos, Gaby put a switchblade in his jacket so the metal detector would go off and the guards would keep Carlos from entering the courtroom. She'd intended to confess, but someone else beat her to it. (More on that below.) Bree went free, and though she claimed she was refusing to see Trip because of his betrayal, it was really because she couldn't believe that he would want to be with her knowing all of her faults. They eventually reunited at Renee's wedding reception. They ultimately married and moved to Louisville, where Bree joined a club for conservative women. She was elected to the Kentucky state legislature. Gaby (Eva Longoria): Her story line involved a promotion to Head of VIP Sales at Cumberly's. She was spending so much time working, she ended up using Carlos' old tricks on him -- buying him a present to apologize for missing dinner. So, he used one of her old tricks on her -- he hired a hot gardener, Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez). Gaby didn't appreciate him joking about the time in her life she's least proud of (her affair), but his point was that they can't go down this road of neglect again. She said they wouldn't, they're adults now. Carlos helped her start a personal shopping website, which led to her own show on HSN. They bought a mansion in California and ""argued happily ever after."" Lynette (Felicity Huffman): She thought Tom (Doug Savant) invited himself over to her house to tell her he wanted to get back together. But instead, because he thought he'd seen her with another man, he told her he'd be filing divorce papers the next morning. After Roy (Orson Bean) reminded Tom how important it is to say things to the one you love when you still have the chance to, Tom told Lynette that even though she'd moved on and was in love, she'd always be the love of his life. She told him the man she was in love with was him. They got back together. And then... Katherine (Dana Delany), who is no longer a lesbian, returned to town to offer Lynette a job in New York heading the U.S. division of her wildly successful food company (which sells frozen croissants to French people). Lynette said no, but then reconsidered. Tom said he'd move wherever to make her happy, only he didn't think she'd ever feel complete. She used her matron of honor toast at Renee's wedding to make up with him. She told Renee and Ben that if they ever feel like a piece of their heart is missing and nothing seems to fill it, it's because it's already been filled by their love and they simply forgot that. Lynette would've stayed in town, but Tom agreed to move to New York. Lynette became a CEO, and they became the owners of a penthouse overlooking Central Park, where, years later, Lynette would yell at her six grandchildren. Susan (Teri Hatcher): She was waiting for the right moment to tell the ladies she'd be the first one to leave Wisteria Lane so she could help daughter Julie (Andrea Bowen) raise her baby. Susan kept trying to fix Julie up with her hot young obstetrician, but that was really just to give Julie a reason to ask her mother if she thought she'd ever find love again. Susan said she may have one more torrid romance in her, but if not, she had enough wonderful memories of Mike (James Denton), who's dead, and her children to keep her warm at night. Julie's water broke as she, Susan, Gaby, and Renee were in the limo on the way to Renee's wedding. Susan eventually stole the limo to get Julie to the hospital; Renee and Gaby, who insisted on stopping at Gaby's store to get her a dry wedding dress first, were taking too long. Renee and Gaby then had to walk/run to the wedding (security didn't recognize Gaby, who was without her work ID). Julie gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Susan told the new owner of her house that Wisteria Lane was anything but boring, and she, Julie, Julie's daughter, and MJ (Mason Vale Cotton) took one last drive around the block. Susan didn't know it, but everyone who'd died, including Mike and Mary Alice (Brenda Strong), was there to watch her go. They were always there, hoping those on the lane would remember that even the most desperate life is wonderful. Of course, the final shot of the finale showed us the new owner of Susan's home, a woman named Jennifer, was hiding a secret of her own. Some things will never change. Mrs. McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten): She was the real heart of the finale. Though she'd wanted to die at home, her doctor told her taking care of her would be too physically demanding for Roy. Just as she was about to move into hospice care, Susan, Bree, Lynette, and Gaby offered to take shifts helping Roy so she could stay. It was Gaby's turn the night she and Carlos were arguing over who would confess to the murder, and Mrs. McCluskey overheard them. She went to court that next morning and told Trip he should call her as a witness so she could discredit Renee's testimony because she'd seen her drinking the night she claimed to have seen Bree with a shovel. Instead, Mrs. McCluskey confessed to the murder. Because of her age and illness, the state didn't press charges. She wasn't done meddling yet: She'd been wanting Bree to find her Johnny Mathis' ""Wonderful! Wonderful!"" on vinyl â€” which she'd have Roy play over and over again as the end neared. Bree couldn't find it, so Mrs. McCluskey called Trip and asked him to help. He was happy to, because of what she'd done for Bree. Roy told Bree about Trip finding the record and assured her that he was a decent man -- not a manipulative lawyer. Bree thanked Roy for finding the record at Renee's wedding reception, which was the start of the conversation that ended with them getting their own happily ever after.

"(CNN) -- Following widespread criticism, Brazil's health ministry has scrapped an online campaign called ""I'm happy being a prostitute."" Prostitution is legal in Brazil and is expected to spike as the nation gears up for the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. The campaign aimed to promote safe sex and reduce the stigma against sex workers. Other posters in the campaign carried slogans such as ""I cannot be seen without a condom, my love."" But Tuesday, Health Minister Alexandre Padilha dropped the campaign, telling reporters he didn't think it was a message his office should be sending. ""The role of the ministry is to have specific content to encourage prevention among sex workers, who are a very vulnerable group,"" he said. As the nation prepares for the sports world stage, sex workers are getting ready as well.

"(CNN) -- A radiation monitor in California has detected a trace of radioactive material from the stricken nuclear power plant in Japan, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization said Friday. The exact amounts were not available, but the test ban organization's executive secretary, Tibor Toth, said the measurements were below what would be considered harmful to human health. The treaty organization's chief press officer, Annika Thunborg, said its officials were ""absolutely certain"" that the radiation detected in California is from Fukushima because the isotypes were consistent with those emitted by the Fukushima reactors, and the timing of their detection is consistent with projections. The test ban organization maintains a worldwide network of monitoring stations to look for evidence of nuclear explosions that could violate the prohibition in its namesake treaty, which has not come into force, against nuclear weapons testing. The treaty has been ratified by 153 nations but the United States is not one of them. The organization announced Friday that it has started sharing its monitoring data and analysis reports with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization because it could prove useful in cases like Japan's. The Sacramento monitor detected minute amounts of radionuclides -- substances that emit radiation -- which had been expected, Toth said. The EPA, in a statement, confirmed that a monitoring station in Sacramento that feeds into the treaty organization's monitoring system ""detected minuscule quantities of the radioactive isotope xenon-133, a gas that is produced during nuclear fission. The origin was determined to be consistent with a release from the Fukushima reactors in northern Japan."" It added, ""These types of readings remain consistent with our expectations since the onset of this tragedy, and are to be expected in the coming days."" It said the EPA's system ""has not detected any radiation levels of concern."" It described the exposure as ""approximately one-millionth of the dose rate that a person normally receives from rocks, bricks, the sun and other natural background sources."" EPA spokesman Francisco Arcaute said monitors at three sites operated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District for the EPA have not recorded anything higher than the typical ""background"" levels seen before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. ""We do not expect to see harmful levels of radiation,"" he said. The test ban organization's discovery is no cause for alarm, said Graham Andrew, an official with the International Atomic Energy Agency. ""As of now, there are no concerns in Japan or elsewhere about human health,"" he said. California public health officials had predicted Thursday that some radioactive particles might be detected but predicted that they would pose no danger. Even before the discovery, some drugstores in California were running out of potassium iodide, which prevents some of radioactive iodine's harm to the thyroid. Public health officials have urged people not to take potassium iodide as a preventive measure. It collects in the thyroid, protecting it from absorbing radioactive iodine. But it carries its own side effects, especially for people who have allergies to iodine or shellfish, or who have thyroid problems. CNN's Matthew Chance and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.","NEW: California exposure represents 1 millionth the background radiation dose rate .

"(EW.com) -- Pixar earned its 14th No. 1 at the box office this weekend — out of 14 releases. Yep, the animation studio, now owned by Disney, has never not opened a film in first place. Its latest release, Monsters University, was no exception. It finished at the top of its class. Monsters graduated with $82 million from 4,004 theaters in its debut weekend, making it the second biggest Pixar opener of all time behind Toy Story 3, which bowed with $110.3 million in June 2010. It also beat the opening of its predecessor, Monsters Inc., which opened with $62.6 million in 2001. That being said, when inflation is taken into account, Monsters Inc.'s debut adjusts to about $82 million today (and that was without 3D tickets). According to Disney, audiences were 56 percent female and 60 percent below the age of 25. Families made up 73 percent of business, and teens accounted for a solid 15 percent. The film played well with all ages, and crowds issued Monsters University an ""A"" CinemaScore, which should help it endure at the box office for weeks to come. EW: 'Monsters University' review . Monsters University's biggest challenge arrives July 3. That's when Universal's animated Despicable Me 2 hits theaters and will provide direct competition for families. The original Despicable Me became a word of mouth sensation and earned $251 million in 2010, and because it's still fresh in audiences' minds, it provides a formidable threat. But Disney is confident that positive audience reactions will carry Monsters University to success. Internationally, Monsters University took in $54.5 million this weekend from 35 territories, representing about 48 percent of the overseas market. All together, Monsters University has earned $136.5 million worldwide in its first three days. It should be noted that Disney declined to provide a budget for the film. Last year, the studio reported that Brave cost $185 million. Because filmmakers had to bring voice actors John Goodman and Billy Crystal back into the fold to work on Monsters University, it's likely that it cost substantially more than that. In second place, the Brad Pitt vehicle World War Z went totally viral with an excellent $66 million debut from 3,607 theaters. The zombie thriller, which reportedly cost over $200 million to produce (Paramount is admitting to $190 million), had a famously troubled production, but thanks to Paramount's relentless marketing campaign (including numerous ads in this year's hugely popular NBA finals), World War Z became the biggest opening of Brad Pitt's career, ahead of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which opened with $50.3 million in 2005. EW: 'World War Z' review . World War Z has a long way to go before it can be deemed a success, but its great box office debut and surprisingly strong reviews have wiped away much of the stigma that surrounded the project. Of course, the film's on-set drama didn't matter much to the average moviegoer. According to Fandango, 87 percent of people who purchased a ticket to World War Z said that the film's much-reported production struggles had zero effect on their decision to go. Who was the average moviegoer? Paramount reports that crowds were 51 percent female (yep, both a zombie movie and a monster movie played primarily to females this weekend) and 67 percent at least 25 years old. Overseas, World War Z earned $45.8 million from 25 territories representing about 30 percent of the international market, which gives the zombie film a $112 million total after just one weekend. Audiences issued World War Z a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade. Man of Steel fell by a hefty 65 percent in its second weekend to $41.2 million. The $225 million Superman reboot has now earned $210 million after 10 days, easily surpassing Superman Returns' gross, which topped out at $200 million in 2006. Unless it continues to plummet at this rate (which seems unlikely — World War Z and Monsters University provided unexpectedly massive competition), Man of Steel is still on pace to reach the $300 million mark. EW: 'Man of Steel' review . This Is the End and Now You See Me rounded out the top five with $13 million and $7.9 million, respectively. This Is the End fell by just 37 percent and has now earned $57.8 million against a $32 million budget. Now You See Me, meanwhile, dropped by just 29 percent and has earned $94.5 million after four weekends. The $75 million magician caper is now a lock to finish above $100 million. 1. Monsters University -- $82 million . 2. World War Z -- $66 million . 3. Man of Steel -- $41.2 million . 4. This Is the End -- $13 million . 5. Now You See Me -- $7.9 million . In limited release, Sofia Coppola's buzzy drama The Bling Ring, which stars Emma Watson, expanded too quickly for its own good. The film, which opened in five theaters last weekend, expanded into 650 locations and took in $2 million. Its resulting $3,077 per theater average limits The Bling Ring's chances for another major expansion. Next week, The Heat and White House Down hit theaters. How will they do?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scotland striker Chris Iwelumo marked his international debut on Saturday by missing an open goal in the 0-0 draw against Norway. Iwelumo made his debut appearance for his national side, but missed a two-yard tap-in. Despite the easy nature of the chance, Iwelumo is by no means the first player to fail to score in such simple circumstances on British soil... For this 11-a-side we have compiled 10 other heart-stopping gaffes to prove to the unfortunate Scot that he's not alone in his misery. How many of these other shocking misses do you remember? 1) Ronny Rosenthal: LIVERPOOL v Aston Villa 1992 . With the score tied at 0-0 the Israeli striker rounded the goalkeeper and, faced with the goal at his mercy, somehow contrived to smack his shot against the crossbar. Liverpool went on to lose the match 4-2. 2) Ryan Giggs: MANCHESTER UNITED v Arsenal 2003 . Giggs had scored one of the FA Cup's great goals when taking on the whole of the Arsenal defense in their semifinal at Villa Park in 1999. However, four years later, the Welsh winger managed to balloon his shot over the crossbar after a mistake had allowed him a clear run on goal. Arsenal went on to win 2-0 on their way to lifting the trophy. 3) Robert Pires/Thierry Henry: ARSENAL v Manchester City 2005 . Arsenal were 1-0 ahead, courtesy of an earlier Pires penalty, when they were handed another opportunity from the spot and instead of simply taking the second penalty, Pires attempted to roll the ball to French team-mate Henry. However, he scuffed the pass and conceded a free-kick in the process, much to the disgust of his opponents who accused Pires of lacking respect. Certainly the oddest penalty the Premier League has ever seen. 4) Kanu: WEST BROMWICH ALBION v Middlesbrough 2004 . With Albion trailing 2-1, and the clock on 90 minutes, the Nigerian striker managed to lob the ball over the bar from just one yard out -- something his manager Bryan Robson said at the time was 'almost impossible'. 5) Freddie Ljungberg: ARSENAL v Bolton 2005 . Swedish midfielder Ljungberg had already given Arsenal the lead in this FA Cup quarterfinal but, with Bolton steaming forward for an equalizer, he then astonishingly scooped the ball over the crossbar from two yards out with the goal gaping. The miss mattered little as Arsenal went on to beat Manchester United in the final -- and have not won anything since. 6) Gordon Smith: BRIGHTON v Manchester United 1983 . Smith will empathize with Iwelumo more than most. Smith is currently the chief executive of the Scottish Football Association, but during his playing career he was responsible for one of the most famous misses in FA Cup final history. With the score level at 2-2 in injury time, Smith was put clean through to give minnows Brighton the chance to make history. The commentator famous screamed: ""And Smith must score.."" He didn't...and United won the replay 4-0. 7) Gareth Southgate: ENGLAND v Germany 1996 . This Euro '96 semifinal at Wembley had finished 1-1 and each side had scored their first five penalties. Defender Southgate, not a regular penalty taker was next in line and his weak effort was hit straight at German keeper Koepke. Andreas Moeller then converted for Germany, who went on to win the competition. 8) Cristiano Ronaldo: MANCHESTER UNITED v Sheffield United 2006 . Just to show even the greatest fluff their lines. With Man United 2-1 ahead at Bramall Lane and cruising to the three points, a piece of Wayne Rooney magic on the right wing presented Ronaldo with an open goal just three yards out. However, the Portuguese wizard casually sliced his shot high over the bar. The visitors had the last laugh by winning the Premier League title, while the Blades ended up being relegated in very controversial circumstances. 9) Peter Van Vossen: RANGERS v Celtic 1996 . So bad was this miss, that even now a howler in front of goal is known in Scotland as 'doing a Van Vossen'. Rangers were 1-0 up at Parkhead when the Dutch striker, with the goal gaping and the keeper nowhere, contrived to shoot over the bar. Despite the howler, Rangers went on to claim their ninth Scottish title in a row at the end of the season. 10) Geoff Horsfield: BIRMINGHAM v Manchester City 2003 . With Birmingham losing 1-0 going into injury time, Horsfield is played through, goes around goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel but then comically mis-kicks and falls over with the goal at his mercy. The defeat left Birmingham in deep relegation trouble although they managed to avoid the drop that season. Don't agree with our list? Have we missed one out? Have you seen a more outrageous miss than these? Leave a comment in the Sound Off box below.

"(CNN) -- Two Burmese migrants accused of the brutal murder of two British tourists on a popular tourist island in Thailand last month have retracted their confessions, a lawyer representing them says. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, who have been in custody since October 1, had admitted to killing David Miller and raping and murdering Hannah Witheridge on Koh Tao, according to Thai police. However the men now say they did so under duress after being physically abused by police, Surapong Kongchantuk, the head of the Lawyers Council of Thailand, which is acting for the two suspects, told CNN Wednesday. Surapong said the men deny the murder and rape charges, and that an official complaint to the justice department of Samui, which has jurisdiction over the island, has been filed. They appealed for fair treatment for the two accused, he added. Thai police could not be immediately reached for a response. The two Britons were found dead on a beach on the island, a popular tourist destination, on September 15. Both were partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads. A hoe with blood on it was found close by, police said. Police Commissioner Gen. Somyot Poompanmuang previously told CNN that DNA in semen taken from Witheridge matched samples taken from the two men. ""The DNA matching result is out already and they matched with DNA found on the female victim,"" he said. Torture claims denied . Reports that the police extracted confessions through torture first surfaced earlier this month, when Burmese media reported that its two nationals had complained to a visiting lawyer attached to the Myanmar embassy. The revelation prompted national police chief Somyot Poompanmuang to hold a press conference in Bangkok to deny allegations his officers had tortured the suspects. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has called for a full, independent investigation into reports of misconduct by police officers. Allegations of torture should be investigated independently, and not by the Thai police, Richard Bennett, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific Program director, told CNN earlier this month. He also said there were questions of due process that had arisen, specifically the absence of legal counsel prior to the confession, and difficulties with interpretation. ""There is a fairly long-standing record of ill-treatment,"" in Thailand, he said. ""Impunity is also a problem. If the investigation shows ill-treatment, those responsible should pay."" The fact that the suspects are migrant workers, many of whom work in Thailand illegally, makes them more vulnerable, he added. Journalist Kiki D in Bangkok contributed to this report.","Burmese migrants who had previously confessed to double murder retract confessions .

"(CNN) -- Instead of contractions, they're called surges. And don't call it labor, it's birthing. When the discomfort of childbirth kicks in, it's pressure -- not pain. The philosophy behind HypnoBirthing is to remove the fear of giving birth, its practitioners say. They believe that by training themselves to calm their body and mind to a state of self-hypnosis, they can reduce pain and discomfort. It's another trend in birthing that gives women the opportunity to prepare for childbirth such as Lamaze classes, yoga and the Bradley method. While it's unclear how many women deliver babies using HypnoBirthing, it's institute says there are about 1,400 practitioners in the United States who train pregnant women to use the methods. Moms who've taken HypnoBirthing classes give birth at hospitals. Some choose to get pain medication, epidurals or cesarean sections. Others elect to give birth at home. The point of HypnoBirthing is that giving birth is natural and can be done with less anxiety, its practitioners say. It does not promise pain-free childbirth. ""The difference is that we're saying let us teach you what happens within the body,"" said Marie Mongan, a hypnotherapist who founded the HypnoBirthing Institute.  ""What we're doing is educating them about what is happening within the body."" August is typically the busiest month for childbirths, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. A handful of hospitals such as the Cleveland Clinic and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center offer HypnoBirthing training. These classes are usually offered along with a variety of other childbirth preparation courses. Mongan said HypnoBirthing's popularity has increased mostly because of word of mouth among moms and pregnant Hollywood celebrities. Actresses such as Jessica Alba and Tiffani Thiessen, and model Miranda Kerr have talked about the pre-birthing techniques that rely on deep relaxation. ""There are ever so many more practitioners who want to become involved at this point,"" said Mongan. ""We're 100 over where we were last year in people coming in wanting to teach HypnoBirthing. It seems to be everywhere. We're getting a lot more media interest, celebrity interest."" The 'easy' childbirth: One mom's story . Unlike the stereotype, in HypnoBirthing, nobody swings a pocket watch back and forth to lull a mother to sleep during labor. The mothers stay awake during the process, but train themselves to calm down so they may appear as if they're sleeping. Some use instrumental music, rhythms and affirmations. They are encouraged to visualize a relaxed place or a goal like cuddling with their newborn. ""It's like a self-hypnosis,"" said Joyce Poplar, a perinatal educator who teaches at Cleveland Clinic's Hillcrest Hospital. ""They're in a deep, relaxed, limp state. Every single woman is imagining something different -- whether it's a place in their mind, an outdoor place such as a beach scene. It's feeling it, being aware of it and having a sensory perception on that beach scene, smelling the salt in the air, hearing the seagulls. They're completely there in a trance-like state."" They also learn breathing techniques. ""The body knows how to birth the baby, just like it knew how to grow that baby for nine months,"" Poplar said. ""I'm teaching the moms the skills to listen to their bodies and the power of the uterus to do the work."" HypnoBirth instructors say the methods reduce pain that stems from apprehension and anxiety about giving birth. ""We really focus on relaxation, releasing all the fears that moms have when they're having birth,"" Poplar said. ""We're getting rid of the fears, memories, experiences, or the mistaken belief they might have had, so they can move forward with natural childbirth."" Melanie Johnson of Hudson, Ohio, had heard plenty of horror stories about labor. ""Everyone wants to inflate the negativity of birth, comparing who had it the worst,"" she said. That's why HypnoBirthers use a different vocabulary. But does changing some words and teaching relaxation techniques really result in a different type of labor? The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists referred CNN.com to the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Dr. Craig M. Palmer, the society's chair of the committee on obstetrical anesthesia, said he wasn't familiar with HypnoBirthing, but noted it could be a useful technique. ""Any sort of childbirth prep that a mother will undergo is useful from a medical and anesthesiologist's point,"" said Palmer, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center in Tucson, Arizona. ""The more prepared you are for labor, the more positive your outcome. As an anesthesiologist, any technique that improves patients' mental focus and state of mind is a good thing."" When Amber Diez, a mother of four from Pembroke Pines, Florida, was pregnant with her first child, she was told by her instructor, ""This is going to be the worst pain in your life."" It turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""It was the worst pain in my life,"" said Diez, who was in labor for 12 hours.  ""I was scared and nervous."" For her second pregnancy, she carried twins and dreaded childbirth.  So her doula gave her HypnoBirthing CDs.  At first, Diez scoffed at what she called, ""weird-sounding, hippie stuff.""  Her family poked fun at the CDs and pretended to fall fast asleep from hypnosis. Diez listened to the CDs every night for a few weeks. When she went into labor for her twins, she found herself relaxed. ""When you're not scared of it, you're able to focus on your body to do what it's made to do,"" Diez said.  ""When you're not afraid, you don't experience as much pain as someone else would."" Women who have tried HypnoBirthing say there is pain, but it wasn't unbearable. ""At the end of labor, right before they're about to come out, I did experience pain,"" Diez said.  ""It was right at the end. I felt like I trusted my body."" Johnson took HypnoBirthing courses because she wanted to give birth without drugs. When she felt the contractions, she serenely listened to Bach and Beethoven on her iPod and focused on her breathing techniques. Every time she felt a contraction she focused on her breathing. ""I visualized the goal on a surge-by-surge basis,"" Johnson said. ""You're visualizing what you've got to do to get through the surge."" When she screamed ""ow,"" her doula coaxed her into a rhythmic ohm. ""I did feel pain, but it wasn't intolerable,"" Johnson said. ""I knew if I could get through this one, I could get through the next one. I could restore energy between each surge."" After 14 hours of labor at home and eight hours at the hospital, Johnson gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Elise. ""It wasn't easy by any stretch,"" she said. ""They don't say there is no pain. The pain is going to be different for every woman. HypnoBirthing doesn't say you don't have pain. It gets you in a mode where you can endure it.""","HypnoBirth trains moms to calm  body and mind to a state of self-hypnosis .

"(CNN) -- The finish line is almost here. Americans have weighed a plethora of questions in choosing their presidential candidate. But amid the quadrennial explosion of political ads, bumper stickers and debates, some questions still baffle: Why is the Republican mascot an elephant? Why are Democrats linked to the color blue? And what happens if the candidates tie? Below, a voter's guide to such perpetually confounding riddles: . Q. Why are presidential elections always in November, and always on Tuesdays? It all comes down to weather, harvests and worship. Back when voters traveled to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allows people to worship on Sunday, ride to their county seat on Monday and vote on Tuesday - all before market day, Wednesday. And the month of November fit nicely between harvest time and brutal winter weather -- which can be especially bad when you're trudging along by horse and buggy. Politics: Plenty of ballot initiatives . But since many voters now travel by horsepower instead of live horses, some people -- like the group Why Tuesday? -- are pushing to move election day to a weekend day to increase the country's historically dismal voter turnout. According to the group, 15 states do not allow early voting, and 27% of non-voters said the main reason why they didn't vote was because they were too busy or couldn't get time off to vote. Q. Why do Republicans have an elephant and Democrats have a donkey? Back in 1874, cartoonist Thomas Nast used an elephant to depict the Republican vote in his drawing ""The Third-Term Panic."" The cartoon was published in Harper's Weekly after the owner of the New York Herald reportedly criticized the notion of Republican President Ulysses S. Grant running for a third term. (Grant didn't end up running in the next election). In the drawing, an ""ass"" -- depicting the New York Herald -- scares away other animals in a forest as the elephant -- or the Republican vote -- looks like it's about to stumble into a pit. But that cartoon isn't where where the Democratic donkey came from. In 1828, Democrat Andrew Jackson's critics called him a ""jackass"" because of his populist views and his slogan, ""Let the people rule."" Jackson decided to run with it -- even using images of a donkey in his campaign ads. Later, Nast also used a donkey to depict the Democratic party. Q. Why are Democratic states ""blue,"" and why are Republican states ""red""? There's nothing magical about this color scheme. Essentially, the media made it up. Find your ballot, polling place . Sure, there are logical reasons to use red and blue -- both are colors in the American flag, and they look sharp on infographics because they're pretty much on opposite ends of the color spectrum. But the seemingly arbitrary color assignments have actually flip-flopped over the years. In 1980, states won by Republican Ronald Reagan were colored blue; Democrat Jimmy Carter's states were colored red. Even as late as 1996, major media outlets were divided on how to color-code the parties. But in 2000, when Americans were subjected to weeks of news about recounts, pregnant chads and electoral infographics, everyone seemed to get on the same page and shaded Republican-leaning states red and Democratic-leaning states blue. Q. What happens if candidates tie in electoral votes? It's possible that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney snag the exact same number of electoral votes. In that case, the 12th Amendment says the House of Representatives gets to pick the president. And since analysts expect Republicans to maintain control of the House, Romney would likely win the presidency. Pick your electoral map . In the same scenario, the Senate would get to choose the vice president. And because Democrats are expected to keep control of that chamber, senators could select incumbent Vice President Joe Biden to form a split administration. Politics: Could close race produce a popular/electoral vote split? Q. Why do presidents have to wait all the way until January 20 to assume office? It used to be a lot longer. Until 1937, presidents didn't get sworn in until March 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots, and because of the winner's logistical issues in moving to the capital. But then better technology kicked in, and the 20th Amendment moved presidential inaugurations to noon on January 20 -- allowing presidents to start taking care of business sooner.","The Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant started with negative connotations .
Some people are campaigning to move Election Day from Tuesday to a weekend day .
If Romney and Obama tie, the U.S. could get a Republican president and a Democratic VP .
The color assignments for Republicans and Democrats have flip-flopped over the years ."
"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- In all likelihood, the 91 Cuban health workers heading to West Africa on Tuesday will face the most perilous assignment of their careers. They are joining 165 of their colleagues already working in the region to halt the spread of Ebola. Although Cuban government officials say the majority of the health workers being sent to West Africa are veterans of previous tough postings, the risks that Ebola presents are unique. ""This is the biggest challenge I have ever faced in my life, it's a very dangerous disease,"" said Dr. Osmany Rodriguez, a Cuban who completed previous assignments in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Rodriguez said he will soon be sent to treat people suffering from Ebola in either Liberia or Guinea. ""My family, they are a bit worried but they know I will be taking care of everything. They will trust in my daily habits and routines in order to avoid the disease,"" Rodriguez said. Rodriguez spoke to CNN as he trained at the Pedro Kouri Institute for Tropical Diseases in Havana, where health workers are drilled by instructors provided by the World Health Organization on how to put on and take off seven different layers of clothing that provide protection from the epidemic. ""The important thing is to save lives,"" said Dr. Jorge Perez Avila, the institute's director. ""Why are Cubans going to Africa? To save lives."" Cuban medical diplomacy is as old as the revolution that first brought the Castros to power, but its motivation is not purely altruistic. Sending health workers abroad boosts the image of a country whose human rights record is criticized. And in some cases, as with a program that sent thousands of Cuban doctors to Venezuela, the island gets paid back in trade, such as oil. Cuba's Ebola efforts have already raised discussion about how it compares to what the United States is providing. ""While the United States and several other wealthy countries have been happy to pledge funds, only Cuba and a few nongovernmental organizations are offering what is most needed: medical professionals in the field,"" the New York Times opined in an editorial. ""It is a shame that Washington, the chief donor in the fight against Ebola, is diplomatically estranged from Havana, the boldest contributor. In this case the schism has life-or-death consequences, because American and Cuban officials are not equipped to coordinate global efforts at a high level,"" the editorial continues. Cuba's health care system was degraded by the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early '90s. In recent years, the government has sent health workers to Venezuela and Brazil, in exchange for badly needed hard currency and oil. Those programs make up one of the largest sources of income for the island. Still, the island continues to post health care workers to other developing nations and even before the Ebola crisis began, had over 4,000 doctors, nurses and technicians stationed in Africa. ""Our principle has been to share what we have and not to give what we don't,"" Perez said. The Cuban health workers will work in West Africa for at least six months. If they themselves become infected, they have agreed not to be repatriated to Cuba for treatment, to avoid spreading the illness further. On Monday, at an emergency summit in Havana of representatives from 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries, Cuban President Raul Castro said the danger presented by Ebola transcends borders and politics. ""We should try to avoid the politicization of this grave problem, which distracts us from the fundamental objective: helping to stop the epidemic in Africa and stop it from spreading to other regions,"" he said. In a rare conciliatory gesture to the U.S. government, which Cuban officials typically deride as an imperialist power intent on wrecking the island's economy, Castro said the fight against Ebola should unite the two governments. ""Cuba is willing to work elbow-to-elbow with all countries,"" Castro said. ""Including the U.S."" Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro also penned an editorial in the state-run newspaper this week, offering to ""gladly cooperate with American personnel on this task"" of fighting Ebola. In a similar gesture in 2005, Cuba offered to send a team of doctors to aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. government ignored the request. Possibly signaling that it recognized the boost Cuba gains from medical diplomacy, the U.S. government in 2006 announced a program to entice Cuban doctors to defect. The Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program allows Cuban health professional working in a third country at the behest of the Cuban government to defect to the United States. While so far not accepting the Cuban offer to cooperate in the fight against Ebola, US officials have also praised the Communist government's efforts to stop the epidemic. ""Already we are seeing nations large and small stepping up in impressive ways to make a contribution on the frontlines. Cuba, a country of just 11 million people, has sent 165 health professionals and it plans to send nearly 300 more,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday. The United States has pledged some 4,000 military personnel to assist with the fight against the disease in Africa, although the troops are not expected to treat people suffering from Ebola. While help continues to pour in from around the world to West African countries reeling from the epidemic, the most basic need is doctors and nurses who can treat Ebola patients without falling ill themselves, health officials said. ""There is a lack of human resources, so it has been a major contribution,"" said Dr. Jose Luis Di Fabio, the WHO's representative in Havana, who is coordinating the training of the Cuban health workers. ""You have to identify patients, diagnose patients and treat patients. If you don't have the human resources to do that, you don't have anything,"" he said. ""Human resources in Africa is the major thing that's lacking."" Nurse Carlos Garcia Hernandez is one of the Cuban health workers training to fight Ebola. He volunteered, he said, because if Ebola isn't stopped in West Africa, it will continue to spread to other countries. ""If it could show up it in developed countries like the U.S. and Spain, it can show up in undeveloped countries, too. Our families are at risk as well,"" he said.","Nearly 100 additional Cuban health workers heading to West Africa .

"(CNN) -- To the outside world, the crisis in Ukraine seemed to come out of nowhere. Cast your mind back to the days before everything changed. Before the revolution; before the downing of MH17; before the Russian tanks rolled into Crimea. Who could have possibly foretold how events would unravel? But for a group of Ukrainian artists, the violence of 2014 was no surprise. They had been warning of the impending unrest for years -- through the medium of visual art. ""It really is uncanny,"" says Nigel Hurst, the CEO of the Saatchi Gallery in London, which is hosting a new exhibition of Ukrainian artworks. ""If you look at the art created in the years before the crisis, it is hard not to come to the conclusion that these artists had a sort of weird foresight. It's as if they had a crystal ball."" Predicting the future . The exhibition, titled Premonition: Ukrainian Art Now, is the biggest of its kind in the world, and will run until 3 November. Some of the artworks will make the hair on the back of the neck of even the most cynical observer stand on end. Maxim Mamzikov's 2012 painting, ""Beach,"" shows people relaxing by the sea -- while behind them a paratrooper is landing in the surf. A series of photographs called ""Mother of Cities"" by the artist known as Napsprom, which was created in 2005, envisages the burnt-out shell of the national museum in Kiev. Only the faÃ§ade is left; the rest of the building is a charred, overgrown ruin. A spine-chilling 2012 painting by Vasily Tsagolov depicts a crowd of protesters with pitchforks, running side-by-side with skeletons. It is titled ""Ghost of Revolution."" Last but not least, Victor Sydorenko's 1996 painting envisages a scenario that is eerily similar to the events of 2014, with a group of people watching an explosion. Its name? ""Invasion"". Prophetic images . Other artworks seem to prognosticate the unrest in a more metaphorical way, conveying a palpable sense of unease, concern about the fragility of the country, and fear for the future. The centerpiece of Sergey Bratkov's series of photographs called ""Ukraine"", for example, is a picture of a foreboding, dark cloud hanging over the landscape. It was created in 2013, a year before the unrest. Pavlo Kerestey's ""Kids Fighting Friend,"" painted in 2007, depicts one teenager stoning another while a gang of onlookers cheers him on. And Mariia Kulikovska's installation ""Untitled,"" from 2012, is comprised of a fractured section of road with smoke seeping ominously through the cracks. Hope for Ukraine . Yet despite these macabre images, Hurst says that the exhibition is underpinned by optimism. ""A good number of the works are uplifting, using bright colors and witty references to Western pop culture and Soviet iconography,"" he says. ""Overall, the exhibition teaches us a lot about warmth, openness, and resilience of the Ukrainian people, and expresses a huge hope and aspiration for their country."" It can only be hoped that the artists are as justified in their optimism as they were in their fears.

"East Porterville, California (CNN) -- California's historic drought has finally delivered its ultimate devastation: hundreds of homes in one community bone dry, devoid of tap water. The Central Valley farming community of East Porterville is a place where 400 homes are without running water. No showers. No flushing toilets. No way to wash dishes. That's because private wells have run dry. Turning the spigot is a futile exercise. ""At first, it was dread that came over us. What are we going to do?"" said Tony Alvarez, 62, a father of five whose home has been without water for weeks. ""We are a low-income family. Things are hard enough as it is, trying to get everybody to school and get everybody ready."" The worst of the drought is tormenting the Tulare County community 160 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. In East Porterville, drinking water comes from private wells, not public utilities. Of the community's 7,300 residents, nearly 1,000 are without running water, county officials said. Into this void has stepped a 71-year-old grandmother who saw a need and responded. She started by buying bottled water with her own money and delivering it to a list of people -- which just kept getting longer. 'An angel' What began as a mission of charity by Donna Johnson, a retiree, is now a well-publicized relief effort, inspiring businesses and others to donate bottled water. ""She has a big heart. She's an angel,"" resident Angelica Gallegos said of Johnson. Johnson regularly visits Gallegos' door to ensure that she, her 5- and 10-year-old girls and husband have enough water for the week, Gallegos said. Johnson does the same for the elderly, the sick and anyone who needs it. She interrupted her retirement when she discovered just how many of her neighbors were living without running water. ""So many people were not informed of what to do in a drought like this. I thought there are people who don't speak English, people that are elderly, they're pregnant, have diabetes, that are ill, everyday people. It doesn't have any prejudice. It affects everybody from the low-income to the higher-income person,"" Johnson said. State of emergency . Johnson's humanitarian project comes as 100% of California faces at least a moderate drought and more than half of the state faces the worst category of dryness, called an exceptional drought, the U.S. Drought Monitor says. California isn't the only state feeling an absence of rain. As of late September, 30% of the Lower 48 faced at least a moderate drought, particularly in the Southwest states neighboring California and in Texas, the Drought Monitor says. But none of those states is facing the extremes of California, where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012. In fact, Gov. Jerry Brown this year declared a state emergency, saying his constituents are facing ""perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" On September 16, Brown signed ""historic legislation"" that creates ""a framework for sustainable, local groundwater management for the first time in California history,"" the governor's office said. Before the new legislation, California was the only Western state that didn't manage its groundwater, officials said. In the meantime, dramatic struggles and responses are unfolding in communities like East Porterville, whose new heroine is receiving national attention. With one jug of water in each arm, Johnson moves at a frantic pace through the dust and often 100-degree heat to deliver drinking water to as many people as possible, as fast as she can. She is now assisted by Matt Rogers, her 19-year-old neighbor who saw how she helps people suffering from the drought. ""It's almost like an illness. It kind of spreads and all of a sudden it's a catastrophe, and it is a disaster,"" Johnson said. Ahead of officials . Without Johnson's effort, officials say they would not have known just how many people were hurting. ""She really helped raise awareness about how bad it was in this confined area,"" Tulare County Emergency Services Manager Andrew Lockman said. Many residents never thought the drought could so profoundly alter their lives. ""You never expect it and you never want to live through this. It's really hard,"" 17-year-old Sandra Tapia said as Johnson delivered water. Her father, a field hand, came home one day in August and discovered there was no running water for his family of six. ""You can't go to the bathroom, you can't take a shower, you can't wash dishes. You have to conserve every single drop,"" Tapia said. Officials say they value Johnson's bringing attention to the disaster because some residents simply don't know what would happen if they told authorities about their lack of running water. Community in fear . For example, some residents worried the government would red-tag their homes and make them move. Migrant workers worried their landlords would kick them out if they reported the problem. Undocumented immigrants panicked about being deported if they had contact with authorities. Authorities sought to soothe those suspicions and fears. ""We're not here to make things worse,"" Lockman said. The 400 private wells without water in East Porterville are just a fraction of the 30,000 private wells throughout Tulare County, which also includes portions of the Sierra Nevada and the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, officials said. As distressing as the empty wells are, officials are also concerned it will take a long time to restore all of them, whether empty or low. ""The issue is we still expect this to get worse, even if we get a substantial rainfall this winter. A lot of the areas in the county are going to take a year or two years to recharge their water levels,"" Lockman added. There is no quick fix. A grandmother weeps . Homes with private wells aren't hooked up to water mains, and such a connection could take years, officials said. The original deal was that residents with private wells would not get a water bill but were responsible for maintaining the wells. That became a problem in the drought because many residents can't afford the thousands of dollars it takes to drill a deeper well. Moreover, even if residents have the money, there is up to a two-year backlog to hire a company to do the job, officials said. In the meantime, county officials are helping residents secure grants for delivery of commercial bottled water. For now, the county is offering a 5,000-gallon tank of water outside the local fire department. Residents can't use that water to drink or wash dishes because it's not potable, but they can use it for toilets, baths and laundry. Residents show up not just with buckets but 55-gallon drums. On a recent afternoon, as he filled up several jugs of water, Alvarez, the father of five whose home has been without water for weeks, called the tank a real help, but he worried about folks who don't have transportation and are out of water. That is where Johnson comes in. At first, she bought the bottled water with her own money and delivered it herself, but now she enjoys donations of bottled water and help from the young neighbor who was inspired by her work. She labors voluntarily through the heat three days a week, but the demands of one recent day proved to be overwhelming: Johnson broke down in tears, feeling the depths of the insidious disaster. She finds comfort in her work, though. That's because her private well has run dry, too, and she savors the kindness of donations. ""Without water, you can't survive, you can't keep your home and you can't keep water in it, and my heart goes out to everybody,"" she said.","California's historic drought leaves nearly a thousand people without water .

"(CNN) -- Bob Lyon remembers the day he met Howard Hughes. He also recalls when Hughes nearly crashed a plane into his boyhood home. Nearly 40 years after Hughes died, Lyon's life still crosses paths with the eccentric billionaire. Lyon has found himself in the center of a dispute over Hughes' gigantic, bizarre wooden seaplane nicknamed the Spruce Goose. This thing is arguably the world's most famous airplane and -- at five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field -- one of the biggest on the planet. Related: Stalking the world's biggest planes . The Spruce Goose's home is a respected aviation museum, which is part of an investigation by the state of Oregon. Here's the story: In 1992, Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, struck a half-million-dollar deal with Aero Club of Southern California to buy the legendary plane. Lyon -- who represents Aero Club -- is now negotiating the plane's final payment, which he estimates at about $50,000. For Lyon, this is way more than everyday business. ""This plane was a part of my life,"" said Lyon, 77. ""I saw it being built. I saw it being put together."" Unfortunately, negotiations have hit a snag. More on that in a minute. First, you gotta know about the amazing story surrounding the plane and the man who flew it. Its official name was the H-4. Hughes called it the Hercules. Designed to carry more than 700 troops, the Spruce Goose flew only once. In 1947 in Long Beach harbor, it grabbed about 70 feet of air for about a mile. Hughes â€” who piloted the test flight â€” said it needed more development. He never let it fly again. Was the flight a failure, as some newspapers suggested? Depends on who you ask. Hughes did prove the thing could fly. But it was never officially certified. Lawmakers hauled Hughes before a congressional committee to justify the plane's taxpayer price tag of $22 million. Hughes pointed out that he had spent an additional $18 million of his own funds to develop the plane. Fearless rogue pilot . When Lyon met Hughes, it wasn't the OCD-plagued, naked, bearded recluse portrayed near the end of Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator."" This was before that. This was a younger Hughes -- the seemingly fearless, rogue pilot and entrepreneur who was hell-bent on success for his aircraft manufacturing company. Lyon was then 10 years old. Hughes seemed like a likable person when they met at the office of Lyon's father -- who was Hughes' patent lawyer. ""I'd never seen a tall, lanky, guy with a Texas accent before,"" he remembers. ""I grew up in Southern California."" In July 1946, the young Lyon had a more memorable brush with the man when Hughes crashed a prototype reconnaissance plane a block away from his parents' Beverly Hills home. The boy arrived at the crash scene to see a fire, a huge column of black smoke and what was left of three damaged houses. No one was killed, but Lyon saw an ambulance driver help transport a seriously injured victim. ""That turned out to be Howard Hughes,"" he said. Soon, other neighborhood kids descended on the scene and started grabbing small pieces of wreckage and running off with them as souvenirs. Lyon remembers police canvassing the neighborhood looking for the missing debris. ""My brother and I were upstairs and my mother went to the front door and there were two officers from the Beverly Hills police department asking, 'Do you have any young children in this house?' She yelled upstairs to us, saying, 'Do you have some pieces of that airplane?' We said, 'No!' And she said, 'Yes, I think you do! Bring them down here! The police are here and they want them.' So we pulled this piece of metal out from underneath my brother's bed and took it downstairs,"" Lyon recalled with a chuckle. ""We thought that was highly unfair."" That same year Lyon watched trucks roll the Spruce Goose down local streets from the plane's construction site on Los Angeles' west side to Long Beach. They ""cut telephone and power lines to get this huge thing down the road."" Hughes died in 1976 at age 70, and by the early 1980s the Spruce Goose was forced to move out of its giant Long Beach hangar. The plane's owners -- including Hughes' Summa Corp. and the U.S. government -- gave the plane to the Aero Club. The transfer forestalled tax expenses and the prospect of cutting the plane into pieces for display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. ""The Aero Club's mission in this whole thing was to save the Spruce Goose,"" said Lyon. The club leased the plane to a company as a tourist attraction. Spruce Goose was moved a short distance away to a spectacular seaside dome next to the moored luxury liner Queen Mary. Around that time, during a celebration dinner, Lyon arrived late to what was supposed to be an escorted tour of the plane. He took the liberty of exploring it alone. Lyon, who also has an engineering degree and a pilot's license, said it was like being a ""kid in a candy store."" He wandered inside one of the aircraft's gigantic wings, amazed at the plane's engineering. He climbed up a set of stairs into the cockpit, daring to sit in the pilot seat where Hughes flew the plane in 1947. ""I noted that there were controls for the pilot, but none for the co-pilot,"" Lyon said with a chuckle. ""Yeah, Howard was gonna fly it. He didn't need any help."" Eventually the Spruce Goose had to leave the dome. That's when Aero Club struck a bargain with Evergreen and the behemoth was floated up the West Coast on barges in a spectacular 138-day moving operation to Oregon. Now, Lyon is piloting Aero Club's negotiations for the plane's final payment. The dispute, said Lyon, basically comes down to a payment formula and the interpretation of three words: justifiable operating expense. ""It's a problem of contract interpretation,"" Lyon said. News media reports have overstated the negotiations' worst-case scenario, he explained. ""We're not interested in repossessing it. It would be a nightmare."" For its part, the museum agrees with Lyon. ""... both sides expect a prompt resolution of that payment,"" the museum said in a statement. Although the museum declined CNN's requests for an interview, the museum's statement said the facility remains open, is financially viable and has no plans to close. Bottom line: museum-goers -- which number around 150,000 a year -- have nothing to fear, Lyon said. ""The Spruce Goose is going to stay where it is."" ""The museum is no danger of losing the Spruce Goose,"" echoed Evergreen spokeswoman Melissa Grace in a statement. ""It will stay at its home at the museum for visitors to enjoy for years to come."" But the museum faces another financial issue. For months the Evergreen museum, and a related organization called the Captain Michael Smith Educational Institute, have been part of an investigation by Oregon's Justice Department. Agency spokesman Michael Kron said the investigation was sparked by ""people who were concerned about financial transactions by Evergreen."" The museum owner holds companies that are for-profit and some that are nonprofit. There have been allegations of improper transfer of funds between the two types of companies. The museum said it is independent, self-sufficient and nonprofit. Kron describes the probe as a ""charitable activities investigation into the charity that runs the museum."" Recently, a broker listed two of the museum's plane exhibits -- a 1945 Grumman Avenger for $250,000 and a 1928 Ford Tri-Motor â€” for $1.75 million. It's unknown if the museum's decision to sell the planes is linked to its financial issues. ""The vast majority"" of the museum's aircraft exhibits, it said, ""are unaffected by issues"" linked to the investigation. Evergreen said most of the planes on display at the museum are on loan from some of the best aviation museums in the world, including the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum and the National Naval Aviation Museum. The museum says it's ""in no danger of losing its displays from these and other sources"" and it has ""cooperated with the Department of Justice in its review and that we are confident the Department of Justice would acknowledge our cooperation and the good work we have put into addressing concerns it has raised."" Kron said a final investigation report is expected to be made public soon. Meanwhile, Lyon is nearing the finish line as a custodian of this aviation icon. During the two decades since the Spruce Goose deal was struck, he's never traveled to Oregon to see the plane. But, he said, who knows? When it's all said and done, he may fly up for a visit.","Museum housing Howard Hughes' giant seaplane is part of an investigation .

"Overland Park, Kansas (CNN) -- The man accused of killing three people at two Jewish-affiliated facilities in Kansas made no secret of his racist views, writing letters to newspapers and inviting people to white-supremacist meetings at his home, say those who knew him. So when news broke that Frazier Glenn Cross had been charged with one count of capital murder and one count of first-degree premeditated murder in connection with the killings, it didn't come as a surprise to the mayor of Marionville, Missouri. ""It was kind of shocking at first. But then reading the article and thinking about it, I thought 'yeah that sounds like something he would do,'"" said Dan Clevenger, who has known Cross for 12 years, describing him as a client at his business where he services law mowers and other small engines. Cross is accused of shooting to death a boy and his grandfather outside a Jewish community center near Kansas City, Kansas, on Sunday and then a woman at a nearby Jewish assisted living facility. The capital murder count is connected to the deaths of William Lewis Corporon and Reat Griffin Underwood, said Steve Howe, district attorney for Johnson County. The premeditated murder count is linked to the death of Terri LaManno, he said. Hate crime charges are possible, as police investigators say they have ""unquestionably determined"" that Cross' actions were a hate crime, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said. Cross appeared in court Tuesday in a wheelchair, wearing an anti-suicide smock. He said only that he couldn't afford an attorney. He is being held on $10 million bond, and he was ordered to return to court on April 24. U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said that federal prosecutors are still collecting evidence and that federal charges could come later. Legal experts say hate crime charges are possible, even though the victims were Christian. The capital murder charge carries the possibility of a life sentence or the death penalty. No decision on whether to seek the death penalty for Cross has been made yet, Howe said. Former KKK leader . Cross, 73, is the founder and former leader of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. Both organizations operated as paramilitary groups in the 1980s, according to the SPLC. The accused killer's neo-pagan religion . In Cross' anti-Semitic and white-supremacist activities, he has also used the name Frazier Glenn Miller, the SPLC said. After he was apprehended at a nearby elementary school, Cross sat in the back of a patrol car and shouted ""Heil Hitler!"" video from CNN affiliate KMBC shows. He obtained firearms from a ""straw buyer,"" a middleman with a clean record who could buy weapons legally and then sell or give them to Cross, allowing Cross to avoid federal background checks, a U.S. law enforcement official said. He had three guns when he was arrested Sunday, authorities said. The shootings took place at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and the Village Shalom Retirement Community in Overland Park a day before the start of Passover, a major Jewish holiday. The police chief said the gunman shot at five people, none of whom he is believed to have known. There were no other injuries, authorities said. Police were investigating statements Cross made after his arrest but declined to provide additional details, Douglass said. The Anti-Defamation League said it warned last week of the increased possibility of violent attacks against community centers in the coming weeks, ""which coincide both with the Passover holiday and Hitler's birthday on April 20, a day around which in the United States has historically been marked by extremist acts of violence and terrorism."" On Monday, the ADL reissued a security bulletin to synagogues and Jewish communal institutions across the country, urging them to review their security plans for the Passover holiday, which began at sundown Monday. 'That idiot ... knocked a family to its knees' The shooting began just after 1 p.m. Sunday in the Jewish community center's parking lot. Inside, the center was a hive of activity. A performance of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was about to begin, and auditions were under way for ""KC Superstar,"" an ""American Idol""-style contest for the best high school singer in the Kansas City area. Outside, the gunman opened fire. Police said he was armed with a shotgun and may have been carrying other weapons. Reat, 14, was there to audition for the singing competition. His grandfather, Corporon, was driving him. The bullets struck them in their car. Both died. ""That idiot absolutely knocked a family to its knees for no reason,"" Reat's uncle and William's son, Will Corporon, said at a news conference Monday afternoon. Grandfather and grandson were Methodists, their pastor, the Rev. Adam Hamilton, told CNN on Monday. Marionville's mayor said Cross' alleged actions ""shows that he didn't care."" ""He didn't have much regard for life. He just wanted to make a show, and he didn't care who paid for it,"" he told CNN. Clevenger wonders whether Cross, who he says told him he wasn't going to live much longer, wanted to ""go out, make the big show."" A woman caring for her mother . The gunman then drove to the retirement home, where he shot the third victim in the parking lot. Authorities identified her as LaManno, who was visiting her mother as she usually did every Sunday at Village Shalom. LaManno's Catholic church, St. Peter's Parish, posted a message on its website calling LaManno ""a loving mother and wife, and a gentle and giving woman."" The Children's Center for the Visually Impaired in Kansas City, where LaManno worked as an occupational therapist, described her as a ""gracious, generous, skilled and deeply caring individual who made a great difference in the lives of so many children and their families."" 'A raging anti-Semite' Cross is a ""raging anti-Semite"" who has posted extensively in online forums that advocate exterminating Jews, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. He has called Jews ""swarthy, hairy, bow-legged, beady-eyed, parasitic midgets."" According to the SPLC, Cross founded and ran the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s. He was forced to shut down after the SPLC sued him for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and intimidating African-Americans. He then formed another group, the White Patriot Party. In the late 1980s, Cross spent three years in prison on weapons charges and for plotting the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees. The short sentence was a result of a plea bargain he struck with federal prosecutors. In exchange, he testified against 14 white supremacists in a sedition trial in Arkansas in 1988. ""He was reviled in white supremacist circles as a 'race traitor,' and, for a while, kept a low profile,"" according to an SPLC profile of him. ""Now he's making a comeback with The Aryan Alternative, a racist tabloid he's been printing since 2005."" CNN's George Howell, Matthew Stucker, Nick Valencia, Janet DiGiacomo, Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Yeah, that sounds like something he would do,"" mayor says after learning of killings .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- A top adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad defended the regime's actions Tuesday, arguing that the government is not attacking peaceful protesters, despite widespread witness reports of a fierce crackdown against displays of dissent. ""Security forces are there against armed groups,"" Bouthaina Shaaban told CNN in an interview, referring to the shadowy entities the regime has consistently said are responsible for the violence sweeping the Arab country since mid-March. ""We're not targeting demonstrators. I think peaceful demonstrators have made their point, and they are making their point every day. We have no problem with that."" Shaaban said the government would like ""to talk to peaceful demonstrators"" and is not opposed to peaceful protests. What it wants to do, she said, is ""isolate armed militants."" She and other Syrian government officials have not provided more detail about the armed groups and their financing. Shaaban said that while demonstrators have ""legitimate grievances,"" there are extremists who are using protests ""as a cover to incite sectarian violence in Syria"" and are badly hurting the economy. Bloodshed has engulfed Syria ever since demonstrators took to the streets in the southern city of Daraa to protest the arrests of young people for scribbling anti-government graffiti. Witnesses reported a tough crackdown against the demonstrators. That sparked more protests and tough security reactions across the country. The videos and witness accounts filtering out of Syria of the security actions have spurred international outrage toward the regime. Rami Abdelrahman, head of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told CNN Tuesday that 1,342 civilians and 343 security personnel have died since the protests erupted. Shaaban said Tuesday that more than 500 police officers and government troops and police have been killed in the violence, in which ""religious extremists"" are ""directing purposeful assassinations."" ""They are the ones who are killing children, who are killing women, who are maiming people, who are cutting people into pieces,"" she said, referring to the ""extremists."" CNN cannot independently verify the death tolls. However, sources in Turkey and Lebanon can account for the many Syrians who've fled to their countries to escape violence. The Turkish government said Tuesday that 10,757 Syrian refugees have crossed the border. It also said 441 Syrians had returned to Syria voluntarily in the past two days. Security sources in Lebanon told CNN that about 1,000 Syrians have crossed into Lebanon near the town of Hermel. When asked whether the crisis would have been different had security forces not acted violently during the uprising's start in Daraa, Shaaban said she thinks ""there are lots of fabrications about the security forces"" and that many security forces were ordered not to carry weapons in Daraa. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria since 1971, with Bashar al-Assad taking power after the death of his father Hafez al-Assad in 2000. The government is dominated by the Alawite minority in a country with a majority Sunni Muslim population. Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Muslims. Last week, Bashar al-Assad held out a promise of reforms and a ""national dialogue"" in a speech that was met with widespread skepticism. As international and domestic outrage festered, Syria's embattled government allowed a group of activists and intellectuals, including some it had previously jailed, to hold a conference on democratic reform Monday at a Damascus hotel. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that the United States was ""pleased"" to see the Syrian opposition was allowed to protest peacefully and has been given some ""breathing space."" It was a ""step in the right direction, but more needs to be done,"" Nuland said, adding that ""a key element of Syria moving in the right direction will be that this continues to be the case."" Louay Hussein, a writer and onetime political prisoner, said ""we must change this tyrannical regime to a democratic, civilian one"" and explained that ""how that transition happens is a question this conference is trying to address."" Hussein said the conference would ""not necessarily"" find an answer to that question, ""but that is the big question in this country now."" About 200 Syrian dissidents gathered in the hotel ballroom, including several signatories of a 2005 declaration that called for a democratic transition. But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests said the people in the hotel don't necessarily speak for them. ""The big question regarding this conference is, where are the young people?"" asked Wissam Tarif, a pro-democracy activist based outside Syria. ""Where are the people who are on the streets? Where are the voices of the people who are from Daraa, or from Douma, or from Jisr al-Shugur, or from Idlib? I think those are the voices that have been missed so far."" Shaaban acknowledged that those at the conference were not representative of the protesters on the streets. ""That's very true. And this is our biggest problem and our biggest challenge,"" she said. ""We are trying our best to reach the leaders of people on the street because we want to solve this problem in our country and move forward."" But she said the government wants to be all-inclusive in its reform efforts by inviting all social groups to participate in a dialogue. She argues that the government would not want to undermine that sense of national unity. ""No government in the world would kill its own people,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- It may be the next best thing to owning a piece of the moon. A cloth American flag that was taken to the moon's surface was one of more than 500 aviation and space exploration artifacts sold into private hands at auction this week. ""To be honest with you, there's only 12 men who walked on the moon out of 105 billion people who have walked on this earth since humankind started walking upright,"" Larry McGlynn, the newest owner of the American flag told CNN on Friday. ""These are incredibly rare items."" The 2.5 inch-by-1.75 inch commemorative American flag framed with an Apollo 15 uniform patchâ€”which also went to the moonâ€”was sold to McGlynn for $27,741.35, according to Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of New Hampshire-based RR Auction. But the biggest seller was a complete Apollo 15 rotational hand controller used by Commander David Scott to fly and land his lunar module on the surface of the moon in 1971. The joystick-like device was purchased by an anonymous European client for $610,063, Livingston said. ""It's a very important hand controller. It was the most used of all the missions,"" Livingston said, adding that Scott had to manually land with the joystick because he was off-course during his descent onto the moon. A crewman optical alignment sight, which is similar to a periscope for space, sold for over $126,000, he said. All three items came from Scott's personal collection. ""These items represent the pinnacle of Apollo-era flown material,"" said Richard Jurek, co-author of ""Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program."" He added, ""While risking their lives during the most critical and historic phases of their mission -- these are the items that the astronauts personally selected to retain as mementos from arguably the greatest technological and engineering achievement of the 20th century."" The market is hot for space items, especially lunar-surface artifacts and prices are continually going up, Livingston said. The weeklong auction was RR Auction's seventh NASA-themed sale. Seventy items from Apollo 11 -- the first manned mission to land on the moon -- also were offered, including pieces from the personal collections of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Many of the collectors, including McGlynn, grew up watching America's space program, and feel a personal connection to the pieces. ""I actually saw an American flag like the one I bought at a geology professor's house years ago,"" McGlynn said. Though he did not want to identify the professor, he said that the flag was a gift from an astronaut who was advised by the professor. ""These astronauts resonate. People love the heroism and the sophistication,"" Livingston said. ""You have to remember, everyone from Galileo to Einstein to Neil Armstrong looked up to the moon, wanting to figure out how to get there -- and these astronauts were able to get up there and come back down.""","A joystick used by Apollo 15 commander to land on the moon sold for over $600,000 .

"(CNN) -- Syrian forces stormed the town of Douma this week, fired at the home of activist Mahmoud Saab, wounded the father of two and then hanged him from the balcony of his home. Activists reported this grisly act by word of mouth and e-mail. But they took one more step. They released a shaky, 42-second video showing his body dangling from a damaged building caught in the crossfire of war. The video appeared to be shot surreptitiously, from a narrow urban space where the cameraman couldn't be spotted. It's one of thousands of videos that Syrian activists have uploaded or smuggled out of the country to document the actions of Bashar al-Assad's regime -- vilified by governments and people across the globe for its fierce crackdown on protesters. Videos of demonstrations, clashes and security actions have marked the Syrian uprising as a YouTube revolt. The images have framed the conflict for other Syrians, the wider world and history since the government has blocked journalists from freely covering the story. ""Social media became a powerful tool in getting the word out."" said Rafif Jouejati, spokeswoman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria, or LCC, citing the ferment during the Arab Spring. ""The Egyptian revolution became a Facebook revolution."" After the Syrian uprising started last spring, activists soon realized immediately that their revolution needed video documentation to make their fight credible to the world. There was no Internet in 1982, when the government of Hafez Assad, the current ruler's late father, conducted a bloody offensive in the city of Hama, she said. ""That city essentially died violently and nobody could verify it. That is very much in the national consciousness because another Assad had done it before. We weren't going to let this Assad do it to us,"" Jouejati said. After the uprising began last spring, the regime started blaming ""armed gangs"" for stoking unrest, a claim that activists all along regarded as bogus. ""We realized we had to counter every argument,"" she said. When the regime began denouncing the activist videos as fakes, the LCC started to make sure the people narrating the videos would say the name of the city and the time it was taken. The activists have been trained to avoid exaggeration, capture the leader of a demonstration when taping a video and show recognizable landmarks. ""You want to try to find newspapers with current date,"" Jouejati said. ""You want to prove it happened on that date."" Thousands of hours of video haven't been published because they aren't verifiable. ""We send the major ones, not every one,"" she said. As the uprising took hold, she said, activists used cell phones and uploaded videos. Cell phones soon became an identifier of opposition activists. ""If you were anywhere near a protest, they could look at your phone and you'd be arrested,"" she said. In time, holding cell phones near protests became illegal, she said. ""At one point, it became a crime to own an iPhone. The iPhone was in fact banned for a few days until the elites were outraged,"" she said. ""They rescinded the ban."" Bashar al-Assad himself has an iPhone, she said. People got more innovative with technology, using hidden devices such as pinholes and pen cameras. When the government put cities under siege and cut off Internet service, activists pivoted to satellite phones. ""We leverage whatever we can, and we figure out different ways to get things out,"" Jouejati said. Regime soldiers sometimes will film protests and massacres and then sell the videos to activists. ""Some of them are simply corrupt. Some of them do need the money. Still others want to support the revolution,"" Jouejati said. ""You do whatever is humanly possible."" ""Syrian citizen journalists and activists"" won the 2012 Reporters Without Borders Netizen Prize sponsored by Google on Monday. Jasmine, an LCC activist who lives in Canada, accepted the award on behalf of the people ""struggling on the ground to achieve what they have always dreamed -- to live in freedom and dignity."" She never uses her full name for security reasons. ""The committees are almost the only way to keep the world abreast of the violence wracking the country,"" Reporters Without Borders said. Jouejati said other groups such as the Revolutionary Council of Homs and the Syrian Revolution General Commission produce videos. ""A lot of groups are doing the same thing,"" she said. It's not a 'sign of disunity,' "" she said. It's a reflection of the ""overarching desire"" to bear witness to the regime's brutality. ""These people are pretty savvy. They are not new to the Internet. A lot of them have been dissatisfied with the regime long before the revolution started,"" she said. The LCC and other groups send press releases about news events around the clock. Activists inside the country work to confirm details that would be suitable for print as well as video. For example, Jouejati said, her group is trying to track down information about a young Damascus woman who was arrested after registering a new political party under the regime's new constitution. The group wants to gather print material and look for video to document this development. ""What's critical about this little bit of information is that Assad implements reforms. People respond positively. Then they get arrested,"" she said. Footage isn't only uploaded from the scene. It is smuggled out of Syria to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Dergham, an activist along the Syrian-Turkey border, said the activists help fuel the uprising. They smuggle medical aid and journalists into the country and tote film across the border at their own risk. There might be funding from outside sources, such as international media smuggled in to the country. But Dergham said, ""They only have got themselves to rely on."" Dergham and another activist named HM didn't want their full names used for security reasons. ""There is no doubt that all our moves on the ground are very risky because we are always subject to arrest each time we have to go through a security checkpoint,"" said HM, a Hama activist. The Syrian videographers who document unrest have died in the line of the duty. One of them was Anas al-Tarsha, killed in Homs last month in a mortar attack. Others who died are Rami al-Sayed and Basil al-Sayed, who also operated in Homs, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Also known as Anas al-Homsi, al-Tarsha filmed ""clashes and military movements,"" the committee said. The 17-year-old was filming an assault on the Homs district of Qarabees when he died. ""Syrian authorities have done everything they can to shut down news coverage of their actions. Anas al-Tarsha and other local videographers have given their lives to ensure that the Syrian government would not succeed,"" the group said. The LCC's Jasmine, who accepted the Netizen Prize, said that ""there are millions of stories"" to tell. ""We were talking to a mother of three detainees, and she made us promise each other that no matter what, we will never stop covering the events of our beloved Syria.""

"Washington (CNN) -- To Republicans, President Barack Obama is a gift that keeps on giving when it comes to campaign fodder to use against Democrats. A line from Obama's economic speech on Thursday is giving Republicans more material to continue slamming their opponents as Obama surrogates. That tactic has been key to Republicans' midterm strategy this cycle, at a time when a majority of Americans -- 52% according to the latest CNN/ORC poll -- disapprove of the President's job. ""I am not on the ballot this fall,"" Obama said at Northwestern University on Thursday. ""But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them."" Rep. Cory Gardner, the Republican nominee for Senate in Colorado, already played up the line during an interview Friday. ""Well I think the President himself yesterday stated that his policies are going to be on the ballot,"" he said. ""Those failed policies are what the people of Colorado are facing and voting on."" And Republicans in three key states for control of the Senate have already jumped on those words in videos that made it online less than 24 hours after Obama spoke. Kentucky . When it comes to Democratic candidates setting up a sharp divide with Obama, Kentucky candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has been one of the most visible, even pointing out in a recent ad, by saying ""I'm not Barack Obama."" But Sen. Mitch McConnell's ad released Friday looks to paint a different picture: . ""Alison Grimes says this election is not about her support for Barack Obama and his failed policies,"" the ad's narrator says, before playing the clip of Grimes stating she's not the President. ""But Obama himself says a vote for Alison is a vote for his policies."" Kansas . Sen. Pat Roberts' campaign also pounced on Obama's comments -- even giving its take on the national backdrop to the president's policies. ""Trillions in new debt. Obamacare. Nearly 10 million Americans unemployed,"" the Roberts' ad's narrator says. The ad cuts to Obama's quote from Thursday, and then ties him to independent candidate Greg Orman, painting him as a Democrat. ""A vote for Greg Orman is a vote for the Obama agenda,"" flashes across the screen before the ad fades out. New Hampshire . Republican Scott Brown's campaign follows a similar formula in attacking Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. ""He's not up for reelection, I know you're shocked to hear that,"" Brown quipped at a campaign event that opens his latest ad. ""But his number one foot soldier Senator Shaheen is."" The final words of the ad: ""Send a message to Obama. Vote no on Shaheen.""","In Kentucky, Kansas and New Hampshire, GOP Senate candidates are playing up the President's quote.

""I have no idea,"" he responded, laughing. ""It was a picture."" It's also one image that Mars would like to forget.

"(CNN) -- Japan has more than 50 nuclear power plants and had planned to build two dozen more by 2030, according to a professor who has written on Japanese energy and security policy. Japan relies heavily on nuclear power because of a lack of resources for other energy forms. CNN.com spoke with  Richard J. Samuels, the director of MIT's Center for International Studies, about Japan's nuclear power history. Below is a transcript of that conversation: . Question: Why did Japan so readily turn to nuclear power when the country experienced the terrible effects of nuclear radiation when it was bombed during World War II? Samuels: It's a good question, but it's a fairly easy one to answer. Despite that history, Japan is resource poor. And its resource poverty trumped its unpleasant history with nuclear radiation. That is, Japan knew that it would need more resources if it were going to transform itself into a global powerhouse. And it had no oil. It was running out of coal and there was no liquefied natural gas in the 1950s. The economy was getting uncorked and ramped up at unprecedented speed. And they needed energy. So nuclear power was very attractive for that reason. Secondly, it was an entirely new frontier technologically in a country that has always been an avid consumer of advanced technology. Third, it presented an enormous business opportunity, particularly for the power reactor vendors: Toshiba, Mitsubishi, and Hitachi. It was also great for the construction industry. So large-scale business in Japan was earliest out of the gate in support of Japan's acquisition of nuclear technology and for signing up for the Atoms for Peace Program in the 1950s. Question: Are the power plants related to the U.S. reconstruction efforts there after World War II? Samuels: No, it comes a little bit after that. By 1954, when the Atoms for Peace program was getting uncorked, the Japanese economy had been reconstructed. Thanks in part to the Korean War and the demand for heavy equipment for the U.S. military, a lot of Japanese industry had come back on line -- steel, shipbuilding. This led to high-speed growth, which really took off by the 1960s at exactly the same moment Japanese nuclear power came online. Question: What sort of considerations were taken into consideration in those early years about building nuclear plants in a heavy earthquake zone? Samuels: From the very beginning, it was acknowledged there was a risk and so engineers were cognizant of the dangers at the time. But the thirst for energy and a general optimism about technology trumped their concerns. ... Question: How many nuclear power plants are there in Japan? Samuels: There are 54. ... That's No. 2 in the world after France in terms of the percentage of electric power supply. And the latest basic energy law in Japan has a ""nuclear first"" caste to it. Under those guidelines, more than two dozen more would be built by 2030. I cannot imagine that these plans will be operative at this point. Question: What else should people know about the country's nuclear plants? Samuels: The cause of greatest concern is probably the Fast Breeder Reactor Program. The FBR was adopted based on a Japanese desire to ""close the fuel cycle."" Japan is, after all, driven by an ideology of a resource poverty. So the prospect of self-reliance in energy -- in the form of the Fast Breeder Reactor-- became the Holy Grail. This was embraced as national policy despite its use of plutonium fuel and despite the risks of diversion. There is also concern that Japan's neighbors might view its FBR as a shortcut to nuclear weapons program. The French and the Americans both abandoned it. But Japan went ahead. And there have been accidents with them. Question: There have been several accidents over the last two decades involving Japanese nuclear plants, including allegations of cover-ups. Tell us about those. Samuels: Let's just say the Japanese regulatory system didn't acquit itself well in those earlier cases. ... You do notice a marked difference between this crisis and the way that they responded to the last earthquake -- that they learned from the 1995 earthquake in Kobe about how to respond, how to accept help from abroad. And one can only hope that they moved to enhance the nuclear regulatory system in Japan. In Kobe, they failed to mobilize their military in a timely way. They refused to accept foreign assistance. They invoked silly regulations about the type of medicines that could be distributed. They simply bungled the search-and-rescue efforts. Many people attribute some portion of the more than 6,000 deaths from that disaster to the ineptitude of the Japanese government. Importantly, no one is making those accusations this time. The government was very quick to mobilize troops. Indeed, this is the largest mobilization of Japanese forces since World War II. There are 100,000 troops deployed right now. This is huge and important. How many lives they can save in a catastrophe of this magnitude, we don't know. But it is certainly a different response than the one we saw 16 years ago.","Japan turned to nuclear power because of a lack of resources for other energy forms .

"(CNN) -- Every day, more than 3,200 kids under the age of 18 smoke a cigarette for the first time. About 700 of those become daily smokers. Those are two reasons, the Food and Drug Administration says, why it has launched a national education campaign aimed at preventing those between the ages of 12 and 17 from trying cigarettes or -- for those already experimenting -- from becoming regular smokers. ""The Real Cost"" campaign seeks to educate these ""at-risk"" teenagers by spotlighting the health hazards of smoking in a series of television, radio, print and online ads. These ads show the costs of smoking, from skin damage to gum disease and from tooth loss to a loss of control over their lives because of from addiction. About nine of 10 regular smokers had their first cigarettes by the time they were 18, said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. Because teenage brains are still developing, they are more susceptible to nicotine addiction, the FDA said. ""We know from research that there is a group of of youth -- 12 to 17 -- who are more vulnerable, partly because of the nature of their lives -- you know, chaotic lives, lots of stress, lack of control,"" Hamburg said. Some live with smokers, ""which dramatically increases the risk, and so we're hoping that we can potentially interrupt a deadly cycle,"" she said. ""We can help these teens understand the real consequences of smoking, the real costs of smoking to them, so that they won't take up smoking if they're on the cusp and will stop smoking if they've already started."" E-cigarettes: Healthy tool or gateway device? Smoking as an adolescent can stunt growth, stain teeth and cause premature wrinkles, health officials say, and smokeless tobacco can cause mouth, esophagus and pancreas cancers. Studies have estimated that every cigarette smoked shaves 11 minutes off your life. In 2009, the Tobacco Control Act became law, giving the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health, including manufacturing, distribution and marketing. The law looks to prevent and reduce smoking by kids under 18, the legal age to buy tobacco products. These new ads are the first of several planned education campaigns, but it's not the only effort. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is continuing its ""Tips From Former Smokers"" campaign with a new set of anti-smoking ads. One of the more striking ads features Terrie Hall, who had her larynx (commonly called the voice box) removed as a result of the ravages of oral and throat cancers. Hall, who had started smoking as a teen, died in September at 53 from complications of smoking. Doctors support raising the smoking age . RJ Reynolds, the second-largest tobacco company in the U.S., runs a youth tobacco prevention program called Right Decisions Right Now: Be Tobacco Free. Company spokeswoman Jane Seccombe said she could not comment on on the FDA's new campaign until she saw the ads. But she says Right Decisions Right Now has been up and running for more than 20 years and is used by more than 20,000 middle schools and community groups like the Boy Scouts of America and Big Brothers Big Sisters. ""RDRN is part of our company's long-term initiative to transform the tobacco industry,"" said Laura Leigh Oyler, a public policy director at the company. ""Over the past 20 years, youth tobacco prevention efforts and programs have had a big impact on reducing teen smoking, now at a historic low, and we are actively working on ways to accelerate the decline in youth tobacco use."" But ""the tobacco industry has very aggressively been advertising for years, for decades, including to youth,"" Hamburg said. ""We think we can make a difference, because we have targeted messages that will resonate."" The initial response from teens who participated in focus groups to evaluate the ads for effectiveness, she says, has been positive. The agency plans to conduct a study following 8,000 kids between the ages of 11 and 16 and will do face-to-face interviews gathering data on adolescents' awareness, attitudes and beliefs about smoking tobacco. Will your children buy candy, gum or little cigars? Over the next two years, the FDA will launch additional campaigns targeting specific groups including multicultural, rural and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) youths. Its goal is to reduce the number of teenage cigarette smokers by 300,000 over the next three years. ""We will make an important contribution to reducing the toll of preventable death, disease and disability from cigarettes and tobacco use. It is astounding how the burden of tobacco continues to take a toll on the American people."" Hamburg said. ""Every year, some 480,000 people die an early, premature death because of tobacco use. It costs the health care system over $289 billion and also lost productivity costs, according to a recent estimate. And our youth are at risk. ... So if we can reach them and stop them, we can prevent a life-long addiction and all of the concomitant disability and disease and early death.""","The FDA is launching a campaign aimed at preventing teen smoking .

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg dominated the final, vital qualifying session of the 2014 F1 season in Abu Dhabi, putting the German in the box seat for the World Championship title. The Mercedes driver, who has endured a fine but torrid season alongside his rival Lewis Hamilton, led the session from the start as Hamilton put in an error strewn performance to finish second, 0.386 seconds behind Rosberg, and set up a mouthwatering race in the Middle East on Sunday. Neck and neck . Rosberg and Hamilton have clashed on and off the track during a season dominated by Mercedes. The two drivers have gone neck and neck for most of the season before a late spurt of form from Hamilton put him ahead for the last race. But a controversial rule change that awards double points for the last race of the season means that Hamilton's 17 point championship lead is far more precarious than it should have been. ""It's only one step, a very small step,"" Rosberg said after securing his 11th pole of the season. His performance meant that Mercedes managed to secure every single pole this season, a feat that hasn't been seen by an engine manufacturer since Ford achieved the same in 1969. Hamilton still favorite . Hamilton, meanwhile, is still the favorite to walk away with the title. As long as he finishes second, Rosberg's performance is immaterial. ""I generally didn't have the best of laps but I enjoyed the qualifying session,"" said Hamilton. ""Tomorrow is going to be a special day ... This weekend is about the championship, not about pole position."" Senna-Prost . All eyes will be on the first corner, reviving memories of the great Senna-Prost rivalry of the 1980s. Argument still rages over whether Prost intentionally crashed into Senna at the first corner at Suzuka in 1989, effectively securing him the championship. Prost has always denied the accusation. When asked how he will approach the first corner, Hamilton replied: ""Same as every time."" Wolff steps back . Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff, who had been highly critical of Rosberg after he clashed with Hamilton in Belgium early on in the season, has denied that any instructions have been issued before Sunday's race. ""I won't tell them anything anymore,"" he said. ""They are in their own little bubble and concentrating on the race. I think we should leave them in peace now to concentrate on tomorrow."" Red Bull sanction . Meanwhile, an unusual presence will be found at the back of the grid before Sunday's race. Red Bull was excluded from qualifying and relegated to the last row after a technical investigation found they had been using illegal cars. Former champion Sebastian Vettel and 2014 break out star Daniel Ricciardo will start last after a stewards' investigation found that their cars had been fitted with illegal parts. According to AFP race stewards released a statement confirming they had ""determined a breach of the regulations had been committed"". An unhappy Red Bull team claimed they had been singled out for punishment, but accepted the sanction. ""We are disappointed that we have been singled out for a front wing deflection test when it is clear that other teams are interpreting the rules in a similar fashion,"" Red Bull said in a statement, quoted by AFP. ""The team accepts the decision of the stewards and will start the race from the back of the grid.""","Nico Rosberg clinches crucial pole in Abu Dhabi.

As ""The Jerry Springer Show"" celebrates its 20th anniversary on the air, it occupies a part of the realm of pop culture that has moved well beyond tossing of chairs and attacking cheating spouses. These days reality shows have replaced talk shows as theaters of the outrageous, which was not the case when Springer's show debuted. So can we blame Jerry Springer for ""Jersey Shore""? Not exactly, said Jennifer L. Pozner, author of ""Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV."" ""I think it's a bit of a misnomer that Jerry Springer started the reality TV craze and can be blamed for it,"" she said. ""There are many similarities, but it's not what people instantly think of."" The similarities, she said, are in tone and the ""behind the scenes manipulation of what you are seeing on screen."" ""You can't blame a talk show for an entirely different genre that has a similar tone,"" Pozner said. ""What you can say is that Jerry Springer was often accused of setting up guests, having actors pose as real people and that sort of thing in an attempt to convince the Springer audience that what they were seeing were real people acting in crazy and buffoonish ways and that is similar to reality TV."" Whether real or not, Springer's show has been embraced by fans over the years even though he said it was never expected to last this long. ""My first contract was for six weeks,"" he said. ""It was just a side job. I had been anchoring the news for the NBC affiliate in Cincinnati [Ohio] for 10 years. The company that owned the affiliate also owned talk shows like Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael, etc."" Springer, 66, said that as Donahue was getting close to retirement, Springer was asked to helm a talk show. He would fly to Chicago, Illinois, in the morning to tape the talk show and then back to Cincinnati to anchor the news every evening at 5:30 p.m., 6 p.m. and 11 p.m., five days a week. That got old pretty quickly, he said, and within two years he had quit his anchor gig. Springer said the first show was pretty tame -- it focused on reuniting a family -- and remained so for a few seasons. Years later he approached producers with the idea to try to compete with ""The Ricki Lake Show"" rather than ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" by catering to a younger audience. ""The fact of the matter is young people are much wilder and open about their lives,"" he said. ""So the show started to go a little crazy."" The show has since become iconic, with Springer appearing on the cover of ""Rolling Stone"" and on ""The Simpsons."" Springer said that after Universal bought the company that owned his show in 1997, it was decreed that they were only allowed to air episodes involving story lines ""that are outside approved human behavior."" His show, he said, was one of the first that didn't just focus on middle-class whites and he rejects the notion that his show has contributed to the ""dumbing down of America"" and contributing to the disintegration of society. ""Certainly much of television is not about high intellect,"" Springer said. ""In terms of it contributing, that's an absurdity. Some of the worst things we ever had happen happened before we even had television."" ""We had a Holocaust and I don't think anyone was watching television at the time."" He said he has no delusions about his show, with its topics like ""Trick or Cheaters,"" ""Confront this Dominatrix"" and ""Lesbians Come Clean."" ""I think [the show is] silly, crazy and has no redeeming social value other than an hour of escapism,"" Springer said. ""There is never anything on our show that hasn't been on the front pages of newspapers in America. The only difference is that the people on my show aren't famous."" ""It's a show about craziness,"" he added. ""I know that going in every day."" Jake Halpern, author of ""Fame Junkies: The Hidden Truths Behind America's Favorite Addiction,"" said shows like ""Springer"" and reality television feed viewers' ""deep-rooted desire to see spectacle and the most tawdry things."" ""The fact of the matter is there are millions of people tuning in and watching the show,"" Halpern said. ""If people didn't want to see this stuff, these shows wouldn't exist."" But at least one person isn't tuning in. With his talk show, a gig as the host of the Game Show Network's ""Baggage"" and traveling with the live tour of ""America's Got Talent,"" Springer reserves his boob tube time for his personal interests. ""If I'm watching television, it's either sports or politics,"" said the man who once served as mayor of Cincinnati. ""I'm addicted to the cable news networks.""","""The Jerry Springer Show"" is celebrating 20 years on the air .

"Editor's Note: Arsalan Iftikhar is an international human rights lawyer, founder of TheMuslimGuy.com, and contributing editor for Islamica magazine in Washington. Arsalan Iftikhar says Obama made progress in improving relations with Muslim world. (CNN) -- Opening the Muslim-world leg of the ""Audacity of Hope"" world tour with the universal Islamic greeting ""Assalamu alaikum"" (May peace be with you) to thunderous applause, President Obama began his long-awaited major address by going straight to many of our pressing geopolitical issues. He spoke from the hallowed halls of Cairo University in the heart of one of the largest Islamic capitals in the world. From beginning to end, President Obama's speech was a concert of enlightenment compared to President George W. Bush's famous farewell news conference in the Muslim world (which resulted in two Iraqi size-10 shoes being boomeranged toward his head). From the issues of violent Muslim extremism to the growth of the neo-racism known worldwide as Islamophobia; from Israel-Palestine to his overall Iraq and ""Af-Pak"" (Afghanistan-Pakistan) strategy, President Obama successfully used his Cairo speech to lay out his framework for several key foreign policy issues. Additionally, with major sections of his address covering women's rights, democratic reforms and nuclear weapons, President Obama devoted much of his 40-plus-minute speech to offering concrete and tangible policy initiatives that he plans to implement in the near future. He talked about his plan ""to invest $1.5 billion each year over the next five years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses"" to help the countless number of internally displaced persons caught in the fighting in Pakistan. Similarly, for Afghanistan, he outlined that we will be ""providing more than $2.8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend upon."" Aside from his concrete foreign policy proposals and tangible development initiatives, President Obama spent much of his Cairo address highlighting the ""common aspirations"" of the United States and the Muslim world. He surprisingly cited the Holy Quran at least four times in his speech and noted that the first American Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, Keith Ellison of Minnesota, ""took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Quran that one of our Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library."" Wow, that is quite a change from your past political interactions with Muslims, Mr. President. As most Muslim-Americans vividly remember, during the 2008 presidential election, when certain nasty and xenophobic right-wing elements in America tried to paint Obama as some kind of ""crypto-Muslim"" Manchurian candidate, we did not see then-candidate Obama go, even once, within 12 feet of an American mosque entrance or Muslim political campaign event. During the 2008 presidential election, the ""Muslim"" insinuation against Obama became so radioactive that two American Muslim women in Michigan were asked to sit out of camera range at an Obama campaign event in Detroit by campaign volunteers in June 2008 simply because the two women wore hijab, the traditional headscarf. But I guess when in Cairo addressing the greater Muslim world, an American president has to be wise enough to talk, and walk, like an Egyptian. On the essential need for a diplomatic, peaceful and final resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli situation, President Obama reaffirmed his commitment to a two-state solution on the condition that ""Hamas must put an end to violence"" and that ""the United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements."" By successfully addressing the major foreign policy issues affecting much of the Islamic world today, President Obama has succeeded in positioning the United States closer to a rapprochement or political détente with the Muslim world. The Obama administration can bring some further resonance to the president's eloquent words by making sure that key administration players like Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Richard Holbrooke and George Mitchell -- Obama's special envoys for the Af-Pak and Israeli-Palestinian portfolios, respectively -- further carry out the president's foreign policy agenda.. Finally, in the spirit of his event, President Obama concluded his remarkable Cairo address by highlighting the individual mandates for peace in each of the major Abrahamic religions. He said that, ""The Holy Quran tells us, 'O mankind! We have ... made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.' ... The Talmud tells us: 'The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace. ...'"" ""The Holy Bible tells us, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.' ... The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision. Now, that must be our work here on Earth."" Amen, Mr. President.

"(EW.com) -- On the topic of TV shows getting a second life, it's impossible not to look to Sex and the City, the original model for Community fans' cheer of ""six seasons and a movie."" After six fashionable years of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte's adventures on TV, the iconic HBO comedy series found new life — twice — with two big-screen adaptations, both written and directed by series exec producer Michael Patrick King. During our chat with King about the revival chances of his other HBO show, The Comeback, the conversation of course veered into Sex territory. (How could it not?) The big question: could a third Sex and the City movie ever get off the ground? Back in January, Sarah Jessica Parker told InStyle that she believed there was one last chapter to tell. Well, King agrees. ""The great gift or riches or luck is that I worked on two shows that were so full that they spilled over into people's lives and the characters were rounded enough that you could still wonder where they are,"" King says, adding that Sex and the City is still thriving on TV, especially as alternative programming (HBO marathoned the series on Super Bowl Sunday). EW: Should there be a 'Sex and the City 3' movie? Acknowledging Parker's comments on a third film, King explains, ""Sarah Jessica and I both know what that final chapter is. That doesn't mean it will or should be told, but I do think there's one story left. Whether it ever happens is a whole other situation. But there's four girls, and those girls are still in my mind. There are other stories to tell and characters that haven't even been written yet."" The show went off the air exactly 10 years ago, in February 2004, delivering series-high ratings for the emotional finale. Four years later, Sex and the City hit movie theaters and raked in $152 million at the domestic box office, with critical reviews split right down the middle. Sex and the City 2 opened with significantly less ballyhoo in 2010 and made $95 million at home, with the Rotten Tomatoes score at just 15%. If it seemed as though the series was on its last legs, that would largely be the accurate assumption — but it depends who you're asking. EW's Owen Gleiberman sees a future. The series still lives online, boasting 14 million devotees on Facebook and plenty of meme life among the Tumblr generation. The clamor for another movie might not be as loud as it once was, but rest assured, it's still there. Just like The Carrie Diaries. ""It's a very interesting balance of zeitgeist and letting go and coming back and figuring out if you're done or you're not done. I listen to people a lot, actually,"" says King. ""What I do know is that there's interest, but with interest comes non-interest. It's all really about the stories, and if you actually think you have something left to say that would make it exciting and worthwhile for the fans' time, that's really the question. Not whether you can get away with it, not whether anybody will buy it, not whether you can make money on it. It's really like, is there enough or more to say that would justify people risking seeing their favorite characters again? And I think there's one chapter left."" EW: Michael Patrick King talks the future of 'The Comeback' The first and perhaps biggest hurdle would be convincing all the women to return, and as it stands, it's just Nixon who seemed to be uninterested about the idea (although that was in 2012, and it sounds like things may have changed). Parker, as we know, believes in a third story; Davis is excited at the possibility, and Cattrall appears to be on board as well. With attitudes in the affirmative, the question falls to whether enough of the moving parts can assemble to get a greenlight for a second sequel. King is realistic that a third Sex and the City venture may in fact never come to fruition, but fans should be pleased to know that he and SJP are on the same page when it comes to finishing the saga with one final story. Although, it should be clear, though King listens to the rumblings about SATC's place in the zeitgeist, he's not exactly flocking to Tumblr or Twitter (where accounts are devoted to the plots of a third movie) to take suggestions. ""Oh, like I would ever look at the Internet!"" jokes King. ""I also sometimes go into the kitchen and just turn on the stove and put my hand on it to see if that hurts still.""

"Chicago (CNN) -- Gun violence has inextricably joined Michelle and Barack Obama with a family from their Chicago neighborhood, and the president will give them a place of prominence during Tuesday night's State of the Union address. Honor student Hadiya Pendleton had performed as a drum majorette at an event during President Obama's second inauguration in Washington and was gunned down days later. The presence of her father, Nathaniel, and mother, Cleopatra, sitting by the first lady's side, will be no coincidence and part of the president's message to the nation. In his address, Obama will renew his support for the gun proposals he's already endorsed, including a ban on military-style assault weapons and bolstering background checks, officials have said. Pendleton's alleged killers -- both of them gang members -- will appear in court for the first time Tuesday morning in Chicago, police there said. One of them confessed Monday, saying he mistook Pendleton and her friends for someone else. The honor student was openly opposed to gang membership, taking to Twitter to discourage her followers from joining. She was 15 when she died after being shot in the back at a playground in late January, in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood, not far from the Obama family home. The first lady attended her funeral. The president will visit Chicago Friday to talk about gun violence in the wake of 500 shooting deaths in his home town in 2012. Pendleton was the 42nd victim shot dead in the city this year. The killing has prompted a ranking Chicago police official to call for stricter penalties against gun offenses. Michael Ward, 18, and Kenneth Williams, 20, were each charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said. Ward said he shot Pendleton, when he and Williams were out to get revenge on rival gang members, according to police. The men had fired upon Williams in July, wounding him in the arm, McCarthy said. When police arrested them, Williams refused to press charges. Instead he apparently decided to take matters into his own hands and, at best, made a serious error. ""The offenders had it all wrong,"" McCarthy said. ""They thought the group they shot into included members of a rival gang."" Shatira Wilks, one of Hadiya's cousins, said Hadiya was hanging out with a volleyball team -- a group of girls and one boy -- when she was killed. Williams allegedly drove getaway and waited in a car for Ward, who wielded the gun, McCarthy said. Police initially received no solid tips on the shooter's identity, but they did get a description of the car, which they were able to link to a traffic stop days before the killing. That, along with information from parolees, led them to the two men. Ward surrendered on Saturday night without a struggle, McCarthy said, but Williams tried to escape. Wilks said the family was elated that the suspects were in jail. ""However there is no level of comfort -- not long-term comfort -- and we are still miserable,"" she said. The shooting should not have happened, McCarthy said, openly frustrated with Illinois' gun laws. Ward was already on parole for a previous gun violation -- unlawful use of a firearm -- when he shot Pendleton, McCarthy said. He thinks he should have been behind bars and not walking around free. ""Michael Ward would not have been on the streets of New York City to commit this act, if it had happened there,"" McCarthy said. ""This is not about gun control, he said. This is about the criminal justice system being designed to prevent gun violence."" The police superintendent called for mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes. What he wants most are controls surrounding the ""loss, theft or transfer of firearms."" President Obama hand-wrote a note to Pendleton's parents, when she died. It was printed on the funeral program and included a promise to take action: . ""We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama.""","Hadiya Pendleton's parents will sit with Michelle Obama at the State of the Union Address .
