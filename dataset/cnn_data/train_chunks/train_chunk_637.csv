Tina Nash, who was permanently blinded by her former boyfriend after he gouged both her eyes out, was attacked by her new partner, Roland Alli . A young mother who was blinded when . her violent boyfriend gouged out both her eyes in one of Britain's worst cases of domestic abuse has revealed how she has since been attacked by her new partner. Mother-of-two Tina Nash, 33, was permanently blinded in April 2011 after Shane Jenkin subjected her to a terrifying 12-hour ordeal. During that attack, she was beaten unconscious and told: 'You’re never going to see your kids . again.' Jenkins, 34, was jailed for life in a secure mental health unit and ordered to serve . at least six years before being considered for release. But just over two years later, Mrs Nash was again the victim of a brutal assault when her new partner, Roland Alli, 32, threatened her with a knife in her own home. Recalling the moment of terror on June 16, which took place in her house in Penzance, Cornwall, Mrs Nash told how she heard the sound of knives clinking in the drawer and knew that Alli was about to attack her. 'It was happening again and my body shot into survival mode,' she told The Sunday Mirror. Truro Magistrates Court in Cornwall heard last that week Alli subjected the 'extremely vulnerable' Mrs Nash to a 'sustained' attack. He was due to stand trial for common assault, but changed his plea and was jailed for . 14 weeks. Alli, from Plymouth, Devon, was also handed a restraining order banning him from going anywhere near Ms Nash's home or contacting her again. Ms Nash's latest turbulent relationship comes despite her becoming a high-profile campaigner against domestic violence in the wake of her blinding. She has spent the last two years trying to overcome the trauma left by her ordeal at . the hands of cowardly Shane Jenkin, who beat her unconscious and poked . out her eyes while she was asleep at her home in Cornwall. In her book, Out of The Darkness, she recalls how she woke up 'smothered in blackness' to find the 18st thug squeezing her . neck until 'my head felt like it was going to explode' and passed out . three times in quick succession. She also wrote: 'I sat up and reached my hand to my face... and felt my eyeball hanging halfway down my cheek. 'I touched my slippery eyeball, like I couldn’t believe it was real. My other eye was swollen to the size of a tennis ball.' The emotional and physical toll of her attack left her reluctant to start a new relationship. But she thought she had found a loving and trustworthy partner in Roland Alli. The couple met on Facebook last Christmas and at the time, Mrs Jenkins believed the trainee forklift driver was someone she could build a new life with. She was cautious and even asked the police to carry out a background check on Alli, to assure her that he . did not have a previous record of abuse towards women. Only then did she embark on a relationship with him. But by May, she had reservations when she discovered Alli was drinking heavily and was becoming possessive. Desperate to continue the relationship, he agreed to join Alcoholics Anonymous and the pair became friends. Their relationship resumed within the month, but his jealousy resurfaced and Mrs Nash claims, he accused her of rekindling her relationship with the father of one of her sons. Recalling her second ordeal of terror, Mrs Nash told The Sunday Mirror that on the night of the attack she had just returned from a visit to her ex-partner's home to drop off her son - and Alli began demanding what had happened. She claims an argument followed and she eventually went upstairs to bed. But Alli followed her into the bedroom and pushed her shoulder, forcing her to fall to the ground. He later seemed apologetic and went to put his arms around her waist, but Mrs Nash pushed him away. New ordeal: Mother-of-two Tina Nash, 33, pictured here arriving at court in April 2011 for the trial of Shane Jenkin . It was then she claims he suddenly grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her back. She also felt a sharp pain above her knuckles. Mrs Nash screamed at him to release her and asked him to leave the house. At that point, she says Alli stormed out and shouted he was going to get a knife from the kitchen. But two minutes later, the police had arrived at the scene. Just before their argument began, Alli had been on the phone to his mother - and she decided to call the police from what she had overheard. Jailed: Shane Jenkins was jailed for life in a secure mental health unit and ordered to serve at least six years before being considered for release . When officers arrived at her home, they found a 15inch serrated bread knife tossed in the washing basket. Police also found a pair of scissors on her bed, which Mrs Nash believes Alli used to cut her knuckle. 'They said Roland was sweating and his eyes were bulging out of their sockets when they arrested him,' the terrified mother said. The attack came just three days after Alli appeared before magistrates for scuffling with a policeman on the housing estate where Ms Nash lives. On that occasion, magistrates heard he was in a drunken rage after being kicked out of her house when he was approached by PC Ian Ridge. Alli pleaded guilty to drunk and disorderly behaviour after struggling with the officer and was fined £35 with £80 costs and surcharge. He was also told to pay £100 compensation to PC Ridge and given a drink banning order for a year. The former beautician says the . combined ordeals by Jenkin and Alli have left her in a state of anxiety, unable to sleep and suffering panic attacks. She . added: 'I've finally asked for therapy from my doctor because although I . want to believe I'm strong, I don't think I can cope any more.' Mrs Nash, who has become a campaigner . against domestic abuse, now hopes her story can serve as an 'early . warning' to others trapped in a violent relationship. In her book, Out Of The Darkness, Tina told other victims: 'It’s not going to get better, it’s going to get worse.' Campaigner: Tina Nash appeared on ITV's This Morning earlier this year to warn others of domestic abuse .","Tina Nash, 33, who was subjected to a horrific attack by Shane Jenkin, has revealed she was attacked by her new partner .

Killed: Saad al-Hilli, a British-Iraqi engineer, was shot dead alongside his wife and mother-in-law in the French Alps . Two sisters orphaned during a gun attack in the Alps in which four died are to be taken out of foster care and returned to their family – under police protection. Young Zainab and Zeena al-Hilli have spent the last 10 months under the protection of social services. This was mainly because at least one adult member of their own family was under suspicion following the murder of their parents near Lake Annecy, in eastern France. Saad al-Hilli, a 50-year-old satellite engineer from Surrey and his wife Ikbal, 47, died alongside the girls’ grandmother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, as they sat in the family BMW estate car. Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist, was also shot dead in the attack on September 5 last year. The authorities on both sides of the Channel still fear that the girls are in danger because Zainab is thought to have seen the killer or killers carrying out the attack. A High Court ruling handed down last week now clears the way for the girls to live with their maternal aunt, uncle and cousin, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Mr Justice Baker ruled that the family had been assessed by social services and ‘have the capacity to care for the girls in these very difficult circumstances which will include a level of police protection’. The judge added: 'It is plainly in their interests to be brought up . within their natural family. Such a placement will sustain links with . their family background and may help them over time to come to terms . with their tragic loss.' The ruling says: ‘Zainab and Zeena have made it clear that they want to live with their aunt and uncle and cousin with whom they have a warm and close relationship.’ It continues: ‘The police do not say that the level of risk is such that they should not be placed with the aunt and uncle’, although the ruling insists on the continuation of police protection. Zaid al-Hilli, the children’s 54-year-old paternal uncle, was arrested last month at his home in Surrey on suspicion of being involved in the murders. He is on bail awaiting further enquiries into an alleged dispute with his brother Saad over their father’s will. Zaid denies any involvement in the crimes. The French authorities have privately . criticised social services in the UK for preventing the girls from being . interviewed adequately about the attack, in which Zainab was pistol . whipped and was hit by a bullet in her shoulder. Scroll down for video . Murder scene: An aerial photo shows the car where three members of the al-Hilli family were found dead . Victims: The two sisters Zainab and Zeena survived the attack and have been under protection in Britain . Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor, is among those who think that a thorough interview could provide vital clues. Last October, Mr Maillaud said Zainab and her father got out of the car after parking in an isolated layby, but Mr al-Hilli then quickly returned to the vehicle. ‘She talked of hearing screams, of seeing violent acts and of her fear,’ said Mr Maillaud. The Annecy murders have baffled detectives, with Zaid al-Hilli being the only arrest in connection with the case. Mr Maillaud believes an international contract killing may have taken place, with a police source saying: ‘This was the work of somebody who knew exactly what he was doing. Whoever carried out this crime had no qualms. This was not the work of an amateur.’ A total of 21 bullets were fired at the scene and each hit its intended target. The bodywork of the BMW was unmarked. Surrey police wanted to keep the High Court ruling a secret but, in a victory for open justice, Sunday Times writer David James Smith challenged an order to exclude him from court. Lawyers for the newspaper successfully argued that ‘the right to attend is an important aspect of the media’s watchdog role’.

If all those pictures of a bouncing baby Windsor are making you yearn for a more palatial abode to bring up your own royal family, then look no further. Lethbridge House, dubbed the Palace in the Park, is finally on the market. And it'll cost you a king's ransom - of £40 million. Des res: Lethbridge House at no. 20 Cornwall Terrace is one of the properties going for 170 times the average price of a new home . That's 170 times the average new house . price, making Lethbridge House and the other properties in the Cornwall .

Lethbridge House is the only home in the terrace to feature a carriage driveway, swimming pool and spa and ballroom. There are two separate mews houses at the back so you can put your guests up in true royal style. Luxury: Among other features, Lethbridge House boasts a private spa with a sauna and swimming pool so owners can relax in splendour in their own home . It is spread over 11,767sq ft, with rooms including spacious living areas, a wine cellar and a media room. The mansion also boasts six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It is the last property to go on the market from the terrace, which is made up of eight Grade I listed homes originally built in 1811.

The Prime Minister - who has been criticised in the past for his choice of holiday wear - today wore pair of loafers (worn without socks) for the visit . Yesterday on his summer holiday to Portugal, he at least sported more appropriate footwear for a visit to a fish market with wife Samantha – if not the most stylish. The beige loafers, worn without socks, cost £20.99 from bargain shoe shop Aldo. The Prime Minister has also been the butt of jokes for wearing the same blue polo shirt year after year. He has swapped that for a new button-down model – again in blue – costing £19.90 from Uniqlo, which he teamed with a pair of shorts that were also £19.90 from Uniqlo. Checking it out: The couple were seen browsing the large selection of local specialities on offer . While he appeared slightly awkward with his new style, Mrs Cameron looked elegant in a £49.99 sleeveless green dress from Zara, and high-heeled sandals, thought to have cost £60 from Aldo. The couple bought fresh squid from the market at Aljezur on the Algarve, where they are staying with children Nancy, nine, Arthur, seven, and Florence, two.

Mr Cameron’s recent efforts to look trendily casual saw him team jeans with a pair of open-toed, flip-flop style leather sandals during a short break to Ibiza earlier this year.

The Liberal Democrat leader and family are visiting their summer home in Olmedo, Spain. The Camerons are also due to make their annual trip to Cornwall and holiday in Scotland during Westminster’s long break.

Greeting: Pope Francis greets a child at the shrine of the Madonna of Aparecida, who Catholics venerate as the patroness of Brazil, in Aparecida do Norte, Sao Paulo State . Pope Francis urged Catholics to resist the 'ephemeral idols' of money, power and pleasure as he celebrated the first public Mass of his initial international foreign journey as pontiff in an emotional visit to one of the most important shrines in Latin America. Before the Mass, Francis stood in silent prayer before the 15-inch-tall image of the Virgin of Aparecida, the 'Black Mary,' his eyes tearing up as he breathed heavily. It was a deeply personal moment for this pontiff, who has entrusted his papacy to the Virgin Mary and, like many Catholics in Latin America, places great importance in Marian devotion.

Trip: The pope is participating in the week-long World Youth Day festival in Rio de Janeiro, from 22 to 28 July, his first trip overseas since he was elected . During his homily, Francis urged Brazilians to keep Christian values of faith, generosity and fraternity, a message he was expected to repeat later in the day during a visit to a drug rehabilitation center in Rio de Janeiro. 'It is true that nowadays, to some extent, everyone including our young people feels attracted by the many idols which take the place of God and appear to offer hope,' he said. 'Often a growing sense of loneliness and emptiness in the hearts of many people leads them to seek satisfaction in these ephemeral idols.' The church is struggling in Latin America to keep Catholics from straying to evangelical and Pentecostal churches that often promise help in finding material wealth, an alluring attraction in a poverty-wracked continent. Priority: Pope Francis' top priority as pope has been to reach out to the world's poor and inspire Catholic leaders to go to slums and other peripheries to preach.

Pope Francis' top priority as pope has been to reach out to the world's poor and inspire Catholic leaders to go to slums and other peripheries to preach. It was no coincidence, then, that the first major event of his first foreign trip as pope was a Mass in Aparecida. The tiny shrine, which draws 11 million pilgrims a year, hosted a critical 2007 meeting of Latin American bishops who, under the guidance of then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, drafted a mission statement on how to reinvigorate the faith on the continent. 'I've seen people in my own congregation leave because the Evangelicals offer them something new and exciting and the Catholic Church was seen as kind of old and stuffy,' said Marcia Cecilia de Souza, the 52-year-old owner of a private school in the southern state of Santa Catarina, as she searched for newspaper to stuff into her soaked leather boots.

Before the Mass, some pilgrims sought shelter from the Southern Hemisphere winter chill beneath tarps while others wrapped themselves in blankets and sleeping bags. And many left offerings to the Virgin. Francis is in Brazil for World Youth Day, a church event that brings together young Catholics from around the world roughly every three years. Approximately 350,000 young pilgrims signed up to officially take part in the Youth Day events. In Aparecida, 16-year-old Natalia Pereira, a high school student from Sao Paulo state, said the cold rain she endured to get to the basilica was a 'test of faith.' 'I've been up all night in line, I'm soaked to the bone and freezing but I'm so excited that it's worth it,' said Pereira, who tried to huddle from the drizzle beneath a friend's large umbrella.

Stabbed to death: Tyrell Matthews-Burton, 19, from East London, was pinned down 'execution style' and stabbed in the chest and back . British tourists will be penned into tightly controlled drinking zones to keep a lid on violence following the killing of a British teenager in Crete. The move follows the stabbing of Tyrell Matthews-Burton, 19, from Leyton, East London, in a mass bar brawl between dozens of British tourists in the resort town of Malia this week. Another Londoner, Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, from Catford in the south of the capital, has been charged with Mr Matthews-Burton's murder. In effort to stop visiting tourists turning Malia into a 'battlefield', the town's mayor, Zacharis Doxastakis, has vowed to clamp down on their 'wretched antics'. 'They can't just come to our country and run riot,' he told the Sunday Express. 'Just because our country is in crisis we don't need to accept such behaviour.' Special zones are being considered, he said, centred around 'clubs that will host young Britons where they can do everything they want to but in an area that is closely monitored.' Youths from across the UK have been flocking to Malia in recent years. Many are attracted by the resort's burgeoning hip hop and urban music scene. With them has come gang allegiances based around their home areas, with violence exported from the streets of London and other British cities to the nightclubs of Crete. Greek police first thought that Mr Matthews-Burton's ‘execution-style’ killing was sparked by a gang feud, but it is know believed that the teenager may have been killed after a trivial row over a woman. It is claimed that he was pinned down on the cobbled street outside Malia's Safari Club and stabbed in the back and chest. An ambulance arrived but the teenager died on his way to hospital. He was killed on his 19th birthday. Greek coroner Manolis Michalodimitrakis said: ‘He was clearly pinned down and killed execution-style – there were no defence wounds. The knife punctured his lung and heart. He lost almost half of his blood.’ Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, a model studying for a degree in economics at Northampton University, has been charged with murder and possession of a weapon. He is believed to have been arrested as he tried to leave the scene on a quad bike. Two other men have been charged with complicity in the murder.

Pray for me, I need your prayers.’ Scroll down for video . Pope Francis lamented not being able to get closer to the people who had come to see him on his trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . The Pope told Brazilians that he could not get close to them because of potential public order problems . The Pontiff’s desire to be close to his followers has often led to impromptu walkabouts, alarming Holy See officials. He leads one of the world's biggest . churches, his words are devoutly heeded and his presence draws in . thousands upon thousands of dedicated followers. But despite his awesome power, Pope . Francis couldn't control his clothes, as a gust of wind caused havoc, . wrapping part of his robe around his face. The . leader of the Catholic Church was leading a mass on Rio de Janeiro's . Copacabana beach - but strong gusts of wind and rain showers caused his . clothes to flutter and wind around his throat. But the Argentinian-born Catholic . refused to let it stop him, and continued with the mass, which was . attended by thousands who did not let the driving rain deter them from . hearing his service. Pope Francis delivers a speech to Catholic faithful at Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro . Carrying on: Pope Francis is in Brazil for the celebration of the World Youth Day - and delivered a mass while the wind whipped his clothes . Francis addressed the young pilgrims who braved the wind and rain to gather on the famous beach . Continuing his approach of being a modest Pope, he celebrated Mass with his fellow Jesuits and heard confessions from young pilgrims in a Rio de Janeiro park today, ahead of one of the most solemn events of World Youth Day, a re-enactment of Christ's crucifixion held at one of Rio's most iconic locations, Copacabana Beach. Francis also offered a noontime prayer and meeting with a group of juvenile detainees, a priority of his ever since his days as archbishop of Buenos Aires and an expression of his belief that the Catholic Church must reach out to the most marginalized and forgotten of society. Even now as pope, he calls a group of youths in a Buenos Aires detention center every two weeks just to keep in touch. In the Rio park, a white tent was set up . to receive the faithful for confession, with small makeshift confession . booths off to the side. Five youths, chosen through a raffle, were . selected to go to confession with Francis, the sacrament in which . Catholics confess their sins and are forgiven. This is Pope Francis's first trip overseas since he was elected to lead the Catholic Church . 'It was just five minutes, it followed . the regular ritual of confession, but then Francis stayed and talked . with us,' said one of the five, Estefani Lescano, 21, a student from La . Guaira, Venezuela. 'It was all very personal. He told us that young people have the responsibility of keeping the church alive and spreading the word of Christ.' The sun finally came out today, ending four days of rain that soaked pilgrims and forced the relocation of the festival's culminating Mass on Sunday. Instead, the Mass and the Saturday night vigil that precedes it will take place at Copacabana Beach rather than the mud pit that is the Guaratiba field, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of central Rio. Last night Francis showed off his rebellious side, urging young Catholics to shake up the church and make a 'mess' in their dioceses by going out into the streets to spread the faith. It's a message he put into practice by visiting one of Rio's most violent slums and officially opening World Youth Day on a rain-soaked Copacabana Beach. Francis was elected pope on a mandate to reform the church, and in four short months he has started doing just that. He has broken long-held Vatican rules on everything from where he lays his head at night to how saints are made. Last night, thousands took to the famous beach so they could hear the pope - who has asked for a 'poor church' - to speak . Participants of World Youth Day waited on Copacabana beach for the arrival of Pope Francis in Rio de Janeiro last night . He has cast off his security detail to . get close to his flock, and his first international foray as pope has . shown the faithful appreciate the gesture. Dubbed the 'slum pope' for his work with the poor, Francis received a rapturous welcome in the Varginha shantytown on Thursday, part of a slum area of northern Rio so violent it's known as the Gaza Strip. The 76-year-old Argentine seemed entirely at home, wading into cheering crowds, kissing people young and old and telling them the Catholic Church is on their side. The Varginha visit was one of the highlights of Francis' weeklong trip to Brazil, his first as pope. The surprise, though, came during his encounter with Argentine pilgrims, scheduled at the last minute in yet another sign of how this spontaneous pope is shaking up the Vatican's staid and often stuffy protocol. He told the thousands of youngsters, with an estimated 30,000 Argentines registered, to get out into the streets and spread their faith, saying a church that doesn't go out and preach simply becomes a civic or humanitarian group. 'I want to tell you something. What is it that I expect as a consequence of World Youth Day? I want a mess. We knew that in Rio there would be great disorder, but I want trouble in the dioceses!' he said, speaking off the cuff in his native Spanish. 'I want to see the church get closer to the people. I want to get rid of clericalism, the mundane, this closing ourselves off within ourselves, in our parishes, schools or structures. Because these need to get out!' Apparently realizing the radicalness of his message, he apologized in advance to the bishops at home.","Pope Francis celebrated Mass with his fellow Jesuits and heard confessions from young pilgrims in a Rio de Janeiro park today .

A mother-of-two miraculously found her engagement and wedding rings two days after losing them on a crowded beach. Laura Curry thought she had seen the last of her wedding and engagement rings after she left them on packed Poldhu Cove, one of the largest beaches on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall. However, she made a desperate plea on Facebook for a metal detector and returned to search for her missing jewellery. Laura, from Millbrook, in Cornwall, took off the rings before putting sun cream on her children Heidi, three, and Dylan, one, and then forgot all about them. Lost and found: Laura Curry with her wedding and engagement rings which were lost on the beach near Mullion, Cornwall and then found two days later using a metal detector . Laura, who married Royal Navy sailor Paul five years ago, said she put the rings- which were worth £3000 in total- in the inside pocket of a beach tent. 'Unfortunately I then became distracted by my daughter - and ice creams - and completely forgot to put my rings back on. She now believes the rings went flying when she shook the sand out of the beach tent. 'I didn't realise I wasn't wearing them until about four hours later back at the caravan park where some friends were staying.' Lost and found: Laura, who married Royal Navy sailor Paul five years ago, said the rings she lost on the beach were particularly meaningful. She helped to design her engagement ring, and a friend made the wedding band . She rummaged through the car and the beach tent, but there was no sign of the rings so she drove back to the beach and spent 40 minutes searching in vain. 'I had to tearfully return home to Millbrook and explain to my husband that I'd lost them. 'He was understandably irritated with me,' she said. Adding to her anguish was the fact the rings were . particularly meaningful: Laura helped to design her engagement ring, and a . friend made the wedding band. Over the moon: The rings lay forgotten in the sand for two whole days and Laura couldn't be happier when she saw them sticking out of the sand . As a last-ditch effort, and without much hope, Laura and Paul put a post on Facebook asking for the loan or hire of a metal detector. A Torpoint woman dropped off one and a hire company delivered a second detector. 'I was unable to get back to the beach until the Friday. By this time I was convinced I wouldn't find them but felt I had to do this for peace of mind. 'Thursday and Friday were just awful in the house, thinking, ""Oh God, what am I going to do?"" On Friday afternoon Laura, husband Paul and their children made the one-and-a-half-hour journey back to the Lizard. 'I had a vague idea of where we were sitting, but when we arrived I thought, ""Oh God, it's so much bigger than I remembered."" 'There were kids with buckets and spades throwing sand everywhere.' 'We found tent peg after tent peg. 'Then, suddenly, I looked to my left and saw my wedding ring sticking out of the sand. 'I squealed and cried at the same time.' She said two other families joined in the hunt for her engagement ring, which she found after an hour of looking, and others wished them well. Eventually Paul found the second ring just a couple of metres from the first. 'Paul was annoyed to start with, but he was very understanding,' Laura said. 'He always loses things and I thought, ""This is horrendous. I'll never be able to say anything about that again"".' She added: 'It's incredible really that they were there two days later. 'Anybody could have picked them up from the sand or the tide and waves could have swept them away or even totally buried them. 'It's a fantastic result.'

The historic house where Admiral Lord Nelson stayed with his uncle to break up to 30 mile journey between his home and school has gone on the market for less than £500,000. The Grade II listed building was owned by the naval hero's uncle and provided the perfect halfway house for Nelson when he was travelling between his family home and his boarding school in Norfolk. When returning home at weekends, Nelson would sleep in the attic of his uncle's house at Holt, halfway between where he lived with his widowed father in Burnham Thorpe and the Paston School in North Walsham. Historic: The Norfolk home where Admiral Lord Nelson stayed while travelling between his family home and school is up for sale . Home from home: Nelson is said to have stayed in a bedroom in the attic of the Grade II listed building and kept his belongings in its eaves . The Holt home was owned by William Suckling, Nelson's mother Catherine's brother. Admiral Nelson is said to have kept his belongings in the eaves of the attic when he stayed and is thought to have once played bowls at the nearby White Lion pub. The property was renamed Nelson House long before its current owner John Shrive bought the property in 1967. He snapped up the house to use as an office for his chartered surveying and auctioneer firm. Now considering semi-retirement, Mr Shrive will now sell the house himself, with a guide price of £495,000. He said: 'When I moved here in 1967 it was a local legend that Nelson used to stay here regularly on his way back to his home in Burnham Thorpe. Living space: The back of the house which has eight rooms and planning permission should a prospective new owner wish to turn it back into a home . Ornate: The grand building has been used as offices for Mr Shrives business since he bought it in 1967 . 'An elderly local told me that and he had been told it by his parents and so on. It was already called Nelson House because of this account. Hero: Admiral Lord Nelson .

Launching its National Recovery and Improvement Plan, NHS England said the number of organisations failing to meet waiting time targets has doubled over the last year. The organisation said that many factors have contributed to the decline of the service including the increasing numbers of patients, seasonal illnesses such as the winter vomiting bug, and delays in admittance and discharge of patients. NHS England said the number of organisations failing to meet waiting time targets has doubled over the last year . The problems could also have been exacerbated by the introduction of the NHS 111 service and pressure on social care budgets, an NHS England document suggests. ‘A&E performance has deteriorated significantly over the last six months,’ the document says. ‘Long waiting times in A&E departments (often experienced by those awaiting admission and hence ill patients) not only deliver poor quality in terms of patient experience, they also compromise patient safety and reduce clinical effectiveness.’ In the last quarter of 2011/12 a third of hospitals did not meet the target of having 95 per cent of A&E patients seen and discharged or admitted within four hours. For the last quarter of 2012/13, two thirds of hospitals failed to meet the target, figures show. NHS England has ordered local health authorities to form ‘urgent care boards’ which will create plans to improve the service in place by the end of the month. ‘When pressure builds across the health and social care system, the symptoms are usually found in the A&E department,’ said NHS England's national director for acute episodes of care, Professor Keith Willett. ‘I've lived that environment for 30 years and I know just how tough it can be. The problems could have been exacerbated by the introduction of the NHS 111 service and pressure on social care budgets . ‘What we all want is great service for patients that meets and often exceeds the minimum standards. ‘To get there, we need the whole NHS system, in the community and hospitals, to recognise the problems and help to relieve the pressure on their colleagues in A&E. ‘In the longer term we need to combine all the expertise in the NHS to determine how best to organise emergency care in future so that people get appropriate, effective and rapid care whenever and wherever it is needed.’ The organisation has already launched a review to try and get to the root of the problems, and NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh is looking into the urgent and emergency care system across the country. The news comes after the health and social care regulator warned that demand on NHS accident and emergency departments is ‘out of control’ and ‘totally unsustainable’. David Prior, chairman of the Care Quality Commission (CQC), said there should be widespread closures of hospital beds and investment in community care to tackle the increasing burden on emergency care. Mr Prior said that far too many patients were arriving at hospital as emergency cases - a crisis which could be averted by earlier intervention through care in the community. This has put such pressure on the health care system that it is at the brink of collapse, he said, meaning regulators cannot guarantee that there will never be another care disaster such as that in Mid Staffordshire. Hundreds of patients may have died needlessly at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust - many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication. Robert Francis QC, chairman of the public inquiry into the ‘disaster’ at Stafford Hospital, highlighted ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people’ at the trust between 2005 and 2009.","NHS England is launching a 'national recovery and improvement plan'

Sometimes they will actually hurt immediately after sun exposure, but more often damage accumulates over the years, leading to sight problems. The ultraviolet rays from the sun - in particular UVB, the same spectrum of ultraviolet that causes the skin to burn - are most damaging to the eyes. Staying cool: Lucy tries out the Primark shades . 'The UVB can damage the lens (which helps focus light) inside the eye,' says Chris Worsman, a senior optometrist at Viewpoint Opticians in York. 'The lens is made up of proteins all in a straight line - that is why the lens is clear. 'UVB causes those proteins to unravel and tangle so the lens becomes cloudy in places - this is a cataract and can develop after years or decades of sun exposure.' Other long-term damage includes pinguecula, harmless but unsightly  yellow fatty deposits in the white of the eye thought to be caused by UV damage to the collagen in the conjunctiva (the clear coating on the white of the eye). Skin cancer of the eyelid is also a risk. 'A type of skin cancer, basal cell  carcinoma, can look like a spot or a sore on the eyelid, and can also occur after sun exposure,' says Mr Worsman. 'Although this won't spread to other places it can grow deep into the eyelid and removing a small one can leave a significant mark.' A shorter-term problem is photo keratitis - also known as snow blindness - when intense sun kills off the outer layers of the cornea (the clear part of the eye at the front of the eyeball). 'It can happen within a day of intense sun exposure and feels as if there is something burning in your eye,' says Mr Worsman. 'It can be caused by being alongside water, because the water reflects the rays so you get a more intense dose of UV.' Total protection: Lucy covers up . This will clear within a few days, leaving no long-term damage. Sunglasses will block UV - if you choose carefully. Light is measured in nanometeres, with UVB rays measuring 320-390 nanometres. If sunglasses carry a CE mark (a European standard of UV protection) that means they should allow no more than 5 per cent of UV rays below 380 nanometres to get through. 'The other thing you may see on your glasses is a UV 400 sign - which just means that the glasses should not allow in UV rays below 400 nanometres,' explains Mr Worsman. 'Technically, this means they offer more protection than those with just a CE mark but the difference is minimal and the ultraviolet between 380 and 400 (which is the UVA light) is not as damaging as the ultraviolet at the lower end of the scale.' Some glasses are also graded by the darkness of the tint, with four being the darkest and one the lightest, but this is cosmetic and gives no UV protection, says Specsavers optometrist James Goldenberg. 'We make sunglasses that have UV protection - done by a dip-dyeing process - yet are completely clear.' Dark tints can be misleading if you don't check the UV rating. 'If you have a dark tint your pupil will dilate to let more light in, providing a bigger window to allow UV in than if you had no  sunglasses on,' he says. Often people assume paying more means sunglasses are better - but do you really need to splash out to protect your eyes? We asked Mr Goldenberg to assess a selection of cheap sunglasses to find out. The real risk is sunglasses which claim to offer UV protection but don't - while all the glasses tested had a CE mark, Mr Goldenburg used a specialist machine to check the amount of UV protection the sunglasses offered. We then rated them out of ten. PRIMARK £3 . Good coverage: Primark sunglasses . UV protection: 100 per cent against UV rays below 400 nanometres . Expert comment: UV light can also get to your eye from the sides and the gap between you face and sunglasses - so they should be a good fit. They need to sit far back on the bridge of the nose but without being so close they are up against your eyes. These provide good broad coverage across the eyes and delicate skin area around the eyes. They don't seem to let too much stray light in at the sides - although how they fit will depend on the shape of someone's face so try before you buy. 10/10 . NEW LOOK £4.99 . Decent: New Look . UV protection: 100 per cent . Expert comment: These have a big gap around the face where stray light could get in, and a brown-red tint which makes no difference in terms of protection. They do have individual pads on each side where they sit on the bridge of the nose and these are often adjustable, so an optician might be able to fit them properly. 8/10 . POUNDLAND £1 . Poundland kids shades: Worse than wearing no sunglasses . UV protection: 47 per cent left eye, 94 per cent right eye . Expert comment: This is worrying. These glasses have a CE mark yet neither eye of the lenses on these sunglasses block out the recommended minimum of UV. Why there is the variation between the two eyes is hard to say - but probably means one side was dipped less thoroughly than the other. These are for kids, who spend more time outside than adults and their pupils tend to be more dilated. The tint on these means they would dilate further and allow more UV light in than normal. So in a way wearing these is worse than no glasses. It's a shame, because the wraparound shape is good and means little light can stray into  the sides. Another pair of adult sunglasses in the same range had 100 per cent protection, so maybe this pair was not dipped for long enough in the UV coating, but this should have been picked up. 1/10 . So-so: Top shop glasses . TOPSHOP £14 . UV protection: 100 per cent . Expert comment: The lens offers protection but the shape is not so good. There are big gaping holes at the side where stray light could get in, but they do feel quite sturdy. 7/10 . SUMMER LIVING 99p FROM 99p STORE . 99p Shop sunglasses: A good shape, Jackie O-style . UV protection: 100 per cent . Expert comment: These offer good UV protection and are a good shape, a big Jackie Onassis-style that covers a big area of the eye, with only minimal stray light coming in at the sides. For the price they are hard to fault. 10/10 . BEABA £19.99 FROM KIDDICARE AND BOOTS . UV protection: 100 per cent . Expert comment: These Beaba Kid 360 glasses  (this pair are for 18 months  to three years) are great for  young children. Great: Beabba kids lenses . They are flexible - even the front section can't bend - so won't snap. They also have  curved arms that fit around  the child's head so they will  stay on. Don't put children in sunglasses all the time. Their pupils are naturally a little wider than adults and if they then wear sunglasses this makes the pupils dilate to allow more light in. And if you put children in sunglasses a lot - not just when it is a bright sunny day - their pupils will gradually lose tone and won't be able to become smaller (which reduces the amount of light coming in to the eye) as they should, so as adults they won't tolerate bright light well. 10/10 . Nice snug fit: Boots' offering . BOOTS £5 . UV protection: 100 per cent . Expert comment: These are a small design - so don't protect a big area around the eye unlike some of the others. But they are a nice snug fit, going right back on the bridge of the nose and letting little light in at the sides. They also feel quite sturdy. 9/10 . MARKET STALL £15 . Surprisingly effective: Market Stall shades . UV protection: 100 per cent . Expert  comment: I am pleasantly surprised by these. These have a CE mark and a mark saying they offer UV 400 protection. But they feel a little flimsy and aren't a particularly good fit - a lot of stray light can get in around the sides. 8/10 . RIVER ISLAND £15 . UV protection: 100 per cent . Good deal: River Island sunglasses . Expert comment: These are a good fit, offering good protection around the eye. They are mirrored so may reflect some light but they won't block more UV. They have a dark tint - four - which, as the label warns, means they are so dark they should not be used for driving as they could make it hard to see. However, they could be good for a bright day on the beach. 9/10 . So how do cheapies measure up? 'I've been pleasantly surprised,' says Mr Goldberg. 'It seems in the vast majority of cases the CE marks can be trusted and manufacturers are taking greater care about the type of sunglass they sell - even at the budget end of the market.'","Primark's £3 shades offer great protection, and so does Boots' £20 glasses .
But wearing Poundland's would be worse than wearing none at all!"

Fair condition: Doctors still do not know what caused Teresa Heinz's seizure-like symptoms on Sunday . Teresa Heinz, the wife U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, was discharged from a Boston hospital Saturday, just under three weeks after she suffered a seizure at their Nantucket home, a State Department spokesman said. Heinz, 74, is expected to make a full recovery from the July 7 seizure following additional outpatient treatment, spokesman Glen Johnson said. ‘I'm extremely grateful for the quality of care Teresa received,’ Kerry said in the statement. I've always known Massachusetts is blessed to have some of the greatest health care in the world, but we've just lived it, and are grateful to all.’ Heinz thanked her doctors and caregivers. ‘They are the kindest people, who love what they do and do it superbly well,’ she said. Kerry praised the State Department Diplomatic Security Service members who first responded when his wife fell ill. Heinz was treated at a Nantucket hospital and another in Boston before ultimately being discharged from Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Johnson previously said the cause of the seizure had not been determined but doctors had ruled out a brain tumor, heart attack or stroke. The family does not plan to comment further on Heinz's health, he said. Heinz was rushed to the local hospital on Sunday, July 7, when she had her seizure during a vacation at their family's vacation home on Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts. After stabilizing her condition, she was flown by private jet to Boston where the experts at Massachusetts General Hospital have not yet been able to determine the root problem. 'As evaluations continue, she, Secretary of State John Kerry, and their family are deeply grateful that physicians have ruled out a variety of possible triggers or other ailments, including heart attack, stroke, or a brain tumor,' Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement at the time. Though her condition was initially deemed critical, she was downgraded to fair soon after she was admitted. Kerry left her side for the first time in mid-July as he headed to Washington briefly in order to formally begin a long-planned U.S.-China economic conference before returning to Boston later that night.

Doctors, nurses, teachers and local government staff will see the income from their 'gold-plated' public sector pensions slashed by more than a THIRD under the Government's reform plans. Some four million public sector workers will see their retirement income take a huge hit as the Government looks to cut its pension liabilities by a quarter by 2065. Paying out pensions based on a proportion of average career earnings, rather than final salaries, will see workers' average pension income fall from 23 per cent of their salary to just 15 per cent, the Pensions Policy Institute has said today. Pension pain: How the Government's reforms will impact members of the four main public service pension schemes. Those who turned 50 before April 1, 2012, will be protected from the reforms, but everyone else faces having to work for longer, pay more into their pots, and get less out of their pensions. Local government workers will experience the changes first as the reforms are introduced from next April, with NHS staff, teachers and government civil servants following suit in April 2015. Despite this, the PPI found that public sector pensions will still provide better levels of income than private sector workers on money purchase schemes. Niki Cleal, PPI director, said: 'The analysis suggests that the combined impact of the Coalition Government’s proposed reforms is to reduce the average value of the pension benefit for all members of the NHS, teachers, local government and civil service pension schemes from 23 per cent of a member’s salary before the Coalition Government’s reforms, to 15 per cent. 'This is a reduction in the average value of the pension benefit for members of these four schemes of more than a third. 'Nevertheless, even after the Coalition’s proposed reforms, the benefit offered by all four of the largest public service pension schemes remains more valuable, on average, than the pension benefit offered by defined contribution schemes that are now most commonly offered to employees in the private sector.' Final salary schemes see staff given a proportion of their final salary, typically 1/60th, as income in retirement for every year they have worked with the organisation. So someone with 40 years service, who retired on a salary of £60,000, can expect a retirement income of £40,000. But career average pensions will see the payouts calculated based on an average of pensionable earnings for each year they worked. The reforms were first brought up in the 2011 Budget, and received Royal Assent last month. Other changes include bringing the age at which staff can take their pensions, which is currently 60 for most members, in line with the state pension age. This will rise for men and woman to 67 between 2026 and 2028. Members will have to pay on average an extra 3.2 per cent of their salary into their pension schemes as well. Affected: NHS staff, teachers and local government workers will be hit by the changes. Police, fire and Armed Forces personnel . are also expected to be affected by the changes, though their 'normal . pension age' will remain at 60. In 2007/08 reforms introduced by Labour, the normal pension age for civil service, NHS and teacher pension schemes rose from 60 to 65. However this only applied to new members, so the majority of scheme members will still have a pension age of 60. Those within 10 years of their pension age on April 1, 2012, will be able to take their pension under the current final salary conditions, rather than the new career average.","Four million public sector workers will see their pension earnings reduce .

Police said a witness described flashes . and explosions followed by a cloud of ash more than 4 miles high (7km) coming from the Te Maari craters on the . northern face of the 1,978m (6,490 ft) mountain, which lies within a designated national park. Scroll down for video . Ash covers the ground after Mount Tongariro erupted in Turangi, New Zealand on Monday night.

It was quite impressive.' Heavy rocks fell just over half a mile from the eruption, damaging Ketetahi Hut, one of four used by hikers visiting the area, which formed the backdrop for many scenes in The Lord of the Rings films directed by Peter Jackson. Three people were also evacuated  from Mangatepopo Hut, which lies southwest of the volcano on Tuesday morning, but no injuries were reported. Nearby residents were also moved from their homes as a precautionary measure and roads were temporarily closed. National carrier Air New Zealand . cancelled or delayed domestic flights to towns near the mountain, after a large ash cloud was seen moving east towards the Pacific Ocean hours after the eruption. Three people had to be evacuated after rocks hurled from the explosion crashed into huts used by hikers on the mountain. People had a lucky escape when boulders landed on Ketetahi Hut during the 30-minute eruption on Monday night. Aerial news footage also showed the extent to which the ash has spread and fallen over several miles across North Island. No . international flights were affected. A man holds a handful of volcanic ashes that fell on a property in Rangipo near the base of Mount Tongariro. Scientists said they had noticed increased seismic activity for weeks, but were taken by surprise when ash and rocks erupted from the volcano for around 30 minutes. They believe the small-scale eruption was driven by steam pressure building within the mountain, rather than molten rock. The clean-up operation begins as local Vic Cassin helps to sweep thick ash from a car. A man covers his nose and mouth as he clears away the thick grey volcanic ash from his vehicle. Volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Tongariro coats an old vehicle at Rangipo in the Tongariro National Park. The choking ash caused a number of roads around the area to temporarily close due to reduced visibility. The fine powdery ash fell in thick layers over cars, houses and roads several miles away from the site of the explosion. Residents clean up the thick ash from their homes. They have been warned to monitor their water supplies for ash contamination. The eruption was followed by a series of minor earthquakes. Steve Sherburn, a volcanologist at the government agency GNS Science, said the eruption spread a layer of ash several centimetres thick over many miles. Ash and smell of sulphur was reported as far away as as Napier and Hastings. A truck travelling down State Highway 1 kicks up a plume of volcanic ash after the eruption coated the area. Driving conditions became difficult as ash began to settle in the area immediately around Mount Tongariro. State Highway 1 was all but deserted as a cloud of ash descended.

The Tongariro National Park remained open, including both ski fields on Mt Ruapehu, which were not affected by the eruption. People living in the area were also being warned to stay indoors, close their doors and windows and check their water supply for ash contamination. New Zealand is part of the Pacific's notorious ""Ring of Fire"", which sees frequent geothermal and seismic activity. The fine powdery ash continues to fall on farmland several miles away. Greenery gives way to silver and grey, thanks to the volcanic ash. However, the last verified eruption of Mount Tongariro occurred in 1897. Scientists said it was too early to determine whether the latest eruption was the start of a renewed cycle of activity. 'This might just be a quiet period and we should expect it to start again at any time. So we are watching things very closely,' volcanologist Michael Rosenberg told TVNZ. Mount Tongariro and its surroundings are one of several locations used by Peter Jackson to shoot The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Mount Tongariro erupted on Monday after lying dormant since 1897.

"By . Louise Eccles . PUBLISHED: . 07:44 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:50 EST, 9 May 2013 . The bike in front of Ella Phillips  stopped suddenly. She slammed on  her brakes but went tumbling over the handlebars, landing helplessly in the middle of the road. Out of nowhere appeared a dark handsome ‘action hero’, who swept her away from the traffic and on to the safety of the pavement – then vanished into the busy street. Was it a bird? Was it a plane? No … it was  Ed Miliband. As Miss Phillips put it, she was so . shocked  to see his face come into focus above her that:  ‘I started to . wonder how badly I’d banged my head.’ Her confusion was compounded, she . said, because the Labour Party leader was ‘actually attractive’ and ‘not . geeky’. Satirists may have to have a rethink – . after all, Mr Miliband is usually compared to bumbling Wallace from . Wallace and Gromit, not Clark Kent. Superman: Labour leader Ed Miliband swooped into action to help a cyclist who had fallen off her bike . Miss Phillips, 29, was cycling to the . October Gallery in central London, where she works as an education . co-ordinator, when the accident happened. She had to make an emergency stop when the bicycle in front of her braked abruptly. She said: ‘The back wheel flipped over, and the next thing I knew  my face was hurtling towards  the ground. ‘Then, there was Ed Miliband’s face . looking very concerned at me. He mysteriously appeared out of nowhere, a . bit like an action hero. ‘My first thought was that I was . seeing things because I was still in quite a daze. He kept asking if I . was okay, if I was hurt. He was there for a good few minutes.’ Mr Miliband reportedly whisked the stricken cyclist on to the pavement, away from oncoming traffic. Miss Phillips, who is also an artist, . said: ‘What added to all the confusion was that he was actually . attractive and not geeky at all. Even the way he appeared was suave. He . was dressed casually but he had style.’ In true Superman fashion, Mr Miliband vanished ‘into thin air’ before she could say thank you. Miss Phillips said: ‘I don’t know if . he was in his car and stopped it to get out, or was walking close by. But wherever he came from he disappeared just as fast. ‘I didn’t even see which direction he went in. ‘He literally disappeared into thin air once I was okay. I didn’t even get to thank him.’ She added: ‘I’ll definitely be voting for him now.’ The accident happened outside Kentish Town Underground station, near Mr Miliband’s north London home, last Thursday. Ella Phillips, 29, fractured her arm after she was thrown over the handlebars of her bike in North London . Artist Ella Phillips said she at first thought she was concussed because Mr Miliband was more attractive and 'suave' in person than she expected . The next day Miss Phillips went to Whittington Hospital, also in north London, where she was told she had fractured her arm. Yesterday, Mr Miliband’s heroics already appeared to have bolstered his public profile. The hashtag #Miliman was quickly . circulated on Twitter. One user tweeted: ‘Where’s his trusty sidekick? The faithful Balls Boy?’ They also tweeted to the Labour Party’s account, asking: ‘When is the action figure coming out?’ While cynics may suggest the story of . the dramatic rescue is almost too good to be true, Miss Phillips . insisted yesterday that it was not part of an elaborate publicity stunt. She said: ‘I have never had contact with the Labour Party.’ A spokesman for Mr Miliband  confirmed . the story was true,  and said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest it could . be a tale intended to boost his image.

"By . Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 04:49 EST, 12 January 2012 . Osama Bin Laden's hideout will be spectacularly destroyed by the Pakistan military in front of TV cameras, it has emerged. Military chiefs plan to launch rocket propelled grenades at the mansion hideout in Abbottabad. It will then be bulldozed in order to prevent the walled complex from becoming a shrine to the former Al Qaeda leader. Big event: The walled mansion where terror chief Osama Bin Laden was hiding before he was killed by U.S special forces will be spectacularly destroyed by the Pakistan military in front of TV cameras . The terror chief  - responsible for the 9/11 attacks - was dramatically killed by U.S Navy Seals at the hideout, which is 30 miles from the capital Islamabad, on May 2. According to the New York Post, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said: 'We will hit it like an enemy fort. 'But first we must erase everything related to bin Laden from our country.' U.S and European officials will be invited to the demolition, which will take place next month. A military spokesman promised it would be a 'big event'. Following the raid on the hideout - which was watched by U.S President Barack Obama live on TV - Bin Laden was buried at sea. Dead: Osama Bin Laden was killed by U.S Navy Seals at the hideout, which is 30 miles from the capital Islamabad, on May 2 . But it led to increasing tensions between Pakistan and the U.S. with Pakistan particularly stung by claims that it turned a blind eye to the hideout. The U.S had been extremely critical of Pakistan, with some suggestions that elements within the army or intelligence services were deliberately harbouring Bin Laden. A tug of war also broke out between the two countries after U.S officials were initially refused permission to talk to Bin Laden's three captured wives following the raid. Pakistan repeatedly refused U.S. demands to interview the women, saying they should have been forewarned about the mission. Tensions between the two countries were then pushed close to collapse when an errant U.S airstrike in November killed 24 Pakistani troops close to the Afghan border. After the American strike, Islamabad shut down vital supply routes into Afghanistan and forced the U.S. to vacate Shamsi Air Base in southwestern Baluchistan province. The U.S. used the base to service drones that targeted militants in the tribal regions close to Afghanistan. Those tensions, however, could now be reignited after an American drone strike killed four Islamist militants in Pakistan yesterday. Deadly: A bomb killed at least 29 people and wounded 37 when it exploded near a fuel station in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber region on Tuesday . Pakistani intelligence officials revealed today that the attack took place in North Waziristan, an al-Qaida and Taliban stronghold close to the Afghan border. Three of the dead were Arab fighters. The late-night missile launch broke the longest pause between strikes since the drone program began in earnest in 2009. American officials say there had been no promise by Washington to avoid drone operations since the deadly November 26 airstrikes along the Afghan border, but that the lull was partly an effort to damp down tensions with Pakistan. Injured: A blast victim receives medical treatment at a hospital in northwest Pakistan's Peshawar following Tuesday's huge bomb . The missiles struck a house around two kilometers from Miran Shah, the main town in North Waziristan, shortly before midnight locals said. 'It was an unusually big bang. Since it was extremely cold I didn't leave the house, but could see a house on fire,' said Qasim Noor, a 20-year-old college student. 'In the morning, we saw a modest mud house had been destroyed.' A U.S. official confirmed there had been a missile strike in the region. On Tuesday a bomb killed at least 29 people and wounded 37 when it exploded near a fuel station in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber region, one of the restive tribal areas where insurgents are battling government forces, regional officials said. 'It was a huge blast and caused damage to a number of vehicles at a bus terminal,' said Khyber tribesman Khan Zaman from the Jamrud bazaar, around 15 miles west of the city of Peshawar. Problems: Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari could be facing a crisis after the government fired the defence secretary today . Government officials in the area said 29 people were killed and 37 wounded, at least 20 of whom are in critical condition. The country was plunged into further crisis today after the government fired the defence secretary. The army warned of 'grievous consequences' for the country, escalating a political and legal crisis that some believe could end in the dismissal of government. Retired Lt. Gen. Naeem Khalid Lodhi, an army loyalist seen as a bridge between the generals and the civilian government, was dismissed for 'gross misconduct and illegal action' and replaced with a bureaucrat close to Prime Minister Yousuf Reza Gilani, the government said in a statement. The developments were a sign of near-open conflict between the army and the government in a nation that has seen repeated military coups in its six-decade history. Relations between President Asif Ali Zardari and the generals have never been good, but have soured dramatically in recent months over a memo sent to Washington asking for its help in reining in the power of the military. Political instability has dogged the government since it took office in 2008 after a 10-year army dictatorship, and there have been frequent, wrong predictions of its demise since then. While unpopular, the government has a solid majority in parliament and its unclear whether the army or the Supreme Court have the stomach to unseat it midterm. The memo, allegedly masterminded by Pakistan's then envoy to Washington, outraged the army, which portrayed it as a threat to national security. Acting under its pressure, the Supreme Court ordered a probe to establish whether it had been sanctioned by Zardari, something that could lead to impeachment hearings. As part of the investigation, army chief Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani and the head of the main spy agency, Lt Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, submitted statements to the court in which they suggested the memo was part of a conspiracy against the army. Prime Minister Yousuf Reza Gilani said in an interview to a Chinese newspaper that Kayani and Pasha had violated the constitution by doing this. The interview was also published by Pakistan's state-run news agency. An army statement denied the mens' actions were illegal, and said Gilani's allegations had 'very serious ramifications with potentially grievous consequences for the country.' It did not elaborate. An aide to Gilani said Lodhi was fired because of his role in submitting Kayani and Pasha's statements to the court.","Rocket-propelled grenades will be launched at the mansion before it is bulldozed .

Emily, 30, created the Facebook page titled Date My Mum after growing frustrated with the men her mother had found through more conventional roots . The page, which features pictures of Roz along with life updates, had received 42 'likes' at the time of going to press . Tired with seeing her mother hurt, Emily, 30, took the unusual step of setting up a Facebook page to help her find a new man. After years of seeing her mother date men who were ‘liars, cheats, smelly or plain weird’ Emily, has created the Facebook page titled Date My Mum. She is desperate to find a new partner for her mother who she says ‘deserves to be treated like a queen.' Emily came up with the idea after chatting to husband Simon, 42, who works as a graphic designer and helps companies to market themselves on Facebook. He thought he could apply his expertise to help his mother-in law find a man with whom she can spend the rest of her life. ‘My gorgeous mum is single and looking for a man to sweep her off her feet,’ writes Emily on the Facebook page. ‘She's been on some dates with guys who have turned out to be liars, cheats, smelly or just plain weird - and so I'm taking it upon myself to try and find her someone suitable!'

Children . in Need presenter Sir Terry Wogan failed to mention Jimmy Savile on . tonight's show as he made reference to the 'awful reminder' the disgraced presenter's scandal has had on the abuse of youngsters. Following . a performance from One Direction Sir Terry Wogan talked about the 'news . in recent weeks' before leading into a film about victims of different forms abuse. He said: 'We know that children are vulnerable and news in recent weeks has been an awful reminder of how terrible that can be. 'Here at Children in Need we . have been supporting children suffering all kinds of abuse, including . sexual abuse. We hope you can help us to continue that support.' It had been anticipated that the BBC would use this year's Children in Need to address the Jimmy Savile scandal - and it will come as no surprise that the disgraced presenter was not mentioned by name. BBC . executives will be keeping a close eye on the public response to its . flagship annual charity fundraising programme as it continues to air . throughout the night. The . appeal is likely to be seen as a test of support for the corporation in . light of the successive scandals that have rocked it over the past six . weeks. Sir Terry Wogan is once again presenting the show, which last year raised a record £46million. The . Savile revelations and the fallout from the shelved Newsnight report . about the late Jim'll Fix It star will inevitably cast a shadow over . this year's six-hour fundraiser on BBC1 and BBC2.

This year's Children In Need is again hosted by Terry Wogan, pictured here with an armful of Pudsey bears, who included a reference to the Savile Scandal . The . BBC said the programme would be 'even bigger and better than ever' with . guests including Girls Aloud, One Direction, Olympics and Paralympics . stars and Sir Alan Sugar, who will appear in a special edition of . EastEnders. Prior . to its airing BBC sources told The Guardian the programme would make . reference to 'recent events that have been covered in the press' but . that it was not expected to specifically mention Savile. 'There . will be some kind of reference to recent events that have been covered . in the Press quite extensively,' said a BBC insider. 'It will also say . that Children in Need does and always has supported children who were . the victims of abuse and will continue to support the amazing work that . these charities do. Scandal: Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989 . Last year the charity fundraising event chalked up a record £46million . Wogan (left) was joined by BBC presenters Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly (right) and new Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw for tonight's show . 'There will be a film to reflect that, and there was one on the same subject last year.' Sir Roger Jones, the former chairman of Children in Need, revealed last month that Savile was secretly banned from the Children in Need appeal for being ‘creepy’. Though . still revered elsewhere at the corporation, the presenter was kept away . from the annual fundraiser because of 'rumours' of his interest in . young girls. Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, . 1987 and 1989, before Sir Roger became chairman. A member of the board . of governors between 1996 and 2002, Sir Roger said he would have stepped . down from his charity role if Savile had become involved. The . BBC has also suffered a slump in trust among licence-fee payers as a . result of the Savile scandal and the ensuing crisis over an inaccurate . Newsnight report about an alleged child abuser, which led to the . resignation of director general George Entwistle on Saturday. The former judge who is leading a BBC inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal has launched an appeal for witnesses. Dame . Janet Smith, who is reviewing the corporation's practices during the . Savile years, has called on potential victims, witnesses, people who . worked with the TV presenter and senior staff at the time to assist with . the investigation. According . to the inquiry's website, the review also wants to hear from people . 'who were familiar with the culture or practices of the BBC' in terms of . 'preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children, young people or . teenagers'. Savile became hugely famous during the 1960s and 1970s as a BBC Radio 1 DJ and presenter of Jim'll Fix It on BBC1. He worked for the BBC between 1964 and approximately 2007, according to the review's website. But . Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is now believed to have . been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with hundreds of possible . victims. A YouGov poll published on Tuesday . found that for the first time since it began tracking support for . British institutions in 2003, more respondents distrust BBC journalists . (47 per cent) than trust them (44 per cent). YouGov . reported a slump of 13 percentage points in trust in BBC journalism the . past fortnight – suggesting the corporation's reputation has been . harmed more by the inaccurate Newsnight report and Entwistle's . resignation than by earlier revelations about Savile. BBC . insiders said Savile would be the 'elephant in the room' during this . year's appeal, but people working on the show stressed that it would be . 'business as usual to make the very best programme we can make so the . viewers really enjoy it'. A . former chairman of Children In Need, Sir Roger Jones, said last month . that the charity had made a decision to keep Savile away from the event . because he had suspicions about the Top of the Pops presenter. Jones, . a former BBC governor for Wales, said he always felt Savile was a . 'pretty creepy sort of character … we took the decision that we didn't . want him anywhere near the charity and we just stepped up our child . protection policies ,which again would have put him at risk if he tried . anything'. Wogan has been . joined by BBC presenters Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly and new Radio 1 . breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw. This year's appeal will be executive . produced by Clare Pizey. A . BBC spokesman said: 'Our aim this year, like every year, is to raise as . much money as possible and we are on track to raise millions to help . change lives of disadvantaged children across the UK. 'BBC . Children in Need has a strong track record of funding projects with a . specific focus on supporting children and young people who are at risk . of, or have experienced, some form of sexual abuse.

An injured hiker who called a private helicopter to collect her and her daughter from an 8,000 foot Washington State mountain as rescuers carried her down in a stretcher has defended the decision, calling it a 'no brainer.' Nancy Allen, 48, and her daughter Sara, 18, reached the top of Mount St. Helens on Tuesday but on their way down the mother-of-two tripped and hurt herself. The injuries were not life-threatening but she was unable to walk. As such, they called 911 and rescuers came to their aid at around 6,100-feet. They put her in a basket stretcher and began carrying her down the mountain. But after a while Allen used her cell phone to call a private helicopter service, which arrived an hour later and air lifted her and Sara to safety. Scroll down for video . No brainer: Nancy Allen, 48, right, and her daughter Sara, 18, left, have defended their decision to call a helicopter to pick them up from Mount St. Helens in Washington State on Wednesday . 'This is a no brainer, y'all,' she told ABC News, adding that the helicopter cost her $1,300. According to Allen, the mother and daughter had been dreaming of the once-in-a-lifetime trip for some time. 'We just wanted to do something we'd never done before,' Sara said. When they reached the summit, they were thrilled but shortly after Allen slipped and fell. 'I was just thinking about the fact that she could be really hurt to the point she had a concussion or something,' the 18-year-old who will son start college at San Antonio, said. Allen said she was scraped and sore and struggling to walk so at around 8 p.m., as daylight was fading and ice was forming on the mountain, the pair called for help. Happy: The women, pictured, left on Tuesday, were thrilled when they reached the summit, but their trip soon took a turn for the worse when Nancy Allen fell, hurting her leg, right . Helicopter: Allen said the helicopter, pictured, cost $1,300 . 'We thought we're going to die up here and my little brother was going to grow up without a mom,' Sara told ABC News. Then rescuers reached them. 'We started yelling, yelling, yelling,' Allen said. 'The wind was such a factor that night.' Had her injuries been more serious, the rescuers would have automatically called a helicopter to fetch her. But she didn't so the heroic rescue team strapped her into a basket, surrounded her with blankets to keep her warm and then began the seven hour trek across dangerous terrain to get to safety. That's when Allen said she would pay for a helicopter to come collect her out of her own pocket. Scared: Nancy Allen, pictured, said the pair were scared for their lives . Rescuers: The mother and daughter posed for pictures with their rescuers after the ordeal . 'I said, ""I don't have seven hours in me. I really don't,""' she said. The Texas mother and daughter returned home this weekend after the ordeal, and Allen doesn't regret a thing. 'When you get in a situation where you really don't think you are going to make it out alive, transitioning into the normal world, things really don't matter,' she said. Multiple search and rescue teams rushed to help the women but Allen called the helicopter at about 5:20 a.m. on Wednesday to get her the rest of the . way down the mountain.

The starlet is an avid fan of Tracy Anderson - author and multi-platform wellness entrepreneur whose clients also include Madonna and Shakira. The former dancer and savvy Gwyneth are now business partners. Together they've produced four exercise DVDs -  each of which has sold in excess of 20,000 copies in Britain alone -  and a book, Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method. Gwyneth reveals that working with Tracy has completely changed her body. She said: 'Still, when I first started working with Tracy, finding motivation was hard. She advised me to think of exercise as an automatic routine, no different from brushing your teeth, to avoid getting distracted. Now it is part of my life.'

In terms of her diet, Gwyneth - who famously follows a super healthy macrobiotic diet - says that scheduling in a detox is very important. After a . gruelling schedule and lapse of overindulgence two years ago, Gwyneth was . left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed . that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels . were sky high.

'Be aware: a juice detox can crash your metabolism and lead to future weight gain.' To avoid getting distracted from your healthy eating plan, she says you should always keep healthy snacks nearby. She loves healthy salad dressings (her favourite being her homemade Mexican green goddess dressing - goat's yogurt, jalapeño, coriander and honey), which she stores in the fridge for the rest of the week and then drizzles over salads and chicken. When it comes to monitoring weight, she believes it's more important to measure in inches with a measuring tape because weighing yourself can lead to shame and guilt. Although she maintains that following . a healthy, balanced diet is key, she admits you should always allow . yourself programmed treats. 'I often have a glass of red . wine in the evening and smoke a cigarette on a Saturday. I love those . moments because they are just the right amount of naughty. 'That balance . keeps you vibrant.

A 12-year-old girl is fighting for her life in critical condition after contracting a rare and extremely deadly brain-eating amoeba while swimming at an Arkansas water park. Kali Hardig is the second person to have come down with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in three years after swimming in the sandy-bottom lake at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas. Only two people in the world are known to have survived the extremely rare Naegleria infection since the Centers for Disease Control began tracking it in 1962. Kali's family is praying for her to be the third survivor. Tragic: Kali Hardig, 12, is in critical condition after contracting a rare amoebic meningitis after she swam in a lake at a water park last week . Hope: Only two people in the world have survived amoebic meningitis and her friends and family members are praying that Kali will be the third . Kali's mother Traci has had t-shirts made for Kali's family and friends with a large, bold number '3' beneath the word's 'Kali's Krew.' 'This is Kali's Krew. Number three stands for the third person who will survive this amoeba disease. My daughter Kali,' she told KLRT-TV. 'We are just going to take baby steps, but other than that, she's doing remarkable. She's a little miracle,' The condition is caused when the Naegleria parasite enters a patient's brain, usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant, warm water up the nose while swimming. Arkansas Department of Health spokesman Ed Barham told MailOnline the water must to be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide. Naegleria are be found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes. But, they only become active when water heats up. The cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from the heat. Kali's mother says her condition at Arkansas Children's Hospital is improving and the family remains hopeful she will recover - despite the astronomically slim odds . Closed: The owners of Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas, have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years . Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by: . The CDC says there have been 128 cases of the disease in the U.S. in the last five decades - making the disease extremely rare, when compared to the number of lakes and muddy swimming holes Americans dip into for refuge from the summer heat each year. The amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees, Barham said. However, this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at Willow Springs Water Park. In August 2010, 7-year-old Davian Briggs died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake. Because two cases have been seen from the same body was water, state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole. They obliged. 'Though the odds of contracting Naegleria are extremely low, they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim,' owners David and Lou Ann Ratliff said in a statement. The park, which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by Little Rock. Kali's mother Traci Harding said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease. 'You're a mom, you're a dad. You can still take your child swimming. We don't want to scare people. We just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out. So they can go and still be a kid,' she said. She encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the Naegleria parasite. Still, Barham, of the health department, says that swimmers really shouldn't be too concerned about the . The U.S. has recorded just 128 cases of Naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years .

U.S. home prices jumped 12.2 per cent in May compared with a year ago, the biggest annual gain since March 2006. The increase shows the housing recovery is strengthening, despite home ownership slipping to an 18 year low. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released today also surged 2.4 per cent in May from April. Cities included: Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Las Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Pehoenix, Denver, Dallas, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta, Tampa, Miami, Charlotte, Washington D.C. New York, Boston . San Francisco, Ca - 24.4% . Las Vegas, NV - 23.3% . Phoenix, AZ - 20.6% . Atlanta, GA - 20.1% . Los Angeles, CA - 19.2% . Detroit, MI - 19.1% . San Diego, Ca - 17.3% . Miami, FL - 14.2% . Minneapolis, MN - 14.1% . Portland, OR - 12.5% . Seattle, WA - 11.9% . Tampa, FL - 10.9% . Denver, CO - 9.7% . Chicago, IL - 8.5% . Dallas, TX - 7.6% . Boston, MA - 7.5% . Charlotte, NC - 7.0% . Washington D.C - 6.5% . Cleveland, OH - 3.4% . New York, NY - 3.3% . The month-over-month gain nearly matched the 2.6 per cent increase in April from March - the highest on record. The price increases were widespread. All 20 cities showed gains in May from April and compared with a year ago. Prices in Dallas and Denver reached the highest level on records dating back to 2000. That marks the first time since the housing bust that any city has reached an all-time high. Home values are rising as more people are bidding on a scarce supply of houses for sale. However, figures released today showed that home ownership is at its lowest since 1995. The seasonally adjusted home ownership rate, the share of households owning a home, slipped to 65.1 per cent, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1995, the Commerce Department said on today. The rate, which peaked at 69.4 per cent in 2004, was 65.2 per cent in the first quarter. Americans are still locked in a rental market, one of the lingering legacies of the recession. High unemployment, a shortage of homes for sale and stringent lending practices made renting more appealing, economists said, warning that the share of Americans owning a home would continue to drift lower. 'There is a big shortage of homes and the amount of households and people that need to live somewhere is increasing,' said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. 'It's difficult to buy a home, they have to look somewhere, so they are renting.' Ownership among people between 55 and 64 fell 0.3 percentage point in the second quarter.  But there were small gains in the 35-44 age range. Another concern is that higher mortgage rates could also slow home sales. But many economists say rates remain low by historical standards and would need to rise much faster to halt the momentum. Svenja Gudell, senior economist at Zillow, a home price data provider, said a big reason for the recent price gains is that foreclosed homes make up a smaller proportion of overall sales. Foreclosed homes are usually sold by banks at fire-sale prices. 'Typical home values have appreciated . at roughly half this pace for the past several months, which is still . very robust,' Gudell said. Gudell . said higher mortgage rates and a likely increase in the number of homes . for sale in the coming months should slow the pace of price gains and . stabilize the housing market. The . index covers roughly half of U.S. homes. It measures prices compared . with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The . May figures are the latest available. They are not adjusted for . seasonal variations, so the monthly gains reflect more buying activity . over the summer. Despite the recent gains, home prices are still about 25 per cent below the peaks they reached in July 2006. That's . a key reason the supply of homes for sale remains low, as many . homeowners are waiting to recoup their losses before putting their . houses on the market. Dallas and Denver, the two cities . that reached record highs, were not hit hard by the housing bust and . therefore didn't experience the sharp price swings like cities in . Nevada, Arizona, California and Florida. In Dallas, prices fell only 11.2 per cent from their previous peak in June 2007 through February 2009. That's . far less than Las Vegas, where prices plummeted by more than half. Since bottoming out, home prices in Dallas have increased nearly 14 per . cent. In . Denver, prices dropped 14.3 per cent from August 2006 until they also . hit bottom in February 2009. Since then, they have risen 17.3 percent. U.S. home prices are still about 25 per cent below the peaks they reached in July 2006 . The biggest price gains are occurring in many of the states that experienced the worst housing bust. Prices jumped 24.5 per cent in San Francisco in May from a year earlier, the largest increase. Las Vegas reported the next biggest gain at 23.3 per cent, followed by Phoenix at 20.6 per cent. All three remain well below their peak prices. The smallest yearly gains were in New York, at 3.3 per cent, followed by Cleveland with 3.4 percent and Washington, D.C. at 6.5 per cent. Higher home prices help the economy in several ways. They encourage more sellers to put their homes on the market, boosting supply and sustaining the housing recovery. And they make homeowners feel wealthier, encouraging consumers to spend more. Banks are also more willing to provide mortgage loans when homes are appreciating in value. Mortgage rates have surged since early May, though the increase would have had little impact on the current report. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped a full percentage point since early May and reached a two-year high of 4.51 percent in late June. Mortgage rates jumped after Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Federal Reserve could slow its bond-buying program later this year if the economy continues to improve. The Fed's bond purchases have kept long-term interest rates low, encouraging more borrowing and spending. In recent weeks, Bernanke and other Fed members have stressed that any change in the bond-buying program will depend on the economy's health, not a set calendar date. Since those comments, interest rates have declined. The average on the 30-year mortgage was 4.31 percent last week. The Fed begins a two-day policy meeting today and could clarify its remarks further when the meeting concludes on Wednesday.","Prices in Dallas and Denver reached the highest level on records dating back to 2000 .

The girlfriend of Aaron Swartz has called an investigation into her late boyfriend's death a 'whitewash.' Aaron Swartz was a 26-year-old programming wunderkind who committed suicide in January while facing the prospect of a long prison sentence in a federal case related to his 2011 hacking of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's network. On January 6, 2011 Swartz broke into a MIT computer control room and tapped into the network to illegally download millions of scholarly articles from the database JSTOR, which requires a subscription. It was not clear what Swartz planned to do with the articles, but he had expressed in the past the need to make information free and open to everyone. MIT wrapped up an internal investigation into their role in the federal case against Swartz today, concluding that the university was unbiased in the federal case. Not responsible: Aaron Swartz committed suicide this past January when faced with the possibility of a long prison sentence for hacking into MIT's network . Trespassing: Swartz breaking into the MIT network closet in 2011 . The investigatory panel concluded that while they had concerns about policies and procedures, there as no wrongdoing on the university's part. MIT computer science and engineering professor Hal Abelson told reporters Tuesday that an independent review panel found that the school's involvement 'did not attempt to be judgmental.' Professor Abelson also said that MIT did not seek federal officials in the investigations, but rather Secret Service came with Cambridge police when they found and reported Swartz's laptop in a computer closet. He said that the school remained neutral in the case, helping neither the prosecution or the defense. Additionally, Professor Abelson said that they did not talk about potential punishments for the hacker. This is a point that Swartz's girlfriend Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman strongly disagrees with. Whitewashed: Swartz's girlfriend called the investigation a 'whitewash' saying the university helped the prosecution while denying any help to Swartz's legal team . She calls the investigation a 'whitewash' and said that MIT was definitely biased during the trial - in the support of Swartz's prosecution. Stinebrickner-Kauffman said that MIT's lawyers gave total access to witnesses and evidence, but refused the same for Swartz's legal team. Swartz's father also disagrees with the investigation. 'MIT claimed it was neutral,' Robert Swartz told the New York Times. 'and it was not - and besides, should have advocated on Aaron's behalf.' He hopes that the university will take the report and learn from Swartz's suicide. 'What's important is MIT's response to the report,' he said. Mr Swartz thinks MIT President L. Rafael Reif should work 'to drive real structural change at the university to make sure that this kind of tragedy never happens again.' Mr Reif said that the school's decisions were 'made in good faith.'","Internal investigation absolves MIT of any blame in federal case .

Declaring child prostitution a 'persistent threat' in America, the FBI said Monday that authorities had rescued 105 young people and arrested 150 alleged pimps in a three-day sweep in 76 cities. The young people in the roundup, almost all of them girls, ranged in age from 13 to 17. This was the the largest child sex trafficking sting in U.S. history. The largest numbers of children rescued in the weekend initiative, Operation Cross Country, were in the San Francisco Bay and Detroit areas, along with Milwaukee, Denver and New Orleans.

Tactics: In the 1990s, gangs took control of street prostitution which forced pimps to move girls into sporting events where security existed such as the NCAA Final Four Championship . The operation was conducted under the FBI's decade-long Innocence Lost National Initiative. The latest rescues and arrests were the largest such enforcement action to date. 'Child prostitution remains a persistent threat to children across the country,' Hosko told a news conference. 'We're trying to put this spotlight on pimps and those who would exploit.' In Operation Cross Country, federal, state and local authorities cooperated in an intelligence effort aimed at identifying pimps and their young victims. The FBI said the campaign has resulted in rescuing 2,700 children since 2003. The investigations and convictions of 1,350 individuals have led to life imprisonment for 10 pimps and the seizure of more than $3.1 million in assets.

Girls are enticed into the sex trade with compliments and offers of making money 'and then they are trapped in this cycle that involves drugs, it involves physical abuse, it may involve torture... so that they are tied to the pimp,' he said. Hosko added: 'Commonly they don't see law enforcement as their friends' but rather as a threat of arrest.

After two years on the streets, Alex reached out to the FBI, which helped her get back on her feet and arrested the 'pimps' involved in trafficking her - Sacramento residents Tynisha Marie Hornbuckle and Tamrell Rena Hornbuckle. As a result of their crimes, Tynisha was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Tamrell was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Alex has since earned her high school diploma and she plans to attend college. Offering her advice to other victims of child sex trafficking, she said, 'They can take everything from you; your voice, your freedom, they can take your fight and will, your everything.

A man who shot dead his school vice principal when he was 14 has revealed his dramatic transformation from bespectacled pupil to tattooed inmate as he appears in court eight years on. Kenneth Bartley Jr. attempted to hide from cameras as he entered Campbell County court in Jacksboro, Tennessee on Monday, where he learned details of his upcoming new trial. He also came face-to-face with the devastated family of his victim, Ken Bruce, who sobbed and clung to each other as they saw the man who took away their beloved husband and father. The trial is scheduled for February . and on Monday, a judge ruled that while Bartley will be tried within Campbell . County, jury selection will take place from outside the county. Hiding: Kenneth Bartley Jr., who allegedly fatally shot his school assistant principal in 2005, arrives for a hearing for his new trial. He looks transformed from the schoolboy who carried out the shooting . The decision came after defense attorney Gregory P. Isaacs argued that the profile of the case had remained high in the area due to eight years of legal wrangling, Knox News reported. District Attorney General Lori Phillips-Jones said there was no proof that people in the county were biased against Bartley, but the judge said he wanted the case to be resolved. He said that by using jurors from another county, it was less likely there would be grounds for a successful appeal - meaning the victim's family could finally achieve some closure. He did not say which county would provide the jurors. Isaacs said he and Bartley were both . pleased with the decision as he had a slim chance of a fair trial within . the small community of Campbell County, where many have a connection to . the school.

'It's just an opportunity he's not had before,' Isaacs told MailOnline. Bartley was a 14-year-old . freshamn when he brought a gun he found at home to Campbell County . Comprehensive School on November 8, 2005. After . Bartley's classmates reported seeing the gun, he was summoned to the . office, where the assistant principal and two administrators were . waiting, and asked to hand it over. When . Administrator Gary Seale and Jim Pierce and Assistant Principal Ken . Bruce began questioning him, a struggle ensued and he fatally shot . Bruce, 48, in the chest. The . administrators were also hurt but wrestled the .22-caliber pistol from . the boy; Seale, 55, was shot in the abdomen and Pierce, 56, was shot in . the chest, but they recovered in intensive care. Killed: Campbell County High School assistant principal Ken Bruce, left, was fatally shot in the chest by then-freshman Kenneth Bartley, right, in November 2005 as he tried to get a gun from him . Subdued: Bartley is escorted to the courtroom for jury selection in April 2007 before he took a plea deal . All three were credited with preventing a much larger tragedy from unfolding at the school. 'The courageous efforts of Gary and Jim . and Ken probably saved many other lives and the lives of our students,' schools director Judy Blevins said at the time. 'So we have to think about what they have done and how they . reacted and what they possibly saved this community.' In . April 2007, Bartley took a last-minute plea deal - pleading guilty to . second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder - as jury selection was about to begin for his trial. He was sentenced to 45 years behind . bars - 25 years for the murder followed by two consecutive 10-year . sentences for the attempted murders. One month after entering the plea, he tried to withdraw it but was denied. Scene: The boy had been called to the school office after classmates said he had a gun with him . However, he has now been granted a trial after the judge ruled the teen was not given enough time to consider the plea deal. His lawyer told MailOnline that Bartley is denying that he is guilty of first or second degree murder. 'The main question was what was his intention?' Isaac said. 'We're confident that there's going to no proof that he went to school to kill anyone.' The victim's family said they just wanted to get through the trial so they can finally see the justice that Bruce deserves and to put an end to the legal wrangling. 'If this is what we need to do to get closure, then that's what we'll do,' his wife, Jo Bruce, said.","Kenneth Bartley Jr. is preparing for a new trial after a judge agreed he did not have enough time to consider his plea deal when he was a teenager .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:25 EST, 29 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:39 EST, 29 July 2013 . Former Indiana and current Florida schools chief Tony Bennett and his staff raised a charter school's grades despite poor test scores. Bennett and his staff gave the school run by a prominent Republican donor an 'A', after test scores in algebra initially earned it a 'C', emails obtained by AP showed. The schools chief is renowned for promising to hold 'failing' schools accountable. Fixing grades? Former Indiana and current Florida schools chief Tony Bennett (pictured) is accused of fixing school grades at a charter school run by a prominent Republican donor . But when it appeared the Indianapolis charter school run by Christel DeHaan might receive a poor grade, Bennett's education team frantically overhauled his signature 'A-F' school grading system to improve the school's marks. 'They need to understand that anything less than an A for Christel House compromises all of our accountability work,' Bennett wrote in a Sept. 12 email to then-chief of staff Heather Neal, who is now Gov. Mike Pence's chief lobbyist. The emails, which also show Bennett discussed with staff the legality of changing just DeHaan's grade, raise unsettling questions about the validity of a grading system that has broad implications. Indiana uses the A-F grades to determine which schools get taken over by the state and whether students seeking state-funded vouchers to attend private school need to first spend a year in public school. Christel DeHaan has given more than $2.8 million to Republicans since 1998, including $130,000 to Bennett . They also help determine how much state funding schools receive. A low grade also can detract from a neighborhood and drive homebuyers elsewhere. Bennett, who now is reworking Florida's grading system as that state's education commissioner, reviewed the emails Monday morning and denied that DeHaan's school received special treatment. He said discovering that the charter would receive a low grade raised broader concerns with grades for other 'combined' schools - those that included multiple grade levels - across the state. 'There was not a secret about this,' he said. 'This wasn't just to give Christel House an A. It was to make sure the system was right to make sure the system was face valid.' However, the emails clearly show Bennett's staff was intensely focused on Christel House, whose founder has given more than $2.8 million to Republicans since 1998, including $130,000 to Bennett and thousands more to state legislative leaders. Other schools saw their grades change, but the emails show DeHaan's charter was the catalyst for any changes. Bennett rocketed to prominence with the help of former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a national network of Republican leaders and donors, such as DeHaan. Bennett is a co-founder of Bush's Chiefs for Change, a group consisting mostly of Republican state school superintendents pushing school vouchers, teacher merit pay and many other policies enacted by Bennett in Indiana. Though Indiana had had a school ranking system since 1999, Bennett switched to the A-F system and made it a signature item of his education agenda, raising the stakes for schools statewide. Bennett consistently cited Christel House as a top-performing school as he secured support for the measure from business groups and lawmakers, including House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tem David Long. But trouble loomed when Indiana's then-grading director, Jon Gubera, first alerted Bennett on Sept. 12 that the Christel House Academy had scored less than an A. Christel House Academy (pictured) in Indianapolis is run by Republican donor Christel DeHaan . 'This will be a HUGE problem for us,' Bennett wrote in a Sept. 12, 2012 email to Neal. Neal fired back a few minutes later, 'Oh, crap. We cannot release until this is resolved.' By Sept. 13, Gubera unveiled it was a 2.9, or a 'C'. A week-long behind-the-scenes scramble ensued among Bennett, assistant superintendent Dale Chu, Gubera, Neal and other top staff at the Indiana Department of Education. They examined ways to lift Christel House from a 'C' to an 'A', including adjusting the presentation of color charts to make a high 'B' look like an 'A' and changing the grade just for Christel House. It's not clear from the emails exactly how Gubera changed the grading formula, but they do show DeHaan's grade jumping twice. 'That's like parting the Red Sea to get numbers to move that significantly,' Jeff Butts, superintendent of Wayne Township schools in Indianapolis, said in an interview with The Associated Press. DeHaan, who opened the Christel House Academy charter school in Indianapolis in 2002 and has since opened schools in India, Mexico and South Africa, said in a statement Monday that no one from the school ever made any requests that would affect Christel House's grades. Current Indiana schools chief Glenda Ritz's office declined comment on the emails. Ritz, a Democrat, defeated Bennett in November with a grass-roots campaign driven by teachers angered by Bennett's education agenda. Bennett said Monday he felt no special pressure to deliver an ""A"" for DeHaan. Instead, he argued, if he had paid more attention to politics he would have won re-election in Indiana. Yet Bennett wrote to staff twice in four days, directly inquiring about DeHaan's status. Gubera broke the news after the second note that 'terrible' 10th grade algebra results had 'dragged down their entire school.' Bennett called the situation 'very frustrating and disappointing' in an email that day. 'I am more than a little miffed about this,' Bennett wrote. 'I hope we come to the meeting today with solutions and not excuses and/or explanations for me to wiggle myself out of the repeated lies I have told over the past six months.' Bennett said Monday that email expressed his frustration at having assured top-performing schools like DeHaan's would be recognized in the grading system, but coming away with a flawed formula that would undo his promises. When requested a status update Sept. 14, his staff alerted him that the new school grade, a 3.50, was painfully close to an 'A'. Then-deputy chief of staff Marcie Brown wrote that the state might not be able to 'legally' change the cutoff for an 'A'. 'We can revise the rule,' Bennett responded. Over the next week, his top staff worked arduously to get Christel House its 'A'. By Sept. 21, Christel House had jumped to a 3.75. Gubera resigned shortly afterward. He declined comment Monday. The emails don't detail what Gubera changed in the school formula or how many schools were affected. Indiana education experts consulted for this article said they weren't aware the formula had been changed.","Emails showed Bennett discussing with staff the legality of changing just Christel DeHaan's grade .

A summer camp is being sued by a family claiming their 15-year-old daughter was ‘humiliated’ and ‘embarrassed’ after being sent home for kissing a boy. The girl, from Westport, CT, kissed a 15-year-old boy behind the arts and crafts building July 11 at Camp Emerson, in Massachusetts, with a camp director hurling insults at the girl before both young lovers were expelled, according to reports. It was the night before the girl’s 15th birthday. The girl’s father was not even allowed on camp grounds when he came to retrieve his heartbroken daughter because she was escorted out by a uniformed, armed police officer, he told 1010 WINS. Co-ed: Camp Emerson is co-ed, and kissing is not against the rules . ‘Kissing, that was all that was going on,’ the father told the radio station. Prior to being sent home, both teens were allegedly screamed at by a camp director, according to court documents, which stated that they were ‘falsely accused them of sexually provocative behavior including the removal of each other’s clothing,’ before the girl was purportedly called a ‘slut’ and a ‘tramp.’ After deciding the teens would be sent home, the director then told their parents that the girl had undressed and was stricken from the camp she had spent the previous four summers in ‘for the campers’ safety because her acts were dangerous,’ according to the lawsuit. ‘I’m a conservative, strict, prude father, especially when it comes to my daughters, but a kiss in summer camp isn’t something that should result in being booted out of camp,’ the father continued. Extracurricular: Campers have been found in bed together and with condoms but weren't punished, according to the suit . Cruel summer: The heartbroken 15-year-old girl was sent home from camp for kissing a boy . Calling the star-crossed lovers’ relationship ‘the summer romance that most teens yearn for, the lawsuit filed Monday said the girl is ‘a child of divorced parents who suffers from anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and treats with a psychiatrist and medications, and who always felt insecure and inferior to her peers, feel confident and beautiful for the very first time in her life.’ The camp does not prohibit kissing, according to the lawsuit. Male counselors even encouraged the boy to kiss her, the suit noted. In the case of a rule being broken, campers are given three strikes before being banished – the girl had never previously received a single strike in her four previous summers at Camp Emerson, the suit said. Other campers found kissing each other weren’t sent home, the suit alleges. Campers involved in much more serious offenses including being in bed together, bringing condoms to camp, calling the nutritionist fat, brutally insulting or urinating on fellow campers ‘were never kicked out or reprimanded in any other way,’ according to the suit. Scene of the 'crime': This is the interior of the arts and crafts building the two teens were allegedly caught kissing behind . Much worse: Camp counselors are alleged in the lawsuit to have been found smoking, drinking and getting high while watching over children as young as eight . Counselors have even been caught smoking, drinking and getting high, but were also never penalized, the suit noted. The counselors look after children ages eight to 15, according to the camp's website. On its website, the camp claims that its ‘superior staff’ has a ‘philosophy of respecting the child and the way we see that each child is cared for as an individual.’ A message left for comment with a woman who refused to give her name, instead calling herself ‘just an office worker,’ was not returned by either of the four directors listed online. The four week session the girl was sent home from cost $6,600, the fee was not refunded. The lawsuit is seeking more than $600,000 in damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress, defamation and various other claims. The young girl and her family are not named in the suit due to her age. A message left with the Hinsdale, MA Police Department seeking comment was also not returned.","Kissing is not against the rules, counselors allegedly encouraged them to kiss .

John McCain paid an emotional tribute . to his Vietnam POW cellmate yesterday, telling the Senate how Colonel . George 'Bud' Day had 'ordered me back to life'. Colonel Day, who survived five and a . half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, some of it alongside Senator . McCain, died on Saturday at the age of 88 in Shalimar, Florida. 'I will see him again. I know I will,' said the Arizona Senator, filled with emotion as he described how he . imagined Colonel Day's vision of heaven in an Iowa cornfield filled with . pheasants. 'I'll hunt the field with him and I look forward to it,' CNN reported Senator McCain as saying. Both men shared a cell as prisoners of . war in North Vietnam's notorious 'Hanoi Hilton' after McCain, a Navy . airman, was shot down while on a bombing raid over the city. Senator McCain told how Colonel Day, a fierce resistor, showed him 'how to save my self-respect and my honour'. Together with a third cellmate, Major Norris Overly, Colonel Day had helped nurse the seriously injured McCain back to health. 'They bathed me, fed me, nursed me, encouraged me and ordered me back to life,' he told colleagues in the Senate. Throughout his 35 years in the military, Colonel Day fought in three conflicts and earned 70 medals making him one of the most decorated American servicemen. The greatest test of his strength happened while fighting in the Air Force during the Vietnam War. On August 26, 1967 he was sent on a . mission to fly 20 miles into North Vietnamese territory to knock out a . surface-to-air missile site. He was about 10 miles from the border when his F-100 plane was hit with anti-aircraft fire. Colonel Day was badly injured after ejecting from the plane, suffering eye and back injuries. On the ground, he was immediately captured. Courage: Colonel Day spent over five and a half years imprisoned by the Viet Cong. He was imprisoned alongside future Senator John McCain at the infamous 'Hanoi Hilton' Miraculously he was able to escape five days later and travel barefoot back into South Vietnam. Two weeks later, just as he was nearing a Marine outpost, a Communist patrol spotted him and he was captured again. For . the next five and a half years he would be taken from prison camp to . prison camp as the North Vietnamese pried the fighter pilot for American . military . secrets, but he only ever supplied false information. Later, . Colonel Day would describe his years as a prisoner to the AP as 'a major issue in . my life, and one that I am extremely proud of. I was just living day to . day.' Senator McCain . was also captured by the Viet Cong in 1967, and wasn't released until 1973. For two years Senator McCain was held in solitary confinement. Reflecting . on their time together in his memoir 'Faith of My Fathers,' Senator McCain said . that Colonel Day 'was a tough man, a fierce resister, whose example was . an inspiration to every man who served with him.' In a Twitter post Sunday, Senator McCain called Colonel Day 'my friend, my leader, my inspiration.' Brothers in arms: Senator McCain called Colonel Day 'my friend, my teacher, my inspiration' in a Twitter post Sunday . During his imprisonment, Colonel Day participated in a show of resistance by joining other prisoners in singing . 'The Star-Spangled Banner' while guards pointed guns at them. Colonel . Day was released on March 14, 1973 and three years later he was awarded . the Medal of Honor by President Gerald Ford for his courage in . enemy captivity. 'Colonel . Day was totally debilitated and unable to perform even the simplest . task for himself,' his award citation read. 'Despite his many injuries . he continued to offer maximum resistance. His personal bravery in the . face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of . fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy.' Colonel Day was born on February 24, 1925 in Sioux City, Iowa. He . started his military career early when he quit high school to join the . Marines in 1942, serving in the Pacific theatre during World War II. Honorable: Throughout his decades-long military career Colonel Day would amass 70 award medals - 50 of them for combat exploits .

Its the time of the day after work and school when the family gather around the dinner table to break bread and share stories- or it used to be. New research shows that although most British families spend time discussing sporting events and TV programmes, we simply don't talk as a family as much as we used to. Events in London topped the poll as the most popular dinner table topics in recent times, including Andy Murray's Wimbledon win and the birth of Prince George. Talking point: Buzz around the birth of the Royal baby made its way to the dinner table, where families said they discussed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George . Success story: Uplifting topics of conversation including Andy Murray's victory at Wimbledon this Summer were more likely to be discussed by a family that world news or politics . Researchers from the Museum of London surveyed 2,000 families and discovered that they are more likely to discuss light topics like the recent heatwave, than world news or politics. Just a fifth of those surveyed said they often chat about politics. Sharon Ament, the Director of . the Museum of London said: 'London is where it’s at this summer - on . the tips of tongues and fuelling family conversations across the . country. Hasn't it been hot lately? Small talk about the recent heatwave has been on everyone's lips, according to new research . Hot topics: Chris Froome's (pictured in yellow jersey) victory at the Tour de France and England's success at the Ashes are high on the list of family conversations . 'Wimbledon success, royal baby fever and Olympics nostalgia – . what all these positive topics share is a home in the capital city. Results showed that 40per cent felt they don't have meaningful conversations as a family and nearly two thirds said the art of good conversation is a dying skill.

The family sits down to eat together around ten times each month- less than three times a week. The rise in TV dinner and technological distractions are just some of the reasons one in four parents feel they don't know what is going on in their children's lives. Ms Ament said: 'You can understand . why light-hearted news - like sport or television - dominate our daily . lives. It can be tough for parents with kids of different ages to engage . the whole family in conversations that appeal to them all - . particularly with the hi-tech gadgets that most kids carry around every . day. 'In this age of technology many parents . are anxious about bonding with their children and really engaging them . on a regular basis.' Hectic routines, general fatigue and . ‘because the television is usually on’ were the biggest reasons cited for families not engaging in conversation. In fact, 45 per cent of meals eaten by the average British family are . done so in front of the television. A quarter of parents surveyed said they feel they have less conversation with their own children than they did with their parents did when they were young. Results showed that 42 per cent of parents worry they don’t talk enough as a family and nearly half find it hard to bond with their children at times.","British victories at Wimbledon and the Tour de France are hot topics .

Pursued: Criminals who were judged to be able to repay their costs will be tracked down by the authorities . Criminals who refuse to pay their legal aid bills will have their cars seized by the government and sold. Offenders who have been judged capable of repaying their legal costs currently owe the taxpayer more than £30million. Officials say that, in future, convicts who do not pay up will be ruthlessly pursued by the authorities. Cars will be seized and sold off in Government auctions. It could see luxury cars held by criminals being flogged off to pay money back to the public purse. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘Legal aid is not free - it is taxpayers’ money. ‘We must bring down the cost of legal aid and our starting point has to be that law-abiding citizens don’t foot the bill when those concerned could pay themselves. ‘I am clear - you can’t avoid paying your legal aid bill and expect to keep a fancy car on the driveway.’ The Legal Aid Agency will be able to apply to the courts for Motor Vehicle Orders from today. A defendant facing trial at the Crown Court automatically qualifies for legal aid, provided they submit a completed application form. Under the Crown Court Means Testing scheme, a financial assessment is then carried out to decide if the defendant should be asked to pay a contribution towards their defence costs. If they can afford it, they will be given a repayment schedule. Once a defendant with assets has qualified for legal aid, the Agency will be entitled to clamp any vehicles which belong to them. After conviction, officials can then go back to court for permission to sell the car, putting money raised towards unpaid legal aid costs. Costs: £700million a year is spent on legal aid for Crown Court cases. Just £9.6million has been recovered of the £43.6million owed . People who are cleared by the courts are . not made to repay their legal aid. Cars will be seized where guilty men . or women refuse to pay what they owe. Some £700 million a year is spent on legal aid for Crown Court cases. At the end of March this year, the Crown Court had recovered £9.6 million - or just 22 per cent - of the £43.6 million owed. A string of wealthy individuals have received legal aid in the past. They included convicted gangster Terry Adams, who got £4.7 million, and caravan park owners the Connors family, who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves. Eligibility: There has been a history of wealthy criminals who have received legal aid in the past, including a premier league footballer who was defending himself against accusations of spitting on an 11-year-old fan . The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs; a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes saloon; enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai; and had £500,000 in the bank. Yet they were still able to claim around £500,000 in legal aid. In 2005, the millionaire former Premier League footballer El Hadji Diouf was given legal aid to defend himself against accusations of spitting at an 11-year-old fan. Under separate changes planned by Mr Grayling, defendants living in households with a ‘disposable income’ of £37,500 or more are to be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid. New rules designed to protect the public from aggressive bailiffs are to be introduced by ministers.Bailiffs will be banned from entering homes at night or when only children are present. They will also be banned from taking basic household items, such as a cooker, microwave, refrigerator or washing machine .","Offenders who were due to repay legal costs owe taxpayer more than £30million .

A teenaged mugging victim helped get his  female attacker jailed after he tracked her down through Facebook. Shermya Pyatt, 19, headbutted the 14-year-old boy before stealing his bike in the robbery. But her victim turned detective and with the help of his friends found Pyatt on Facebook after hearing her accomplice yell her distinctive name.

Crown Court heard the mugging happened when Pyatt, and an unknown man, . approached the boy and his friend. The unidentified accomplice grabbed the youngster and knocked him off his mountain bike. Pyatt, from Leicester, then headbutted the young boy before she fled with the mountain bike at 8.20pm on September 17 last year. She was branded a ‘violent bully’ as she was caged. Judge Simon Hammond said: 'This defendant is a street bully. There’s a nasty, violent streak in her. 'People are entitled to go about their lives without people robbing them.

According to a poll conducted for the European Parliament, Britain and Germany are favoured destinations. The survey, carried out by the Afis organisation, provides fresh evidence that tens of thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians are poised to migrate to the UK. On the move: Protesters shout slogans and wave national flags during an anti-government protest in Sofia last Thursday. More than 80,000 Bulgarians are likely to move to Britain in a new wave of large-scale migration . The two countries joined the EU in 2007 and under Brussels rules, restrictions curbing their citizens’ right to take jobs here must be lifted at the beginning of next year. There are no official estimates of how many may come, but plausible projections suggest it might be as many as 50,000 a year. According to the Afis poll more than one in 20 Bulgarians – 400,000 people – are considering leaving the country and 22.5 per cent of them, more than 80,000, are likely to move to Britain. The European Parliament poll follows a survey for the BBC’s Newsnight in April which found that 8.2 per cent of Romanians and 13.6 per cent of Bulgarians would consider Britain as a migration destination. Concerns: UKIP's immigration spokesman Gerard Batten said 'we can clearly see the UK will be a magnet for those who want to work because of the wage differential' Those percentages suggest 350,000 citizens of the two countries are considering moving to Britain. 'Given the political unrest that is taking place in Bulgaria right now, I will only expect this figure to rise. The situation is compounded by an extremely high level of  corruption in this EU member state' Gerard Batten, UKIP . According to a study carried out for the Migrationwatch think-tank earlier this year, a Bulgarian family with one earner on the national minimum wage would have a weekly income of £62 in their own country. However in Britain, where the minimum wage would be boosted by Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Child Benefit, and tax credits, the family’s income would be £543 a week. UKIP’s immigration spokesman, Gerard Batten, said of the Afis poll: ‘Given the political unrest that is taking place in Bulgaria right now, I will only expect this figure to rise.

Christian victory: Nearly every supermarket will this year stock The Real Easter Egg for the first time this year . Christian groups have won a victory in their campaign for shops to sell a religious Easter egg. Nearly every major supermarket will for the first time this year stock the Real Easter Egg – the only one to mention Jesus on its packaging. Customers and bishops have lobbied them for three years to stock the £3.99 egg. They all turned the product away when it was launched in 2010, but Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-op signed up to trial the eggs in 2011 and 2012. Now Sainsbury's and Tesco have joined them – a decision church leaders described as 'a milestone'. Asda is the only major chain not to stock the egg, the box of which explains the religious significance of Easter and contains an activity for children. The Meaningful Chocolate Company expects to sell more than 200,000 of the religious eggs. Around 80 million Easter eggs are sold each year in the UK. Sainsbury's and Waitrose will stock just 12 eggs at a small numbers of stores. Tesco is the biggest stockist and will sell the eggs out of 450 of its largest stores. A spokesman for the Meaningful Chocolate Company, which makes the egg, said the supermarket had 'never replied' to multiple calls and emails. The Meaningful Chocolate Company expects most of its sales will be by mail order and through independent shops, with the remainder made up by supermarkets. Individuals, schools and churches have ordered as many as 200 of the religious eggs at a time.

A community-minded couple, who won an eye-watering $136.5million with a Powerball ticket, have broken with the fast car, fancy house tradition of lottery spending by investing in a sewage treatment plant. Mark, 52, and Cindy Hill, 51, have decided to use their new-found wealth to improve Mark's hometown of Camden Point, Missouri, which is home to fewer than 500 residents. They live in nearby Dearborn. City officials were estimating it would take around 25 years to complete the treatment works so the couple stepped in donating $50,000. It will allow families in the town to do away with individual septic tanks. Top prize: The Hill family holds a check presented by Missouri Lottery director May Scheve (right). Left to right, sons Jason, Cody, Jarod, adopted daughter Jaiden, and ticket holders Cindy and Mark Hill . Waste not want not: The Hills have opted to buy a sewage treatment center, like the one pictured, with their winnings . Speaking to CNN, Cindy Hill, 51 said: . 'For some reason (God) put it in our hands. I think to make sure it . goes to the right things.' And the sewage works isn't the only local project receiving a windfall as a result of the Hills good fortune. The couple are also paying for a new . fire station so the emergency service can have direct access to the . local highways and a new ball field which will allow kids to play away . from traffic. Camden Point fire chief, Walt Stubbs, said the donation would doubtlessly save lives. 'Money changes a lot of people,' he told the broadcaster. 'They are just good people and are willing to help others.' 'They are doing some really nice things for the community.' Shock: Cindy Hill recounted her disbelief at realizing she had the correct numbers at the lottery press conference in November. She has since said she wants to spend her money on the 'right things' Plans: The Hills said they may adopt again after the success of adopting Jaiden from China. They say they want to stay grounded as a family . The couple have also donated a scholarship fund to North Platte High School in Dearborn, which they both graduated. Mayor Kevin Boydston said: 'I've said all along . that these lottery winnings could not have gone to a better couple. They are giving back to the community, just like they . said they would.' The projects are not surprising considering the down-to-earth family's reaction to their win. Rather than moving to an exclusive . resort or investing in a fleet of Maseratis the family have stayed in . their modest family home with husband Mark meeting his friends for . coffee in the local convenience store, as normal, every day. The only big purchase they've made since netting the staggering amount was on a simple pick-up truck. Daddy's girl: Mark Hill holds his adopted daughter, six-year-old Jaiden Hill, at North Platte High School where they received their win. They've since donated to a scholarship at the school . Excitement: The family said they were excited and wanted to stay grounded . 'I'm real proud of them,' said Shirley Hill, Mark Hill's mother. 'They have stayed grounded. That's their nature.' In the winners press conference Cindy said: 'I just want to go home and be back to normal. Maybe take a nap.' Back then Mark said he was . already struggling to adjust to their new life. When the Lottery put them up . in a hotel, he ran to get toothpaste - and caught himself checking . prices. 'Old habits are hard to break,' he said, laughing. The couple have an adopted six-year-old daughter Jaiden and three adult sons. They've previously said they will consider adopting again because of their win. Sharing the news: A Missouri reporter tweeted this picture of what appears to be Hill's Facebook announcement in November . Mark, a mechanic at a hot dog and deli packaging factory, . had given his wife $10 to buy tickets. She bought five after picking . her daughter up from school, chose numbers at random and left the . tickets in the car overnight. The next morning, she checked the . numbers and on discovering they had a winning ticket, she called her . husband and said: 'I think I'm having a heart attack!' She . drove to her mother's home to verify the numbers and was later met by . her husband, who had refused to believe her. Their son Jason, 26, initially said of the win: 'I hope we stay grounded and I hope we stay the good . people we were yesterday.'

Since his shameful fall from grace after making anti-Semitic comments, John Galliano has been trying to make amends to re-build his career. But while his recent Paris catwalk show and collaboration with Oscar de la Renta both met with rave reviews, it seems his own wardrobe leaves something to be desired. The British designer, 52, was pictured meeting former model and creative director of American Vogue magazine, Grace Coddington, yesterday wearing a number of crimes against fashion. Striking looks: The flame-haired former model and eccentric fashion designer couldn't be missed as they dined in New York . Time for cricket? The designer met Grace Coddington for lunch wearing his unusual outfit . Perhaps in a nod to his heritage, he teamed a cricket jumper with tasseled tartan shorts resembling a picnic blanket. This was worn over a longer pair of camouflage shorts accompanied by green socks pulled up to his knees, worn under sandals. He also wore a scruffy khaki jacket and a baggy beanie with pink sunglasses as he stepped out in West Village, New York. Meanwhile flame-haired  Ms Coddington looked a far cry from the glamorous model who once graced the cover of Vogue. The Welsh-born 72-year-old wore baggy black trousers and a jacket with a white shirt. She further dressed down her look with plimsolls and a plain leather shoulder bag. Is the catwalk ready for this look? Galliano has been planning his return to fashion following his fall from grace in 2011 . In her heyday: Grace Coddington was a successful model and graced the cover of Vogue before becoming its creative director . Change in style: Galliano taking to the catwalk for Dior in 2010 . The pair have been spotted dining together on a number of occasions recently as Galliano plots his return to the world of fashion after he was sacked from Dior in 2011. Ms Coddington had hinted at Galliano's return during an interview with Vogue at the end of 2012. 'I love John, I think he's brilliant,' she said. 'He certainly intends to come back - when he's ready. I hope he will return, but I don't know. That's a tough one to get over.' Galliano has endeavoured to make amends for his previous behaviour with his publicist Liz Rosenberg stating in Feburary: 'Mr Galliano continues to be committed to making amends and seeking forgiveness from the Jewish community for his insensitive remarks two years ago.' Meanwhile the designer blamed an addiction to alcohol on his indiscretions in an interview with WWD in January: 'I am an alcoholic. I have been in recovery for the past two years... I remain committed to making amends to those I have hurt,' he said. 'Several years prior to my sobriety, I descended into the madness of the disease. I said and did things which hurt others, especially members of the Jewish community. I have expressed my sorrow privately and publicly for the pain which I caused, and I continue to do so.' It was confirmed last month that he will teach a masterclass at New York's top fashion college, Parsons The New School For Design, this year called 'show me emotion' divided into three day-long workshops.","British designer, 52, trying to re-build his career .

The model muse of French designer Yves Saint Laurent is auctioning her 12,000-piece haute couture wardrobe, an historic collection of creations by fashion masters such as YSL, Claude Montana, Azzedine Alaia, Paco Rabanne, Thierry Mugler, Christian Lacroix and Francois Lesage. Danielle Luquet de Saint Germain, who was born in Lyons but has lived in Geneva since the 1970s, is credited with being the inspiration behind Saint Laurent's groundbreaking 'le smoking' tuxedo for women, his see-through blouse and the YSL safari jacket. Their partnership began when Luquet arrived at her first casting with the designer in the 1960s, aged 19, wearing male clothes - a trenchcoat and man's trousers - and the designer was so intrigued he asked her to leave the clothes behind for him to 'inspire himself' with. The muse of late French designer Yves Saint Laurent, left, Danielle Luquet de St Germain, right, is selling her £12,000 haute couture wardrobe at auction in October . The collection includes a black, see-through chiffon dress decorated with ostrich feathers, expected to fetch over £12,500, and a satin 'Picasso' dress embellished with embroidery by Francois Lesage, predicted to go for no less than £10,000. Saint Laurent, who died in 2008, once said of his muse: 'I had nothing to teach her; on the contrary, it was she who helped free me of all the outdated references I had.' Françoise Sternbach, a member of the French Union of Professional Art Experts who helped curate the auction, told Women's Wear Daily: 'I know everyone will focus on the YSL pieces, which are magnificent, but I tell you there are dresses here by Claude Montana which would not have existed without her.

Delettrez, the auction house who are looking after the sale which . begins in October with a 350-piece lot, said the petite former model had . cared extremely well for the clothes and kept them in a 'museum-like' state of preservation. Luquet is credited with providing inspiration for YSL's legendary safari suits, here being modelled at the designer's last ever show, in Paris in January 2002 .

An Air Force colonel in charge of sex assault prevention has been charged with one of the very same crimes he's paid to stop after he allegedly groped a female victim while intoxicated. Lt Col Jeff Krusinski, 41, the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response boss, was arrested early on Sunday morning after police said he grabbed the female victim's breasts and buttocks in a parking lot in Crystal City, Virginia. Police said that Krusinski, then tried to touch the woman again, but she was able to fight him off and call 911. Scroll down for video . Bloodied: Jeffrey Krusinski, the chief of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response division, was charged with sexual battery in the incident over the weekend . A booking photo taken after Krusinski's arrest showed numerous cuts and scratches on his face, but it's not known whether they were from the scuffle with the woman, who was not identified. Krusinski was charged with sexual battery - a misdemeanor - and held on $5,000 bond. An Air Force spokeswoman confirmed Krusinski's employment and rank to ARLnow.com, but would not comment further. Police told the site that he and the . victim did not know each other before encounter on South 23rd Street, a . street dotted with several restaurants and bars. NBC News reported that Krusinski was removed from his post as the Air Force conducts an investigation into his arrest. Krusinski graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1994 with a degree in psychology. Dishonor: Krusinski was reportedly removed from his post as details of the arrest came to light . He later attended St Mary’s University and the Air Force Institute of Technology, according to his LinkedIn page. Two years ago, while stationed in Afghanistan, he recorded a video greeting for the Air Force baseball team. Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a tweet on Monday night that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is 'outraged and disgusted' over Krusinski's arrest. It is another black eye for the Air Force, which is currently struggling with accusations of sexual assault within its ranks. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program says on its website that the program 'reinforces the Air Force's commitment to eliminate incidents of sexual assault through awareness and prevention training, education, victim advocacy, response, reporting and accountability. 'The Air Force promotes sensitive care and confidential reporting for victims of sexual assault and accountability for those who commit these crimes.' Dozens of young female recruits and airmen at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio were victimized by their instructors who sexually harassed, improperly touched or raped them. The preliminary figures for 2012 show there were nearly 800 reports of cases, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen Mark Welsh said during his testimony to a House committee in January. That would be a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported. The 2012 figures were included in a report that the Defense Department submitted to Congress last month. Hagel has been examining the startling epidemic. According to defense officials, Hagel will seek legislation requiring that cases go through the U.S. Court of Military Appeals, and that senior officers no longer have the authority to set aside guilty findings.

The funeral director left with the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev made a plea to the State Department today to help him settle what will happened with the suspected bomber's remains - even if it means flying them to Russia. Peter Stefan said on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge, where the suspected bombers lived prior to the attack, refused to bury the body. Mr Stefan, whose business in Worcester, Massachusetts has been picketed by protesters, said that everyone deserves a dignified burial. He is hoping that the government will offer him assistance in making sure Tsarnaev's body makes it to the relevant authorities in Russia. Scroll down for videos . Decision time: Peter Stefan told a news conference on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge refused to bury the body of suspected bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev there . The impasse over 26-year-old Tsarnaev's body came as a local man started a fundraising campaign to have the alleged terrorist's body returned to his family in Russia. William Breault, from Worcester, has kick-started the campaign with $500 to send the body back to Tsarnaev's parents. Mr Stefan said on Monday that he understood the reluctance to deal with the remains following the atrocious attacks last month. However he told NBC: 'Everyone wants him sent back to Russia. I'm gonna get on the phone with the necessary people and say, ''We need help with this.''' The funeral director added: 'It also makes us look bad. In this country, we bury people. We don't leave them hanging around.' Mr Stefan said that he believed that alleged terrorist's family want his body returned to Russia. Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva has repeatedly claimed that her son's were framed for the Boston bombing. A State Department spokesman said that Tsarnaev's family should contact the Russian Consulate for help while Massachusetts Governor Patrick Deval called the burial a 'family issue'. Family: Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni arrived at Mr Stefan's funeral home on Sunday where Tsarnaev awaits burial rites . Determined: Funeral director Peter Stefan accepted the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, to give him a 'dignified burial' Cambridge city manager Robert Healy said on Sunday that Tsarnaev's body was not welcomed in one of its cemeteries. 'I . have determined that it is not in the best interest of peace within the . city to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge . Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,' Healey said. Tsarnaev's uncle  Ruslan Tsarni visited the funeral home over the weekend to claim his nephew's body. Tsarni chose to step in, he said, . because 'no one wants to associate their names with such evil events' and because religion and tradition call for his nephew to be buried. Every cemetery in Massachusetts has turned down the body of Tsarnaev but Mr Stefan remains insistent that this death be handled like any other. He has also reached out unsuccessfully to cemeteries in New Jersey and Connecticut. Some protesters outside the funeral home believe the bombing suspect should be buried at sea, similar to what was done with the body of Osama bin Laden. Other protestors simply did not want Tsarnaev's remains in their town, like retired firefighter Ronald Wahlers. 'It’s going to give this neighborhood a bad name,' Wahlers, who has lived in Worcester for a year and a half, told the Boston Globe. 'This guy doesn’t belong here.' Watching: Police remained at funeral parlors where the body of Tsarnaev was taken and where protestors followed . Fiona Gilley, left, and her sister Nairi Melkonian, both of Worcester, Mass., hold signs urging compassion while they stand on the other side of the street from protestors on Sunday . Tsarnaev, 26, died from ‘gunshot . wounds of torso and extremities’ and blunt trauma to his head and torso. The certificate lists the time of his death as 1.35am on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing. Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the U.S. ten years ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing. Tsarnaev's family was making arrangements Friday for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured the day after his brother's death. Body: Tsarvaev's body is now at Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, waiting to be buried . The body was released by the state medical examiner on Thursday. It initially was taken to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters, before being taken to Mr Stefan's funeral parlor, which is familiar with Muslim services. Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth. Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to national TV. Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said. Governor Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event. As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities have been searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found . hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston . suburb, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of . helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his . dormitory room before the FBI searched it. The . April 15 bombing, which used pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured . more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line. Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated . The brothers decided to carry out the attack before Independence Day when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said. The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained on Friday. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings. The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J.

A high school teacher has been forced to resign and escorted off the campus after she was discovered to be a part-time glamor model. Olivia Sprauer said she was asked to resign after confirming to school chiefs she posed for a series of bikini-clad modeling shots. The 26-year-old, who models under the name Victoria Valentine James, had been planning to resign later this month to pursue a modeling career. Revealing: High school teacher Olivia Sprauer was asked to resign from her Florida school after she was found to have posed for bikini glamor shots . However when school chiefs at Martin County High School saw one of her photos, she was escorted from the campus. Miss Sprauer, an English teacher from Boca Raton, said she was called into the principal's office and shown a photo that had been sent to him. On confirming she had posed for the shoot, she was told to resign and was escorted from the campus in Martin County. Various shots of Miss Sprauer are featured on the website Model Mayhem. She describes herself as a 'a graduate student living in South Florida' who loves being in front of the camera.

Going to the fridge to butter some toast, a woman was shocked by what she found crawling among her groceries. Staring back at her was an exotic spider, believed to have travelled more than 6,000 miles from India in a box of grapes. Beverley Cooper, 52, screamed when she saw the two-inch female Indian wolf spider, which experts believe is pregnant, in the fridge at her home in Glenrothes, Fife in Scotland. Friend in the fridge: Beverley Cooper found this Indian wolf spider in her fridge. Experts believe the female spider is likely to be pregnant and travelled more than 6,000 miles from India . Her husband David Cooper, 60, rushed downstairs and caught the spider, capable of giving a nasty bite, in a glass before calling the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The female spider is now living at the Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World. Mr Cooper, a former schoolteacher, said: 'I heard my wife screaming and when I went to see what was wrong I discovered the spider sitting on the wall of the fridge. It was odd looking and I immediately knew it wasn't a normal house spider. ‘I think being in the cold had slowed it down as it wasn't moving very quickly and was relatively easy to catch. ‘I thought it would jump at first, but it was quite lethargic from being in the fridge. 'I'm really glad the spider has found a new home as it's certainly been through quite a journey, wherever it came from.' Shock discovery: Beverley Cooper (left) screamed when she saw the exotic spider in the fridge starring back at her and after rushing to her aid, husband David (right) caught it in before calling the Scottish SPCA . Mrs Cooper, a co-ordinator with Fife Council said: ‘I got a huge shock. I think all of Glenrothes heard me screaming. ‘It was 11pm and David was feeling peckish so I went to the fridge to get bread and butter for toast. ‘As soon as the light went on I saw . this hairy spider staring back at me. It looked enormous to me and I . just started screaming. ‘It was like no spider I’d seen . before as it was hairy and had big beady eyes, like a tarantula. But I . didn’t want to squash it. I don’t like to kill anything but it would . also have made a horrible mess of my fridge.’ SPCA animal rescue officer Kieran Smart said: 'The spider was found in the fridge, next to a box of grapes which originated from India, so the chances are it has come home in the Cooper's shopping.' Andrew McDonald, general manager of Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World said: ‘We think the spider could be pregnant. ‘It is hard to tell with a small spider, but we are pretty sure it is.’ Kevin Thom, from Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World, said: ‘This spider isn't deadly but if (someone was) bitten, it would leave a real sting. ‘Although it's not much bigger than the average house spider, it definitely isn't from Britain. ‘It has different markings and, unlike house spiders, its eyes are at the front of its head, helping it to hunt and escape danger.’ Found all over the world, Wolf spiders venom is not deadly to humans but can cause mild pain and swelling. While the wolf spider has a lifespan of no more than two or three years, it is hoped that the new female will contribute to a new generation of the spiders at the centre. Mr Macdonald said: ‘We think we will have this spider for maybe 12 to 18 months, but hopefully we will keep the offspring and have another generation.’ Anyone who finds an exotic creature such as this should call the SPCA Animal Helpline on 03000 999 999.

This is the premise behind Armenian photographer Suren Manvelyan's latest collection, which features extreme close-up images showing eyes of animals, birds and reptiles. The collection includes rodents, hyenas, lemurs, monkeys, tiger pythons, cats, dogs, snakes, birds, a fox and even a flying possum. Husky dog: Huskies mainly live in the Arctic and are known for having pale blue eyes. However, some species have been known to have brown, green and yellow eyes . Fennec fox: The fennec is a small nocturnal fox that lives in the Sahara desert in Africa. Its eye resembles what paleontologists believe many dinosaur eyes to look like. The fox is known for its large ears, which help keep it cool . Lark: Larks are passerine birds, also known as perching birds or songbirds. The majority live in dry regions, in northern and eastern Australia. Larks are medium-sized birds, between five to eight inches long and weigh between 15 and 75 grams . Long-eared owl: The long-eared owl is indigenous to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is between 12 to 16 inches long and has a wingspan of around 39 inches . Chinchilla: The chinchilla has the most distinctive pupil of Manvelyan's collection. It is a rodent native to the Andes mountains in South America. The name chinchilla means 'little chincha' and is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who used to wear its fur . Iris recognition (IR) is an example of biometric identification. Biometrics uses a person's unique features, such as irises and fingerprints, to identify who they are. Everyone's iris has a complex, random pattern that is different to anyone elses. IR uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques to scan this random design. The scans analyse more than 200 points that can be used for comparison, . including rings and freckles. The technology was first proposed in 1936 by ophthalmologist Frank Burch. In 1987 two ophthalmologists, Aran Safir and Leonard Flom, patented the idea. John Daugman then created algorithms for iris recognition in 1989. Each of the photos in Manvelyan's collection show the complex surface of individual animal eyes. Many of Manvelyan's images were taken of animals in captivity at Yerevan Zoo in Armenia. Manvelyan's Animal Eyes collection was a follow-up to his Your Beautiful Eyes series which features extreme close-up images of human eyes. Although the eyes look different, they work in a very similar way to human eyes. The main parts of the eye include the cornea, pupil, iris, retina and radial and sphincter muscles. When the animals look around, the light reflected from different objects enter their eyes through the transparent cover called the cornea. The light then travels into the eye through the pupil. The pupil is the black circular part in the centre of your eyeball. The . varying pupil shapes and sizes of the animals in Manvelyan's collection . is determined by where in the world they live and how much sunlight . they get. It also depends on whether they are nocturnal or not. Lemur: Lemurs only see in black and white. This means they don't choose food based on what it looks like, but instead of how it smells. Their monochrome vision makes it easier to see at night. The word 'lemur' comes from the Roman mythological word, lemures, which means ghosts or spirits . Iguana: Iguanas use their eyes to navigate through forests and find food. They use visual signals to communicate with other iguanas, and have a third 'eye' on top of their heads called the parietal eye. The parietal eye is a scale that contains photoreceptors to detect different light ranges . Abino tiger python: The albino tiger python is a specially bred species of the Asiatic python, found predominantly in Southeast Asia. They can grow up to around seven metres long making them the world's longest reptiles . Rhesus macaque: Also known as the rhesus monkey, their eyes most closely resemble human eyes. In January 2000 the rhesus macaque became the first primate to be cloned, and in January 2001, the first transgenic rhesus primate was born that contained genes taken from jellyfish . Black kite: The black kite is a bird of prey, so-called because it soars and glides in search of food, and can change direction smoothly and quickly. The birds often get electrocuted because they perch on electric wires . Radial . fibres within the iris - the coloured part of the eye- pull the pupil . open when it's dark to let more light in and make it easier to see in . low-light conditions. Nocturnal animals, such as the Fennec fox, have larger pupils to make easier to see at night. Sphincter . fibres help the pupil contract to restrict how much light enters the . eye in bright conditions. Chimpanzee: Chimpanzees, also known as chimps, have eyes similar to humans because they can distinguish colours that other mammals can't see. The eyes on a chimp are close together, like on humans, so they can see stereoscopically and make out shapes in 3D, with depth perception . Tockus: The tockus is a type of hornbill bird found in Africa. They have binocular vision, although unlike most birds with this type of eyesight, the tockus' bill can sometimes get in the way and obstruct their view . Guinea pig: The guinea-pig is a domesticated rodent, also known as cavy. It doesn't exist naturally in the wild. The term to be used as a 'guinea pig', referring to being a test subject, comes from when the rodents were tested on during the 19th century . Hyena: Spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed with their eyes open. Although they look like felines, they behave more like canines and have a keen sense of smell which they use for hunting. Their body parts are used for medicines in some parts of Africa . Siamese cat: The Siamese cat originated in Thailand, formerly Siam. They are known as Wichian Mat or 'moon diamond' because of the shape and colouring of their eyes. Only pure bred Siamese cats have light blue eyes . A human eye, looking uncannily similar to many of the animal eyes . Husky dogs live in very bright conditions in the Arctic, so their pupils are smaller. The lens focuses the light onto the back of . the eye called the retina. The . retina is made of thousands of light-sensitive neurons, called . photoreceptors, which change light signals into electrical ones. These . electrical signals are then sent to the brain along the optic nerve and . the brain processes what it's looking at in the visual cortex. When you look at an object it is projected onto your retina upside down. Your brain then turns it the correct way up. There are some differences, however, depending on the species. For example, lemurs can only see in black and white so use their sense of smell to choose which food to eat. And husky dogs can have different coloured eyes because of a condition called heterochromia. See more of the photographer's work here.","Collection includes hyena, python, tiger and monkey eyes .

"By . Ted Thornhill and Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 06:32 EST, 23 September 2011 . An incredible video has captured the six-ton Nasa satellite doomed to fall to Earth this week - NASA is slowly narrowing the area it could strike down. So far, it looks unlikely to hit the US, but the rest of the planet is still terrifyingly vulnerable. Astrophotographer Thierry Legault's clip, shot in northern France, shows the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere . Research Satellite (UARS), appearing as a beaming mass of light as it plummets to Earth - where there is a one in 3,200 chance it could hit someone. The 1,200lb satellite will, Nasa estimates, break into more than 100 pieces . on re-entry, and some will burn up - but it's estimated that around 26 . of the heaviest metal pieces WILL hit the surface - in lumps weighing up . to 300lbs. Tumbling to Earth: Images from Mr Legault's video show the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), appearing as a beaming mass of light . Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain . Best guess: The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live . Debris could be scattered over an area . up to 500 miles long. It would be the first time in history someone was . injured by space debris. Mr Legault's footage of UARS was . captured through the lens of his Celestron EdgeHD 14in . Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in Dunkerque, France on September 15 - . eight to nine days before its estimated re-entry. Filmed at an altitude of only 250km, the body of the UARS is visible, as are its solar arrays. Mr Legault told the skywatching . website Spaceweather.com: 'The satellite appears to be tumbling, perhaps . because a collision with satellite debris a few years ago. The . variations in brightness are rapid and easily visible to the human eye.' The Upper Atmosphere Research . Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six . continents. NASA says it could land at any point between 57 degrees . north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated . areas of our planet (see map below). Most of the satellite will burn up . during re-entry, but a 1,200 pounds of metal metal will still plummet to . the Earth’s surface. Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal. He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'. Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up over a ton will strike the ground. It will not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed. The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag. A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed. Don't worry too much, though - the odds of any one particular person being hit are much lower, around one in 21 trillion. It’s . being tracked by the Joint Space Operations Center of U.S. Strategic . Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but Nasa admits it . has no idea where it will come down, or when. The . space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 . degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains . could scatter over a 500mile area. That means pieces of it could land in Scotland – or somewhere in Chile. However, a Nasa spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris. He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects. This satellite is far smaller than . the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or . the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979. So far this year alone, two large Russian rocket stages have fallen to earth without inflicting any injury. Mir . fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and . parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the . Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water. Nasa is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it. The . spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of . UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for . assistance.’ It was launched . back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, . wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere.

Junk yard in space: UARS is one of the thousands of objects in Earth orbit being tracked by Nasa, as shown by this computer graphic . But now it’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph. The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites. The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground. The UARS is something of a relic - these days, Nasa satellites are designed to be light enough to burn up on re-entry, or to have fuel to fly up into a higher, longer-term orbit.

A rabbit born with a normal amount of hair has confused doctors after it appeared to show signs of a condition that only exists in dogs. Delta-Mouse appeared just to be the runt of the litter when he was born six weeks ago, but when his fur started falling out owner Debbie Ikin from Horwich, Greater Manchester, realised something was amiss. When she took the pet to the vet, she discovered that he had pituitary dwarfism. Scroll down for video . Miniature: Owners feared their tiny, bald and funny looking rabbit might not survive . Rare condition: The poor bunny began shedding his fur after he was born six weeks ago . His condition, which caused his fur to fall out all over except from his head and feet, had only been seen before in German Shepherd dogs, the vet said. Ms Ikin, 40, said: 'I thought he was the runt of the litter with a skin condition. I have grown up around rabbits and we have had several litters but I've never seen anything like Delta-Mouse. 'I worried he wasn't eating properly, but he was living and just looked a bit different, especially compared to the other rabbits.' After being checked by the vet, he was declared perfectly healthy. Ms Ikin said the vet decided not to take a blood sample from the tiny creature as it might make him anaemic, so she has been keeping a close eye on him instead. Rabbit's foot: But luck was on Delta-Mouse's side and the little creature has surprised everyone by getting stronger by the day . While he remains far smaller than his siblings, the rabbit's fur has now regrown . Debbie Ikin, who bred the unusual looking rabbit, said he has become part of the family and will not be for sale . The rabbit's eyes need bathing every morning to help him open them because they get stuck together over night. And when out in the sunshine, Delta-Mouse must be lathered in factor 50 suncream to protect his sensitive skin. The rabbit has astounded both his owners and vets by becoming stronger by the day. His hair has regrown on his body, but he still has bald patches on his the back of his head and the top of his feet. Ms Ikin's son Jacob, 10, loves his new pet and after naming him Delta when he was born, added 'mouse' to the end due to his small stature. Best friends: Ten-year-old Jacob was so afraid to hold the tiny baby bunny when he lost his fur because he seemed so fragile . Now that Delta-Mouse is on the road to recovery, he likes no where better than sitting on Jacob's head . The ten-year-old has been scared to hold him at times because he is so precious. Ms Ikin said: 'He's thriving and very spritely. He's super friendly and loves to sit on your shoulder. 'He's become quite a little celebrity, everyone wants to come round and see him and have their picture taken with him.' Ms Ikin's breeding pair Junior and Stitch have produced a number of litters as well as being parents to Delta-Mouse.

'However, . we'd rather people left the painting of postboxes to us. We are liaising . with our engineers to ensure that it is repainted red as soon as . possible.' Mr Smith decided to paint the Lymington postbox in an apparent protest that Royal Mail had instead . chosen to paint one gold in Cornwall, where Ainslie was brought up. Botched job: A man was apparently cautioned by police after making an attempt to paint this postbox in Belvedere, south London . Mr Smith, who owns a bar and restaurant at Lymington Yacht Haven, described the climbdown as a victory for common sense. He said: 'I’m over the moon. It’s all I ever wanted for Ben, for Lymington, and everyone who has supported the campaign. 'Thousands of people wanted the post box to be painted gold - I’m just the person who did it.

Explaining it's U-turn, a Royal Mail spokesman said: 'There’s been a huge amount of interest in this. 'We understand the depth of feeling involved as Ben is a local hero and sailing is very much part of the Lymington community. Ben loves the gold post box in Restronguet but would love to have one in . Lymington as well and we’re happy to oblige.' Taking matters into their own hands: Supporters of bronze medal-winning boxer Anthony Ogogo painted this Royal Mail postbox in his hometown of Lowestoft, Suffolk,  in honour of his achievements . 'Miserable': Peter Moran was dismayed to find the postbox he painted gold in honour of his neighbour Alistair Brownlee has been returned to its original red . A Facebook campaign backing a golden postbox in Lymington attracted more than 1,700 supporters. Ainslie also described Mr Smith as a 'legend of Lymington' for painting the box gold. It was latest in a long line of incidents over the last fortnight. Fans of Olympic bronze medal boxer Anthony Ogogo struck in his hometown of Lowestoft in Suffolk.

The owner of a valet service has been caught red-handed in a moment driving a customer's expensive convertible which was paid to be entrusted to his care - a scene right out of the 1980s movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Premier Parking Spot in Cocoa, Florida claims to look after customers' cars while they head off on vacation cruises. However instead of the 2012 Corvette convertible being placed in a secure garage in the Florida location and perhaps being serviced, an undercover investigation found that company owner Jay Nieves had secretly taken the car on a weekend joyride.

Money maker: Jay Nieves valet service offers customers, many heading off on cruises, to look after their cars and drop them at the terminal in style . Brat pack: In the 1986 blockbuster comedy, directed by John Hughs, Ferris Bueller takes a rare red Ferrari out for a spin - even though it belonged to his friend's father . An investigation by ABC7 discovered the deception when they handed the fraudster  keys to a $60,000 convertible  - and he found the temptation was too great to resist. Less than six hours after it had been in the lot, Nieves took the car on the road - all captured on a hidden camera with built-in GPS. The businessman and a female employee were caught driving the car on the freeway and into his driveway where he took pictures of it with his phone. He later parked it at night outside a restaurant. Nieves also used the convertible to run errands for three days - at one point piling it high with DIY products and allowing his pet dog to run all over the upholstery. What's mine is yours?

Even when shown the video of himself behind the wheel, he continued to refute the claims. No charges have yet been filed against Mr Nieves bu authorities. In the 1986 film starring Matthew Broderick, Ferris Bueller convinces his friend Cameron to ‘borrow’ his father’s vintage 1962 Ferrari GT California. Director John Hughs said in interviews at the time that there were only 100 of those cars ever produced. In the movie, Cameron is fearful of his father’s retribution after he discovers that they’ve put a few hundred miles on the car’s odometer. In an effort to ‘undo’ the mileage, Bueller suggests that they run the car in reverse. Cameron kicked the car out of anger, sending it plummeting  into a ravine.

Iraqis watching a statue of former President Saddam Hussein topple in Baghdad's Al-Fardous square in 2003 as Iraqis began removing symbols of Saddam Hussein's 24-year grip on power . Mr Ely, 52, from Derby, lambasted the case as a waste of time and money. He said: 'This is ridiculous. The police . investigation cost tens of thousands of pounds and my fees are being . paid by legal aid. Where’s the common sense? 'The case was a complete waste of . police time and my time. Having part of the statue of Saddam is like . having a piece of the Berlin wall. It is a historical artifact', he told The Sun. Mr Ely claimed he arrived in the Baghdad's Firdos Square just after the statue of Saddam . had been torn down. He helped himself to the 2ft left buttock by using a hammer and crowbar to . prise off the piece after American soldiers overturned the former Iraqi leader's statue in . Baghdad in 2003. He planned to auction it for soldiers’ charities but hid the chunk when police began investigating in January. Iraqi leaders made a complaint via the Iraqi Embassy, claiming that the piece was part of the country's heritage. Liberated: Thousands of jubilant Iraqis celebrated the collapse of Saddam Hussein murderous regime, beheading a toppled statue of their longtime ruler in the centre of Baghdad . Derbyshire police launched an investigation and arrested Mr Ely on suspicion of breaching Section 8 of the Iraqi Sanctions Order 2003 earlier this year. Under the order, anyone possessing Iraqi cultural property must give it to the police. Officers searched Nigel’s Herefordshire . cottage but failed to find it. Mr Ely was released without charge. Police now say they are not convinced the . metal is from the Saddam statue. A spokesman for Derbyshire police said: 'Despite a thorough investigation, the . piece alleged to be from the statue has not been recovered and we found . evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of its origin. 'It is disappointing that a large amount of police time and resource has . been required to investigate the claim that this item was genuine. 'If . any new evidence comes to light, or if the item is traced and is shown . to be genuine, further police action will be taken.' Hussein, who had governed over Iraq . from July 1979 until April 2003, was eventually captured and hanged in 2006 after . being found hiding in a hole.","SAS hero Nigel Ely, from Derby, helped himself to souvenir after statue toppled in 2003 .

It may have taken 69 years but one of the longest-running experiments in the world has captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time ever. The experiment began in 1944 at Trinity College Dublin to prove that pitch, a material that appears to be solid at room temperature and is also called bitumen, tar or asphalt, is in fact a liquid. Drops take between seven and 13 years to fall and this is the first time a drop has been recorded on camera - a similar experiment in Australia missed filming its latest drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off. VIDEO: See the historic pitch drop fall . Pitch is the name for any 'viscoelastic, solid polymer'. It can be made from petrol and is also known as tar, bitumen or asphalt. Pitch can also be produced in plants, known as resin and it is used to waterproof sails and ships. Physicists from Trinity College claimed the viscosity of the pitch in its experiment is around 2 . million times more viscous than honey, or 20 billion times the . viscosity of water. How quickly the tar drops depends on the exact composition of the pitch, and the environment its in. It can be directly affected by temperature and vibrations. Scientists used to think glass was a slow-moving liquid, because old church window panes are thicker at the bottom, but this . is now considered a solid. Pitch-drop experiments involve heating a sample of solid pitch to increase the material's viscosity - ability to flow. It is then poured into a sealed glass funnel. The tar is left to settle before the stem of the funnel is removed to create a hole for the pitch to drop from. The Dublin experiment is believed to be the second oldest pitch-form test. The oldest known test began at Cambridge University in Australia in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell. A decade later the first drop fell and since then only another eight have dropped. It can range from between seven and 13 years for each drop to form and fall. The origins of the Dublin experiment are less known. According to the journal Nature, it is believed to have been started by a professor at the Irish university, Ernest Walton, in 1944 to promote how science experiments can be used for education purposes. One of the longest-running lab experiments in the world, taking place at Trinity College Dublin, has captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time, pictured. A similar Australian experiment missed filming its last drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off . No-one was watching the drop and it's believed many fell without being recorded. Physicists at the college set up a webcam last April to start monitoring the experiment again and at around 5pm on 11 July the first drop was filmed falling. Scientist Shane Bergin from the university told Nature: 'We were all so excited. 'It’s been such a great talking point, with colleagues eager to investigate the mechanics of the break, and the viscosity of the pitch.' The Australian experiment has been much more widely documented and is in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world's longest running scientific experiment. It is also believed to have enough pitch in the funnel to last for another hundred years. The oldest known pitch drop experiment began at Cambridge University in Australia in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell. The first drop fell a decade later. Professor John Mainstone, pictured, has been custodian of the Australian test since the 1960s but has missed every drop . At room temperatures pitch, pictured, appears to be a brittle solid - but the series of 'drops' which have formed in the Dublin and Australian experiment prove that it is in fact a liquid . The last drop to fall during John Mainstone's Australian experiment was missed because the camera was turned off . Professor John . Mainstone is now custodian of the experiment that is on public display . at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Since starting at the university in the early 60s he has missed all five drops that have fallen. He hopes to be present when the next one - which has grown into a perfect teardrop shape - finally falls from the funnel. Since . the webcam was erected next to the experiment it has attracted a large . and devoted following of barmy boffins and amateur enthusiasts from . around the world. Indeed, Professor Mainstone was surprised to receive emails from the Inuit people who were watching the experiment online. As more drops fall the gaps between them will grow, so the next drop could be the last one for decades. Prof Mainstone, 77, another alumnus of Cambridge, said: ‘I am friendly with Thomas Parnell's son, who is now in his 80s. ‘He said that other people in the physics department didn't take much interest in it. The students probably laughed at him. ‘It became something of a real oddity . and was hidden away in a cupboard and when I started I had to convict . the department to put it on display. There were people who thought it . should just be thrown out. Professor Thomas Parnell (1881-1948), conceived the now famous Australian Pitch Drop Experiment . Parnell as a Lieutenant in the AIF, serving in France during the latter part of WWI and into 1919 . The earlier drops that fell during the Australian experiment have now flattened . ‘Before he died in 1948, Parnell would have been there for two drops, so I've been there for many more than him. But no one has ever actually watched one fall. ‘The last time it happened I was in London and I got an email saying it was getting close, but I wasn't worried because we had a camera on it. ‘Then I got an email to say it had happened, which was followed by another email to say the camera had not worked. Hopefully the technology is better now. ‘The closest I have been to seeing a drop live is five minutes away, and on another occasion I left the university thinking it would not drop at least until the next day, but when when I arrived in the morning it had happened. ‘It is very difficult to judge when it is going to drop. But as it gets nearer the pitch hangs by filaments and when one of those breaks it goes. ‘The current drop is much smaller than the last one, which is still attached to the pitch, but it may flatten out so the next drop might come away quite clearly. ‘Pitch is not a homogeneous substance and is a complex mix of hydrocarbons so it is difficult to predict what will happen, especially as the conditions have changed with the introduction of air conditioning. ‘People from around the world get in touch about it - and not just from English speaking countries. ‘I've even had emails from Inuit people. There really are pitch drop devotees. ‘Former students come back to the university with their children and grandchildren and look at the experiment and say it looks exactly the same. ‘I hope it continues to run after I'm gone, I think there are another 100 years left and the gaps between drops will get longer and longer.’","The experiment began in 1944 in a bid to prove pitch, or tar, is a liquid .

Charanjeet Kondal, who founded the website 'Morph Thing', created his image of the heir to the throne by morphing the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

He said: 'On each image focal features like the nose, eyes, mouth and eyebrows are taken and combined to find an average between them. That average is then taken from both images and then that average is combined to create the final image.' He added that he is 'quite excited to see if my system prediction is right' now that Kate's son is due to be presented to the world.

Wearing a 'Don't frack my future' T-shirt and fighting against the grip of four police officers, Marina Pepper was today removed from a rural drilling site she and a group of 100 campaigners have occupied for the last five days. Mrs Pepper, who has worked as a Playboy model and Page Three girl, was carried away from the oil drilling site by officers after she tried to stop a lorry of office furniture from entering. The 45-year-old Liberal Democrat councillor is believed to have tried to create a blockage as deliveries of equipment were made to the site near Balcombe, West Sussex. Scroll down for video . Forcibly removed: Marina Pepper was carried away from the scene where protestors were blocking a lorry near Balcombe . Not without a fight: The Liberal Democrat councillor pushes against the four police officers, who hold her by her arms and ankles . Cause: Mrs Pepper has become the face of the anti-fracking campaign which has taken hold by the site which is run by Cuadrilla . Six campaigners were today arrested at the site which is run by energy company Cuadrilla, bringing the total number of people held since Friday morning to 23. Protesters are fearful that the . exploratory oil drilling planned at Balcombe could lead to fracking, the contorversial process of pumping high pressure liquid underground to . split shale rock and free gas. Campaigners against the method have raised concerns about the chemicals used in fracking as well . as the impact on the environment. Sussex Police said policing the protest has put a strain on their resources, with 'some proactive work' being postponed as a result. Campaigner: Mrs Pepper modeled for Playboy magazine (left) and The Sun. She is now a Liberal Democrat councillor . Loud and clear: Demonstrators tried to prevent police officers from escorting a lorry carrying equipment for the drilling site . The campaigners have counted Bianca Jagger- the former model and ex-wife of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger- in their company. Anna Dart, of Frack Free Balcombe, said . around 100 people turned out to protest today, including a pregnant . woman who stood in front of a truck. She said: 'We are not going away. We . have already caused significant delays. Over 90% of the Balcombe . community have said they support non-violent action. 'We are being brought food and water by . villagers and our toilets have been hired by Greenpeace. The villagers . have been incredibly supportive. One even brought down cream teas from a . wedding.' Stand off: Police prepare to eascort the lorry into the Cuardilla site. The company has fracked elsewhere and protestors fear they will do so at the Balcombe site in the future . Costly: Superintendent Steve Whitton, of Sussex Police said their resources have been stretched by policing the demonstrations . Superintendent Steve Whitton, of Sussex Police, said his officers were doing their best to strike a balance between people’s right to protest alongside Cuadrilla’s right to operate. He said: 'We understand how strongly some people feel about the issue of fracking but it is important that they work with us to protest safely and peacefully. 'Our primary tactic is to talk to . people, and officers are going to great lengths to explain to people why . we are there and what is acceptable in terms of their safety and others . working at the location. 'When . we police these kinds of demonstrations we will always look for a . negotiated response. We would much rather talk to people and persuade . them to move than use coercion. 'Some . pictures in the media look dramatic. What they often don’t show is the . length officers have gone to persuade protesters to move. Arrests: Six people were arrested today, taking the total number of protestors held by the police to 23 . Blockade: The crowd of protestors stood in front of the delivery lorry, blocking its way into the drilling site . Struggle: Police said their aim was to move people by talking to them, rather than physically removing them . 'If protesters block the way and it is lawful for the company to operate then they need to move. 'If they are repeatedly asked to move, and at times are putting their own safety at risk, some level of coercion has to be used.' Cuadrilla rebutted rumours that it had . suspended plans to drill because of the protests, with officials saying . drilling will start as soon as possible.

Police discovered the boy in a cupboard at the home of registered sex offender Adam Younger (pictured) A young boy was found hiding in a locked cupboard at a paedophile’s home. Police discovered the 12-year-old during a routine visit to the home of registered sex offender, Adam Younger. Durham Crown Court heard that Younger, then 22, was being monitored as a three-times sex offender. It was under the terms of that order that the officer visited the house in Horden, County Durham, on December 29. Mark Styles, prosecuting, said when Younger answered the door he was only partially dressed. The officer decided to check the rest of the premises, during which she went into a bedroom with unmade bedding and a cupboard locked by a latch from the outside. Mr Styles said: 'On opening it, she found a 12-year-old boy hiding inside. 'He was coaxed out and assured he wasn’t in trouble.' Younger fled, later sending text messages back to the boy, telling him: 'Run', and, 'Say you have only been for ten minutes.' Later that day, Younger was arrested outside his grandmother’s house in Sunderland. He told police that he had befriended the boy at a bus station. Mr Styles said the boy, who was considered vulnerable, appeared to have stayed there for much of the Christmas holiday, with Younger, 'playing off one person in responsibility against another'. The boy, who was found at Younger's home in Horden, County Durham (file photo, above) is believed to have stayed there for much of the Christmas holiday . When the boy’s mother came seeking him, Younger played out 'a charade' pretending to be the elder brother of her son’s schoolfriend, who was on an errand. Younger, now 23, admitted child abduction and two charges of breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Two of his previous offences were for sexual assaults on boys aged under 13 and the third was for downloading indecent images of mainly young boys, for which he received a 21-month custodial sentence at Teesside Crown Court, in January 2009. As part of that sentence, Younger was also made subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (Sopo) limiting his future contact with boys. Warren Grier, mitigating, said: 'Clearly the defendant knows there’s only one outcome. 'It’s a custodial sentence and he needs assistance from a sex treatment programme while he’s serving that sentence.' Jailing him for three years, Recorder Ian Atherton told Younger it would appear he was 'grooming' the 12-year-old, using deceit to convince the boy’s mother it was all above board.","Sex offender Adam Younger partially dressed when he answered the door .

Water-laden 'rivers' of flowing air are likely to bring more flooding misery to the UK as a result of climate change, scientists predict. Researchers from the University of Reading believe serious flooding will become twice as likely in the UK by the end of the century, thanks to a weather phenomenon that sees huge volumes of water vapour traveling though the air. They have blamed climate change for increasing the occurrence of 'atmospheric rivers,' which are already responsible for causing floods of large magnitudes in Britain during the winter months. Scenes like this one of a flooded high street in Cockermouth, Cumbria, could become more frequent sights. Scientists believe serious flooding will become twice as likely in the UK by the end of the century, thanks to atmospheric rivers . Atmospheric rivers are narrow saturated air currents that cause heavy, long-lasting winter rain in mid-latitude regions of the Earth and can carry enormous amounts of water. If the scientists are correct, we could see the weather phenomenon more frequently that produces the sort . of floods that devastated Cumbria in November 2009, The Independent reported. A staggering . foot of rain fell within just three days and this sort of weather could become more frequent in the years ahead. Atmospheric . rivers have been blamed for some of the UK's most dramatic floods in . recent times that are estimated to have caused over £1 billion worth of . damage in the last year alone. A new study in IOP Publishing's Environmental . Research Letters, has shown that atmospheric rivers affecting the UK are expected to become stronger and more frequent by the end of the century  - because of global warming, the researchers claim. Atmospheric rivers are narrow saturated air currents that cause heavy, long-lasting winter rain in mid-latitude regions of the Earth and can carry enormous amounts of water. Here, a diagram shows the concentration of water in the Cumbria flood . The scientists found that large parts of the projected changes in atmospheric river frequency and intensity would . be down to thermodynamic changes in the atmosphere, rather than the . natural variability of the climate. They said this suggests that it is a response to . climate change. To reach these conclusions, the scientists used five climate models to simulate conditions between 2074 and 2099 based on forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions. All the models indicated a doubling of atmospheric rivers frequency compared with that seen during the period 1980 to 2005. An increase in the intensity of atmospheric rivers, leading to greater amounts of rain, was also predicted. Lead author of the study, David Lavers, from the University of Reading, said: 'Atmospheric rivers could become stronger in terms of their moisture transport. The flooded River Derwent breaks its banks and floods properties in Cockermouth, Cumbria in November 2009. Dr Lavers said the link between atmospheric rivers and flooding is already well established, so an increase in atmospheric river frequency will probably lead to an increased number of floods . 'In a warming world, atmospheric water . vapour content is expected to rise due to an increase in saturation . water vapour pressure with air temperature. 'This is likely to result in increased water vapour transport. 'The link between atmospheric rivers and flooding is already well established, so an increase in atmospheric river frequency is likely to lead to an increased number of heavy winter rainfall events and floods. 'More intense atmospheric rivers are likely to lead to higher rainfall totals, and thus larger flood events.'","Scientists believe serious flooding will become twice as likely in the UK by the end of the century, due to atmospheric rivers .

The founder of whistle blowing website WikiLeaks has launched his political party to contest Australian elections this year. Julian Assange, 41, said the WikiLeaks party would field seven candidates in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia states. The Australian citizen is one of three party candidates who will run for upper house Senate seats in Victoria that will be held before December.

'Canberra needs to be a place of light, not a place of darkness,' he told his party members. If the 41-year-old wins the election, he would be required to take up his Senate seat on July 1, 2014. WikiLeaks Party national council member . Sam Castro said that if Assange wins a seat but cannot return to . Australia by then, the party can choose a replacement. But she said the onus is on the .

A spiritualist who believed life is controlled by Mother Nature died after he was struck by lightning while kayaking in the sea. Keith Kirkum, 59, was out on the open water when he was caught in a freak thunderstorm. When his body was found washed up on shore the following day it was at first assumed he had drowned. But a post mortem examination revealed he had died from a heart attack caused by an electric shock. His partner, Charlotte Kelly, 61, yesterday described how she was still trying to come to terms with the  manner of his death. She said: 'This was such an unusual way to die, I just couldn’t believe it. I’m numb. 'He believed in the bigger picture – Mother Nature and the great beyond. I suppose you could say there is a sad irony in the way he died' Mr Kirkum was described as a 'spiritual atheist' who began investigating various philosophies in his 20s. He met Miss Kelly 20 years ago and they worked together at home in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, on a website that sold books specialising in 'mind, body and spirit'.

Snow on ancient Mars is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there, American scientists have said. Researchers at Brown University have shown that some Martian valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes. The findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient Mars bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere. Researchers at Brown University have shown that some Martian valleys (pictured) appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes . Scientists studied four different locations on Mars that they suspected had water-carved valleys, caused by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges. The new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere. Kat Scanlon, a geological sciences graduate student at Brown, led the research and is well-acquainted with the orographic effect. She did graduate work in meteorology in Hawaii, which is home to a quintessential orographic pattern. Moist tropical winds from the east are pushed upward when they hit the mountains of Hawaii's big island. The winds lack the kinetic energy to reach the mountain summit, so they dump their moisture on the eastern side of the island, making parts of it a tropical jungle. The findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient Mars bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere. Nasa's Mars Curiosity rover (pictured) found evidence of 'drinkable' water in clay minerals in Gale crater, in March . The western side, in contrast, is nearly a desert because it sits in a rain shadow cast by the mountain peak. Ms Scanlon thought similar orographic patterns might have been at play on early Mars and that the valley networks might be an indicator. 'That's what immediately came to mind in trying to figure out if these valleys on Mars are precipitation related,' she said. The scientists started by identifying four Martian locations where valley networks were found along tall mountain ridges or raised crater rims. To establish the direction of the prevailing winds at each location, the researchers used a newly developed general circulation model (GCM) for Mars. The model simulated air movement based on the gas composition scientists think was present in the early Mars atmosphere. The team then used a model of orographic precipitation to determine where, given the prevailing winds from the GCM, precipitation would be likely to fall in each of the study areas. The new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere. A photo of the red planet, taken by the Curiosity rover is pictured . The simulations showed that precipitation would have been heaviest at the heads of the densest valley networks. Ms Scanlon said: 'Their drainage density varies in the way you would expect from the complex response of precipitation to topography. We were able to confirm that in a pretty solid way.' The atmospheric parameters used in the GCM are based on other models that predict a cold climate on the red planet, so the precipitation modeled in this study was snow. However, the researchers said that the snow could have been melted by episodic warming conditions to form the valley networks and therefore it could also have rained on ancient Mars. Ms Scanlon said: 'The next step is to do some snowmelt modeling. 'The question is how fast can you melt a giant snowbank. Do you need rain? Is it even possible to get enough discharge [to carve the valleys] with just the snowmelt?' The answers to these questions could provide an insight into the climate on Mars billions of years ago.","American scientists have shown some Martian valleys appear to have been caused by snow when winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges .

The idea is to reflect sunlight in a bid to block infrared radiation, which some scientists think could stop temperatures rising. There has been much speculation over the years as to whether the U.S. government is interested in geoengineering and has set its sights on manipulating the weather, according to The Independent. Weather manipulation is a particularly contentious in the U.S. after commentators have claimed that huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as Oklahoma (pictured), were actually deliberately made by the US government using the Harrp antenna in Alaska .

A better fit: Major Sequana Robinson models a new women's combat uniform that is now being rolled out to all Army bases in the U.S. A new combat uniform specially designed to fit the female body is now available in the U.S. army, almost a month after it was announced that all military jobs would be open to women by 2016. The début of the Combat Uniform-Alternate is the first in a series of moves the Army hopes to make in the next three years to help fully integrate female soldiers. With narrower shoulders, a slightly tapered waist and a more spacious seat, the unisex clothing line has been in the works since 2009. It is now being issued to all the Army's installations - except for Fort Benning in Columbus, Georgia - for women and also men with a smaller or more slender body. Unlike the decades-old Army combat uniform, which comes in 36 sizes and was designed principally by men for men, the alternate clothing line was created to fit a broader range of body types, officials say. The trousers feature wider areas at the hips, waist and backside; elastic around the waistband instead of pull string; adjusted pockets and knee-pad inserts; and a shortened rise in pants. The jackets include adjusted rank and name tape positioning, adjusted pockets and elbow-pad inserts, slimmer shoulders, a thinner and more fitted waist, and a longer and wider coat bottom. Also, buttons are replacing the fabric fastener pockets. According to a 2008 Army focus group report, 'unisex' combat uniforms designed for men fit many women badly in the shoulders, bust, hips and crotch. These deficiencies left many buying sizes that were too large. The Army designed a solution and had 400 active-duty and 200 National Guard and Reserve female soldiers fit-test the line in 2011. Eighty-six percent said the coat fitted better and 71 per cent said the trousers fitted better, said Major Laverne Stanley, the assistant product manager of soldier clothing and individual equipment. 'An overwhelming majority, 94 per cent of all respondents, said that the cut of the new ACU-A allowed them to present a better military appearance,' she said. Roughly one in every six U.S. soldiers . is a woman and, last month, the Army announced that the ratio likely . will increase by early 2014, when the service will continue its efforts . to open all closed units and military occupational specialities to . women. In 2012, the Army . opened 14,000 positions in closed units to female soldiers, and this . year, senior leadership has signalled its intent to open an additional . 6,000 infantry, armour and field artillery positions before accepting . female applicants into reconnaissance, surveillance, and targeting and . acquisition battalions.

'Remarkable recovery': Mia, pictured with mother Natasha on the beach, recovered well from the nightmare of 2006 which left her with a broken arm . Poignant: Natasha and her family always celebrate Liam's birthday by releasing balloons out over the sea. He would have been 13 this year . Now, his ex-wife Natasha, 41, is living in Queensland, Australia, with Mia, now nine, and her new husband Richard with whom she has a three year-old son Reuben. Today, she has revealed how her daughter has made a remarkable recovery from the nightmare of 2006 which left her with a broken arm. She said: 'At the time she had a vivid memory of what her father had done to her. She would say ""Daddy shouted at you, threw all the clothes and then pushed me in the mud"". 'It was so much for a little one to bear.' Family: John Hogan pictured with Natasha and their two children Liam and Mia before the tragedy in Crete where Hogan threw Liam to his death from a hotel balcony . Scene: The tragic incident happened at the four-star Petra Mare hotel, in Lerapetra, Crete . Holiday destination: The couple were on a make or break holiday at the hotel on the island of Crete when the incident happened . 'Mia is loving life and excelling at school. She is a happy and well-balanced child, which is somewhat of a miracle.' Hogan and Natasha, who lived in Bristol, were on a make-or-break holiday with their two children as their marriage foundered. Hogan returned to the UK in June 2009 for psychiatric care. Since 2011 he has been receiving treatment under the Mental Heath Act at a psychiatric unit. Grief: Liam's mother Natasha has revealed she always celebrates Liam's birthday, releasing balloons into the ocean every year . In 2010 he was pictured out shopping in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, while still living in care. Natasha said: 'We always celebrate Liam’s birthday - he would have been 13 this year - and release balloons out to the ocean.' She added: 'I hear nothing of John Hogan, nor do I wish to. I am not in contact with his family though they are kind enough to send Mia cards, gifts and letters. 'It is a beautiful place here, good for the soul, and has been the turnaround point in Mia and I being able to get our lives back. 'New surroundings have brought new memories which are non-painful.' Natasha spoke of her new life Down Under as she raises money for the Winston’s Wish charity which helped her and Mia recover. She said: 'The only reason for me getting out of my bed in the morning was Mia, and Winston’s Wish had the tools to give me strategies in which to carry on. 'They saved my life and strategies given to me to survive the mental torture are still being used today. 'They gave me strategies to enable my two-and-a-half-year-old, Mia, to comprehend where her brother and father had suddenly gone. 'They prepared me for the future and helped me to understand that children have different stages of grief depending on their age, due to their cognitive development. 'I am loving life on the Sunshine Coast and continue to use strategies that were given to me when Winston’s Wish counselled me in the early days following Liam’s death.' On August 25, Natasha and Richard, 47, will be running in a half-marathon close to their Queensland home. In 2011, Avon coroner Maria Voisin ruled that Hogan was not been mentally ill at the time of the tragedy in August 2006. On trial: John Hogan pictured arriving at court during his trial over the death of his son Liam on the island of Crete . Grief: John Hogan pictured in tears arriving for his second court appearance on the island of Crete . It was the second time a coroner had ruled Liam was unlawfully killed. Ms Voisin’s predecessor, Paul Forrest, recorded the same verdict at the end of the original inquest in 2008. The . initial verdict was overturned by the High Court in 2009 because Mr . Forrest had not addressed properly Mr Hogan’s mental state. He was also set free by an Athens court in 2009 after almost three years in a Greek jail and psychiatric hospital. An earlier decision to jail him for the unlawful killing of his son was overturned when it was accepted that he had been temporarily insane at the time. A Greek jury concluded he had suffered an 'earthquake of insanity' as he pushed Liam to his death and then leapt with Mia. New life: Natasha is now happily married to new husband Richard, left.

The awkward job of transporting a canoe could soon be a thing of the past after an inventor has designed one that can be packed down to the size of a suitcase. Called a Stakanoo, the boat is made of three sections that slot together in less than a minute to create the 7.6ft vessel. These sections can then be separated and packed inside each other to make the 19kg boat fully portable so that it fits in the boot of a car with one seat folded down, on the backseats or stored in a cupboard at home. A keen canoeist and inventor from Somerset has designed a portable kayak. The Stakanoo, pictured, is made of three sections that slot together and can be stacked together to fit into the back of a car or stored in a cupboard . When packed away, the Stakanoo can fit comfortably into a car boot, pictured left, as well as sit across the backseat, right. The boat only weighs 19kg which means it can be carried and assembled by a single person in around 60 seconds without the need for any specialist tools . Last year two design students from London created a foldable boat based on the ones created using origami. The full-size vessel is folded from a 8ft by 5ft piece of plastic and can be . transformed from a flat sheet to a rowing boat by a single person in two . minutes using only three components. Another model of the £800 'Foldboat' can be folded up and carried in a backpack . The single sheet of plastic can be folded over and . over again up to 6,000 times and comes in two designs - one . that folds into an easy-to-carry parcel and one that unfolds completely . flat. The Stakanoo is the brain child of keen canoeist and inventor Stuart Woodward from Bath, Somerset. Woodward designed the vessel as a solution to motorists stacking canoes and kayaks onto the roof of their cars. He wanted to design a canoe that could be packed into the boot of a car to negate the need for . a roof rack. This in turn boosts fuel efficiency because there is less drag created as the car drives on a motorway. The Stakanoo is made up of three slottable compartments - the tip of the bow connects to a section containing the seat and the midship, which then slots into the stern. These sections have been designed in such a way so that they fit inside one another. Woodward claims it only takes 60 seconds to assemble the Stakanoo and less time to fold it down. And because the sections slot together, this can be done single-handedly without any tools. When the three sections are fitted together the full length of the Stakanoo is 7.6ft long and 2.25ft wide. This series of images shows how the three slottable sections of the Stakanoo fit together to form the 19kg portable boat, pictured top. These sections can then be unpacked and fitted together to form the 7.6ft vessel, pictured bottom, with the seat added . When it is packed away, the boat can be carried by one person and weighs 19kg. The 46-year-old inventor started on . the design in September last year following his trip to the coast and . completed his first canoe in May. He . has now built two fibreglass Stakanoos, which are on sale with Bristol Boats in . Saltford, and has a patent pending. Woodward is then hoping to liaise with a canoe manufacturer and he has two more variants designed in a longer, more traditional canoe shape with splashdecks fitted, which he hopes to make in the future. The Stakanoo is the brain child of 46-year-old Stuart Woodward, pictured in his invention, from Bath, Somerset. Woodward wanted to design a portable alternative to roof-mounted canoes . Woodward's Stakanoo costs £465. Only two models are currently available in Bristol but the inventor plans to sell them across the country soon . He said: 'I was in Cornwall last year . and saw lots of canoes being transported on the roofs of cars, and . thought there must be a better way of doing that. 'I started designing a take-apart . sectional canoe, that stacks inside itself, taking up no more room than a . large suitcase to make transport easier. 'It fits in the car, so the car has maximum fuel economy on motorways. 'It's also much safer as it can't fall off the roof and it is easy to park in car parks as there is nothing overhanging. 'It is easy to store when at home - you can place it under the stairs, in the garage or shed, in the loft.' 'After two designs were not what I wanted, I found a way of making the sections slot together with no bolts, straps or tools. 'I have taken it out on the river extensively and it paddles very well and turns in a tight circle. It is a fun hybrid between a kayak and a canoe and you can you can just pack it up, put into in your boot and away you go.' The Stakanoo costs £465.","The fibreglass boat is called a Stakanoo and costs £465 .

Downing Street has repeatedly stressed that Mr Cameron 'remains in charge' wherever he is in the world. But Mr Clegg has encouraged the idea that senior ministers 'hold the fort' when the PM is taking a break. The two men faced criticism after it emerged they would both be out of the country at the same time.","Couple return to work in London after week-long holiday in Spain .

But when Premier League footballers fly in on their summer tour they cannot go without a haul of luxury goods. New Manchester City signing Jesus Navas showed off his designer wares as he flew off to Munich for the latest leg of his club's round the world pre-season trips. Life of a star: City's new signing Jesus Navas had his bag open as the team jetted on to Munich from Manchester for the next leg of their tour . The Spanish international, who cost £15million, doubled his pay when he signed a contract worth an estimated £80,000 at City. The 27-year-old used to suffer from chronic homesickness which stopped him moving away from his hometown club Seville. However, he was able to overcome the condition to play abroad for his country and won both the World Cup and the European Championships with Spain. Manchester City were in Hong Kong to . take part in a pre-season competition called the Audi Cup. The English . side faced AC Milan, Sao Paulo and Bayern Munich in the competition. Here MailOnline identifies . the items inside and compiles the wallet-busting accessories you need . to fit in as a Premier League star... just thank God there's a cash . machine behind him. 1. Gucci double-zip washbag - £250 . To carry every toiletry a Premier League . star could get his hands on, be it gel to keep the hairdo in place . during the action or aftershave to smell terrific after the match. 2. Beats by Dr Dre - £219No Premier League player worth his salt can be seen without their ludicrously oversized headphones in tow. These top-of-the-range headphones are the audio must-haves, if you're willing to spend big. Even the cheapest Beats by Dr Dre headphones cost nearly £100. The biggest, chunkiest and priciest are a must have for your matchday bag if you are a millionaire Premier League footballer. 3. iPad - from £399Who wants to socialise with team-mates on those long flights when you can get stuck into a bit of Angry Birds on the latest iPad? Kept in a zip compartment in Navas' bag, the Spanish star could have his favourite TV shows from home loaded on to save him from repeats of TOWIE. With just a few hours of training each day, Premier League footballers have a lot of time to kill. 4. Nike Air Max - £119These brand-spanking new shiny trainers are pride of place in Navas' bag, and while they'll cost you a pretty penny, it's a fair bet the Spanish star's boot sponsors were generous enough to chuck him a complimentary pair. Most likely these trainers will just be for casual wear as football clubs carry their players' training and matchday boots and kit. 5. Manchester City training T-Shirt - £16.99Likewise this sky blue training t-shirt, with a big City crest pride of place. Again you'd have to think this was a freebie, compulsory wear from Navas' new club. Unless, of course, large-branded items available for £16.99 from the club shop are de rigueur among Premier league footballers on £100k-plus a week these days. 6. Unidentified furry object - ??

Charges: Children would no longer be able to rack up big bills without their parents knowing under plans unveiled by the government . Mobile phone companies may have to contact customers when their monthly costs exceed £100 under plans to protect families from racking up huge bills. A cap has been proposed after a spate of cases of so-called ‘bill shock’, when children run up internet bills worth thousands of pounds on their parents’ smartphones or iPads. Children can play online games on a mobile phone or buy credits for apps at the touch of a button without the owner of the device being alerted to it. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said yesterday that new laws would force the industry to contact their customers about any suspicious activity before it spiralled out of control. Her department hopes mobile phone providers will monitor their customers’ net usage in the same way as high street banks look out for fraud, and contact them about irregularities such as suddenly spending hours on a premium rate phone line or buying hundreds of credits for an online game. Government sources said a cap of £100 was one of the options. A survey this year found children have cost their parents an estimated £30million in unauthorised app purchases. Five-year-old Danny Kitchen from Bristol made headlines when he racked up a £1,700 bill in just ten minutes while playing the game Zombie v Ninja on his parents’ iPad. Even David Cameron has expressed concerns about how easy it is to run up huge bills. The Prime Minister said: ‘I worry about my children buying things, as happens now with in-app purchases. ‘You’ve set up some football game and the next thing you know you own half of Real Madrid.’ Racked up £600 bill in three hours: Lee Walters, 10, of Streetly, West Midlands, downloaded the 'Hay Day' app on his mother Katharyne William's old iPhone - and paid £19 a time to buy virtual diamonds and gold coins . Costly: Lee Walters innocently clicked on the 'buy now' option which appeared more than 12 times an hour - landing his mother Katharyne, 42, with a giant £613 bill . Ministers will also introduce a £50 cap . on bills for lost and stolen phones, as already exists for some credit . cards. Currently someone whose phone is stolen is liable for all the . thief’s spending, and is vulnerable to scams whereby the thief rings a . premium rate phone line they have set up. A new policy paper states that while . many phone companies text their customers when they incur high roaming . charges abroad, there are many other causes of ‘bill shock’ such as high . data usage, misuse of lost or stolen phones, and unintentional . purchases within apps which are unregulated. It states: ‘With the proliferation of . internet- enabled mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, and an . exponential increase in data consumption, consumers can find themselves . facing bills that far exceed the amounts they expect. We expect mobile . operators to develop and use a consistent approach to limit bill shock. ‘We will encourage them to adopt the measures set out by Ofcom, including: the introduction of text alerts to advise people when they approach their call limit and notification of the costs of making further calls; the promotion  of account management tools to enable customers to track their usage easily; and information about other steps that people can take to help themselves.’ The legislation will also introduce tougher penalties for nuisance callers, and make it clearer to the public how they can opt out of unwanted calls from marketing firms, after an explosion of calls about payment protection insurance. Mrs Miller said: ‘The communications industry has undergone change at  an unprecedented pace over the last decade. In this digital age we must ensure the needs of the consumer are not lost in the dash for progress . . . the Government will ensure consumers are protected from potentially harmful content, soaring costs and contracts that don’t meet their needs.’ Costly mistake: Lee Neale, 43, faced a £4,000 bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing 'free' games on his iPad . Angry Birds, pictured, was one of the games featured in a lawsuit in America over children running up huge bills on 'free' games . Customers who accidentally rack up huge bills on iTunes do not have an automatic right to a refund. But . Apple announced earlier this year that it will pay out £66million in . compensation to parents in the U.S. whose children ran up massive bills . using its free apps. Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents' credit cards. Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. A number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children. These 'bait apps' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game. When children purchase 'currency', their parent's iTunes account gets automatically charged. Apple started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 2011. But many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills. A . US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania . who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly . addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million). The . case involves games such as Angry Birds, pictured above, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil . Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads . on tablets such as Apple's iPad. But . the company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK . and any refunds are currently given on a case-by-case basis. The . Restrictions menu in Apple's iOS software lets you control in-app . purchases, and can even be used to stop children downloading apps . entirely. Parents can set a password for in-app purchases or turn them off altogether. It's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age-restricted content. To prevent in-app purchases in iOS, open 'Settings' then choose 'General' and 'Restrictions'. Then tap 'Enable Restrictions', choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm. Now you can set restrictions from the menu below. In the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off' to stop children's ability to run up bills.","Mobile firms could be forced to contact billpayers when charges start rising .

The parents of a war hero killed in Afghanistan have spoken of their disgust after his widow sold a medal honouring his sacrifice. Fusilier Simon Annis’s young wife Caroline, 26, listed the Elizabeth Cross on the online noticeboard Gumtree for just £500. The medal, which recognises the loss borne by Service families, was awarded to her after her 22-year-old husband died in an explosion in Afghanistan. 'Callous': Fusilier Simon Annis' wife Caroline sold his Elizabeth Cross over the internet for £500 . 'Insulting': Fusilier Annis' morther Ann said she would have re-mortgaged her house to get her son's medal back . But Fusilier Annis’s devastated parents have criticised their daughter-in-law for not offering it to them before selling it. Pete and Ann Annis have now paid the new owner £1,757 – more than three times the initial listing – to retrieve the medal. They only found out that the Cross had been put up for sale when a friend spotted an  advertisement online. Mrs Annis, 49, last night branded her daughter-in-law as ‘callous’ and ‘despicable’. She said: ‘It’s as if my boy’s life meant nothing to her. ‘It was terribly insulting that she didn’t offer us the medal instead of sneakily selling it.’ Fusilier Annis, from Salford, was serving with the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in the feared Helmand Province. He and his wife had been married for just a few months when he was killed on his six-month tour of duty. Along with comrade Fusilier Louis Carter, 18, he died on August 16 in 2009, trying to save their  severely wounded commander, Lance Corporal Jamie Fullarton, 24. The soldiers had been advancing into Sangin, a Taliban outpost dubbed the most dangerous place  on earth. During the mission,  L/Cpl Fullarton triggered a bomb, badly injuring himself and three others. Fusiliers Annis and Carter rushed forward to help the wounded. As they carried their commander away on a stretcher, they set off a second blast – killing them both. L/Cpl Fullarton later died of his wounds. Paying tribute to her husband following his death Caroline Annis described Simon as the ‘perfect husband, son and brother’. ‘He will be sorely missed by all of us,’ she said at the time. ‘He was a true hero who made all of . us so very proud and he will always have a place in our hearts. We will . love and miss him always.’ Sacrifice: The Elizabeth Cross was presented to Fusilier Simon Annis' bride Caroline after he was killed in an explosion in Helmand in 2009 (file picture) But four years after Fusilier Annis’s premature death, his young widow – who had fallen out with the soldier’s family and is now in a new relationship – advertised the Elizabeth Cross on the internet.

In A final humiliation, Vicky Pryce was yesterday stripped of her official honour, the Companion of the Order of the Bath. Pryce was jailed earlier this year for taking speeding points for her ex-husband Chris Huhne and yesterday lost the honour, earned for her services as an economist. The former senior civil servant, who split from the Lib Dem Cabinet minister after he had an affair with press officer Carina Trimingham. was sentenced to eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice, but served just two. Going, going gong: Economist Vicky Pryce, who wore an electronic tag to give evidence to a House of Lords committee this month, has been stripped of her CB . An announcement published in the . London Gazette read: ‘The Queen has directed that the appointment of . Vicky, Mrs Pryce, to be a Member of the Civil Division of the Third . Class, or Companion, of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, dated . June 13, 2009, shall be cancelled and annulled and that her name shall . be erased from the Register of the said Order.’ The decision came after Labour MP . Andrew Gwynne wrote to David Cameron, saying that ‘convicted criminals . should not be allowed to hold honours bestowed in good faith by HM the . Queen’. Disgraced: Former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne was also jailed along with ex-wife Pryce after they falsely told police she had been driving when his car was caught by a speed camera, so that he could avoid a driving ban . He demanded the Prime Minister call a . meeting of the honours forfeiture committee to consider the case for . stripping the economist of her honour. He wrote: ‘I have no doubt that the . vast majority of the public will find it profoundly unacceptable that a . convicted criminal with such disregard for British justice continues to . hold such an illustrious honour.’ After her release from prison, Pryce . appeared before a parliamentary committee wearing an electronic tag to . answer questions on the economic crisis in Europe. She is currently writing a book entitled Prisonomics, about women and the criminal justice system. Anyone who has been sentenced to . three months prison or more can have their honour cancelled at the . discretion of the forfeiture committee, which is led by the country’s . top civil servant, Sir Bob Kerslake. Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former . Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, was stripped of his knighthood . after taxpayers were forced to bail out his bank. It had been given for . services to the financial services industry, which was on the brink of . collapse.

A cinema that had to be pulled down when people living nearby realised it was in the wrong place could be demolished for a second time. The £8million development in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, was originally built 75cm out of place and builders were ordered to pull it down and start again. However, as work got underway for a second time, people living nearby carried out their own measurements and discovered it was too close to their homes. Third time lucky: The 32,000sq ft complex may have to be pulled down for a second time after locals realised it was slightly out of place . Artist's impression: The new development, which local residents have campaigned for for years, will house a six-screen Cineworld and four restaurants, three flats, a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes . Developers Turnstone Estates and architects January Consultants have now submitted a fresh planning application in the hope the building will be allowed to remain where it is. Chris Goldsmith, managing director at Turnstone Estates, insisted the latest error was 'imperceptible' and hoped the new application will appease locals. He said: 'It’s all to do with regularising the building. It’s imperceptible really. 'But given the building being under such high scrutiny we thought we should regularise it. Developers had erected the steel frame and begun building the brickwork for the cinema complex, before local people established it was in the wrong position . Work has got well under way; the decision to pull it down for a second time is in the hands of the local council . 'We know that there are a few people locally who are very concerned so we are doing whatever we can to put their minds at rest.' Huntingdonshire District Council is expected to rule on the issue next month. The first time it was built, it was 75cm out of place. Paul Halfpenny, of Britannia Construction, said it was down to an 'error in design information provided to us by our lead design consultant'. The cinema complex was due to open in September, but the completion date was pushed back by four months after the decision was made to first pull down the development. This time the 32,000 sq ft frame is 30cm too far west and 20cm too far north, according to people living next door. With the decision on whether to pull it down a second time in the hands of the council, it is now not known when the centre will open. Residents measured the building themselves and found it was 30cm too far west and 20 cm too far north . The location of the building is so sensitive because of its proximity to existing houses . Residents and town councillors in St Neots have been campaigning for around 10 years to get a cinema built nearby. In 2006 Peter Rowley, a U.S.-based millionaire with links to the town, donated about £1 million for a leisure facility in St Neots. Residents were consulted and in 2007 said they favoured a cinema. The development, which is being built on the site of a former recycling centre, will consist of a six-screen cinema, four restaurants, three flats, a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes. Residents in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, have been campaigning for a cinema since 2006 .","In May the part-built cinema was pulled down for being 75cm out of place .

Mr Indyk thanked President Obama and . Mr Kerry for entrusting him with 'taking this . breakthrough and turning it into a full-fledged Israeli-Palestinian peace . agreement.' 'It is a daunting and humbling challenge, but one that I cannot desist from,' he said. Negotiations have been stalled since the . controversy over Israel approving the settlement-building of 1,300 Jewish settler homes in predominately Arab East Jerusalem in September 2010. They are considered illegal under international law, although the Israelis dispute this.

The two sides confirmed they would meet hours after Israel approved the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners who had been held for up to thirty years - a long-standing demand of President Abbas. 'I . think reasonable compromises have to . be a keystone of all of this effort,' Mr Kerry told reporters as he . acknowledged that the path ahead would be long and difficult. The initial negotiations starting today, mostly over procedure, are expected to continue on Tuesday. The Israeli delegation will be led by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, while chief negotiator Saeb Erekat will represent the Palestinian side. 'I know the negotiations are going to be tough, but I also know that the consequences of not trying could be worse,' Mr Kerry said. Major sticking points will include the future of Israeli settlements on the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees. Secret terms: The framework for the talks that John Kerry has managed to pull together between the Palestinians led by Saeb Erekat, left, and the Israelis led by Tzipi Livni, right, have not been made public . Mr Kerry explained that he chose Mr . Indyk because he 'knows what has worked and he knows what hasn't worked, . and he knows how important it is to get this right'. 'He understands that to . ensure that lives are not needlessly lost, we have to ensure that . opportunities are not needlessly lost.' In his new job, Indyk replaces David Hale, who had served as a place holder in the post until last month. British-born Martin Indyk, 62, currently works as foreign policy director at Washington-based  think tank, the Brookings Institution. A former kibbutz volunteer and researcher at the pro-Israeli lobbying group AIPAC, he went on to serve as President Clinton's ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997. Indyk was a significant player in the failed 2000 Camp David talks and he worked with Israeli Prime Ministers Rabin and Barak on Oslo peace process in 1993. His new role follows a series of frustrations. George Mitchell resigned from the post in   2011 following fruitless attempts to get the Israelis and Palestinians to engage. Thus far President Abbas has been reluctant to negotiate with hard-line Israeli leader Mr Netanyahu, fearing he will reject what the Palestinians consider minimal territorial demands. The Palestinians will be heading into the talks seeking a secure state of their own in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in 1967. However, the Palestinians have need to accept the principle of limited land swaps, allowing Israel to annex some of the dozens of settlements it has built on war-won lands since 1967. President Abbas had repeatedly said he will only go to talks if Israel either freezes settlement building or recognises the 1967 lines as a starting point for drawing the border of a Palestinian state. Late last year, the UN General Assembly recognised the State of Palestine within those 1967 borders. Israel has made no such concessions, at least publicly, and the details of the framework for the talks brokered by Mr Kerry remain undisclosed.","Middle East peace talks resume tonight for the first time in three years .

A father has spoken of his grief after seeing his teenage son drown just 10 metres from the shore during a family holiday to France. Kieran Knight disappeared off the coast of Messanges in Aquitaine last week, just moments after his father Kevin suggested that they return to the beach. The death of the 16-year-old, who was a Sunday school leader and wanted to become a teacher, has prompted an outpouring of condolences from friends at his school and church. Mr Knight has warned against the dangers of swimming in the sea, in a bid to prevent other families from suffering the same tragedy. Kieran and his father were swimming in the Atlantic Ocean at a notoriously dangerous spot last Wednesday when the teenager was dragged away by a strong undercurrent. A rescue operation was launched, but the boy could not be saved, and his body was not recovered until three days later. Mr Knight, 48, hopes to use the horrific accident to raise awareness of the danger posed by the sea. He said: 'We were no more than chest deep and no more than 10 metres away from the shore line when I felt we should come out of the sea. I moved forward and looked back and Kieran was gone. 'He was literally two metres away from where I was standing, but the undertow was totally different. 'Kieran was not a strong swimmer - he was an adequate swimmer, but we were not in deep. We both had our feet on the ground. I would never go that far into the sea. 'People need to be aware that the danger can be right there at the water's edge. You could easily think it was safe.' The boy's mother Dawn and sister Tara were both on the beach at the time of the tragedy. He is also survived by his brother Aidan. The family from Newhall in Derbyshire had been holidaying in south-west France to celebrate Kieran finishing his GCSEs. He was set to start at sixth-form college in September, and was planning to become a primary school teacher after leading the Sunday school at Emmanuel Church in Swadlincote, where he was a regular worshipper. Danger: Kieran was holidaying with his family on the south-west coast of France, pictured . 'The church has been a great part of his life, and the support from the church has been huge,' Mr Knight said. 'Kieran was a typical quiet teenage lad. He didn't tell us much about what was going on at school, but we have been overwhelmed by the number of people of his age which have come forward and left messages of condolence. 'He was a much-loved son and will be sorely missed.' Mr Knight praised the local services in France, including police, staff on the campsite where they were staying and the British consulate, saying they had been 'more than wonderful' in the circumstances. A memorial has been set up outside Emmanuel Church and several messages have been left in Kieran's memory. Reverend Graham Rutter said that Kieran's loss would be keenly felt by many members of the church community.","Kieran Knight and his father were swimming off south-west coast of France .

Drug addict Ian McEnroe, 49, targeted boutiques, toy shops, delis and wine merchants in wealthy south Manchester suburbs. He approached stores across Stockport, Didsbury and Chorlton claiming their clothes, bottles, drinking glasses and even toys were dangerous to get refunds and vouchers as compensation. In one scam last October, McEnroe told the owner of Monkey Puzzle toys in Chorlton that his son had cut himself on a shard of glass in a box of Lego. The tale was completely untrue, but he was refunded for the imaginary accident. He also duped staff at Ye Old Cock Inn in Didsbury by telling them his daughter had bitten into an ice cube which contained a piece of glass. Again, he got a refund. Employees at The Cheese Hamlet in Wilmslow Road, Didsbury, refunded McEnroe after he claimed his wife had cut herself on a wine bottle bought from their deli. In several incidents, he stole items from shops and then took them back and demanded a refund. In total he defrauded the businesses of £2,914.

A mother has described how she is living in a 'bad, bad dream' after her daughter was told she would be prosecuted for killing her sibling in a car crash. Angie Stone said the family was already coping with the grief of losing her son, Gregg, 20, a few months earlier after being shot dead in Afghanistan when daughter Jennie, 29, died in the collision. Her third child, Rosie-Ann, 20, was behind the wheel of her own car when Jennie's vehicle hit a tree in Fraisthorpe, West Yorkshire, and she is now facing prosecution. Describing the pain the family has had to cope with already, she said the decision by the CPS was like 'losing another of our babies'. Tragic: Jennie Stone was killed in February when the car she was travelling in hit a tree. Her sister is being prosecuted for the crash and last year, her brother died in Afghanistan . Mrs Stone, 56, said: 'Have our family not lost enough already? It is like being trapped in a bad, bad dream.' She, who said the sisters were extremely close, has vowed to fight the decision 'tooth and nail' and said she cannot mourn properly with a court case hanging over the family. She believes Jennie would be appalled by the CPS’s decision if she was still alive. She said: 'This is not going to achieve anything at all, no good outcome whatsoever. 'Even Jennie’s son Charlie knew Rosie was in the other car and he said to us ""I don’t want anything to happen to you, Rosie. I don’t want you to go to court and get in trouble"". 'There is nothing to be achieved apart from destroying the family even more. I thought the CPS was human. Enough, enough, the family have suffered enough.' A CPS spokeswoman said: 'Rosie-Ann Stone has been reported for summons for driving without due care and causing a fatality. Private Gregg Thomas Stone, from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was the first of the sibling to be killed. He died in Afghanistan on Sunday June 3 2012 when trying to rescue an Afghan policeman . 'We are aware of the incredibly emotive circumstances of this case but must adhere to the Code for Crown Prosecutors which requires our lawyers to consider two things. 'The first is whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Where this is met, and it is in this case, we must consider whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. 'To make this decision we have sought the views of all parties including the Stones’ family and Jennie’s immediate family. 'Taking into account all of the information available to us at this time, we have concluded that it is in the public interest to prosecute Rosie-Ann and have advised Humberside Police to report her for summons.' Jennie, a final-year student at the University of Lincoln’s Hull campus, had been driving a Peugeot 206 towards Bridlington when she was in collision with a Vauxhall Astra, driven by her younger sister Rosie-Ann, before crashing into a tree. She had just dropped her son Charlie, then aged nine, at Skipsea Primary School. Ms Stone says Jennie, pictured, would be mortified at the thought of her sister being prosecuted for the car crash . According to police at the time, both cars were travelling in the same direction and were trying to overtake a truck which was also travelling north. Jennie had moved in with her partner, Dave Parker, just 24 hours before she was killed. Rosie-Ann Stone is expected to appear in court before magistrates in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, next month. Her late brother, Private Stone, of the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was shot dead as he took part in a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman in Helmand Province on June 3 last year. His death left behind wife Sam, who gave birth to his daughter Grace after his death. An inquest in May found he had been unlawfully killed.

New figures reveal the proportion of people who report high levels of life satisfaction has risen from 75.9 per cent to 77 per cent. Experts claimed the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations could have helped to life the nation’s spirits. Happier: The proportion of people rating their life satisfaction as 7 or more out of 10 rose from 75.9 per cent to 77 per cent . The data is the latest to emerge from David Cameron’s much-mocked Happiness Index. People are asked to rate their life satisfaction out of 10. While there were rises in happiness between 2011-12 and 2012-13, there was also a fall in the proportion of people rating their anxiety at a higher level of six or more out of 10. It fell from 21.8 per cent to 20.9 per cent. The study says factors influencing ‘personal well-being are complex and will differ from person to person’. But it added: ‘The period of 2012/13 also included several special events in the UK, such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee (in June 2012) which included a special bank holiday and the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic games (July to early September 2012). ‘These events could also have potentially influenced people's assessment of their personal well-being in the 2012/13 period.’ Cheers:  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June last year and British triumphs in the London Olympics, including Mo Farah winning gold in the 5,000 metres, helped lift the nation's spirits . Index: The proportion of people giving ratings of 4 or less out of 10 for happiness fell from 10.9 per cent to 10.3 per cent . The factors most associated with personal well-being are health, employment and relationship status. The data show differences in personal well-being between groups of the population. For example, people aged 45 to 49 rated their life satisfaction lower than any other age group and black people lower than any other ethnic group. There were no significant changes between the years for unemployed people, whose average life satisfaction remained below those in employment. Other non-official sources show an improvement in personal well-being for similar periods. They also show that life satisfaction in the UK changed less between 2007 and 2011 than in other European countries. Worthwhile: Eight out of 10 people gave high ratings when asked: 'Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile? Anxious: The proportion of people rating their anxiety at a low level of 3 or less out of 10 increased from 60.1 per cent to 61.5 per cent . Dawn Snape, ONS head of measuring well-being, said unemployment peaked in autumn 2011 but then decreased steadily throughout most of 2012. She added that job vacancies had remained close to a record low in 2011 but began to rise in early 2012, continuing through to spring this year when it reached its highest since autumn 2008. The ‘rosier’ employment picture could be taken as a sign of ‘optimism’ she said. She added that the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London might have been a factor in boosting happiness. ‘There are other events, obviously, that happened during the course of last year that might also have raised people's spirits, particularly the Queen's Diamond Jubilee with that extra holiday, and we have had the Olympics and Paralympics,’ she said. ‘All of those could potentially have influenced people's assessment of how well their life is going and how they feel overall and generally raise their spirits.’","Proportion of people with high life satisfaction rises from 75.9% to 77% .

The real culprit behind heart attacks and strokes is stem cells, researchers have claimed in a landmark study that could revolutionise treatment. Until now, scientists thought vascular health problems were triggered by smooth muscle cells. Now a team from the University of California in Berkeley have found a previously unknown stem cell, which causes the arteries to harden when it multiplies. Real hope: The cells can multiply and cause arteries to harden, blocking the blood's route to the heart or brain . The groundbreaking work is set to completely change how heart attacks and strokes are treated, dramatically cutting the number of deaths, according the study published today in the journal Nature Communications. Heart attacks are the most common reason for people to need emergency treatment. Around 90,000 people in Britain have one each year - of whom around a third will die as a result. More than 150,000 people a year have a stroke and it is the third largest cause of death after heart disease and cancer. Strokes occur when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, while heart attacks happen when the supply of blood to the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. Landmark moment: The discovery of the new type of stem cell could dramatically cut the number of deaths from strokes and heart attacks . 'For the first time, we are showing . evidence that vascular diseases are actually a kind of stem cell . disease,' said Professor Song Li, from the university. The build-up of artery-blocking plaque . results from the body’s immune response to vessel damage. Vessel damage is caused by . low-density lipoproteins - the 'bad' cholesterol many people try to . eliminate from their diets. It attracts white blood cells, . causing the formation of fibrous scar tissue, which narrows the blood flow. The scar tissue has certain characteristics of . smooth muscle, the main type of tissue found in the blood vessel wall, but it is actually dormant stem cells that are activated and multiply. 'This work should revolutionise . therapies for vascular diseases because we now know that stem cells . rather than smooth muscle cells are the correct therapeutic target.' 'This is groundbreaking and provocative work, as it challenges existing dogma,' added his colleague Dr Deepak Srivastava. The newly discovered vascular stem cells . are multipotent - or capable of changing into various cell types, including smooth muscle, nerve, cartilage, bone and fat . cells - explaining why previous studies misidentified the cells involved . in vessel clogs. 'In the later stages of vascular . disease, the soft vessels become hardened and more brittle,' said . Professor Li. 'Previously, there was controversy about how soft tissue . would become hard. The ability of stem cells to form bone or cartilage . could explain this calcification of the blood vessels.'","Scientists previously thought heart attacks and strokes were caused by smooth muscle cells .

After posing for the cameras as he joined commuters on board a river boat yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister was back on terra firma this morning, ferried to work in the back of his ministerial limo. Unfortunately for the Lib Dem leader, a photographer was also on hand to picture the moment an aide held the car door open for him outside his home in Putney. In the back: Nick Clegg climbs into his government car today, in stark contrast to his trip down the Thames wife wife Miriam yesterday . On firm ground: The Deputy Prime Minister opted for a more traditional route to Whitehall this morning . With David Cameron still on his holidays in Portugal, Mr Clegg is the most senior minister in Whitehall. Keen to get his time in charge of the country off to a flying start, yesterday he took to the water with wife Miriam, with the couple see gazing into . each other’s eyes while other commuters paid little attention to the . fact the Deputy Prime Minister was on board. But luckily a photographer just happened to be there . to record the ‘impromptu’ trip as the couple drank coffee and exchange loving glances. At least in his open-neck shirt and . expensive suit, Nick Clegg looked more at ease than David Cameron did on . Friday as he attempted the casual look on holiday in Portugal with wife . Samantha. The Deputy Prime Minister and his wife Miriam, a lawyer, were returning to work yesterday after their own break in Spain. Nailing it: Mr Clegg later tried his hand at hammering a tac into a sofa during a visit to to Forest Sofa Ltd In Salford. Cheer up: The Lib Dem leader looked glum - maybe thinking about his fun boat ride yesterday . It . was the first time Mr Clegg has used the river bus for the half-hour . commute from his home in Putney, South-West London, to his Westminster . office. But his ministerial . car still had to make the trip, to carry paperwork for the Liberal . Democrat leader, who, Downing Street insists, is not running things as . Mr Cameron ‘remains in charge’ – even on holiday. Tomorrow Mr Clegg is expected to host the second of his new monthly . press conferences, taking questions from journalists on any topic. All smiles: Nick Clegg and wife Miriam Durantez Gonzalez gaze at each other during a half hour boat trip to work this morning . Bored boaters: Other commuters paid little attention to the Deputy PM as they travelled from Putney to Westminster . Lonely at the top: With David Cameron still on holiday in Portugal, Mr Clegg is the most senior government minister in Westminster . By . contrast Mr Cameron has faced criticism for not holding the 'take . all-comers' press conferences which became routine under Tony Blair and . Gordon Brown. As millions of people battled through . traffic jams or the crush on trains and buses, Mr Clegg looked relaxed . as he boarded the boat from his family home in Putney to Westminster. During . the half hour river journey the Cleggs enjoyed coffee from Costa – . notably snubbing Starbucks which has faced criticism for its low tax . bill in Britain. Stepping out: The Cleggs were seen walking in the sunshine this morning while other commuters braved traffic jams and over-heated public transport . Rested: The couple have just returned from a week in Spain, where Miriam's family are from . Downing Street has repeatedly stressed that Mr Cameron 'remains in charge' wherever he is in the world. But Mr Clegg has encouraged the idea that senior ministers 'hold the fort' when the PM is taking a break. The two men faced criticism after it emerged they would both be out of the country at the same time .","Lib Dem leader climbs into government car - while an aide held the door .

A university lecturer has apologised to the parents of a 15-year-old girl who died after taking ecstasy tablets he'd left stashed in his home during an unsupervised party. Isobel Jones-Reilly, known as Issy, took two or three pills at the party at a west . London townhouse owned by university lecturer Brian Dodgeon on Easter Saturday in April . 2011. A group of young partygoers found a secret drugs stash - including ecstasy, LSD and ketamine - hidden by the academic, who was a lecturer at the Institute of Education at the time, in a whisky container in a wardrobe cupboard in his bedroom. Mr Dodgeon today broke down in tears as he apologised to the parents of Isobel for leaving the drugs in the house - claiming he didn't believe he was being irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised as there was a '0.1 per cent' chance of his illegal narcotics being found. Tragedy: Isobel Reilly, 15, pictured left, died in April 2011 after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the home of Brian Dodgeon, pictured right leaving the hearing, and Angela Hadjipateras . Cleared: Brian Dodgeon, pictured with partner Angela Hadjipateras, was given an eight month suspended sentence for drug possession after Isabel's death. The couple have been told they will not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter . At an inquest into her death, he turned to Isobel's parents in the front row and said: 'I am so sorry about what happened. 'All I can say was at the time I didn't feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised.' His voice cracked and he wiped away a . tear as he added: 'In retrospect, I very much regret I had drugs at all . and I made that decision.' But Dodgeon refused to accept it was . 'blindingly obvious' he should not have left his house unsupervised to . attend another party in Hastings with his partner Angela Hadjipateras that night. He said: 'At the time, it didn't seem . likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start . systematically looking through the drawers. 'There was a 0.1 per cent chance of . anyone finding those drugs, there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that . someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes . a fire and people die.' Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where he kept drugs but insisted they would be 'virtually impossible' for the teenagers to find . Addressing Mr Dodgeon, Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox . said: 'Isn't it blindingly obvious 14 to 15-year-olds are very likely . to take the opportunity to misbehave and to really push the boundaries, . and you should not have left them unsupervised.' Dodgeon said the teenagers usually . invited to his home for parties did not appear to be big drinkers, and . the idea they were look for his drug stash never occurred to him. 'I had never had the experience of our bedroom being used by anyone but Angela and myself', he said. 'At none of the other parties had . anyone gone into our bedroom, even a party that was unsupervised until . 3am - it was a no go area.' He added: 'I didn't think that people . would go through our drawers in our bedroom, I didn't think anyone . would go into our bedroom at all. 'You would have to go through 15 drawers before exhausting all the convenient drawers to look through.' The inquest has heard at previous . parties at his home, a teenage girl had to be put to bed for being too . drunk and there had been cannabis smoking. But Mr Dodgeon said: 'There had never . been evidence of drug taking and never serious problems with people . getting drunk and being sick, or having to be driven home. 'It seemed to me from parties that we had supervised, people would sneak in very small beers or cider.' The lecturer said the teenagers . appeared to be 'polite and studious', adding: 'At that time, I felt that . party was going to be safe. 'I felt it was important to occasionally demonstrate a degree of trust to that generation of kids, I felt it would show trust. 'I really did not think that people would search the bedroom.' Untimely death: Flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets . Mr Dodgeon previously admitted four counts of . drugs possession when he appeared in court after Issy’s death and was . sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years in December . 2011. The  lecturer . was today told at the hearing . he would not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter over the . pills being 'readily accessible'. Dr Wilcox said: 'It has been decided there are no further prosecutions that can be brought.' Dodgeon's partner Angela Hadjipateras told the inquest she believed his drug stash was 'virtually impossible' for the . partying teenagers to find. Ms Hadjipateras admitted she knew her . partner of 27 years was a recreational drug user, but she did not want . to know where they were hidden in the house. She . told the inquest Dodgeon regularly smoked marijuana or hash cannabis, . and was aware he had taken LSD and ecstasy in the past. Dudgeon only confessed where his drug . stash was hidden, inside a whisky bottle in the bedroom closet, when . they drove back from Hastings following Isobel's death. 'I knew he had hash and marijuana, . and that that had, I can't remember dates, but I know I had asked him if . he had any ecstasy or other drugs', she said. Mourning: Friends and family release balloons in memory of the schoolgirl whose temperature soared to 41.7C after taking the drugs . 'If he had anything in his possession, he said I wouldn't have to worry about it, they would be very well concealed.' Ms Hadjipateras said Dodgeon moved . his whisky tin of drugs to different places round the house, often . picking hiding places which were 'high up'. She said she had 'deduced' he would . have drugs in the house because she knew he used them, but added: 'I . chose not to find out where it was.' She told the inquest: 'On the way home from Hastings, he told me. He told me that there were drugs hidden in the top cupboard. 'It was in the early stages, before . we knew what had happened, and he said it was virtually impossible it . could have been drugs in the house that would have been the ones. 'He said we couldn't have any problems with any of the kids finding them. 'He told me he had them right at the back of the cupboard, they were in our bedroom in the top cupboard. 'He told me that there was LSD ecstasy, and that there was a very small amount of ketamine.' Asked . by the coroner why she had not tried to find the drugs, Ms Hadjipateras . said: 'I believed that Brian is extremely responsible, and that if he . told me they were extremely well hidden, I preferred not to know.' Ms . Hadjipateras admitted 'eight or nine' teenage parties had been held at . their home prior to Isobel's death, although this was the first to be . unsupervised. Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the schoolgirl would 'probably' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell . She had . been forced to help a drunk teenage girl at a previous party, and . accepted it was 'not totally outrageous' that drug taking, drinking, and . underage sex could take place at a party. 'Isn't that why you would generally supervise the parties, because of the risk that something can go wrong?', asked Dr Wilcox. 'Surely . it is absolutely barn door obvious the risk of alcohol, cannabis, and . teenage behaviour is more likely to go up if the party is unsupervised.' Ms Hadjipateras said she had asked a neighbour to be 'on call' during the party in case of emergency. She . added: 'When I weighed up whether it was wise or unwise to go and leave . the kids at the party, I heard the views of a number of people whose . children are the same age, I came to the conclusion it was a manageable . risk.' Shortly after taking the drugs, Issy began hallucinating and frothing at the mouth, the hearing was told. But her friends only called an ambulance when . she collapsed and started shaking - about an hour after she took the . pills. When paramedics arrived at the house . in leafy Kensington, west London, her temperature had soared to 41.7C - . compared to the normal body temperature of 37C, Westminster Coroner's . Court heard. Issy was taken to St Mary's Hospital, but she died later that morning. Professor Robin Braithwaite, a . forensic toxicology expert based at King's College in London, said Issy . could have survived if she had been taken to hospital before her . temperature had risen so dangerously out of control after she took the . drugs. He said: 'That is a very high . temperature. The start of irreversible death is something like 42C, a . temperature of 41C is very high. 'It may have been possible that she . would have survived had help been summoned earlier when her temperature . was not quite so high and she was unwell. 'There are cases reported where hyperthermia can be treated. 'The earlier help is sought, before . the temperature rose to those high levels, it may have been possible had . she been admitted to hospital that treatment could have been given to . try and lower her temperature.' He said even with a temperature of 40C or 41C it is 'possible' she could have survived. The 15 year-old suffered from . suspected hyperthermia, brought on by taking two to three ecstasy . tablets which were of 'high' purity, the inquest heard. Cause of death was given as ingestion of MDMA - the active ingredient in Ecstasy. Two other teenagers, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also took pills at the party and were taken to hospital. The inquest continues.","Isobel Jones-Reilly died after taking up to three pills at unsupervised party .

German authorities have today arrested a 93-year-old alleged former Auschwitz guard on suspicion of accessory to murder. Hans Lipschis, who once lived in the United States, was taken into custody today after prosecutors concluded there was 'compelling evidence' he was involved in crimes at Auschwitz while there from 1941 to 1945. Lipschis admits he served with the Nazi SS in the notorious death camp but claims he was only a cook. About 1.5 million people, primarily Jews, were killed at the camp. Hans Lipschis was taken into custody Monday after prosecutors concluded there was 'compelling evidence' he was involved in crimes at Auschwitz while there from 1941 to 1945 . Lipschis . was deported from the U.S. in 1983 for lying about his Nazi past when . he immigrated to Chicago in the 1950s after the war. Stuttgart prosecutors say a doctor confirmed his health remains good enough for him to be kept in detention. He is expected to be the first person brought to court after investigations were launched by German officials several weeks ago into the Auschwitz guards who escaped scot free after WW2. Lipschis, who was born in Lithuania in 1919 and was granted 'ethnic German' status in 1943, is accused of working at Auschwitz-Birkenau as a member of the S.S. from 1941 to 1945. He is suspected of participating in murder and genocide. Lipschis’ name was added a few weeks ago to a list of wanted Nazi criminals published by Dr Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's office in Israel. Hans Lipschis was born in Lithuania in 1919 and was granted 'ethnic German' status in 1943. This is his ID Card from Auschwitz . Over 1.2 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland during the war. A German newspaper tracked Lipschis down to a retirement home near Stuttgart where he denied the charges. He claimed he knew nothing about the horrors committed at the camp and said he was a 'cook for the entire time I was there.' In the past German prosecutors have relied on eyewitness testimony or paperwork when bringing murder charges against suspected war criminals. But the conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk in 2011 in Munich set a new precedent whereby it was enough for people to have served at a site of mass extermination without specific acts being proved. In 1956 Lipschis fled to the United States and lived in Chicago for 26 years, but was deported to Germany in 1983 after being identified by the U.S. as a Nazi war criminal.","Hans Lipschis was taken into custody on Monday .

A baby bear which was tortured by Ukrainian keepers for the entertainment of tourists at Euro 2012 is on the road to recovery after being rescued by an animal charity. Nastia the adorable five-month-old bear cub had been illegally sold by Lutsk zoo to animal traders in Vinnytsia, Ukraine and made to perform. Heartbreaking images showed the young bear being grabbed by the neck and shoved into a tiny box, as her mother frantically paced her cage unable to intervene. Scroll down for video .

Rescue: Dr Amil Khalil, from Four Paws animal charity, carries Nastia away from the zoo after the company worked with Ukrainian authorities to rescue her . Reunited: Vets hope Nastia will be able to see her mother again in the next few days . Campaigners from animal charity Four Paws had released the distressing footage in the hope of getting the zoo to reunite baby bear and mother. While the youngster is screaming, the mother bear was shown racing around the cage and throwing herself at the metal mesh in a bid to get back to her cub. The cub is then pushed down into a wooden box still shrieking - and it is nailed shut with a wire cover. But since the footage was filmed, Four Paws have enlisted the help of Ukrainian authorities and have managed to free Nastia.

Companies and individuals outside of the media industry are being investigated as part of a criminal investigation into hacking, Scotland Yard has confirmed. However, the Metropolitan Police said it does not 'recognise' reports that it holds a list of 200 private detective clients that directly feature in ongoing criminal investigations. A statement from the police force was released as pressure mounts on the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and MPs to release the names of hundreds of companies and individuals who may have used rogue private investigators to steal personal information. Private eyes: Scotland Yard has confirmed companies and individuals outside of the media industry are linked to illicit hacking . However, Scotland Yard said it 'will not . risk prejudicing future potential prosecutions or compromising our . responsibilities as a public authority and data controller by releasing . details of individuals or companies where there is no intelligence or . evidence that they were associated with the criminal conduct of a . private investigator they had employed'. Last week, officers gave MPs a list of 102 firms and individuals – including a global celebrity and FTSE 100 firm – who hired detective agencies accused of hacking, blagging and stealing private information. But the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) has now admitted it is holding a further list of 200 clients that was not turned over to the Home Affairs Select Committee. The news means the use of corrupt investigators by law firms, banks, insurance companies and celebrities in the so-called ‘hidden’ hacking scandal is far more serious than was thought. Yesterday investigative news agency Exaro said it had seen the list, and revealed HM Revenue & Customs, BT and British Gas were all targeted by private investigators. It included obtaining details of income and tax paid by individuals, as well as bank account details of British Gas customers and whether phone lines were linked to specific addresses from BT. It total more than 300 companies and individuals could be involved in so-called ‘blue chip’ hacking where private data may have been gathered illegally by private snoops. Later this week Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce that private investigators will be regulated for the first time. Customer records: Details of BT customers' phone lines and bank accounts of British Gas customers were obtained by rogue investigators . Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, has now written to the chief executives of various regulators to ask for clarification on what guidelines, if any, they issue to organisations in their industry on the use of private investigators. He said: ‘The context in which the companies implicated by Soca's information have acted is crucial for us to understand their motives. ‘By understanding whether an organisation has conducted their business within their regulator's guidelines gives a clear indication of their ethical standpoint. ‘Without the names the public are currently left impotent in their judgment. It is important we try to gain as much assurance as possible on their behalf.’ Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce a crackdown on rogue investigators later this week . The list of regulators contacted includes the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), The Law Society, ICAEW, Security Industry Association (SIA), Office of Fair Trading, BVRLA, Office of Rail Regulation and Financial Conduct Authority. The Soca report released today in an unredacted form appears to suggest much of the information accessed unlawfully by private detectives was done so for some of Britain's most high-profile businesses. HMRC, BT and British Gas are now revealed as some of the victims. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We take the protection of customer data extremely seriously so we constantly review our processes and procedures in light of developments in the e-security world, together with the expert technical and strategic advice we receive from our advisors and in-house teams. For reasons you will understand we cannot go into more detail.’ A spokesman for BT said: ‘BT takes its responsibility to protect customer data very seriously and will not tolerate misuse of its systems or inappropriate or unauthorised access. ‘For this reason, BT ensures that user access can be tracked so that any misuse may be detected, and offenders can be dealt with appropriately.’ A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘We expect law enforcement agencies to take tough action against criminal behaviour wherever it is identified. ‘Ministers will shortly be announcing plans to regulate private investigators.’","Police confirm businesses also under scrutiny over corrupt investigators .

Tragic: Grandmother Joyce Moulson, 84, collapsed and died just a few minutes after vandals bombarded her house in Bradford with rocks . A grandmother died moments after youths pelted her house with stones, an inquest heard today. Joyce Moulson, 84, was at home making dinner for her grandson when a rock broke one of the windows in her front door. She was spotted in her back yard looking 'very annoyed' and searching for a dustpan and brush to clean up the broken glass. Ms Moulson told a neighbour 'some b***** just got my front door window' before collapsing moments later. She was rushed to hospital but died later that evening, an inquest at Bradford Coroner’s Court heard. Forensic pathologist Dr Matt Lyall said she had an underlying hypertensive heart disease which caused her death. But the doctor added that the stress of the vandalism may have lead to her dying. He said in a statement: 'It seems logical to consider the upset and anger caused by the incident was capable of placing increased physiological demands upon her heart. 'Whilst I cannot be certain it seems reasonable to conclude that the stress apparently caused by the incident has probably made some contribution to this woman's death by exacerbating her underlying heart disease, although she could have died suddenly from the heart disease.' Neighbour Philip Mudd said after the stone was thrown he helped her find a shovel to clean up the broken glass and they both went into her house. He said: 'I thought she tripped over the door frame. Then she just went down like a sack of potatoes.' Mr Mudd described her 'fighting', occasionally regaining consciousness, as he and her grandson tried to help until paramedics arrived. He described his neighbour as 'bubbly', adding: 'She would do anything for anyone, never complaining. She was a nice person.' Assistant Deputy Coroner Mary Burke . recorded a narrative verdict, saying: 'Joyce Moulson had developed . significant hypertensive heart disease. Memorial: Floral tributes left on the doorstep of Joyce Moulson's home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, shortly after her death in November last year . 'She collapsed very shortly after a pane of glass at her house had been smashed by youths. She was taken to Bradford Royal infirmary but sadly died there.' The coroner added: 'It cannot be clearly established that there is a definite link between Mrs Moulson's death being caused by what happened. 'The pathologist says it may have made some contribution, but he also says she could have collapsed at any time.' The court also heard from Detective Chief Inspector Simon Atkinson, the Chief Investigating Officer into Mrs Moulson's death. He told how the police had identified four youths who were in the vicinity in Wibsey, Bradford, West Yorkshire, at around 5.30pm on November 27 last year. They were arrested in connection with both the damage to the elderly lady's house and also her death. But they 'weren't able to establish beyond all reasonable doubt proof that would support criminal proceedings' in respect of Mrs Moulson. A 13-year-old youth, who cannot be named, was prosecuted for criminal damage and received a youth rehabilitation order earlier this year.","Joyce Moulson, 84, was making dinner when vandals attacked her home .

Arm heavily strapped in plaster, Helena Silver looks as if she may have been in a particularly nasty accident. But these injuries were the result of an encounter with a tom cat in her bedroom. The library assistant suffered a dozen bite wounds when the animal attacked her as she tried to pull it away from a fight with her own cat. Recovering: Helena Silver spent six days at Southampton General Hospital recovering after a savage attack by a neighbour's cat . Ms Silver was left with multiple bite wounds on her hand and wrist after she intervened to save her own cat Gem. After a couple of days her wrist had swelled to twice the size, right . After the incident she went to . hospital for a tetanus jab but a short while later her hand swelled to . twice its normal size and she had to be admitted for six days. Her arm was put in plaster and she was given an intravenous antibiotic drip amid fears she would develop blood poisoning. Miss Silver’s ordeal began when she . was woken just after midnight by the noise of her own cat Gem being . attacked in her bedroom by the ginger tom. The rival had climbed into . the ground floor room through a top window she had left open because of . the warm weather. She said: ‘I’d been in a really deep . sleep and woke up by the sound of the cats fighting. I pulled Gem away . and the other cat just went for my right hand and sank its teeth in. It . bit down so hard I screamed and then it did it two or three more times . on my hand. ‘I grabbed it by the scruff of the . neck and pulled it off my hand and chucked it straight out of the . window. There was blood all over the carpet and the curtains and I was . in agony.’ Ms Silver's cat, Gem (pictured), was attacked by an unknown neighbour's cat in the middle of the night . The ginger tom cat woke Ms Silver when it crept in her bedroom at night and started to fight with 15-year-old Gem, pictured . Miss Silver, of Southampton, bathed . her wounds in boiled salty water and drove to hospital as a precaution. Doctors warned her cat bites could prove dangerous and told her to . return in 48 hours. Within that time Helena’s hand had ballooned in size and she was in tremendous pain. Doctors immediately admitted her to a ward. She was put on the antibiotic drip and . her right arm was made immobile in a raised position in an attempt to . minimise the risk of any infection spreading. Miss Silver was told doctors might have to operate to clean the deep wounds thoroughly. She said: ‘When they told me I needed to be admitted for surgery I was horrified. ‘I was supposed to be going away for the weekend two hours later – the hotel was booked and paid for. Fortunately Gem escaped without too many injuries, but Ms Silver faced possible surgery to clean out the infected wounds . Before and after: The wounds to Helena Silver's hand after she was attacked by a stray cat, and after treatment for the infection that caused her hand and wrist to swell to twice the size . ‘They told me I could go home if I . wanted to but said there was a risk of septicaemia which could prove . fatal. In the circumstances I wasn’t going to take any chances.’ Miss Silver said she planned to . distribute leaflets around her area warning neighbours about the cat. ‘He’s the evil twin of my cat and he’s attacked my neighbour’s cat too . and left her with a huge vets’ bill. When I went home before being . admitted to hospital it was there sat on my doorstep. ‘I’ve no idea what he’s called, or who owns it, but people need to be told about him. ‘I don’t know whether he came in through my window looking for food or a fight but I wouldn’t like to meet him again.’ Last year Nora Scott, 80, was left . looking like a mugging victim after she was attacked by a neighbour’s . cat in Stoke-on-Trent.

If French is the language of love and English is the language of business, then where does that leave the German vernacular? With its strong consonants and sharp vowels, to many the German tongue can sound a little harsh compared to some of its continental counterparts. Now, a video posted online has demonstrated just how some of the most delicate and demure words in other languages can sound guttural and even angry when spoken in German. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Überraschung': The German word for 'surprise' comes out a little harsh-sounding in the video . 'Avion': The French word for 'aeroplane' meanwhile sounds easier on the ears . Stereotypes: The British language appears to sound inoffensive compared to others . The video, below, features five characters demonstrating how certain words sound in the French, English, Italian, Spanish and German languages. In an amusing comparison words such as 'butterfly', 'daisy' and even 'pen' sound jarring and severe when spoken in German - with a little help from the actor's choice of expression, of course. Dressed in lederhosen and with a pint of wheat beer sat next to him, the German man makes the words sound angry and coarse when he translates the words into 'schmetterling', 'gänseblümchen' and 'kugelschreiber' respectively. Ascribing to the most basic of national stereotypes, the French woman wears a beret and striped top while a glass of red wine and a baguette lie on the table in front of her. The British character holds an umbrella and has what appears to be a pot of tea while the Italian looks to be enjoying a bowl of spaghetti bolognese with his glass of wine. The Mexican meanwhile is not only wearing a sombrero, but he also has his guitar beside him along with a bottle of beer which is flavoured with tequila. 'Aero': Despite being known for their passion, the Italian language can sound lyrical and romantic . 'Sopresa': The Spanish word for 'surprise' sounds quite a bit different to the German version . Despite its reputation for being harsh the German language is loved by many across the globe. For some, the language's logic and its set of rules are among its most attractive features while others simply enjoy the way it sounds. German is a West Germanic language and is one of the world's major languages. It is related to both English and Dutch and the majority of its vocabulary comes from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. There is however a number of words which do derive from Latin and Greek.","Video demonstrates just how different words sound in different languages .

The BBC's flagship rural current affairs programme Countryfile has come under fire after an investigation found it had given undue prominence to an outdoor clothing range. The BBC Trust has censured the show after viewers complained presenters had been seen wearing Rab jackets in back-to-back episodes. Programme-makers said it was 'unfortunate' that the presenters should have chosen to wear the same brand of Rab outer wear, but said that it was 'coincidence rather than collusion'. Countryphiles: Matt Baker (left) with Julia Bradbury and show founder John Craven . They added that Countryfile presenters, who include Julia Bradbury, Matt Baker and John Craven, supply their own clothing and choose what they wear on shoots. The . BBC Trust's editorial standards committee, which did not identify any presenters by name, ruled that the wearing of . branded clothing by the presenters did not amount to product placement, . as there was no evidence that it was worn in return for payment or any . other consideration. But . it said that 'the wearing of the same visibly branded clothing by two . of the programme's presenters in the two editions of the programme did . amount to undue prominence....which gave the impression that the . programmes were promoting or endorsing these products.' The 'cumulative effect was that the branded clothing was unduly prominent' and breached guidelines covering product prominence. The programmes were broadcast last November and December. It is not the first time the BBC has been forced to defend itself over criticisms of product placement. In 2008, MailOnline ran seven pictures of its correspondents out on location who were all sporting North Face jackets, including the then economics editor Evan Davis, who now presents the Today Programme. At the time, a BBC insider told us: 'There is no doubt these companies like having their brands shown on the news and occasionally I have heard of firms approaching a reporter and offering them a free jacket. 'I have heard this has happened with two people. Technically that's illegal because BBC reporters are not allowed to get any freebies.'

Barclays saw more than £2billion wiped off its value yesterday as it revealed emergency plans to help plug a £12.8billion black hole in its finances. The embattled lender said it would go cap in hand to shareholders to try to raise £5.8billion by selling new shares. The huge shortfall in the amount it needs to cushion itself from future financial shocks was almost twice as big as expected, causing its shares to plunge almost 6 per cent, knocking £2.3billion off its value. Towering challenge: The bank is looking to raise £5.8billion through a share issue as they shore up their finances . The lender, which has a huge casino . banking operation built up under disgraced former boss Bob Diamond, is . the only lender on the high street forced to take such drastic action. It came as Barclays revealed another . £2 billion bill to compensate customer mis-sold payment protection . insurance as well as small businesses duped into paying for complex . investments alongside loans. Richard Lloyd  from consumer group . Which? said: ‘The eye watering PPI compensation bill continues to . escalate, showing how much banks have been in denial about the scale of . their mis-selling.’ Profits in the first half of the year slumped 17pc to £3.6 billion compared to the same period last year. Last month the Bank of England . ordered lenders to plug a £27.1 billion shortfall in the amount of . capital they need to protect themselves against future losses. Barclays, Nationwide, the Co-op Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds all fell short. But Barclays and Nationwide were the only two banks to miss  tougher ‘leverage ratio’ rules restricting how much they can lend. These dictate that banks can lend up to £33 for every £1 of capital they hold in reserve. Share issue: Barclays are issuing £5.8billion worth of new shares to meet new regulatory requirements . Barclays plans to raise £5.8 billion . by selling new discounted shares to existing investors, including just . under 700,000 ordinary shareholders. The bulk is likely to be snapped up by pension funds and investment firms. If they do not take up the offer, . investors will see the value of their existing shares eroded as millions . of new Barclays shares are flooded into the market. Prospectuses will be sent to investors in September with the bank aiming to complete the shares sale in October. It also hopes to raise up to £2 billion by issuing high interest bonds – known as Co cos -  to customers. These are effectively IOUs, whereby an investor lends the bank money and receives regular interest payments in return. The rest of money will be raised by winding down some of the complex financing provided to big businesses and pension funds. Barclays had hoped to meet the target . by the end of 2015 but lost a battle with the Bank of England’s safety . watchdog the Prudential Regulation Authority. It will have to plug the shortfall in its finances by June next year. Barclays’ chief executive Antony . Jenkins came under fire  last month after he said the bank may have to . cut lending in order to meet the targets. But yesterday he insisted that there . would be no reduction on the amount of loans provided to households and . businesses as a result of its plans. Hit: Shares in Barclays fell around 5 per cent upon opening this morning, but are still up significantly in the last 12 months . Denying that the shortfall in its . finances was a result of ‘reckless trading,’ Jenkins said: ‘This will . not affect our lending to businesses or support for the mortgage market . in the UK.’ The news came as Barclays revealed the spiraling cost of past wrong doing. This included a provision of £1.35 . billion to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance . alongside loans and credit cards. This takes its bill for the scandal . to just under £4 billion, with High Street lenders racking up a total . bill of almost £18 billion so far. Barclays also set aside £650 million . to compensate businesses mis-sold  interest rate swaps to small . businesses alongside loans. Thousands of firms, from fish and . chip shops to hair salons, were duped into buying these complex . financial instruments which were meant to protect them against rising . interest rates. But when interest rates fell to . record lows many were left stranded on expensive contracts or hit with . crippling bills if they wanted to switch to a cheaper loan. Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has promised to clean up the bank since replacing  former chief executive Bob Diamond last summer. Diamond was ousted after Barclays was fined £290 million by British and American regulators for rigging Libor interest rates. But a string of scandals continue to dog the bank. These include an investigation by the . Serious Fraud Office into its previous fund raising with Qatar . investors during the financial crisis.","Bank raising total of £12.8bn to protect against future financial shocks .

A former security guard has been jailed for nine years after forcing his lover to jump out of a third-floor window - impaling herself on the railing below. Joel Nasser, 63, attacked Aniela Zawistoska with a coathanger after the pair had sex at his luxury mansion flat in Kensington, west London. Nasser then lunged at her, causing the terrified half-naked 38-year-old to jump 20ft on to the wall railing, which pierced through her hip and buttock. An off-duty doctor doctor who happened to be passing by stemmed the blood before she was rushed to St Mary's Hospital by air ambulance. She was put in a medically-induced . coma and taken to intensive care where she received treatment to remove . part of the railings from her hip and buttock. Ms Zawistoska also suffered numerous fractures to her hip, pelvis, ribs and back, as well as a 'great deal' of blood loss. Nasser claimed his victim was leaning out of the window and slipped. He also said she had been taking drugs before she fell. But a jury found him guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent following a two-week trial at the court. Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told Nasser at Southwark Crown Court that it was 'remarkable' Ms Zawistoska survived. He added: 'Rightly or wrongly you were convinced that the victim had stolen from you on two occasions. Trial: Nasser pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm at Southwark Crown Court in London, pictured, but was found guilty by a jury after a two-week long trial . 'You clearly had a fair amount to drink and on your own admission, took a large amount of cocaine.

'In my view, the evidence points very strongly to the . fact that you then lost your temper. 'This was your flat and you knew the height from which she would fall and clearly intended to cause her serious harm. 'In truth, it is remarkable that she survived. This assault must have dramatically altered her life for the worse. 'What you did was witnessed by three independent witnesses who were horrified if not seriously traumatised by what they had seen. 'Throughout the trial you have never indicated a hint of remorse about what you did.' Nasser's co-defendant, Halima Badamasi, 28, from Harlesden Road, northwest London, was cleared of the same charge on the direction of Judge Loraine-Smith. The victim been invited to the party at Nasser's home in Chiltern Street, Marylebone, last Halloween, where guests drank and smoked cannabis. In her statement, the victim said she had sex with Nasser during her visit to his flat. 'Afterwards, he accused her of stealing his money,' said prosecutor Lesley Jones. 'She says she was then attacked by Mr Nasser and he used coathangers lying around the flat.' Michael Newport, defending, said Nasser spent many years working as a security guard for the Saudi Arabian Information Centre, but had struggled to find a new job after being laid off. 'What happened was no doubt fuelled by a high level of intoxication,' Mr Newport conceded.","Former security guard Joel Nasser, 63, launched attack on Aniela Zawistoska during a party at his third-floor flat in Kensington, London .

Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell has been accused of ‘cashing in’ on his Government connections by accepting a top role with a private consultancy. Critics say there is a conflict of interest in his new job as chairman of Frontier Economics, which has been working on Heathrow Airport’s third runway bid. The leading financial consultancy lobbies ministers on behalf of its high-profile clients, mainly blue chip companies. Lord O’Donnell, who received a peerage when his reign as Britain’s top civil servant ended, takes over from former Downing Street policy advisor Sarah Hogg, who is stepping down after 14 years at the company. It comes at a crucial time for the controversial third runway bid, for which the firm has highlighted the potential economic benefits. A report published by Frontier this month says the UK could miss out on £14billion of trade in the next decade without it. Steve Reed, a Labour member of the House of Commons public administrations select committee, said: ‘There are far too many cases of civil servants taking well-paid jobs in the private sector so they can cash in on their contacts in government.’ During his time as Cabinet Secretary, between 2005 and 2011, Lord O’Donnell presided over a large increase in the number of consultants employed by Whitehall departments. He joined Frontier in 2012 as a senior advisor and was promoted yesterday to chairman. A spokesman for Frontier said he had not been involved in its work with Heathrow, and said: ‘Gus acts in full accordance with the Civil Service rules and his primary focus is to work with the team at Frontier to build the company into an even stronger European economics advisory business.’ Lord O’Donnell, an economist, said he was looking forward to his new role, saying: ‘Not only is Frontier at the forefront of applying economics to tough public and private sector issues, it has an internal culture that is second to none.’ Non-executive board members include Lord Turnbull, Lord O’Donnell’s predecessor as Cabinet Secretary.

Corrupt private detectives involved in widespread illegal hacking obtained gained access to highly sensitive pay and income details held by HM Revenue and Customs, it emerged today. Phone giant BT and utility firm British Gas also fell victim to dodgy private investigators, according to a secret report by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). Pressure is mounting on Soca and ministers to release the names of hundreds of companies and individuals who may have used rogue private investigators to steal personal information. Target: Records held by HM Revenue and Customs were used to find out the income and tax bills of private individuals, reports suggest . Last week, officers gave MPs a list of 102 firms and individuals – including a global celebrity and FTSE 100 firm – who hired detective agencies accused of hacking, blagging and stealing private information. But the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) has now admitted it is holding a further list of 200 clients that was not turned over to the Home Affairs Select Committee. The news means the use of corrupt investigators by law firms, banks, insurance companies and celebrities in the so-called ‘hidden’ hacking scandal is far more serious than was thought. The list is in the hands of the Metropolitan Police, which is refusing to publish it. However today investigative news agency Exaro said it had seen the list, and revealed HM Revenue & Customs, BT and British Gas were all targeted by private investigators. It included obtaining details of income and tax paid by individuals, as well as bank account details of British Gas customers and whether phone lines were linked to specific addresses from BT.

Later this week Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce that private investigators will be regulated for the first time.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, has now written to the chief executives of various regulators to ask for clarification on what guidelines, if any, they issue to organisations in their industry on the use of private investigators. He said: ‘The context in which the companies implicated by Soca's information have acted is crucial for us to understand their motives. ‘By understanding whether an organisation has conducted their business within their regulator's guidelines gives a clear indication of their ethical standpoint. ‘Without the names the public are currently left impotent in their judgment. It is important we try to gain as much assurance as possible on their behalf.’ Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce a crackdown on rogue investigators later this week .

HMRC, BT and British Gas are now revealed as some of the victims. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We take the protection of customer data extremely seriously so we constantly review our processes and procedures in light of developments in the e-security world, together with the expert technical and strategic advice we receive from our advisors and in-house teams. For reasons you will understand we cannot go into more detail.’ A spokesman for BT said: ‘BT takes its responsibility to protect customer data very seriously and will not tolerate misuse of its systems or inappropriate or unauthorised access. ‘For this reason, BT ensures that user access can be tracked so that any misuse may be detected, and offenders can be dealt with appropriately.’ A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘We expect law enforcement agencies to take tough action against criminal behaviour wherever it is identified. ‘Ministers will shortly be announcing plans to regulate private investigators.’","List of 102 companies and individuals who hired private investigators .

Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were congratulated on the new arrival by throngs of wellwishers at the Whitstable Oyster Festival in Kent - a week on from the eagerly anticipated royal birth. The couple were showered with gifts for Prince George including a tiny lemon T-shirt which Charles can pass on to the baby as a souvenir from his trip to the festival. Game: Prince Charles ate two oysters as he visited Whitstable's annual oyster fair - and joked to onlookers, 'What I do for Whitstable!' Shona Corcoran, 38, from Whitstable, said she and her three-year-old daughter Hannah felt that they should bring a gift for the baby prince and the perfect opportunity presented itself today as they passed it on to Charles. 'It's one of the Whitstable Oyster Festival T-shirts and we just wanted to give something to George.'He said, 'Oh, that's fantastic, thank you. I'm sure he'll like to wear that',' she said. Down the hatch! Charles gets stuck in: Going... ...going, gone. Kindhearted Camilla is on hand in case of a spillage, too . Charles met a woman who also has a grandchild called George. Margaret Quinney, 67, said: 'He was talking about the grandchildren. 'He said there are lots of grandparents around.' It was after Charles met Mrs Quinney and her daughter Jo that he said: 'George - a very good name.' Mrs Quinney, grandmother to six-month-old George, said they 'just had a feeling' the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would call their son George. Bad memories: Camilla declined the offer of an oyster, saying she'd 'had a bad one' once . 'Now are you going to get this?' Photographers missed Prince Charles's first attempt at eating the local delicacy - and urged him to down another . 'We just had a feeling. We knew it was going to be George,' she said. Her daughter Jo said she thinks it will now be a 'very popular' name for baby boys. Sonia Rule, 38, whose partner works for the Whitstable RNLI Lifeboats crew said she heard Charles joke that his grandson will 'be known as Georgie in no time'. Charles and Camilla met with local fishermen during their visit to the week-long festival which dates back to Norman times. While Charles tried two oysters, his wife declined, saying: 'I love them but I ate a bad one once.'Charles joked with photographers who were keen to get a snap of him eating the local delicacy, having missed him eat his first. 'I've just tried one!' He said. Adding: 'Now are you sure you're going to get this?'

Natalie Adams, 38, who was among a group of mothers and babies enjoying the sunshine at the harbour, said Charles also joked with her about having eaten the two oysters. 'He said 'what I do for Whitstable. They are an acquired taste',' she said. Ms Adams, a member of the yacht club, said: 'It's a lovely community in Whitstable. 'Friends all supporting friends.'

As Charles and Camilla approached their car to leave, crowds called out: 'Thanks for coming!' Whitstable is famous for its native oyster. Popular since Roman times, they are farmed seasonally, and are only available between May and August. The nutrient-rich waters that flow from the Thames Estuary, mixed with salt water from the North Sea, are said to provide the perfect growing environment for the algae which form the oysters' diet.

A frail widow who was recovering from cancer was bound by her hands and feet before being beaten to death by burglars. Pamela Wheeler, 76, was tortured into revealing the combination to a small safe in which she kept her life savings. The pensioner was known to have kept a large amount of cash at home because she did not trust banks. The first picture of Pamela Wheeler, known as Pam, who was found murdered in her home in Thamesmead, South-East London, on July 22 . Investigation: Police search for clues in the street in Thamesmead, south-east London, where Pam Wheeler was found dead in her bungalow . The raiders are thought to have kicked . and punched the defenceless mother of two in the face and upper body as . she lay cowering on her dining room floor. Detectives believe she was still alive when the raiders fled from her bungalow in Thamesmead, south London, last Thursday. Mrs Wheeler’s body was found three days later after neighbours noticed she had not fed the local cats. Hunt for evidence: A police officer searches a drain near Mrs Wheeler's home . Police found her back door open and her safe open. Several credit cards had been left strewn around the semi-detached property. The attackers are thought to have forced her to reveal the PIN numbers to her bank cards. Mrs Wheeler, who had recently recovered from breast cancer, lived alone following the death of her husband Dennis two years ago. Yesterday her devastated family . described the former dressmaker as a kind and charitable widow who had . lost touch with her ten siblings following the breakdown of her first . marriage. Her niece, Velda Holland Jones, 74, said: ‘She was a lovely lady. ‘We used to hang out when we were in our twenties and she was a happy girl back then. It’s shocking to hear how she died. ‘After she split from her first . husband, John, she became estranged from the family and there was no one . who was in touch with her any more. ‘No one knew why she lost touch with . us all, but that’s  the kind of thing that happens when people move off . in their own directions.’ The mother of two, who remarried in . 1997, wrote a post on Friends Reunited a number of years ago saying: ‘I . am happily married to Dennis, and living in Thamesmead, south London. I . have two children, both married, and three dogs whom I adore.’ But following her husband’s death at the age of 70, she became reclusive. Police say Mrs Wheeler kept a large amount of money in a safe at her home because she didn't trust banks . Neighbour Tracey Smith, 39, said: ‘Pam . was really friendly with the children and you would always see her . taking her dogs for a walk and she was happy. ‘But after her husband passed away she . would stand outside at night in her dressing gown on her own. The girl . next door phoned the council and told them she needed help. ‘She did have a carer who came round occasionally and she was mobile but she obviously had a  few problems. ‘My friend went in and found her. She had her hands tied. Her credit cards were out on the floor.’ Neighbours said they had seen two men . aged 19 or 20 hanging around by her gate on Thursday evening.

Disability benefit claimants in Scotland soak up over a fifth more in handouts than their counterparts in England, an analysis found yesterday. It said the cost to taxpayers of disability benefits paid north of the border amounts to £593 for every person in Scotland – while in England the figure is £461. The breakdown by the country’s most respected economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said one reason may be that Scots are more likely to claim disability benefits than people in England. Research said the cost to taxpayers of disability benefits paid north of the border amounts to £593 for every person in Scotland, while in England the figure is £461. File picture . Other reasons may be that Scots suffer from greater ill health and disability, or that assessments meant to weed out those who are fit to work may be less strict than in the rest of the country. It may also be that there are more benefit cheats in Scotland, the report said. The IFS analysis, prepared as advice for Scottish voters in advance of next year’s independence referendum, said spending on benefits is likely to rise faster in Scotland than the rest of the country. ‘Funding the benefits system in the decades ahead may prove somewhat more burdensome for an independent Scotland,’ it warned. Spending on disability benefits is relatively higher in Scotland and spending on housing benefit lower, while Scotland's older population leads to relatively less being spent on child-related benefits and more on pensioners . The research, funded by the Government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said overall benefit costs in Scotland were £17.2billion in the financial year 2011/12, 30 per cent of all taxpayer spending in Scotland. This came to £3,238 for every individual, 2 per cent higher than the £3,176 for the rest of Britain. The gap has narrowed in recent years, the IFS said. But the picture is skewed because high spending on social housing in Scotland means low rents for tenants, and so claims for Housing Benefit are much lower than in the rest of the country. If public spending on housing is taken into account, the real cost to taxpayers of subsidising housing in Scotland is £597 for every person in the population, compared to £493 in England and £471 in Wales. Disability benefits are 23 per cent higher for every individual than in England. The IFS paper said an independent Scotland could push through radical reforms of its own benefit system. But it warned: ‘Any major redesign of the system would either require Scotland to spend rather more on benefits than is spent now or else create large numbers of losers, who will typically have fairly low incomes.’ IFS economist David Phillips, the author of the report, said: ‘Overall benefit spending per person is similar in Scotland to the rest of Great Britain. ‘But within this there are considerable differences: Spending on disability benefits is relatively higher in Scotland and spending on housing benefit lower, while Scotland’s older population leads to relatively less being spent on child-related benefits and more on pensioners. ‘Independence ... would provide Scotland with an opportunity to design its own benefits system. It would also need to adapt it to the fact that Scotland’s population is projected to age faster than the rest of the UK.’","Scots 'more likely to claim disability benefits', says research .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 6 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:57 EST, 6 January 2013 . God remains a major presence in the mist-swathed hills of West Wales. Most towns and villages, however small, are still dominated by a handsome chapel or Anglican church. But dark forces are at work. The 2012 census suggested that Wales is ‘the witch capital’ of the United Kingdom, revealing it is home to 83 self-described witches and 93 Satanists. Reverend Felix Aubel has said he has seen many cases of witchcraft and has told of how locals have gone to him for help after being cursed by witches who blackmail victims for money . ‘It’s an alarming figure, and there are indications that there are a lot more who wouldn’t confess to being witches,’ says the Reverend Dr Felix Aubel, 52, a Congregational minister for five chapels. In a new memoir, Dr Aubel says that during his 19 years as a minister in Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, he has seen many cases of witchcraft — ‘in the high dozens’ — and tells how terrified locals have gone to him for help after being cursed by witches who blackmail victims for money. Dr Aubel says he has evidence that the witches promise spiritual help then cast spells on people if they don’t pay for the ‘service’ — a sort of Satanic protection racket. Others apparently use effigies — or ‘poppets’, as they are known locally — in an attempt to put spells on enemies. Made out of fruit, paper, wax, potato or grain, ‘poppets’ are pierced in the heart with sharp needles, in the hope that the same pain will be visited on the victims. Rev Aubel has detailed how he come across the use of effigies, the 'evil eye' and witches during his time as a church minister . Impossible to credit? Not according to Dr Aubel. One of his chapel members in Aberaeron was victimised in this way after falling out with another worshipper. A witch was asked by a former church member to create a ‘poppet’ of someone. The reason one woman was targeted was because of a row between the two women. The case predated Dr Aubel’s ministry, but he witnessed its evil effects. ‘The motivation was envy that had turned into jealousy — envy then evolved into paranoid hatred,’ says Dr Aubel. Rev Aubel has revealed witchcraft is thriving across rural parishes in Wales in his autobiography . ‘The woman had gone to an English witch who lived outside Lampeter in order to find a way of punishing the other woman. She then told her victim that the witch had made a poppet of her and was attacking it. ‘The psychological pressure destabilised the victim and turned her into a nervous wreck. I had to convince her that there was nothing wrong with her.’ He said he asked an experienced Anglican exorcist to lift the ‘curse’. ‘I’ve got an open mind on the subject,’ continues Dr Aubel, ‘but it doesn’t matter whether you say there’s a basis to it or not. If it’s real to the victims, it’s real: people can still be destroyed as a result. It ruins family life and careers; and some victims even take their own lives.’ Dr Aubel also has experience of the so-called ‘evil eye’ — an ancient belief that some people have the power to create evil simply by looking at someone else. He gives the example of a woman who had given birth to a baby boy and who was given the ‘evil eye’ by a childless spinster neighbour. Dr Aubel says: ‘Both mother and child were subsequently taken ill, due to acute breathlessness. There was no apparent medical reason or  explanation. Mother and child had to go to hospital.’ Next, the spinster visited the hospital ward, where, coincidentally, Dr Aubel was visiting the new mother. He noticed that the other visitor ‘praised the baby to its mother in a very false and patronising way’. Such fake flattery is, he says, ‘one of the most noticeable characteristics of the utilisation of the “evil eye”.’ The reverend, fearing for the child, asked the spinster to make amends, by saying ‘God bless you’ to the baby. But he says: ‘The idea of  saying “God bless you” was anathema to a witch. Her face froze. ‘She was extremely bitter and jealous that she had no children herself. With these witches, there’s often an extreme bitterness and an underlying hatred towards their fellow human beings. They are motivated primarily by hatred for humanity.’ Eventually the woman left the hospital. Dr Aubel pictured at his chapel in Trelech, where he has been told a coven of witches still meet in the area . As for the mother of the baby, when she recovered, she put a horseshoe in the porch of her home in order to protect her son . and herself from the malevolent effects of the ‘evil eye’. Of course, there have been reports of witchcraft in Wales for centuries — a hangover from pre-Roman days of paganism and Celtic druids. ‘In many rural areas, the old religion, the worshipping of pagan deities, continued in the local folk customs,’ says Dr Aubel. ‘In more industrial parts of Wales, the influx of people meant that old customs disappeared. But in more remote areas, it lived on. These old beliefs were passed on from generation to generation.’ In the early 1900s, there was apparently a notorious family of witches who became members of Caersalem Baptist Chapel in Pembrokeshire. Dr Aubel says that one of his deacons in Aberaeron had a grandmother who was a well-known witch and who is now buried in the chapel cemetery. ‘I have been told that a coven of witches still meets in the Trelech area,’ says Dr Aubel. ‘Until recently, the witch of Talog — a village about six miles from here — was advertising in the local paper, offering cultist services.’ Those included spells — or ‘curses’ and divination, or analysis of  the future. The witch of Talog also provided sessions with tarot cards and Ouija boards and witch initiation ceremonies with the use of pentagrams (symbols of the power of the spirit), dancing and group rituals. ‘It’s all mumbo-jumbo — but it still has a negative effect on those who believe in it,’ says Dr Aubel. The minister thinks there are several factors behind the growth in witchcraft. ‘It seems to increase during bad economic times,’ he says. ‘It was at its worst in 2008 to 2009, and it was bad during the mid-Nineties. ‘Witchcraft has grown in a spiritual vacuum — the latest figures show the number of Christians in this country has dropped from 72 per cent to 59 per cent. People are looking for a purpose in their life, for some sort of spiritual movement. The church minister has told of how he had to call out an exorcist, similar to the 1973 classic film, after a parishioner was cursed by a witch . ‘Witchcraft offers an apparent spiritual quick-fix when there’s financial debt, marriage breakdown, or an emptiness in people’s lives. ‘I fear that witches are ruthlessly exploiting people’s weaknesses, emotional needs and problems.’ He says older church members are not affected, but that people in their late-teens or early 20s are susceptible. Others who are vulnerable are those with children in their late-teens, who are suffering money and job troubles. Dr Aubel says: ‘They are often single parents who don’t know where to turn, and suddenly they’re offered a solution. The witch of Talog even said it in her advert — she offered “problem solutions”.’ Undeniably, Wales is a land where tales of the occult and paranormal abound. After a Freedom of Information request in 2011, Dyfed-Powys Police revealed that, in its area over the previous five years, there had been 14 UFO sightings, 26 reports of ghosts, 11 of witches and two of zombies and vampires. In one report, someone said they had been force-fed a furball during a witchcraft ritual. In Llanelli, a man told police that a coven of witches wanted to sacrifice him. He had, it must be conceded, been drinking. Someone else claimed her mother was a ‘black witch’. In 2011, there was a report to officers of ‘malicious communication; rumours that an individual’s mother is a witch’. Welsh witch: Wales is home to 83 self-described witches . Another caller to the police reported ‘that one individual is a witch and had attended at the house to put salt around the bed’. According to medieval superstition, salt can be used to ward off evil. But while Dr Aubel is concerned by such reports, he is sceptical that witchcraft actually works: ‘The witches are charlatans — they make it all superficially attractive, and might even give quite effective advice about, say, debt-solving to begin with. ‘They create a cult mentality, like the Moonies or the Scientologists. Then, if someone tries to withdraw from their control and stops paying, the witches cast a spell.’ He goes on to warn: ‘If you use them, they’ll usually insist on coming to your house. Then they can take something of yours — a photo, say — so they can later use it as psychological blackmail. They’ll send back the photo of you with the eyes torn out, to scare you.’ Dr Aubel says he doesn’t confront the witches personally. His priority is to wean victims off their ‘negative influence’. ‘I’m just trying to offer an academic, rational solution and to tell people not to dabble in this world — it’s so very counterproductive. People get sucked into something that’s beyond their control.’","2012 census suggested Wales is 'the witch capital' of the UK .

Pierre Darcys champagne, pictured, is being sold by Asda for only £10, usually costing £23.98 a bottle . Well, it looks like champagne and it tastes like champagne, but it doesn’t clean out the wallet like champagne. This Christmas, in an unprecedented supermarket price war, the cost of the most famous, most expensive of festive drinks has plummeted to record lows. Tesco is selling its premier cru champagne for £14.99 a bottle. Marks & Spencer is doing its Louis Chaurey non-vintage Brut for £12.75, on a multi-buy deal. And Waitrose has halved the price of its Bredon Cuvee Jean Louis Brut to £14.99. But the really staggering deals are on offer at the cheaper supermarkets. Asda’s Pierre Darcys Champagne Brut normally goes for £23.98 a bottle — but you can now get it for £10, until January 3. And the deal of deals comes from Aldi, which is selling its sparkling for under £10: its non-vintage Philizot et Fils Champagne Veuve Monsigny Brut is going for only £9.99. And, just like a gift-wrapped puppy, it’s not just for Christmas — the deal will continue into the New Year. The question is, how on earth can supermarkets afford to sell their champagne at such rock-bottom prices? And, perhaps more importantly for consumers, is it drinkable? In all its essential elements, the Aldi champagne follows the time-honoured rules of the drink. It’s made from traditional champagne grapes — a third chardonnay, a third pinot noir, a third pinot meunier — using the double fermentation method that produces the famous bubbles. Its alcohol level is 12  per cent — a classic figure for champagne. And it doesn’t taste too bad, either. ‘Of course it’s not a premier cru [a top champagne] at that price, but it’s been well received; it’s won awards,’ says Katy Jameson, spokeswoman for Aldi. The official Aldi tasting notes proclaim that ‘this award-winning champagne is elegant and fresh’, with an ‘intense nose of baked apple, brioche and stone fruits with gorgeous flavours of apples, red fruit and minerality on the palate’. Luxury: France's Champagne region is known for its distinctive sparkling wines . Objective experts haven’t trashed it, either. One broadsheet wine writer calls it ‘bright and fresh, if a little one-dimensional’. Still, even one dimension isn’t half bad for less than a tenner. But how exactly can Aldi get the price so low? The maths suggest it’s near impossible to turn a profit on a bottle costing £9.99. You need 2.2lb of grapes for a single bottle of champagne. At current market rates, that will cost you £4.38. Excise duty on top of that is £2.43, and VAT, at 20 per cent, must be paid on the total — another £1.36. Already we’re up to £8.17, and we still haven’t paid for bottling, warehousing, shipping and distribution. Those overheads vary but, altogether, the total cost price is almost certain to match or exceed the selling price of £9.99. Until November 22, Aldi was selling it for £12.99, but it has been slashed to its current price since then — and there it will remain well into 2013. So how do supermarkets like Aldi and the others make their money, if at all? The suspicion is that deals like these are loss leaders — they draw our attention, get us through the supermarket doors and then we spend money on other full-price items while we are there. They are also sometimes described as ‘crosstown deals’. They encourage customers to make a special trip to discount supermarkets — which are often on the fringe of town — to take advantage of these low prices, and then end up spending lots more money on other goods, too. And plenty of us are happy to make that trip — the British drink more champagne than any other nation except France. Though prices this year seem to have reached new lows, there have been one-off Christmas deals like this before. Several years ago, Woolworths offered a limited supply of champagne at £5 a go — that was clearly a loss leader and a publicity stunt which could not prevent the chain going bust. This year, the cuts are widespread and, in many cases, last well beyond Christmas. There is a genuine, long-term price war being waged. The supermarkets refuse to admit whether they are actually losing money on any of these deals. The last thing they want to be accused of is underpricing booze, just at a time when the Government is considering introducing minimum alcohol pricing to deter problem drinkers. ‘Aldi works with its suppliers to get the best possible deal, but we can’t really go into our business model,’ says Katy Jameson of Aldi. ‘Our buyers spend a lot of time looking for the right champagne, and they will go to the smaller suppliers to find it.’ One smaller supplier in question is the respected family champagne house of Philizot et Fils, based near Epernay, in the heart of the Champagne region. ‘We’re very happy with selling our champagne to Aldi,’ says Virginie Philizot. ‘Yes, £9.99 is a very low price but that is marketing by the supermarket. It has nothing to do with us. It doesn’t affect how much they pay us for our champagne. We still make a good profit on our sales to them.’ Asda has gone through a very similar process to end up with its £10 champagne, finding a small family company and building a close relationship with them. Its Pierre Darcys Champagne Brut — winner of a bronze award in the 2012 International Wine and Spirit Competition — is produced by the family company of Champagne Paul Laurent and is made with grapes harvested around the village of Bethon in Cotes de Sezanne, south of Epernay. Cheap: Aldi's Philizot et Fils Champagne Veuve Monsigny Brut, left, is selling for £9.99, while Tesco's premier cru champagne, right, is selling for £14.99 . Lynsey Grace, Asda’s champagne buyer, . chose it because it is ‘fresh and easy-drinking’. Tasting it myself, it . has a certain amount going for it. Just like the Aldi champagne, it’s . made from a mixture of chardonnay, pinot noir, and pinot meunier grapes, . and is 12  per cent in alcohol volume. Pale gold in colour, it has a . distinctly Christmassy nose of burnt apple. If . I’m brutally honest, it is ever so slightly acrid, with a lingering, . bitter aftertaste. But give it a real Arctic chill in the freezer just . before Christmas lunch, and your mother-in-law won’t tell the . difference. Once again, the . question is: how is Asda managing to sell it so cheap? ‘We’re able to . sell champagne at such fantastic prices due to our size and the volume . of our orders,’ Asda’s Lynsey Grace says, before adding: ‘We take our . role as a responsible alcohol retailer seriously, which is why we . committed to never selling alcohol as a loss leader and always sell at . cost, plus VAT and duty.’ With . price cuts like this, the supermarkets are hoping to shift more . champagne than ever this Christmas. Lynsey Grace expects a 10 per cent . uplift in sales of the drink, compared with last year. But . you won’t find these sorts of prices on champagne from the famous . houses — the Bollingers, the Veuve Clicquots and the Moets. Even in . these recession-hit times, the gilt-edged names still gain their brand . value from being reassuringly expensive. Debate: The multitude of champagne being sold at bargain prices has stirred debate amongst wine critics . Expensive: Wines from the region are usually expensive, leading some to question how supermarkets can afford the discount prices . Yet . the very name champagne still carries a cachet even at the cheap end of . the market — a cachet jealously guarded by the handful of vineyards in . the Champagne region of northern France through their representative . body, the Comite Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne. ‘Christmas discounts are great value for money for the consumer,’ says Thibaut Le Mailloux, spokesman for the Comite. ‘But they don’t support the image of champagne in the best way. They make champagne look cheap when it isn’t cheap to make — thanks to the production process and the limited amount of produce. ‘And the price promotions at Christmas are paid for by higher prices for the rest of the year.’ But the odd thing is that even the £10 bottle from Asda still carries a certain prestige thanks to the word ‘champagne’, emblazoned in large letters on its label, metal cap and gold foil wrapper. It still has all the customary thrills of champagne: it opens with a satisfying pop, a blast of icy smoke and that overflowing stream of minuscule bubbles. And there is no mention of Asda anywhere on the bottle or its wrapper. Of course, we want our champagne to be as dirt cheap as possible — but we don’t want Great Aunt Gladys to know exactly how cheap it is when she’s knocking it back during the Queen’s Speech. Glamour never goes out of fashion — nor does a bargain. The £10 bottle of champagne is a rare combination of the tw .","Supermarkets engage in 'price war' selling famous drink at discount prices .

The terrifying moment two skydivers almost collided thousands of feet above ground has been captured on film. The pair were falling at up to 240mph when they missed each other by centimetres.

Kenneth Andre Adolfsen, whose feet are visible, missing colliding with his friend in mid-air by centimetres . Kenneth Andre Adolfsen admitted that he and his friend were 'very lucky' to avoid each other in mid-air. The close call was captured by Mr Adolfsen's helmet camera as he jumped from the plane. The Norwegian dare-devil immediately begins a head-down skydive but within seconds his friend can be seen hurtling straight towards him. With minimal control, the quick-thinking skydiver manages to curl up just as his friend plummets past. Mr Adolfsen lifts his knees up and his friend also pulls his limbs into his body as they narrowly avoid colliding. He said on his YouTube page: 'Thing happens very fast in freeflying, and we were lucky this time. 'Safety first, know your limits.'

In 2011, Patrick Sandeman died following a jump at Sibson Aerodrome, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when he collided with skydiver Matt Le Berre. Mr Le Berre pulled on his brakes when he realised Mr Sandeman was below him but could not stop his knees hitting his friend's canopy and their parachute lines became tangled.","Kenneth Andre Adolfsen and his friend missed each other by centimetres .

A 75-year-old Detroit-area woman convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her teen grandson was sentenced to at least 22 years in prison Thursday, despite her desperate plea to a judge to spare her from dying behind bars. Sandra Layne got a minimum sentence of 20 years for second-degree murder, along with a mandatory two-year sentence for using a gun to kill 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman. Hoffman was shot six times, including twice in the back, last spring in Oakland County's West Bloomfield Township. Layne said she shot him out of fear during a physical altercation, but a jury in March rejected her claim of self-defense. Jailed: Sandra Layne, 75, is led out of court after being sentenced to at least 22 years in prison for killing her grandson . Tears: Sandra Layne sobbing heavily during proceedings, as she did during this court appearance on March 13 . Prosecutors said there were no signs of Layne being injured by Hoffman. A recording of a 911 call shows him being shot again while pleading for help - a critical piece of evidence that jurors played over and over during deliberations. Judge Denise Langford Morris zeroed in on it, too, wondering why Layne simply didn't call police if she felt helpless. 'Grandmothers are supposed to protect. ... Why did you keep shooting and how could you keep shooting?' Morris asked. 'You didn't have to keep shooting. Those were hollow-pointed bullets designed for a devastating impact.' Layne sobbed heavily during a long, rambling address to the judge, her belly chains and handcuffs sagging over orange jail clothes on her slight frame. 'I'm sorry for what I did. I apologize . to everyone I've hurt, everyone. ... Sorry is too small a word,' she . said, pleading with Morris to not allow her to die in prison. Grief: Jennifer Hoffman, right, mother of shooting victim Jonathan Hoffman, called her mother a 'monster' after she was convicted in March . Layne's daughter, Jennifer Hoffman, urged the judge to show no mercy. 'She showed no mercy when she planned, stalked and murdered my son in . his bedroom. Sandra Layne is pure evil and if given the opportunity . would surely kill again,' Jennifer Hoffman said. Hoffman's father did not attend the . hearing because he was in Arizona with his 16-year-old daughter, . Jessica, who is recovering from a tumor. Michael Hoffman said the girl . 'has a hole in her heart to match the hole in her head' since her . brother's death. In a letter read by the prosecutor, . the father said Layne 'put on her war paint and came in gunning for my . boy.' He accused Layne of killing his son because he was ready to move . on after high school and she would no longer be able to control him. Hoffman was living with his grandmother during his last year of high school while his parents lived in Arizona where a daughter was being treated for a brain tumor. He had a history of drug use and had tested positive for synthetic marijuana on the day of the shooting. Layne claimed he feared flunking probation and demanded money and a car to leave the area. Sandra Layne, 75, looks over at her husband Fred Layne moments after she is sentenced in to 22 years in jail in Pontiac, Michigan, on Thursday. Prosecutors, however, said Hoffman was wearing just shorts and socks when he was killed and had made plans to see a friend that night, not flee. Prosecutor Paul Walton, noting the minutes that went by before Layne shot the boy again, said he had never handled a homicide 'this cold, this long and this calculating.' Layne blamed the parents for not taking Jonathan back to Arizona and said her grandson's drug use made him unmanageable for an elderly woman. She accused Michael Hoffman of giving up on the boy and said she pleaded with the pair to return to Michigan when drugs landed him in the hospital. 'If I could go back, I never would have bought that gun,' Layne told the judge. 'I would have said to his parents it's their responsibility, help him, take him.' Sandra Layne looks back to family members after being sentenced to second-degree murder . Outside court, Jennifer Hoffman said her mother was lying about any indifference by parents. She said she visited Michigan once a month. 'She's a complete narcissist. ... I wish I had seen how evil she was. I wouldn't have left my son with her,' Jennifer Hoffman told reporters. Layne's husband, Fred, and son, Scott Silvers, declined to comment on the sentence. The judge said Hoffman probably belonged in a rehab center or another place outside his grandmother's supervision but instead 'is in his grave at 17.' 'Make no mistake,' Morris said, 'Jonathan is the victim here.' Jennifer Hoffman smiled as she left court in March after the 75-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder. Hoffman described her mother Sandra Layne as a 'monster' outside the Michigan courtroom where she had been found guilty of killing 17-year-old Jonathan. Layne shot her grandson six times during an argument last spring as he pleaded with 911 responders to help him on the phone at the West Bloomfield Township home. Devastated: The husband of Sandra Layne, 87-year-old Fred Layne openly wept as the verdict was read on Tuesday . Following the verdict, Ms Hoffman told the Detroit Free Press that she was happy that her mother had been found guilty. She added: 'I know my son is in heaven and that is a place she’ll never see.' Hoffman had been living with his grandparents since 2011 when his parents divorced and moved to Arizona. The elderly woman's husband Fred Layne wept in court as his wife was shackled and taken away by officers. Layne struck grandson Jonathan Hoffman with six of . ten shots fired over a six-minute span on May 18, 2012. During the two-week trial, the jury heard a recording of . the 17-year-old's desperate call to 911 and even more shots while he was . on the line. 'My grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help. I got shot again,' Hoffman told a dispatcher as he gasped for air. Tragic: Jonathan Hoffman, 17, was shot dead by his grandmother last spring . Prosecutor Paul Walton told jurors that Layne never rushed out of the West Bloomfield Township home, despite claiming to be afraid of her grandson, and never called for an ambulance to help him. She claimed that she shot him after Hoffman struck her during a heated argument about money and a plan to flee Michigan because of a failed drug test. 'She told the court last week: 'I wanted him to pay attention to me. He had to listen. ''It wasn't a conversation. It was arguing. Swearing.' But Walton pointed . out that Layne never complained to police about being attacked. A . hospital nurse who examined her after her arrest said Layne had no . injuries and spoke lovingly about Hoffman. Defense attorney Jerome Sabbota asked jurors to view the incident through the eyes of a woman in her 70s. He said Layne was taking care of a teen . who had used drugs and brought strangers to the home. Hoffman's parents . were in Arizona during his senior year of high school. Taken away: Defendant Sandra Layne is shackled after being convicted of second-degree murder as she turns around and looks at her husband . Shock: Sandra Layne, center, sits with her attorneys as the words she cried to police on the fateful day last spring flashed up in court . ''Her adrenalin is pumping. You're not calm,' Sabbota said in his closing remarks. 'Boom, boom, boom - you pull the trigger.' During her emotional testimony last week, Sandra Layne said that it was a difficult arrangement, especially after her grandson was treated in a hospital for using hallucinogenic drugs. Layne said Hoffman was deeply upset on the day of the shooting after testing positive for so-called synthetic marijuana. She said she had to stop the car three times on the way home to calm him down. 'He's got to sit down. We've got to make a plan,' Layne told the jury. 'He's got to talk to people, his mother, his father. 'We're screaming at each other. He said, ''I'm getting out of here. They're going to put me in jail.'' ... He had to stay here. We had to resolve things here.' Layne said she shot the teen during another argument later at her home. She acknowledged in her testimony that she told police that she had 'murdered' Hoffman. 'I recall saying a few things. I'm screaming, hysterical,' Layne told the jurors.","Sandra Layne convicted of second-degree murder for killing her 17-year-old grandson Jonathan Hoffman in May 2012 .

A 17-year-old skier who went missing on Sunday was found unharmed this morning after he built a snow cave with skills he learned on popular TV survival shows. Nicholas Joy, of Medford, Massachusetts, was skiing with his father, Robert, on Sugarloaf Mountain on Sunday afternoon when he got lost. His desperate family feared the worst after his second night on the mountain last night but were delighted when a snow-mobiler discovered the teen stumbling to safety this morning. Found: Rescuers took this photograph just moments after Nicholas Joy was found 'in great shape' after spending two nights lost in freezing conditions on Sugarloaf Mountain, Maine . Survival show fan: Nicholas Joy, pictured, managed to stay alive using skills he learnt from popular survival shows . In a statement this afternoon, Robert and Donna Joy said: 'There is great relief and happiness that Nicholas has made it through this difficult ordeal.' 'We want to thank everyone for their . hopes and prayers and especially members of the rescue team'. Nicholas became lost when he tried to find his way back after skiing off trail on Sunday. He built a snow cave, covered himself with branches to keep warm and survived on water from a nearby stream in skills learned from his love of outdoors survival programs. His enthusiasm for the shows like the popular Man vs Wild hosted by Bear Grylls, meant he survived without injury and was able to walk from the woods to be spotted this morning. According to PracticalSurvivor.com picking a good location is key. It should aim to protect you from the wind and avoid possibly perilous spots such as a riverbank . If you're a skier you should use your skies to help you gather a huge pile of snow - around five foot high or more. You should then pat it down and leave it to settle before you hollow out a cave . The cave should be several feet deep sloping slightly up. Pine boughs should be placed at the base for added insulation and to stop the body being in contact with the snow . The ceiling is then carved into a dome shape . The site recommends a wall thickness of 12+ inches with a ventilation hole . General manager of Sugarloaf Mountain John Diller was with the family when they heard the news. 'We were ecstatic. I was with his parents about a minute after they found him. I cried along with them,' he told the Boston Herald. 'This kind of thing, it’s almost like a miracle.’ Snowmobiler Joseph Paul happened upon . the high school senior four miles away from the resort around 9am today . as he rode on Caribou Pond Road. He gave the hungry teen cheese crackers and peanuts before taking him in to be reunited with his parents. He was later filmed by a local broadcaster walking to a waiting ambulance. 'I was searching off the side of the trail looking for any footprints or sign of anybody,' he told WHDH. 'All of the sudden I see some footprints walking down the trail. So he . had found the snowmobile trail finally and I just gave him a ride out. 'He said he went off, following the . trail and it ended skiing and then he started hiking back up. He decided . he was going to take a shortcut and then he got lost.' 'He said he watched a survival show and made a shelter with branches and drank out of the stream, so that’s how he survived'. The experienced skier was supposed to meet him at the bottom of the mountain just before 1pm on Sunday. Freezing conditions: Nicholas Joy's survival after two nights on Sugarloaf Mountain has been described as a miracle .

Nicholas was taken in to Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, Maine, but is believed to be without injury, not even suffering frostbite . One thing is for sure - the teenager is hungry.

Drivers should wear sun cream in their cars even when the windows are closed, doctors have advised. They warned that the sun’s damaging rays can penetrate glass, raising the risk of skin cancer. While glass will block UVB rays, which cause sunburn, the more-damaging UVA rays pass through. Slap it on: Drivers have been warned to apply sunscreen even if they have their windows closed to avoid harmful UVA rays . Despite people spending more time driving than gardening or exercising, they are less likely to wear sunscreen when in a car than outdoors, it was found. Just 15 per cent of people said they used sun cream ‘most of the time’ while driving – a figure described as ‘dismal’ by the researchers from Stony Brook University in the State of New York. In contrast, 38 per cent said they would normally wear sunscreen when outdoors. Surprisingly, those with a history of skin cancer were no more likely to wear sun cream than others. The US researchers asked 225 men and women to fill in a survey about their driving habits, including how often they drove with the window open and when they wore sunscreen. Many had been treated for skin cancer in the past. Two-thirds of those questioned believed they didn’t need to wear sun cream if the windows were closed. Dr Dennis Kim, one of the researchers, said: ‘Like the majority of patients in our study, I too used to feel protected from the sun while in a vehicle, unfortunately this is not true. ‘Because such a large proportion of a person’s cumulative sun exposure occurs while in a vehicle, automobile-related UVA exposure is a considerable public health concern.’ Dismal: Just 15 per cent of people apply sunscreen when driving despite them spending more time in their cars than outside gardening or exercising . While windscreens and tinted windows offer protection, much of the sun’s rays pass through side and rear windows. Dr Kim cited previous research which showed that laminated glass in windscreens blocks 98 per cent of harmful UVA rays from the sun. But these rays – which penetrate deep into the skin causing ageing, eye damage and skin cancers – can easily penetrate the non-laminated glass of side and rear windows, with at least 80 per cent passing through. Is the parasol absolutely necessary? Dr Kim said: ‘The good news is that this damage can be limited by wearing sun creams, long sleeve shirts, and protective eyewear.’ He added that although he did his research in America, Britons should also take care, especially in the summer. Non-malignant melanoma, the most prevalent type of skin cancer affecting 100,000 people in the UK each year, was found to occur more often on the arm closest to the driver’s window. Among those who took part in the study, this was the left arm. But research from countries with predominantly right-hand drive cars, such as the UK, found higher numbers of the cancers on the right arm. The study, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, also found that when people did apply sunscreen, it was frequently in the wrong place. For instance, it was often not applied to arms and hands – despite them being exposed to the sun while driving. Yinka Ebo, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Although this is a small study that relied on skin cancer patients recalling what they did in the past, it’s a reminder to consider sun protection even for everyday activities like driving. ‘Windows can block UVB rays but most don’t block UVA rays – so your skin may still be getting damaged.’","Few motorists apply sunscreen when driving despite skin cancer risk .

Investigators have gathered 'mounting evidence' that suggest the Boston bomber brothers could have been involved in a grisly unsolved triple murder in 2011, it has emerged. Officials told ABC News that forensic evidence could tie Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to the killings of Brendan Mess, Raphael Teken and Erik Weissman, who were found with their throats slit and marijuana dumped over their dead bodies in a Waltham, Massachusetts house. The Tsarnaevs knew the men as Tamerlan trained in boxing and martial arts with Brendan Mass. However, officials said more DNA testing is required before bringing an indictment against the surviving brother, Dzhokhar, who is recovering from a self-inflicted gun wound in a prison infirmary. Involved? Tamerland, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, could have been involved in a 2011 triple murder, investigators have said. Forensic evidence and cell phone records reportedly tie them to the scene . Following the April 15 bombings and the suspected involvement of the Tsarnaev brothers, investigators began to look into the link between Tamerlan and Mess. Authorities have now told ABC that forensic evidence from the crime scene in 2011 matches the Tsarnaev brothers. Their cell phones were also in the area at the time of the killings, records show. Victim: Tamerlan's best friend, Brendan Mess, had his throat slit in an attack in September 2011 . The three men had ordered food from an Italian restaurant on the September 11, 2011, but when a delivery woman came to leave the food, no one answered the door. The next morning, one of the victim's girlfriends found their bodies. Their throats had been slit, they have been covered with marijuana and there was also $5,000 cash in the home. Initially . police said two other people had been there on the day and they were . looking to question them, although no one has ever been charged. Ray said there had been no forced entry, so police believe the killer was known the victim and was let into the apartment. Investigators at the time said the murders were 'targeted and not a random act of violence.' Middlesex District Attorney Gerard Leone issued a statement soon after the murders saying, 'based on the present state of the investigation, it is believed that the victims knew the assailant or assailants, and the attacks were not random.' Neighbors described Mess and his two roommates as quiet, nice people who were a welcome change of pace from previous residents who often had loud parties late into the evening. Murdered: Raphael Teken (left with a friend) and Erik Weissman (right) were also killed in the home . Scene: Investigators said there was no sign of forced entry so it is likely the men knew their murderers . After the deaths, friends said that . Tamerlan acted oddly - failing to attend his close friend's funeral and . dropping out of the martial arts school where they had both trained. One man who knew Tamerlan through the . gym where they trained said some of their social circle 'without even . speaking about it beforehand have all been thinking' he could be . involved. The friend, who gave his name only as Ray, told BuzzFeed Politics: . 'At the time, none of us would have thought it was Tam. It was just so . emotional and we thought we had someone else who had done it.' But since Tamerlan was identified as . the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three and . injured 180, Ray believes his sudden disappearance after Mess's death . may be a clue.

An insert poster for the seminal 1931 cinema adaptation of Frankenstein has sold for a staggering $262,900 (£173,700) at auction after it was stashed in a cupboard for more than 30 years. Dallas, Texas-based Heritage Auctions, which sold the vintage poster to an anonymous bidder, says it's the largest bid ever recorded for an insert poster. The previous record was a $191,200 bid last year for a 'Casablanca' poster. Record breaker: This poster of the 1931 film adaptation of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein has sold for a staggering $262,900 at auction after it was stashed in a horror fan's cupboard for more than 30 years . The seller, Keith Johnson of Ottawa, Illinois, says he purchased the vintage poster as a teenager for a few dollars at an Ottawa antiques shop in 1968 or 1969. Measuring 14in wide by 36in long, it is believed to be the only confirmed insert poster for the classic Universal Pictures film still in existence. The film, directed by James Whale, featured Boris Karloff as the monster, alongside Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye. Unlike typical film promotional posters, insert posters are printed on card and are designed to be slipped inside movie theatre display cases. Mr Johnson and his wife Julie are both horror film fans. She said the couple over the decades would occasionally pour themselves a glass of wine and take a look at the poster.","It is believed to be the only one still in existence .

Marks, who is not a student at the university, allegedly lunged at an officer, striking him and attempting to grab his gun, saying that 'asshole' Gordon Ramsay had possessed him and transformed him into God. Officers reportedly tried to subdue Marks, but the baton and pepper spray they used on the tall foodie had no effect. Marks, the runner-up on MasterChef season three in 2012, broke free from officers and began running. He was finally apprehended by five officers in a resident's backyard and taken to hospital for his injuries.

Marks, a U.S. Army contract specialist, was the runner-up to Christine Ha in the third season of the popular reality cooking show MasterChef last year where he was mentored by Ramsay, Joe Bastianich and Graham Elliot. The self-taught cook beat out 30,000 hopefuls for a spot on the show and came close to the top spot, losing out to Ha after serving up an undercooked lobster. Since the show, he's been involved with the Real Men charities in Chicago and has spoken about plans to open his own culinary school.

Before appearing on the show, Marks told the blog Eat Jackson what he thought about Gordon Ramsay: . 'He has that intensity that I like… He doesn’t intimidate me; he motivates me harder… His personality is milder on [MasterChef] than on Hell’s Kitchen; but he can get intense.' Following the first of two eliminations on the show, Ramsay told Marks that he could call him any time and that he would help the young chef with his career.","Josh Marks, 26, was arrested by University of Chicago police after a confrontation on campus .

The bus driver who lost control of his vehicle, causing it to smash into a lamppost which crushed an eight-month-old girl to death in her stroller was on his cellphone at the time, police believe. Idowu Daramola, 48, from Thornwood, New York, was charged with death by auto, reckless driving and using a cellphone while operating a vehicle after the death of little Angela Paredes on Tuesday. His alleged mindlessness sparked a terrifying - and ultimate deadly - chain reaction; his bus struck the lamppost, then a tree, another lamppost and a parked car, which hit three other parked cars. Seven people were sent to hospitals - including four in one of the cars - and authorities desperately tried to save Angela as her mother, Maylin Hogo could do nothing but scream helplessly.

A three-year-old girl has been killed and 17 injured after a main water pipe ruptured releasing a powerful torrent. The little girl drowned and her home was destroyed when the pipe exploded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The barrage of high pressure water has destroyed dozens of homes and swept away vehicles, leaving a path of devastation and debris. Scroll down for video... Devastation: A three-year-old girl has died and 17 have been injured after a main water pipe ruptured in a residential area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Aerial footage from local media shows the water powering through and destroying residential homes in the poor western district of Campo Grande . Some 17 houses crumbled because of the flooding, and more than 140 people were forced out of their homes. Firefighters have had to use floating platforms to rescue people who had been trapped by the rising flood water. Isabella Severo dos Santos was named by local media as the child who drowned in the incident. Footage shows how the incessant barrage of water also destroyed her family home. The Globo television network ran images . of a first responder wading through knee-high water . carrying little Isabela in his arms. Homes have been reduced to rubble by the surge of water, which killed a three-year-old girl . The water pipe exploded in a built up poor area of western Rio de Janeiro . One distraught woman tells the camera: 'Here it is, I'm a hard working woman, I am a fighter. I ended up okay, but Isabella, how did it come to this? Three years old.' The freak accident happened in the poor Campo Grande district, located in the west of the city. The spurt of water that resulted from the rupture reached a height of around 20meters (65ft), flooding the neighborhood with water up to 2meters (6ft) high in places, the network said. The cause of the break was not immediately clear. Cars were tossed like toys by the powerful torrent of water which swept away numerous homes . Rescuers had to find boats and floating platforms to help access those trapped by the flood water . During a visit by Rio Gov. Sergio Cabral, residents brandished signs berating the beleaguered official. Cabral, who has seen his popularity plummet since mass nationwide protests swept Brazil in June, visited a local school where those displaced by the floodwaters had been taken. Speaking to gathered TV cameras, he pledged to give all possible assistance to those affected by the flood. The incident came a day after Cabral appealed to critics to call off the protests they've been staging in front of his beachfront Rio apartment on and off since June. Cabral said the demonstrations were disrupting the lives of his children, ages six and 11, and suggested the protests would be more appropriate in front of the governor's palace, his place of work. The cause of the break was not immediately clear . Tensions are already high in the city after demonstrators alleged that leader Cabral is corrupt and called for his impeachment . 'I'm making an appeal from the heart, as a father,' Cabral said at a news conference Monday. The demonstrators allege Cabral is corrupt and are calling for his impeachment, as well as an investigation into spending on the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, which Rio is hosting. A poll by the Datafolha agency said Cabral's popularity has plummeted by 30 percentage points in the space of a few weeks. The poll showing his popularity fell from 55 points to 25 percent, was conducted on June 27 and 28 among 605 respondents and had a margin of error of plus or minus four points. Damage caused by the burst water main spread as the water levels rose . Clean up: The huge operation to clean up the poor neighbourhood has begun . Cabral belongs to the centrist PMDB party, which is allied with the Worker's Party of President Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity has also taken a beating since the start of the protests. A 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares in Sao Paulo initially triggered the wave of mass demonstrations, which rapidly snowballed into nationwide movement over a simmering public dissatisfaction about a disparate set of issues including government corruption, high taxes and poor government services.","Main water pipe exploded in Rio de Janeiro's western Campo Grande district .

Fifteen years after a pair of North Texas road-rage killings put Douglas Feldman onto death row, the rage still appears to exist. Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials declined to make Feldman, 55, available to reporters as his scheduled Wednesday evening execution approached. One media session several weeks ago never even began, because he ripped the telephone from the visiting cage outside death row and became disruptive. It was among 136 disciplinary cases Feldman’s has accumulated in prison. 'He’s a memorable character, a dangerous person in any setting,' said Jason January, the former Dallas County district attorney who in 1999 prosecuted Feldman for capital murder. 'He threatened to kill me personally.' Still fuming: Fifteen years after a pair of North Texas road-rage killings put Douglas Feldman onto death row, the rage still appears to exist. Feldman, a former financial analyst turned gun-toting motorcyclist, was convicted of killing Robert Everett, 36, of Marshfield, Missouri, and Nicholas Velasquez, 62, of Irving. The two truck drivers were killed about 45 minutes apart on August 24, 1998. Prosecutors said Feldman became enraged after Everett cut him off, so he shot him and then later, simply because he was still angry, shot Velasquez. Barring any delays ahead of the execution, Feldman will be the 11th prisoner executed this year in Texas and the third this month in the nation’s busiest capital punishment state. He will be the 503rd inmate to be put to death in Texas since reinstatement. Feldman’s attorney, Robin Norris, filed a clemency petition with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles that was turned down Monday. Multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected Norris’ appeals on Feldman’s behalf. First victim: This is the scene of the first murder committed by Mr. Feldman . At Feldman’s murder trial, prosecutors produced evidence of numerous confrontations initiated by Feldman, including one where he jumped on the hood of another driver’s car, smashed it with hammer, and then used the hammer to beat the windshield, a door and the driver. Psychotic: Mr. Feldman said he would kill the journalist interviewing him, his cameraman and another man off camera if he had a gun . 'I have come to hate every single . person on this planet with all my heart and soul,' he told a former . girlfriend in one of 81 letters to her while awaiting trial. 'If I had a . button which would kill every single person on this planet, I would . push it with no hesitation whatsoever!' Evidence . showed Feldman was riding his Harley-Davidson bike on U.S. Highway 75 . just north of Dallas when the 18-wheeler driven by Everett passed and . then pulled into Feldman’s lane. Feldman was enraged, pulled out his . pistol and fired several shots at the back of the truck trailer. Then he . reloaded and pulled up alongside the truck cab. 'I chased Mr Everett down and I shot him to death,' Feldman testified at his trial. 'I felt like I needed to stop that man.' Eleven miles later, and after circling back to make sure Everett was dead, Feldman spotted Velasquez, driver of an Exxon fuel tanker, replenishing tanks at a Dallas gas station. 'I exploded again in anger,' he testified. 'I drove by and shot him. It was just acting out. I felt emotionally compelled and consumed by anger.' 'I have found it quite pleasurable to kill those two men,' he said in another letter to his ex-girlfriend. The day before the fatal shootings, evidence showed he shot up a Volkswagen dealership where he once had some work done. Feldman was arrested about a week later after shooting a man outside a fast-food restaurant.","Douglas Feldman killed two truck drivers 45 minutes apart from each other in 1998 .

The New York Post quotes one source saying: 'They are together almost every weekend and sometimes Friday when Ashley gets off work... They are still together.' Another friend quoted in the NY Post said the are 'trying to move forward' and 'working things out'. The friend described the whole affair as a 'wake-up call' for Rob who now seems 'different'. Disgraced ex-CBS News anchor Rob Morrison has agreed to a plea deal that means he can avoid jail for allegedly strangling his wife, Ashley Morrison. The couple have reportedly been seen spending time together again . The couple's relationship was forced . into the spotlight when in February Rob Morrison was accused of . strangling his CBS news anchor wife Ashley in a drunken argument. Mr Morrison quit his job at CBS and is . now undergoing domestic-violence abuse programs and substance-abuse . treatment to avoid jail. He pleaded guilty to second-degree threatening . and disorderly conduct. Morrison, 45, was under a court order . to stay out of their family home and to remain at least 100 yards away . from his wife at all times. But following the plea agreement, he has reportedly been spending time with his family at Greenwich Water Club, Connecticut. According to the NY Post, one member . of the club reported seeing the ex-Marine help a child in the pool who . had got a bloody nose. On Twitter, one person known as . Randolph Harris, has posted a picture apparently of Mrs Morrison and . their son, celebrating her birthday at the health club this weekend. His message said: 'Happy Birthday to Miss Ashley Risk Morrison of CBS News, New York!' Friends of the couple have told the . news service that Morrison is making amends and is carefully following . his court-mandated therapy, although he 'has a lot of work to do'. If Morrison, 45, successfully stays . out of trouble for the next two years, the New York state Superior Court . in Stamford will clear Morrison's charges from the public record. Morrison has agreed to complete two domestic-violence programs, undergo a psychiatric exam, participate in substance-abuse treatment and submit to random urine tests over the next two years . ‘It is very unusual for any criminal defendant to want to enter a plea of guilty,’ said Morrison’s attorney Robert Skovgaard. ‘That having been said, Rob . recognized the potential risks in going to trial, and more importantly, . he realized that prolonging the case does not serve the Morrison . family's interests.’ Morrison, 44, resigned from his . $300,000-a-year job in February after police accused him of choking his . CBS Moneywatch anchor wife Ashley Morrison in a 'drunken rage'. He is alleged to have choked her at their home in Darien, Connecticut in February. The estranged pair have a young son. The state has not dismissed a strangulation charge against Morrison, Skovgaard said it has chosen not to prosecute him on the charge if he successfully completes the 26-week Explore program for those involved in family violence and the Family Violence Education program. In May local Connecticut newspaper The Darien Times reported that Morrison had grown increasingly irritated during a telephone conversation with one of their reports and he resorted to insults and foul language. He is reported to have used a ‘slew of insults and profanities to express his frustration at a story that had published that he claimed was “bull****” and “completely inaccurate.”’ The jobless news anchor also questioned how the 'shi***' paper got its information, claiming its sources 'suck.' 'You know every time you call my f***ing attorney, it costs me a thousand dollars?' he is allegedly to have said. When the reporter asked Morrison for an interview, he promptly hung up. Denial: Morrison denies allegations that he assaulted his petite wife Ashley, pictured . Rob Morrison called the Darien Times to complain about their story about his next court appearance. He said it was ‘bull****’ and ‘completely inaccurate’ ‘Your sources suck in the Stamford Court, and the Darien Times - I know this is big time for ya, OK, but your sources suck, brother’ ‘The clerk is your source? [The state’s attorney] you f***ing idiot,’ he said. ‘F*** the clerk.’ He claimed the newspaper gets its information from ‘whatever is f***ing fed to you on some press release or some form.’ ‘Good for you, bro,’ he said. ‘You know every time you call my f***ing attorney, it costs me a thousand dollars?’ He also described the newspaper as ‘shi***’ and hung up when he was informed the conversation was all on the record. Morrison is writing an autobiography which tells the story of his TV career and troubled marriage to fellow presenter and wife. Following his arrest in February, several allegations have . emerged about the couple's difficult past with Morrison accused of infidelity and previous incidents of domestic violence. He denies the charges and believes he can set the record straight in his book, according to the New York Daily News.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:16 EST, 31 July 2013 . The story of three black robbers who wore latex masks to dress as white cops when they knocked over a New York check-cashing store last year was so sensational it could have come from a movie script. Prosecutors revealed yesterday that it did. Authorities in New York say Akeem Monsalvatge, Derrick Dunkley and Edward Byam took their ideas straight from the 2010 Ben Affleck film 'the Town,' which is about a gang of bank robbers who use clever disguises to cover their tracks. The race-switching disguises for the Queens, New York, robbery were so good that store clerks had no idea that the robbers had been wearing masks at all, witnesses testified at the trial for the three men - which began on Tuesday. The robbers got away with a $200,000 haul. Scroll down for video . Masked: The New York City Police Department has collared two brazen burglars who robbed a cash-checking store in Queens disguised as cops, thanks to their polite letter of appreciation to the mask maker. Unmasked: Officials say Edward Byam and Akeem . Monsalvatge, right, of Queens, dressed in NYPD gear and wearing high-end . masks, robbed a Pay-O-Matic in Rosedale on Valentine's Day 2012 . Bad inspiration: Prosecutors say Ben Affleck's 2010 film 'The Town' gave three accused robbers in New York their script for a $200,000 robbery of a check-cashing store . The New York Post reports that Brooklyn prosecutors have submitted into evidence a picture of Monsalvatge and one of his alleged co-conspirators wearing a t-shirt with a scene from the film. The case bears other hallmarks from the movie, as well. The robbers showed a clerk at the Pay-O-Matic cash-cashing store in Queens, New York, a picture of her house to prove that they were 'serious' - just has Affleck's character did in the opening bank robbery scene of 'The Town.' They also doused the scene in bleach in an attempt to clean up any DNA evidence left at the scene - another trick taken from the film. The men also are accused of dressing as cops, which Affleck and on-screen partner Jeremy Renner pulled off at the end of 'The Town' during a heist at Boston's Fenway Park. There are, however, key differences between the film and the real-life heist. In 'The Town,' Affleck and on-screen partner Jeremy Renner dressed as cops - just as the suspects in the Queens robbery . Each set of masks Affleck and his cohorts wore in the film were clearly meant to be disguises. In one scene they wore ghoulish Halloween masks. In another, they dressed as nuns. The masks Monsalvatge and his cohorts used were much, much better. They reportedly paid $2,000 for masks made by Custom Effects, a film special effect company that has recently done work for '2 Guns' and 'The Wolverine.' ‘We don’t . know if they are white, black or Hispanic. People in the neighborhood . saw them in the van for two or three days before the robbery,' a police spokesman said at the time. 'They saw . three white guys.’ And the race-swapping angle is a totally new angle. Customized: The customized mask model used in the heist costs well over $500 . Stash: The two made away with $200,000 in pilfered funds . The alleged robbers are said to have taken great pains to hide the fact that they are black. Thick gloves covered their skin . completely, and dark glasses hid their eyes, making it nearly impossible to identify them. After getting away with the heist, Byam wrote a short thank you note to Composite Effects, the makers of the mask, to show his gratitude for the 'realism' of the disguise. The photograph of the clerk's home that the robbers left behind proved part of their undoing. The police then traced the photograph of . the clerk's home to a nearby Walgreen's where it had been developed. They were able to get Byam's . home phone number on a receipt. Thanks to an anonymous tip, the NYPD zeroed in on Composite Effects, a company that makes masks similar to the ones the criminals used. They contacted the company which then supplied them with an email from Byam. 'I’m sending this message to say I’m extremely pleased by CFX work on the mask,' Byam allegedly wrote, according to the New York Post. 'The realism of the mask is unbelievable.' It appears they purchased the 'Mac the Guy' model with customized hair designs for upwards of $600. If the trio were wearing masks the stunt would imitate a London bank robbery, Britain’s biggest ever, when £40m was robbed from the exclusive Grafts in Mayfair. The two crooks hired a professional make-up artist to disguise them using liquid latex, at a cost of £450 ($720), reportedly under the pretense that the four-hour transformation was for a pop video.","Robbers wore life-like masks to steal $200,000 from check-cashing store .

The original brooch, made by famed jewellers Alemany & Ertman in New York, was a gift for Dali's wife in 1949. But, with the artist's permission, the company made several copies from his original designs. The one for sale was bought by an Italian man in the 1950s and it has been passed down through his family ever since. The artists did not design that many pieces of jewellery . The piece went up for sale at auctioneers Dreweatts of Newbury, Berkshire, and had been expected to sell for £12,000. But such was the interest in the extremely rare item, went for eight times that amount and was bought by a private watch collector from the US. James Nicholson, head of jewellery at Dreweatts, said: 'Privately owned pieces of this calibre which have never been on the market before arouse considerable interest globally. 'The Dali brooch is a fantastic piece. He didn't design that many pieces of jewellery, probably about 20 in all, so whenever one comes on the market it is very rare. 'We don't know how many pieces like this were made but this is the first time one of this large size has come up for auction. 'I knew there would be a lot of interest in the piece but because it was so unusual there was no precedent for me to go on. 'It was very exciting in the sale room and moved very, very fast, everybody was shouting down the telephones trying to get their bids in, it was an electric atmosphere. 'There were people bidding from all over the world, from the USA, Europe, the UK and the far East. 'There was a lot of interest because some collectors specifically look for artist's jewellery.

William Hague last night condemned the Egyptian authorities after scores of supporters of deposed president Mohammed Morsi were shot dead and hundreds more injured yesterday. The Foreign Secretary called on the country’s new rulers to halt violent attacks on protesters as the latest death toll was put at more than 100, with more than 1,000 said to be wounded. Mr Hague said after the bloodbath carried out by state security forces just before  pre-dawn prayers: ‘I am deeply concerned by recent events  in Egypt and condemn the use of force against protesters which has led to the loss of lives.

However, Al Jazeera Egypt reported that some 4,500 may have been injured in the early morning violence. Military-backed authorities were feeling emboldened after millions turned out for nationwide rallies on Friday called by the army chief.

Filed Monday in Ohio, the lawsuit holds former doctor Ali Salim, the hospital he used to work for and Craigslist accountable for Deanna Ballman’s death, and is seeking $40million in damages. Mr. Salim has been charged in connection with the death of both the 23-year-old expectant mother and her unborn child. Dead: Deanna Ballman died from a heroin overdose, her body was found on the side of a rural Ohio road . A tragedy: Two young children will grow up without their mother, and a third child died before it was even born . The website should have known Mr. Salim was a danger to women after numerous complaints were made to both local police – who notified the site of the danger he posed – and directly to the site by abused women, according to the suit. ‘Craigslist was on notice and knew or should have known defendant Ali Salim was inherently dangerous to its Internet users,’ the suit said. Multiple women answering ads placed by the former doctor accused him of sexual assault, and even to be alone with him in the house while he painted the human digestive system on their abdomens, according to the suit. The accused killer’s employer, Knox Community Hospital, is also being held liable in Ms. Ballman’s death. The suit accuses the hospital of negligence for allegedly allowing Mr. Salim to take the needles he is said to have used to inject the deceased mother with heroin, as well as not keeping adequate track of the narcotics being taken. Not a cleaning ad: Authorities have now said that Ms. Ballman answered a personal ad posted on Craigslist, not a cleaning ad as was originally reported . Loving mother: Ms. Ballman is pictured here with one of her children . Accused killer: Dr. Ali Salim pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, kidnapping, rape and assault . The suit also tried to accuse a third party of helping Mr. Salim inject Ms. Ballman with heroin, but authorities have not been able to prove that accusation. Discovered dead August 1, 2012 on the side of a road in rural Ohio, Ms. Ballman is said to have been alive when Mr. Salim allegedly dumped her body after injecting her in the leg with heroin and raping her. Mr. Salim has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, rape and assault charges, as well as two counts of murder – one each for Ms. Ballman and for her unborn daughter she planned to name Mabel Lilly. Ms. Ballman was nine months pregnant when she died. Horrific: Ms. Ballman's 19-year-old brother was petitioning to take custody of her children - until he was shot dead earlier this year . So sad: Ms. Ballman left behind two young children . Originally reported to have been responding to a housecleaning ad on Craigslist, authorities now say Ms. Ballman was replying to a personal ad on the site. Mr. Salim’s lawyer has accused the deceased mother of prostituting herself to support her drug habit. Authorities have disputed this claim, saying there is no evidence to suggest Ms. Ballman was a drug user. The deceased mother also had two other young children that her 19-year-old brother James Ballman was peititioning for custody of until he was shot dead in February.","Deanna Ballman was originally said to have answered an ad looking for cleaning services, but authorities now say she answered a personal ad placed on Craigslist .

Barry Penaluna, 32, staked £50 at 100-1 that he and girlfriend Helen Drinkall, 29, could lose a massive 10 stone in six months and they landed the bet to win £5,000 after a healthy eating and exercise regime saw the couple dropping from a combined 40st 12lbs to 30st 6lbs. Bookmakers William Hill take about a 100 bets a year on weight loss, but no pair of gamblers have lost more than 10 stone before, so the couple have made punting history after being offered the longest ever odds. Partners Barry Penaluna and Helen Drinkall put a bet on themselves to lose weight and won £5,000 from William Hill when they lost 10 stone between them . The pair, from Killingworth, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, decided to lose the equivalent of a third person ahead of their marriage after civil servant Barry popped the question to Hull-born Helen last December. Strapping 6ft tall Barry, who weighed 23st 3lbs when he placed the bet and now tips the scales at 17st 2lbs, said: 'I had tried diets and exercise in the past to lose weight, but it had never worked and at one point ahead of placing the bet I was up to 25 stone. 'Then I read a story about a man who won a bet with William Hill after losing a few stone and decided that we could do it and the £5,000 would be a great incentive and could go towards our wedding and a holiday. 'We've been together 10 years and it's easy just to get into a comfort zone. I was probably about 17st when we met and now I'd like to get down to 14st or even 13st. But it goes on a lot easier than it comes off. Once I put the bet on I wasn't going to lose it,' Bookmakers William Hill, who accept around 100 bets on weightloss each year, offered the couple odds of 100-1 and paid out when Barry and Helen slimmed down . Barry added: 'I knew it was a big challenge, but with healthy eating and starting to take exercise I knew we could do it. We went on the caveman diet and cut out carbs and alcohol. I've just done the Great North 10k and a year ago I couldn't even run round the block. 'I go out running with my younger brother Jamie, 27, and he keeps telling me there is more in your legs, so I don't give up. I do a boot camp at the weekends and a cardiovascular work out session can see me burning 1,200 calories per hour. 'I've not had an alcoholic drink for four months and before this I'd have about 10 pints on a night out and a couple of bottles of white wine. 'I've got a season ticket at St James' Park and after the match I go for a Diet Coke now, but the lads all know about the weight loss and there's been no peer pressure to have a drink at all. 'I've won a few hundred on the football and the golf before, but this is my biggest ever win by a long way and the weight loss is priceless.' The couple decided to change their lifestyle after getting engaged and will now put their winnings towards their wedding . Mother-of-two Helen, a fellow civil servant who hails from Hull, who went from 17st 9lbs to 13st 4lbs, said: 'I checked with the doctor that we were okay to take on the bet and we have changed our whole way of life with more exercise and healthy eating. 'Barry is the chef and he's put us both on the Paleo diet - or Caveman diet - where we don't eat carbs and have increased our exercise. 'We've grown together, but we now have two daughters Chloe, aged three, and 10-month-old Sophie and we don't want to be big unfit parents unable to play with our children. 'We got engaged before Christmas and then we struck the bet to get extra incentive for our wedding - I wasn't going to get married being overweight. We've tried lots of diets in the past, but striking that bet was the best incentive. When William Hill accepted our bet they changed our lives.' William Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'This is a record-breaking first for William Hill as we've never had any couple land such a heavy-weight punt at 100-1 on their weight loss. 'When Helen called to say they had succeeded we were flabbergasted, this is an amazing achievement and they deserve their winnings.'

TOTAL: Around 4,000 calories per day . Breakfast: Strawberries, melon or banana (100 kcal each serving) and a glass of water. Lunch: A grilled chicken salad (350 kcal) with water. Cutting out the soft drinks saved thousands of calories each week. Evening meal: Healthy piece of chicken or fish with vegetables and perhaps a piece of fruit for dessert. Cooking the food himself ensured that Barry knew exactly what went into it and their evening meal was rarely more than 750 calories.

Jeff Flake, from Arizona, beat a number of younger contenders including Oprah Winfrey's goddaughter Kirby Bumpus to clinch the top spot in The Hill's '50 Most Beautiful' list, which was released today. But overall it was the Democrats who triumphed in this year's rankings, taking 26 places on the list compared to 16 for the GOP. Scroll down for videos .

Just . over half those named to the list - which was evenly split between men . and women - were Democrats, with 16 Republicans and eight who are not . affiliated to any party. However, . this dominance is more likely to be due to the larger number of . Democrats currently working in the capital, with the party controlling . the White House and the Senate.

A judge ordered disgraced Houston hand surgeon Michael Glyn Brown to be arrested for contempt of court for the second time after once again skipping a hearing related to his divorce from Rachel Brown. The soon-to-be ex, meanwhile, was in attendance and even briefly posed for pictures, though she left before the hearing—smiling for the camera alongside her new love, retired Houston Astros great Jeff Bagwell. Brown’s prior contempt-of-court arrest was back in March, when the same judge who handed down Tuesday’s order, Judge Sheri Y. Dean. The owner of a national chain of hand surgery clinics was jailed less than three weeks. Moving on? Rachel Brown is in a bitter divorce battle with disgraced hand surgeon Michael Brown and showed up to the most recent hearinng alongside her new beau, former Astros star Jeff Bagwell . Brown, who lost his medical license in 2006 after he tested positive for cocaine, has been a fixture in Texas courts for years, now. In January, Brown was accused of choking a flight attendant and threatening to strip naked on a flight from London to Miami. The flight attendant told authorities that she was able to pull away from Brown's grasp but alleged that his behavior continued after she returned to serve him a some food. A criminal complaint obtained by the Houston Chronicle earlier this year said that Brown knocked over the meal as he wrapped his hands around her neck and began to squeeze, and asked her 'are you a strong woman?' Charged again: Michael Glyn Brown, pictured in court in 2011, was arrested in March for failing to appear for his divorce proceedings and was again charged with contempt of court for the same reason Tuesday . The Chronicle reported that Brown then said he was going to 'get naked' and remarked about the 'sexual' things he wanted to do to the women. Eventually, the flight crew was able to get Brown calm, and he soon fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. When the plane landed, he was taken into custody and has since pleaded guilty to related charges. He is currently in a divorce battle with Rachel Brown, his fourth wife. In 2011, Brown went to trial on charges he threw a humanitarian award and two heavy vases at Rachel Brown. He was later acquitted. It was not the first time Rachel Brown accused her husband of assault. According to the Houston Press, Rachel made prior complaints against Brown at least three times: in 2003, 2006, and 2009. She filed for divorce on Jan. 7, 2011. In the bag: Bagwell, left, has been pulled into the messy divorce of girlfriend Rachel Brown, right, from disgraced hand surgeon Michael Brown as Michael Brown's attorney accused him of alcoholism in a hearing over the couple's children . Business: Brown's carpal tunnel clinic, the Brown Hand Center, which also has locations in Phoenix, Dallas, Austin and Las Vegas, has about 400 staffmembers . Jeff Bagwell, whose impressive career saw him hit 449 home runs, came into the mix in the last year and, according to the New York Post, isn’t a squeaky clean replacement for Brown. In a January 2013 hearing concerning . Brown’s visitation of their children, Rachel admitted that Bagwell had . recently entered a rehab facility for alcohol abuse and left before . completing the program. Bagwell has always maintained that he’s never . used performance enhancing drugs. Rachel herself admitted in court to using cocaine and ecstasy after the birth of her kids. She says she stopped using drugs in 2009. Rachel has said she intends to marry Bagwell. Tuesday’s proceedings set a September 30 trial date for the divorce trial. Brown now stands to be arrested for contempt of court. Though he previously served less than a month for the same charge, Brown was sentenced 180 days in jail for the first offense. Brown’s sentencing for the flight attendant assault is set for September 25.","Embattled owner of a string of hand surgery clinics that bear his name, Michael Brown has now been charged with contempt of court for skipping a hearing for the second time .

Car bombs ripped through busy streets and markets in Iraq on Monday, killing at least 60 people in predominantly Shi'ite areas in some of the deadliest violence since Sunni insurgents stepped up attacks this year. The 17 blasts, which appeared to be coordinated, were concentrated on towns and cities in Iraq's mainly Shi'ite south, and districts of the capital where Shi'ites live. Militant groups including Al Qaeda have increased attacks in recent months in an insurgency against the Shi'ite-led government as a civil war in neighbouring Syria heightens sectarian tensions. The violence has raised fears of a return to full-blown inter-community conflict in a country where ethnic Kurds, majority Shi'ites and Sunni Muslims have yet to find a stable way of sharing power.

Making waves: The Academy elected it's first African-American president Tuesday - Cheryl Boone Isaacs . A veteran marketing executive is the new president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The organization's board of governors elected Cheryl Boone Isaacs to the position Tuesday evening, over Rob Friedman of Lionsgate. She is the first woman to hold the post in three decades and the first African-American president in the academy's history. Film industry insiders praised the decision on Twitter. Alex Ben Block, senior editor and show business historian for The Hollywood Reporter, called Boone Isaacs a 'wonderful choice for movie Academy prez, smart, experienced, diplomatic, hard worker and her election makes history.' The Academy has had two previous female presidents, actress Bette Davis for two months in 1941 and screenwriter Fay Kanin who served from 1979 to 1983. Boone Isaacs' selection could be addressing a 2012 Los Angeles Times survey that found the organization lacked diversity. Most of the members were white, male and older. The LA Times  surveyed 5,100 of the total 5,765 and found only 6 per cent of the members were not white and only 23 per cent were female. Boone Isaacs was elected to a one-year term but is eligible to serve four successive terms. She succeeds Hawk Koch, who served for one year but was ineligible for re-election. Lack of diversity: Boone Isaacs' selection comes after a 2012 Los Angeles Times survey found most of the Academy members to be white, old and male . Boone Isaacs previously served as vice president of the film academy, which announced its new president via Twitter.

A prisoner was killed in a high-speed car chase with police after breaking out through the roof of an Arkansas jail with his cellmate. Stephen Mitchell, 39, who had been on remand at the Jackson County Detention Centre facing a charge of first-degree battery, died yesterday afternoon pursued by police in Missouri. He and fellow prisoner Steven Reed, 22, had escaped late on Sunday night after removing a light fixture from the ceiling of a cell that was in a surveillance camera blind spot. Prison break: Stephen Mitchell, 39, left, and Steven Reed, 22, right, escaped from Jackson County Detention Center after climbing onto the roof. Reed was later recaptured while Mitchell died in a car chase with police . The pair had worked at the hole left until it was big enough to climb through into the jail's attic, from where they were able to escape on to the roof, ABC News reported. Reed was recaptured on Monday evening in a nearby rural community, but Mitchell was not found until the next day, when a Missouri highway patrol officer stopped a White Nissan Sentra for speeding and spotted him inside. Mitchell's wife, Jessica, was driving the car, with her husband in the front passenger seat. But as she stepped out of the vehicle to answer the patrolman's questions, the fugitive leapt into the driver's seat and sped off. He got away, but hours later Missouri police again spotted the car and gave chase - until a catastrophic car wreck ended his bid for freedom, and his life. Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas told ABC News: 'During the pursuit, Mitchell wrecked his vehicle and sustained fatal injuries, which led to his death.' Missouri police are investigating the cause of Mitchell's accident. His wife placed in custody in Mountain View, Missouri, awaiting an extradition hearing to be returned to Arkansas, where police hoped to question her about any involvement in the escape. Reed, Mitchell's co-escapee, was meanwhile charged with first-degree escape and sent back to jail with bail set at $1million. Before his escape he had been awaiting transportation back to state prison for a parole violation. Mitchell and Reed's escape was not discovered until Monday morning, some ten hours after they broke out of jail, giving them a considerable headstart on police. Sheriff Lucas said conditions at Jackson County Detention Center had not helped matters. The jail is designed for 26 prisoners but usually holds around 50. 'I am not making excuses, but it is hard when you have limited staff and are underfunded and overcrowded,' he said.","Stephen Mitchell, 39, and William Reed, 22, found a surveillance blindspot in the jail where they were able to burrow through the ceiling .

First Italian in space: Luca Parmitano is in the middle of a six-month mission on the International Space Station . 'I was just lucky to be back inside in no time.' The suits worn by astronauts when outside pressurized cabins are known as EVAs, Extra-Vehicular Activity suits. Astronauts wear a liquid-cooled garment under the suit which serves to regulate body temperature. It was the cooling water used in this under-suit that experts suspect began to leak into Parmitano's helmet. 'The water - if it had continued to leak much more, it would have been very serious,' Chris Cassidy said a separate NASA video released Tuesday. Cassidy explained that the cooling water somehow got into Parmitano's ventilation system. The helmet of the suit has an air vent that blows oxygen from behind the astronaut's head. Water bubbles built up then began leaking water from behind Parmitano's head into the helmet, saturating his communication cap and filling up to cover his nose, mouth and ears. 'Once the water got big enough that it went all the way around and . started coming outside the edge of the white plastic piece, then it . saturated his communication cap, and sort of capillary flow just brought . the water all around his head,' Cassidy explained. 'He had water filled up in his ear cups, and it started to creep into his eyes and covered his nose.' Parmitano, who is the first Italian in space, said there was about 3lb of water inside his helmet. NASA engineers in Houston are investigating what could have caused the leak, which is a serious concern for astronauts and mission control.

North America may be full of bears, but it is rare for people ever to get close enough to observe them in their natural environment. So this video, filmed by a hidden camera in a Canadian park, is a unique opportunity to see how wildlife behave when they are not in the presence of humans. And the result may be surprising - because the bears appear to be pole-dancing around a tree in the middle of the woods. Scroll down to watch the video . Dance party: A family of bears has been filmed dancing around a tree in a Canadian park . Comfort: The bears were apparently attracted by the chance to scratch their backs on the tree's bark . Pose: The unusual positions taken by the animals are reminiscent of human pole-dancing . The extraordinary video was filmed in Kananaskis Country, a large expanse of national park in the province of Alberta. Part of it was made with a normal camera, and part with a night-vision lens, so that it captures wildlife at play 24 hours a day. Over a number of days in May and June this year, a variety of animals including deer and black bears approached the tree which the camera was trained on. Bounce: Some have compared the bears' antics to the popular dance move twerking . Pioneer: This grizzly was the first bear to discover the therapeutic effects of the tree in Kananaskis Country . Bandwagon: A black bear also joined in the fun by going to scratch its back on the tree . But rangers really hit the jackpot when a family of grizzly bears discovered the tree and adopted it as their latest plaything. When the first bear arrived, he began scratching his back against the bark. This apparently produced such a pleasant sensation that he spread the news to other grizzlies, and before long they were all checking out the tree. Wildlife: This deer was another animal to be caught on the rangers' camera in late May and early June . Night vision: The camera was not only operating in daylight hours but filmed through the night too . At one point, as many as four bears were vying to grab a spot on the tree - and their vigorous motion made it look as though they were pole-dancing. The video of still images edited together and set to an upbeat soundtrack by Ewan Dobson was uploaded to YouTube by Alberta parks offficials. It has garnered more than 200,000 views in less than a week as viewers flocked to enjoy the wild antics.","Amazing video filmed in wilderness of Canada's Kananaskis Country .

Hundreds of people swarmed around the Prince when he went onto the field at half time during the Westchester Cup, the sport's answer to the Ryder Cup. He shook the hands of several spectators who came forward to congratulate him on the birth of Prince George of Cambridge, when he joined them for the tradition of going onto the field of play to stamp down divots made by the horses.

Brush with majesty: The Prince shares a joke with a well-wisher as he strolls among the spectators . An area was roped off in front of the royal pavilion at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park, on the border of Berkshire and Surrey, where he had previously watched the first three chukkas between England and the United States. But in a surprise move, Charles stepped over it and walked into the crowds, flanked by his security guards, for a walkabout. Kevin Newberry, 36, from Oxford, was one of those who shook hands with the Prince. Charles stepped over the rope separating the royal party from the crowds and walked into the crowds, flanked by his security guards. He shook hands with Philip Day from Binfield, Berkshire . 'I just went up to him and said ""Congratulations"", and he replied ""thank you very much"",' he said. Joining Charles in the Royal pavilion at the game were celebrities including Star Trek actress Alice Eve, Strictly Come Dancing's Brendan Cole, Life on Mars stars John Simm and Philip Glennister, and television presenter and former England rugby union scrum half Matt Dawson. Charles presented the Westchester Cup, the sport's oldest trophy, to the England team after they beat the United States 12-11 in the first chukka of extra time.

The popularity of the monarchy has soared to all-time highs following the birth of Prince George, a survey has revealed. The Queen is enjoying unparallelled public support as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have reinvigorated interest in the Royal family, particularly among the young. Three quarters of the British public believe the newborn prince will one day become king, as the public confidently predict the monarchy will endure. Soaring popularity: 74 per cent of people think Prince George, held by his mother Kate, will one day become king . Two years ago a quarter of people said the country will be a republic within the next 50 years, compared with just nine per cent now, the ComRes survey for the Sunday Telegraph found. The Royal family have enjoyed a surge in popularity on the back of Kate Middleton's wedding to Prince William two years ago. A series of importance events - the wedding, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the royal birth - have kept them firmly in the public eye. Popularity: 26 per cent said the Queen was the member of the Royal family they most admired, making her the most popular royal . King in waiting: Prince George who was born on the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital, in west London, on Monday . Not even the controversy surrounding nude photographs of Prince Harry in a Las Vegas hotel room last year has dampened enthusiasm for the family, according to the survey. Following the death of Princess Diana in 1997 after her divorce from Prince Charles, support for the monarchy slumped to historic lows. But by the time the Queen's Golden Jubilee came around in 2002, the family's popularity had already recovered. The public believe that Prince George will become king even though his turn is unlikely to come for more than half a century. The survey found that 53 per cent believe Britain would be worse off without the royals - and only 14 per cent believe that the country would be better without them. Today the most popular royals after the Queen are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with Prince Harry. But a significant proportion say Prince Charles should not accede to the throne when the Queen dies. The survey found that 38 per cent of people are in favour of Prince William being the next King - compared with 42 per cent who said it should be Charles. Future king? 38 per cent of people said Prince Charles should not become king and the Crown should instead jump a generation straight to Prince William . Asked which member of the Royal family they most admire, 26 per cent of people said the Queen, 19 per cent the Duke of Cambridge, 17 per cent Prince Harry and 12 per cent the Duchess of Cambridge. Just four per cent said Prince Charles - and only one per cent opted for his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. However, 40 per cent said the Queen's £36.1million Sovereign Grant does not represent good value for money - compared with 43 per cent who said that it does.

While many of us will be hoping for bronzed limbs this summer, some people may emerge from repeated sunbathing sessions with a rather more unsightly side-effect - dry, scaly rings on the skin that refuse to budge. Thousands of women suffer from  Disseminated Superficial Actinic Porokeratosis (DSAP) - a skin condition that causes red or brown circles on the legs and forearms and is normally triggered by over-exposure to the sun. While some develop just a few of these lesions, normally about one centimetre in size, others have dozens all over their limbs (the greater the sun exposure, the more rings are likely to appear). Lizard look: DSAP, a skin condition that causes red or brown circles on the legs and forearms, is normally triggered by over-exposure to the sun . They also tend to increase in number with age because of cumulative  effects of sun exposure which damages cell DNA, causing a thickening of the skin. The sun can make them red and itchy and they often get darker and more noticeable in summer, as warm weather can cause blood vessels under the skin to dilate. Although triggered by over-exposure to the sun, the chance of developing it is influenced by genetic factors. Parents with the condition have a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to their children. This is not just due to similar skin types, but also to carrying a faulty gene. And sunbathing will make the condition significantly worse, and result in more skin lesions. Similarly, wearing sun cream may not stop you from developing it, but may lessen its severity. Many parents will be unaware of the genetic link and could unwittingly be putting their children at risk if they don't encourage them to cover up in the sun. The condition is most commonly diagnosed among younger women in their 30s and 40s, although no one knows why this group seems to be affected. Seeing red: Sunbathing will make the condition significantly worse and result in more skin lesions . Kate, 42, had enjoyed sunning herself on her summer holiday - although she wore sunscreen to protect her fair skin. Then two years ago, as she turned 40, she started developing red rings over her arms and legs. 'I had noticed a few dry patches before then, but as soon as I turned 40, these lesions started appearing,' recalls the mother-of-two from Leeds. 'To begin with I thought it was psoriasis but they were different from that, so I went to the doctor. He diagnosed DSAP and told me the condition runs in families and there was very little I could do about it. 'The lesions can be unsightly. It depends on the weather and time of day - they tend to look better in the morning and get redder when it is warmer or if I have a hot shower and the blood comes to the surface.' Kate has discovered her mother also has the condition. Dr Alex Anstey, a consultant dermatologist and spokesman for the British Association of Dermatologists, says: 'We usually see this condition in sun-worshippers or those who have used sun beds heavily. 'The condition tends to affect those of white European descent who burn easily but tan poorly in the sun. It is more common in women than men and normally develops between 30 and 50 years of age.' Dr Raj Mallipeddi, a consultant dermatologist in London, adds: 'This is yet another reason why we should protect the skin from sun damage. 'We are now seeing the effects of a generation who spent time in the sun without worrying about it, generally among people who grew up in the Seventies and before. 'The vast majority of sun damage occurs during the childhood and teenage years, so it is very important to protect children from the sun to prevent conditions like DSAP developing.' Thankfully, the condition itself is not usually dangerous or contagious - Professor Anstey says the risk of the lesions becoming cancerous is 'low'. But those with the condition may be at higher risk of developing skin cancer because of their high sun exposure, explains Dr Mallipeddi. Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun damages DNA within skin cells, and this can lead to the development of cancerous cells. The lesions are sometimes misdiagnosed as actinic keratosis - a common skin condition, again linked to sun damage, which often appears on the face and other exposed areas, and in some cases turns to skin cancer. They can also be mistaken for psoriasis. Because of the similarity with actinic keratosis, many patients are unaware they are passing the DSAP gene on to their children. Cover up: Protect your skin from the sun with clothing, a hat, and SPF . The bad news is that there is no cure, and treatments to reduce the appearance of the lesions generally don't work and can even cause side-effects. Cryotherapy (where liquid nitrogen is sprayed on to the lesions to freeze them off), surgery and laser treatments can all cause scarring, and creams such as Imiquimod, which boost the body's immune system to destroy abnormal skin cells, can lead to severe reactions such as redness and inflammation. 'In most people, no treatment is necessary - because the condition is not a health risk, and treatment is generally not that successful - and reassurance they are not dangerous can be offered,' according to information from the British Association of Dermatologists. 'The best way to avoid developing or worsening of this skin condition is to avoid exposure to the sun.' The advice to anyone concerned about changes to a mole or patch is to seek medical advice. And to stay safe in the sun, doctors recommend protecting your skin with clothing and a hat, wearing sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher and reapplying every two hours. Kate has seen an NHS dermatologist and has had a couple of the bigger lesions frozen off – which worked, although it made her skin blister. But, more than anything, she is extra diligent about sun protection now. 'I have about 50 lesions on each arm and the same on both of my legs,' she says. 'I try to keep my skin covered up, but if I do go out in the sun I always wear sun protection factor 30 or 50 to try to stop the lesions getting worse.'","DSAP is a skin condition that causes red or brown circles on legs and arms .

The hair-straightening Brazilian blowdry could be exposing people to dangerously high levels of a cancer-causing chemicals, according to new research. A study has found that the Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Hair Solution made the air in salons contain potentially dangerous levels of formaldehyde. It is recommended that hairdressers use products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde, but the product investigated contained 12 per cent formaldehyde. Both Jennifer Aniston (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) have both had a Brazilian blowdry, which makes hair permanently straight without the need for daily straightening or products . Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that formaldehyde concentrations in the air . around hairstylists and customers exceeded limits set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. National . Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the California . Division of Occupational Safety and Health. ‘Our study found that using Brazilian Blowout, without proper engineering controls like local exhaust ventilation, could expose hairdressers and their clients to formaldehyde at levels above the short-term occupational exposure limits,’ study author Michelle Stewart from the University of California, Berkeley’s school of public health. ‘While installing local exhaust ventilation is a traditional exposure control, that solution may not be feasible in small salons due to the cost of ventilation systems, permits, installations, ongoing maintenance and efficacy checks,’ Stewart said. The Brazilian blowdry began in Brazil in 2005 and usually uses a solution containing formaldehyde to straighten hair. The recommendation is that salons . use products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde, but the . products have been found to contain up to 12 per cent. The treatment involves washing the hair with a . special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the . straightening solution which is . applied, combed through, then left on the hair for 30 . minutes. In the last stage, straighteners are applied to ‘lock-in’ the formula and set the blowdry. The heating stage is where . problems can arise. Combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from . curling, creating a long-term straightening effect. But when the . solution is heated, the formaldehyde emits a vapour which can bring with . it a whole host of symptoms . There is additional concern that if . formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate . the hair follicle and permanently damage the cells that produce hair . growth. The result is that when hairs fall out, they are not replaced with new ones. The Brazilian blowdry began, as the name implies, in Brazil in 2005. Exactly how the straightening properties of formaldehyde were discovered are unclear, but its use in the textile industry to straighten wool may have sparked the idea. Better known as a key ingredient in embalming fluid, formaldehyde is also one of the main ingredients in many of these hair straightening treatments. First, the hair is washed with a special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the straightening solution which is applied next and combed through, then left on the hair for around 30 minutes. In the last stage, extra-hot straighteners are applied to ‘lock-in’ the formula and set the blowdry. But the heating stage is where problems can arise. Combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from curling, creating a long-term straightening effect. But when the solution is heated, the formaldehyde emits a vapour which can bring with it range of health complaints including  watery eyes, runny nose, upper respiratory tract irritation and nosebleeds. There is additional concern that if formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate the hair follicle and permanently damage the cells that produce hair growth. The result is that when hairs fall out, they are not replaced with new ones. The chemical is also strongly linked to cancer. According to EU rules, the level of formaldehyde in the hair solution must be less than 0.2 per cent to protect the health of both stylist and client. Hair straighteners may be the healthier option now that a study has found that the Brazilian Blowdry exposes people - particularly hair stylists - to high levels of formaldehyde . But in the U.S., where the straightening . treatments have been popular for longer, some manufacturers have been . caught using solutions containing up to 50 times the limit. The explanation for this is the stronger the solution, the longer lasting and more effective the result. The product is available in more than 6,000 salons within the United States, according to the news release. The findings appear in the August issue of the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene.","Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional .

The biggest hospital in Wales has been branded 'dangerous' in a damning new report, which says patients are at risk because of increased waiting lists. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) warns that people waiting for heart operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff are 'dying regularly' and some children are suffering because of delays. No fit state: 2,000 patients failed to get non-urgent surgery in the first three months of the year alone, because of lack of beds or cancellations at University Hospital of Wales . Its report says: . * Children are being fitted with hearing aids because of a lack of time and resources to insert grommets to treat ear infections . *Patients are suffering complications because of delays in treating kidney stones . * A&E and intensive care units are 'frequently gridlocked' with patients 'often stacked up in corridors and ambulances'. Bosses at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said the 'unacceptable' situation was now being addressed and were looking at options to increase cardiac surgery capacity. The seven-page RCS report says 2,000 patients failed to get non-urgent surgery in the first three months of the year alone, because of lack of beds or cancellations. 'This has resulted in increasing waiting lists such that patients are clearly coming to harm. In cardiac surgery we heard that patients are regularly dying on the waiting list from their cardiac pathology, mostly valvular disease' it says. The RCS report came following a visit to surgical departments by its Public Affairs Board for Wales (PAB) in April this year. The report from the Royal College of Surgeons also found failures in the cleaning and sterilisation of theatre equipment . It highlighted a 'universal consensus' among clinicians that some services at the hospital were dangerous and of poor quality. The perception among doctors, it said, was that operations are being cut to save money and meet financial targets. Increased waiting lists mean patients are regularly dying from their cardiac pathology before surgery . Some services had been effectively suspended' such as paediatric tonsillectomy and children are now regularly being fitted with hearing aids because there is no ability to do grommet insertion instead. The RCS report found 'inadequate' facilities for urgent and emergency, failures in the cleaning and sterilization processes and concerns that the A&E department was failing to cope with demand. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, whose husband died at the hospital, called for the chief executive and the whole board to step down. She told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'I'm horrified because some of my constituents go to this hospital, constituents in the Cynon Valley, and to hear from the RCS through a leaked report that certain departments are dangerous, with patients dying regularly, that the services at the UHW were dangerous and of poor quality, that is horrifying and particularly because we didn't know about it. ""The situation sounds to me very similar to the Mid Staffs situation. This is the Welsh Mid Staffs moment. Health board chief executive Adam Cairns apologised for performance at the hospital and confirmed that 15 people had died in the 12 months while on the waiting list for heart surgery. But he rejected calls to resign. 'Our role, I think, is to look the problems that we have in the eye and then be very determined to fix them and I think it would be a dereliction of duty to walk away from these problems. We have to fix them' he told the programme. The RCS' report comes less than a week after the Royal College of Physicians warned that vital NHS Wales services were at risk of collapse because of severe staff shortages.","2,000 procedures cancelled in three months at University Hospital of Wales .

Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400). Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen. There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year. The iPhone 5S was expected to be released on 13 September, with the cheaper version due at the start of October. Production . problems are now said to have pushed this date back, meaning the iPhone . Lite could be released before the high-end iPhone 5. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal claimed suppliers in Asia had said Apple recently asked for prototypes of screens . that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone. It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays. This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the . current model. Apple has unveiled a new handset every year since it announced the first iPhone in 2007. The first four models - iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 - were all unveiled in June and went on sale around a week or so later. More recent models, including the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5, were announced in October 2011 and September 2012 respectively. Rumours of a summer release for the iPhone 5S began in April this year when sources close to the electronics . giant, including manufacturers, leaked details that production had started. Reports from an American magazine in May . suggested the iPhone 5S would be announced on 10 September and go on . sale ten days later.

The backing case could be made of coloured plastic according to images shown on Chinese site WeiPhone, pictured . According to site MacRumours, photos leaked in mid-June show that iPhone 5S will be the first to feature a new A7 chip designed by Apple and a higher capacity battery . It will be the first time in Apple's iPhone history that the company has unveiled two handsets in the same month. It was originally dubbed iPhone Mini, then iPhone Lite, and now leaked pictures from WeiPhone showing plastic cases suggest it could be called the iPhone C. The cheaper handset is expected to be made of plastic to keep costs . down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink . and blue. According to analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets, the iPhone Mini could be made of plastic and could cost as little as £63 ($99). Other prices put it much higher at £260 ($400) and it is likely to be closer in price to Apple's iPhone 4. Apple does not comment on future products before its launch events.

Britain is prepared to break ranks with the international community to arm Syrian rebels, David Cameron said yesterday. In an intervention that will raise fears of being sucked into another foreign war, the Prime Minister said there was ‘danger in inaction’ over a conflict that has claimed 70,000 lives. He suggested Britain would try to  persuade other European Union countries to lift an embargo on arming rebels when the current sanctions lapse in May. David Cameron suggested Britain would try to  persuade . other European Union countries to lift an embargo on arming rebels when . the current sanctions lapse in May . But he said it was ‘not out of the question we might have to do things in our own way’. This could involve vetoing an extension of the EU arms embargo so the UK could send guns and ammunition to groups fighting to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He revealed officials have drawn up emergency legislation to bring in a looser package of unilateral sanctions against Syria if the EU prohibitions lapse. Mr Cameron told the Commons liaison  committee: ‘We are still an independent country – we can have an independent foreign policy. ‘If, for instance, we felt that action needed to be taken to help bring about change in Syria, to help end this appalling bloodshed, and if we felt our European partners were holding that back, then we’d have to change the approach. But that’s not what I hope will happen.’ Richard Ottaway, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, warned British weapons could fall into jihadist hands in the country. He told the Prime Minister: ‘It is widely accepted that jihadists are gathering from all over the world to fight their cause in Syria. Don’t you think it would be a  mistake to start arming rebels who we don’t really know their identity and whose intentions are uncertain?’ War-torn: Smoke rises over the Salah al-Din neighbourhood in central Aleppo, Syria . Mr Cameron acknowledged the danger, but added: ‘The point I would make is – there is a danger in inaction. While the world stood by and has frankly not done enough in Syria, what has happened? As well as 70,000 people being killed, you’ve seen jihadist elements, as it were, grow.’ He added: ‘My argument is by working with the opposition, by supplying parts of the opposition and helping parts of the opposition you can at least have some influence with your partners.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague announced last week Britain will send non-lethal military equipment, including armoured cars and body armour, to rebel fighters. It followed the relaxation, at Britain’s request, of EU sanctions. The commander of the rebel Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, has called for the lifting of the EU embargo.","PM signals Britain could veto extension of arms embargo in May .

A well-to-do New York heroin addict who, with his then-pregnant trust-fund-baby girlfriend, was caught with a cache of weapons and bomb-making equipment in December will serve a reduced seven-year prison sentence as part of a plea deal. Aaron Greene, 32, pleaded guilty to a single charge of attempted felony weapons possession in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday and his disappointed parents attended the hearing. The 32-year-old had faced 10 years behind bars after police found terrorist handbooks, two shotguns, 60 shotgun shells, knives and seven grams of the explosive HMTD in the apartment he shared with girlfriend Morgan Gliedman. But he agreed to the plea deal, shaving three years off his sentence although the agreement also includes five years of supervised probation. Guilty: Aaron Greene, 32, pictured here in January, pleaded guilty to a single charge of attempted felony weapons possession in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday . Gliedman, who later had a baby girl, Melody Sunshine, is still awaiting trial. 'Our client wished to accept responsibility for his conduct and put this unfortunate chapter behind him,' defense lawyer Isabelle Kirshner told The New York Post of Greene, who will be formally sentenced on September 4. The questionable couple were arrested in December for allegedly keeping explosives in their Greenwich Village apartment and plotting to blow up the arch in nearby Washington Square Park. Friends allegedly told police that Greene had previously tested explosives in the Manhattan public park. The friends report that Greene was seen sprinkling powder on the ground before throwing rocks at it to see if it would explode is in keeping with police theories that the couple were stocking up on highly unstable explosives in order to stage an attack. Free on bail: Morgan Gliedman, who went into labor last week as police handcuffed her for allegedly keeping explosives in her apartment, leaves Manhattan Criminal Court with her lawyer on Tuesday . The New York Times reported in January that police interviewed Daniel Whittaker, a friend of Greene's who lives in upstate New York. Mr Whittaker, who is a corrections officer, was questioned because Greene told investigators he had given some weapons to 'a friend in law enforcement'. The main focus of the investigation, however, has been the apartment Greene and Gliedman lived in while she was pregnant with their child. Gliedman, 27, went into labor during her arrest and because she stopped doing heroin during her pregnancy, the child was born drug free. Inside the apartment, officers found . seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the . substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings. Target: Greene was allegedly seen sprinkling powder around the arch in Washington Square and watching it explode . Dangerous: The NYPD bomb squad was called in to remove the explosive that was discovered in the couple Greenwich Village apartment . The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive. Police . also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting . shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a . replica of an M203 grenade launcher. Several disturbing items were seized, . including: 'The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and . Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself . Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby . traps and explosives. Officers . were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and . Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to . their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported. 'Junkies': Morgan Gliedman, 27, and Aaron . Greene, 31, are both admitted heroin addicts - even though Gliedman was . heavily pregnant when the explosives were found at their apartment, . police say . The . apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street is near the apartment where . two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb . for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970. Greene . and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources said at the time. They said the pair were just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' according to the Daily Beast. Friends revealed to the New York Post . that Gliedman, a former student of New York prep school Dalton, was on a . safe track to success until she met Greene, who has a series of felony . weapons charges to his name. In court: Gliedman and her lawyer Gerald Shargel in Manhattan Criminal Court as she was granted bail . New mom: Gliedman displays her bump as she attends court . Moving on: She was ordered to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet and to go to rehab . Rehab-bound: Gliedman was whisked away to a mandatory 30-day treatment program . She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing. 'She . comes from a great family, raised on Park Avenue, went to a great . school, but then this guy introduced her to drugs,' a friend told the . Post. They added that Gliedman stopped doing heroin when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby was born drug-free. The newborn, named Melody Sunshine, is now being cared for by . Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a broker, and father, Dr. Paul Gliedman, head of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Brooklyn. 'She wants to get clean. She wants to address this legal issue. She wants to raise her daughter,' said celebrity bail bondsman Ira Judelson, who posted Gliedman's bail, in January. Following . the arrest, it emerged that the 27-year-old was already a suspect in a . robbery - and already on probation for drug possession.

Another day, another wave of Apple rumours - this time about the potential demise of the iPhone 5. A Chinese source claims the company will stop making its current flagship phone when it releases its upcoming, rumoured, iPhone 5S and iPhone Lite models. The reports claims Apple wants to focus its attentions on, and ultimately promote more sales of, the newer designs. These rumours come at the same time Apple is said to be having production difficulties with the new phones, in particular the iPhone 5S, meaning the release date could be pushed back to the end of September. A Chinese source claims Apple could discontinue its iPhone 5, pictured, to focus solely on the upcoming, rumoured, iPhone 5S and iPhone Lite models. This could be in a bid to boost sales of the newer designs . Chinese site ETNews believes Apple could discontinue the iPhone 5 to focus solely on its rumoured, upcoming new models. Earlier this year, industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claimed Apple was working on a low-cost handset. Dubbed iPhone Mini or iPhone Lite, the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made . of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera. Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400). Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen. There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year. The iPhone 5S was expected to be released on 13 September, with the cheaper version due at the start of October. Production problems are now said to have pushed this date back, meaning the iPhone Lite could be released before the high-end iPhone 5. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal claimed suppliers in Asia had said Apple recently asked for prototypes of screens . that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone. It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays. This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the . current model. Chinese site ETNews claims that the touchscreen technology currently used on the iPhone 5 is 'not suitable for low-volume production'. This means that when fewer people are buying the iPhone 5 because new models are on the market, Apple will potentially spend more money on production costs than they make back in sales. Apple is expected to therefore abandon production of the iPhone 5, focusing on the . high-end successor as well as the rumoured cheaper, plastic model dubbed the iPhone Mini or iPhone Lite. If true, this would go against Apple's current policy to keep its previous two models in production at a cheaper price, to attract lower-end customers. However, AppleInsider added that the company's CEO Tim Cook recently said the the iPhone 5 was the company's most popular iPhone 'by far.' The site also quotes recent data that suggests  the device makes up half of Apple's iPhone sales. In a separate report, AppleInsider has also learnt that the new models could be delayed due to production problems. According to a research note found by the site, written by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, there have been 'setbacks in the production of numerous components' meaning the handset may be pushed back to the end of September. The model was expected to launch on 13 September, with the iPhone Lite due at the start of October. This delay could see the cheaper iPhone released before the high-end model. The iPhone 5S is expected to have a fingerprint scanner and an updated camera and it may be these new features that are causing the delays. Accessory manufacturer Tactus published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model earlier this year. The design is rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera and could cost as little as £63 ($99) Apple is rumoured to be working on an iPhone 5S, due to launch in September, as well as cheaper, plastic models dubbed iPhone Lite.

If the rumours are true Apple's giant iPad could be same size as its MacBook Pro. It would also be bigger than some laptops, including HP's 11.6-inch EliteBook. This mock-up shows what Apple's iPhone 6 handset could look like. It was designed by French technology site NowhereElse. The iPhone 6 - originally expected to be released in 2014 - could be announced as early as 27 September . At the same time Apple was said to be . working on a larger, 5.7-inch iPhone dubbed a 'phablet' because its a . cross between a phone and a tablet computer. These rumours originated in a note to investors written by industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets. Apple traditionally unveils new handsets at an annual event in September and this was bolstered by claims this week from the company's CFO Peter Oppenheimer who said the company was 'on track to have a very busy fall.' As well as the new phones, Apple is believed to be working on a new MacBook Pro and iMac. Latest rumours from suppliers in Asia suggest Apple is working on a 13-inch version of its iPad tablet.

If the rumours are true, this giant iPad could be three inches bigger than the current model, pictured . A 13-inch iPad would make the tablet computer the same size as the company's MacBook Pro, pictured . Mr White added the iPhone Mini might 'have a curved back casing made of coloured plastic and will be thicker than the iPhone 5.' Other rumours to have generated from White's note include that the iPhone 6 - expected in 2014 - will have a much larger screen than the current 4inch iPhone 5 model. These rumours were also said to have come from sources within the phone maker's supply chain in Asia. One person said to have 'direct knowledge of the matter, according to Reuters, said: 'They constantly change product specifications almost to the final moment, so you're not really sure whether this is the final prototype.'","Reports claim the iPhone 5 could soon be discontinued .

Firefighters responding to a domestic fire got a shock when they were confronted by dozens of exotic snakes - some of them venomous. Among the 28 reptiles discovered in the house in North Davis, Utah, were six deadly species - including a Gaboon viper, which is widely considered one of the world's deadliest. Usually found in the jungles of Africa, Gaboon vipers have the highest venom yield of any venomous snake and fangs which commonly measure up to two inches long. Venomous: A Western diamondback rattlesnake, like one of the snakes found by firefighters as they battled a blaze at a home in North Davis, Utah.

Local fire chief Mark Becraft told ABC News: 'We always have a search team go in to clear the house and make sure there are no humans. 'They came out with an all clear but said that there were numerous snakes caged in the house ... They definitely didn’t want to handle them.' The spooked firemen called in the . local Animal Control, who handed the issue over to the state's Division . of Wildlife. Chief Becraft added that he was 'sure glad to hand it to . someone else to deal with.' My, what big teeth you have... The fangs on highly venomous Gaboon vipers can measure up to two inches long. (Stock image) As well as the Gaboon viper, the haul of serpents included five albino western diamondbacks, an American species the venom of which causes necrosis - the premature death of cells in living tissue. Gaboon viper venom also causes necrosis, but is less potent. However the volume of venom it injects into a victim means that any bite must be considered a serious medical emergency. Brad Hunt of the Utad Division of Wildlife told ABC News: 'The Gaboon viper is considered one of the most dangerous snakes in the world. 'It has very long fangs and very potent venom.' Anti-venom for Gaboon vipers is not readily available in the U.S. Officials believe the owner of the house is a snake professional or breeder, and suspect that at least the Gaboon viper was smuggled from outside the state. Clint Thacker, Director of Davis County Animal Services, told ABC that the snakes were kept in immaculate conditions. The confiscated western diamonbacks were given to an animal rescue centre specialising in rehabilitating snakes and reptiles which the Gaboon viper is being kept by the Division of Wildlife while authorities continue their investigation. However, the remaining 22 legally owned snakes will be returned.","Homeowner could face charges over his collection of serpents .

Officers are keen to discover why the pair, from Paisley, had booked into a hotel just a few miles from their own home. They also want to know where the pair went in the nine hours between checking into the Greenock hotel at around 4pm on Thursday and returning to their room at around 1am.

Payout: The college student who was taken to county jail and subsequently forgotten for five days, settled with the Department of Justice Tuesday for $4million . Torture: Mr Chong endured five days forgotten in the cell, drinking his own urine and hallucinating . “It was an accident,” Mr Chong said in a news conference on Tuesday attended by KPBS, “a really bad, horrible accident.” Mr Chong's attorney Eugene Iredale said that the Justice Department is still trying to figure out how Mr Chong slipped from their notice, but the inspector general still has no answers. The DEA did not have a system in place at the time on how to treat detainees, but has since installed camera in each of the cells and holds daily inspections. “What happened to Daniel should never happen to any human being on the face of the planet,' Mr Ireland said in the press conference. 'The government has recognized the profound suffering that Daniel underwent,' he said. Mr Iredale said that no one has been disciplined for the drug bust, and that no criminal charges will be filed. The student originally planned to sue for $20million. Mr Chong said he is in good health back UC San Diego studying engineering. The engineering student was swept up as one of nine suspects in an April 21 drug raid that netted 18,000 ecstasy pills, other drugs and weapons.

Seven suspects were taken to county . jail, and another was released, but Mr Chong was somehow left behind, said Amy Roderick, a . spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration. 'Each suspect was interviewed in separate interview rooms, and frequently moved around between rooms and cells,' Ms Roderick said. 'The individual in question was accidentally left in one of the cells.' Mr Chong said federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents told him he would be let go.

When he was found on April 25, he was taken to a hospital and treated for cramps, dehydration and a perforated lung - the result of ingesting the broken glass. 'When they opened the door, one of them said `Here's the water you've been asking for,' Mr Chong said. 'But I was pretty out of it at the time.' Mr Chong also ingested a white powder DEA agents said was left in the cell accidentally and later identified as methamphetamine. It took him nearly five days at Sharp hospital to recover, he said.","Daniel Chong, 24, was arrested on April 21 in a drug bust and taken to county jail for questioning .

Britons can still find bargain summer holidays in Europe - because the prices of food, drink and entertainment in some of the most popular resorts have plummeted. The drop in prices are a result of bars and restaurants competing for custom while holiday budgets shrink. Despite the pound struggling against the euro, holidaymakers heading off to Crete will find that prices have fallen by almost a fifth. The price of food, drink and entertainment in Crete, Greece, has fallen by almost a fifth since last year . Sunny Beach in Bulgaria was the cheapest resort in Europe at £76.35 for holiday essentials . Meanwhile, those going to the Costa del Sol will save 15.3 per cent compared with the same time last year. A . Post Office survey compared the cost of 12 holiday essentials, . including sun cream, a three-course meal for a family of four, a glass . of wine and a pedalo ride. The cheapest resort in Europe was Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, where the items cost £76.35, followed by the Costa del Sol at £77.68 and Mallorca in Spain at £91.02, according to the Post Office Holiday Costs Barometer. The holiday essentials added up to £96.27 in the Algarve, Portugal, and only 30p more in Marmaris, Turkey. Britons who opt for somewhere a little closer to home will pay the price, with costs in Bournemouth rising 11.8 per cent to £139.28 since the summer of 2012.

With her painstakingly-applied make up and fashionable clothes, Seanie Nammock is like any other teenager. But behind her stylish looks, the teenager is battling a devastating genetic condition that is slowly paralysing her. The 17-year-old, from West London, is suffering from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disorder that is turning her muscle and tendon into bone. Seanie Nammock, 17, has a debilitating genetic condition that causes her to grow a 'second skeleton' Her arms are locked onto a bent position and she struggles to raise them above her waist. Seanie with her 22 year old sister Sinead Nammock (right), who is helping to raise money to fight the condition . Already, her arms have become locked into a bent position at her waist, rendering them immobile like a statue. The teenager has grown extra bone over her shoulders so she can no longer reach above her waist and struggles to brush or wash her own hair or dress without assistance - and the condition could get even worse. The slightest knock or bump causes painful flare-ups that trigger the irreversible bone growth which locks her joints into place, and she cannot have any injections or biopsies as this too may cause unwanted bone to form. Seanie with her mother Marian Granaghan (left), 58, and sister Sinead. Miss Granaghan says she lives in constant fear her daughter will be in an accident that will exacerbate her condition . Bone growth caused by FOPs is different to regular bones . Happier times: Seanie as a baby. She was not diagnosed with the condition until she was 12. Right, Seanie and Sinead as youngsters . Perversely, the condition makes it harder for her to avoid accidents as she finds it hard to steady herself on banisters when climbing the stairs and her locked arms affect her balance. She can't even out out her hands to break her fall, a situation she describes as 'scary'. But the debilitating condition has not hampered her hobbies or social life. A keen cook, she loves to shop and spend time with her friends. Sisterly love: Sinead is climbing Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to raise cash to combat Seanie's condition . 'My friends are brilliant, they do my hair for me sometimes and help me get my coat on and anything I can't do really,' she said. Seanie uses barbecue tongs to apply make up and a comb with an extended handle to do her hair. The teenager, who passed 10 GCSEs, including five A grades, told the Sunday People: 'I just crack on with things to be honest. There is no other option. 'It's taken me the last five years to get to the point where I'm able to push it to the back of my mind and just carry on.' The condition is particularly frustrating for Seanie because before she was diagnosed she was a keen sports fan, playing tag rugby and frequently visiting the gym. Maria Granaghan, Seanie's mother said: 'Her friends are all great. They all look out for each other and just get on with being girls and enjoying themselves.' Seanie was diagnosed with FOP in 2008 after she was admitted to hospital following a minor trampoline accident. 'She had fallen on her back and it had caused a sore lump to form,' said Miss Granaghan. 'It was huge, hard red and hot to the touch, so I took her to the hospital to get it checked out.' Unfamiliar with the symptoms, doctors at St Mary's Hospital told her not to worry, and sent her home - but when the lump didn't clear and Seanie began complaining of severe pain, her mother rushed her to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. MRI scans and further testing revealed the diagnosis. 'It was a horrible shock,' said Mrs Granaghan, speaking in 2009. She added that she is always on the lookout when she's out with Seanie, living in fear that a skateboarder or someone on a scooter will crash into her. There is no cure for FOP and only about 600 people in the world have been diagnosed with it. Seanie is forced to rely on over-the-counter pain killers to combat the condition. Like many other girls her age, Seanie is into make up and fashion. She has adopted more sedate pursuits because of her FOP, but used to be a keen sportswoman . Even a simple injection at the dentist is off-limits, so the teenager has to take good care of her teeth. The family is trying to raise £120,000 for the FOP research team, which gets no funding from the government, and her sister Sinead is setting off on a charity trek up Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to raise cash later this week. Seanie is furious that the battle to cure the condition gets so little support. She said: 'If you get me started on that I will really have a right old rant, especially when I hear about girls getting boob jobs on the NHS or politicians and their spending sprees.'

The tempestuous relationship between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton still has the potential to shock almost four decades later. A major new BBC drama about the Hollywood lovers had to be re-written because it was littered with too many swear words. BBC bosses panicked when they received the first draft of ‘Burton and Taylor’ which will be broadcast tomorrow night on BBC Four because it contained 49 different uses of the F word as well as a reference to the c word. One source close to the production, which stars Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter said bosses ordered a re-write to edit out the swearing . Taylor and Burton, who married and divorced each other twice over - both swore like troopers particularly during their spectacular off-screen bust-ups. But producers thought the language in the original script was too blue even for a drama to be broadcast at 9.00 pm. One source close to the production, which stars Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter said: 'The BBC thought the language in the production was a problem and William Ivory the writer was asked to remove a lot of the swearing. 'Bosses said ""Billy we love the script but we simply can’t have 49 f***s and a c-word"". 'Billy was just trying to capture the rhythm of their speech and simply hadn’t realised just how much swearing he had included in the script.' The toned down version of the screenplay still doesn’t pull any punches and it may still strike some viewers as too risque. The tempestuous pair - who married twice - became lovers on the set of the film Cleopatra . Both characters, who became lovers on the set of the film Cleopatra, use the f word including in one scene where they row and Taylor slaps her husband around the face. He tells her to stop ‘f***ing hitting him’ and she says she will when he ‘f***ing apologises’ In another scene Burton uses the c-word to describe the critics who have just savaged the production of Private Lives in which they are both starring. The drama focuses on the couple’s decision to star in a 1983 production of Noel Coward’s comedy about a divorced couple. Although the two stars, who made eleven films together, are no longer lovers they can’t help but reminisce about their previous sex life. In one scene set in a hotel room Burton bemoans the fact that he is getting older and that he struggled to ‘get his sword of his sheath and wave it about a bit’ during a recent production of Camelot. Taylor, seen here with Burton, is portrayed as still being deeply in love with the actor and desperate to rekindle their romance . A delighted Taylor tells him 'Not like you Richard,' before she is told off for having the mind of a ‘collier’. Taylor then asks her former husband 'How do you f*** anyway?  You can barely move?' He replies: 'There are ways and means my love. 'Remember that train we took to New York and we lay there and let the rocking of the carriage do the job.' In a flashback scene, set ten years earlier Burton asks his wife why she is dressed like an ‘over-ripe tart’ while they are preparing to exercise in a hotel room. She replies: 'I thought maybe we could screw afterwards,' and then bemoans the state of her breasts. She tells Burton: 'I am holding my bosom. Its bouncing up and down. Richard I am 40 years of age. They are 40 years of age.   They have gained a certain amount of elasticity.' A besotted Burton tells her: 'You are so gorgeous. Your tits are gorgeous, your arse is gorgeous, your legs, your belly,  Did I mention your tits?  Let’s just screw.' She tells him: 'We can be extra vigorous.' Taylor is portrayed as still being deeply in love with Burton and desperate to rekindle their romance. She is resentful of Burton’s new found love for actress Sally Hay who he would eventually marry during the run of Private Lives. For his part Burton wants to re-assure that Taylor she will always have place in his life even though he realises he most move on. He tells her: 'I will always love you Elizabeth, as long as I live. But us together it will destroy me. I can’t do it. That is what I had to say to you. That is why I did this bloody job.' Dr Frances Warner, an Emeritus Fellow at Oxford University, who was a close friend of Burton’s and who organised the couple’s second wedding reception said: 'I think that was the case. He did try and move on and eventually he did. 'He and Elizabeth remained in constant contact and they did telephone each other a lot. 'But all of that was understood by Sally who supported him and was an actual saint.' Jose Eber, the Beverly Hills-based hair stylist who was one of Taylor’s friends said the fact that she swore a lot simply added to her appeal. He said: 'So what. She was a real person who was passionate about life.' 'She said what she wanted to say and I applaud her for being herself.'","BBC 4 programme re-written because of copious swear words .

The license granted by the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms now gives Mr Wilson government approval to make and distribute guns. Mr Wilson told Ars Technica: 'The big thing it allows me to do is that it makes me manufacture under the law—everything that manufacturers are allowed to do. 'I can sell some of the pieces that we've been making. I can do firearms transactions and transport.' Defense Distributed has already made several prototypes of 3D-printable gun parts, including for the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which is allowed under U.S. law without a license. The group has made its blueprints available as free downloads via its own distribution website after other 3D printing websites decided to remove the files.

Two Texas-based companies, whose names are not known, have since volunteered space and a 3D printer for the team to carry out manufacturing and ballistics testing. Mr Wilson said he will not actually start making and selling guns until he receives an 'add-on' to his license which will allow him to deal in a broader range of firearms, including fully automatic weapons.

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 21:22 EST, 22 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:08 EST, 23 July 2013 . Biopics have a gruesome obsession with the decay of stardom. We’ve seen it too many times in recent dramas — Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady, for example, depicting an aged Margaret Thatcher wracked by dementia. The love affair between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was the romance of the century. They burned like phosphorus together, with an intensity that made other lives seem feeble glimmers. With the release last year of Burton’s candid, vivid diaries, it’s a story that was begging to be told on screen. Helena Bonham Carter and Dominic West as Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor . So why did Burton And Taylor (BBC4) focus on the final sputterings of their great passion, when they met to play Noel Coward’s Private Lives on Broadway? Elizabeth, the Hollywood child star from Hampstead Garden Suburb, was a bloated wreck in 1983, addicted to pills and booze. Richard, the son of a Port Talbot miner, was less than a year from death, crippled by pain and hollowed out by alcoholism. There’s a story here — how Taylor, insecure at 50 and yearning for past glories, engineered a reunion with Burton on stage, in the hope their love would be rekindled and they could marry each other for a third time. But it’s a footnote, an epilogue to the epic feature of their love. The parties, the screaming rows, the  jewellery, the breakdowns — we saw none of it, until the closing minutes of this drama. And that scene, with the couple doing a drunken keep fit  routine to the strains of Frank Sinatra before falling into bed, outshone everything that had come before. The couple had a tempestuous booze-fuelled relationship and remarried after their first marriage ended . This production looked lavish. And Helena Bonham Carter did her considerable best — there’s a seam of insanity that glitters in her acting, whether she’s playing a villainess in Harry Potter or a heartless swindler in Les Miserables. As Liz Taylor, she seemed to make the madness external, to wrap herself in it. At the core was a lonely,  middle-aged woman, swaddled in the trappings of stardom: the venomous personal assistants, the packs of  lap-dogs, the parrot called Alvin that travelled everywhere with her. Bonham Carter caught the husky drawl and the bored manner to perfection. She looked more like Courteney Cox but that didn’t matter: this was a performance, not an impression. Dominic West fell far short, however. He looked like a much younger Burton — in 1983, the great actor was jowly and raddled, ripe for the stroke that killed him. But West sounded like John Humphrys, and he exuded none of the menace, thunder or charisma that had bewitched audiences. At times he looked more like an accountant than a Shakespearean. The script, by William Ivory, had strong lines that conjured up the aggressive banter between the couple. Burton, trying to sleep off a hangover while his ex-wife flirted girlishly with him, growled: ‘Elizabeth, I swear to God, if you don’t stop talking, I’m going to climb out of this bed and drive back to the Dorchester in my bloody underpants.’ Homage of the week: In his TV sitcom more than 50 years ago, Tony Hancock did a send-up of the radio series The Archers where he spent five minutes pretending to die — noisily, hammily and shamelessly. Count Arthur Strong (BBC2) had the sheer chutzpah to reprise the gag. That took some nerve! But there was a time in their lives when . he would have done exactly what he threatened. That’s what this drama . lacked: the colossal flamboyance of Burton and Taylor when they were . gods. At least they’re still stars.  Everyone knows who they are. By contrast, . ITV’s new quiz show, Take On The Twisters, didn’t have a clue what it . was or how it wanted to be. The set looked like The Weakest Link, the music sounded like a cross . between Millionaire and Dr Who, the contestants seemed to think they . were playing Blockbusters and the final round was stolen straight from . Deal Or No Deal. The central concept was good: players have to answer general knowledge . questions fast enough to keep six egg timers from running out. Every . correct answer means they can turn one timer over: hence the Twisters in . the title. It might evolve to be good viewing, if the faults are ironed out. But in . this opening edition, much of the format didn’t work, and the show had a . runaway winner before it was halfway through. It’s hard to keep watching  a long, gruelling ending . . . and that’s as true of quizzes as  of biopics.","Burton and Taylor (BBC4) *** .

Pictures captured with an infrared thermal imager show that the penguins’ outer surfaces are on average between four and six degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding air. Researchers at the University of Glasgow studied images of 40 penguins and discovered that the part of a penguin that is covered by thick plumage, dubbed a 'cold coat', is colder than the surrounding air. Scroll down for video . Pictures captured with an infrared thermal imager show that the penguins' outer surfaces are cooler than the surrounding air .

The only exposed parts of the animals that are warmer than the air are the unfeathered eyes, beaks and feet. The scientists also discovered that the only part of the birds’ surface that is warmer than freezing is the eye. Dr Dominic McCafferty, a biophysical ecologist at the University of Glasgow, told the BBC: ‘Most of the body that is covered by thick plumage was found to be, on average, 4 to 6 degrees Celsius colder than surrounding air temperature. ‘At first, we were very surprised by this discovery.’ The scientists believe that the observations of the breeding colony in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, suggest that extreme radiative cooling draws heat from a penguin’s surface. The only part of the birds' surface that is warmer than freezing is the eye . Dr McCafferty next hopes to use thermal imaging to study how huddling together helps penguins save energy . Radiative cooling occurs when heat is released into space from the penguins’ body surface making it cooler than might otherwise be expected. The report, which was published in Biology Letters, also claims that because of the penguins’ layers of insulating fat and feathers they can maintain a body temperature of 39 degrees Celsius even when the air temperature is minus 40. Dr McCafferty next hopes to use thermal imaging to study how huddling together helps penguins save energy. Radiative cooling is the process by which a body loses heat through thermal radiation. It is commonly experienced on cloudless nights when heat is released into the atmosphere from the surface of the Earth, or the outer surface of an animal. It is the sum of the three sources of radiation: outgoing radiation from objects versus incoming sky and cloud radiation. Maximum radiative cooling occurs when the sky is clear, it is dry and there is little wind.","The outer surface of an emperor penguin is colder than the air around it .

The White House is weighing a far-reaching package of legislation that would tighten restrictions on firearm sales and ownership by requiring universal background checks for gun buyers and creating a national database to track the weapons. Gun rights advocates say the measures would crush private sales of firearms and lead to government confiscation of legally-owned guns. A group led by Vice President Joe Biden to study gun control is considering the various measures and compiling a list of them to send to President Obama before the end of the month. The group convened after 20 children and six adults were killed in a gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School last month. New laws: The White House is weighing a far-reaching package of legislation that would tighten restrictions on firearm sales and ownership. Gun rights activists say it would hurt sales at firearm shows like this one in Sandy, Utah . Broader: The measures the White House is considering are far broader than simply a reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons, which Obama has already said he would support . Obama plans to review the recommendations and send his own package of proposals to Congress. 'This is not something that I will be putting off,' Obama said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press.' The measures the White House is considering are far broader than simply a reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons, which Obama has already said he would support, the Washington Post's Philip Rucker reported Saturday. 'They are very clearly committed to looking at this issue comprehensively,' Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, told the Post. Gross, who has been involved in the discussions, said the proposals under consideration are 'a deeper exploration than just the assault-weapons ban.' One such proposal would require universal background checks for all gun buyers and could put a dent in business at gun shows and online, according to gun rights activists. Leader: Obama appointed Vice President Joe Biden to lead the effort in finding an effective way to tighten gun laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . Current law requires federally licensed gun dealers, such as Wal-Mart, to verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent before selling that person a gun. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day. But private sellers, most of whom sell firearms online or at gun shows, are not subject to the same requirements. Federal law requires private sellers to refuse a buyer if they suspect that person might not pass a background check. But no check is required and no paperwork is filed regarding the process. The White House is considering reaching out to Wal-Mart and other gun retailers to help build public support for the universal background check, since the retailers could benefit from a potentially negative effect on private sales. Tragedy: President Barack Obama reacts as Counterterrorism chief John Brennan briefs him at the White House on the details of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary . Another proposal under consideration would create a national gun-tracking database, which gun rights advocates oppose because they believe it would lead to government confiscation of legally-owned firearms. The database would require that guns be registered or permitted. In a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, that went viral online last week, gun owner and Marine Joshua Boston explained his reasoning for opposing the database. 'I will not register my weapons should this bill be passed, as I do not believe it is the government’s right to know what I own,' he wrote, expressing the fears of millions of gun owners. 'Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime.' Opposition: Gun owners like U.S. Marine Corporal Joshua Boston, pictured, oppose a national database to track firearms . Boston's argument is rooted in the foundation of the Second Amendment, better known as the right to bear arms, which was originally established as a means to protect against tyranny. The powerful National Rifle Association insists that the answer to ending gun violence against innocents is in improving mental health care, an area that the White House is also reviewing for potential legislative changes. 'We’re going to need to work on making access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,' Obama said in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting.  'We’re going to need to look more closely at a culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence.' Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman who carried out the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, reportedly had a history of mental health problems.","President to push for law that includes universal background checks, creation of national database of gun owners .

Huma Abedin will be taking a long vacation from her role as Hillary Clinton’s right-hand woman next month to ‘support her family’ during husband Anthony Weiner’s mayoral campaign. Though the official line is that Abedin has long had this vacation in the works, it comes just as Weiner’s campaign has taken a huge dive amid revelations of the former congressman’s continued sexting. The break from helping Clinton transition into private life may not help Abedin find privacy of her own, though, as Weiner’s Sydney Leathers seems content to continue publicly shaming the serial sexter and just after Abedin was spotted dining with a top Clinton aide. Time off: Anthony Weiner's wife Huma Abedin will be taking a long vacation from her role as Hillary Clinton's right-hand-woman as her husdand's campaign continues to unravel . ‘Huma is not taking a leave of absence,’ a Weiner campaign source told Politico. ‘But she will be taking vacation time in August to support her family during Anthony’s campaign. She had always intended to do this.’ The vacation comes as Hillary Clinton’s dance card for the summer dwindles down to nothing and she and Bill head to East Hampton for the month of August. Politico’s sources insist that, with the mayoral primary reaching the home stretch, Abedin wanted to be with Weiner and their 18-month-old son Jordan. Why now? The official line from the Weiner campaign is that Abedin has long had the vacation scheduled, though it comes at a conspicuous time for the campaign . Abedin was a major focus of coverage of her husband beginning the moment she approached the podium to speak on July 23 after a website released screenshots of highly sexual interactions between Weiner and political blogger Sydney Leathers. Abedin maintained at the time that she would stand by Weiner in spite of his renewed scandal. She hasn’t spoken publicly on the matter since. She also failed to appear in a recent campaign ad released by Weiner. Family time: Abedin intends to take the time to help her family during her husband's campaign, but what form that help will take is not known . Some say Clinton insider Philippe Reines had a hand in her decision not to support her husband by appearing in the ad. Whose image Reines was concerned about, Abedin’s or Hillary Clinton’s, is unclear. Also unclear is how Abedin will, exactly, be supporting her family during her long holiday. As Sydney Leathers makes the media rounds, with catty appearances on Howard Stern and rumors she’ll be appearing in a pornographic film, Weiner certainly has his hands full. Perhaps her role will be as counselor to her husbands it becomes more and more clear that her support can’t save his flagging campaign. She hinted the help may not be political by choosing not to appear in a recent ad for the Weiner campaign. Here, she dines with Clinton insider Philippe Reines, who may have counseled her to stay out of the ad .","Abedin plans to spend August to 'support her family' during Weiner's campaign .

A debt-ridden hospital trust that plans to axe 750 jobs is spending more than £25,000 a month on an American IT expert. Rotherham Hospital Trust paid around £40 million for a computer system that has never worked. In a bid to repair the failing system the trust is paying £25,000 a month, plus hotel bills and air fares, to U.S. IT expert Larry Blevins - who has even advised the White House. Staff at the crisis-hit trust are furious that taxpayers is picking up the bill for airline tickets, laundry and restaurant bills. Rotherham Hospital Trust is planning to axe 750 jobs in an attempt to save money but spent £40 million on a computer system that lost 5,000 outpatient appointments . Flight tickets cost £4,000 when Mr Blevins flew in from the USA for a three month initial period. His basic expenses over a six week period at Sheffield's Hilton Hotel came to £2,300 for accommodation, laundry, taxis to work, meals and non-alcoholic beverages. His contract has now been extended and he remains as project manager for the struggling IT system. Hospital chiefs have told staff that the Electronic Patient Record System is being retained despite ongoing problems. The failing IT system caused chaos when it 'lost' 5,000 outpatient appointments in a 'black hole' which cost the hospital £1.6 million and had patients turning up at the wrong times for appointments that doctors knew nothing about. The hospital trust has also admitted that three other consultants - Michael Morgan, the trust's interim chief executive, barrister and accountant Tim Bolot, who is leading the financial recovery, and Joshua Ejdelbaum in a supporting role - are costing £92,400 a month including VAT. In February the trust was found by NHS watchdog, Monitor to be 'in significant breach of the terms of its authorisation' for its failure to deliver on its savings plans. On-going problems with the controversial patient record system - originally budgeted at £30 million - were also highlighted by consultants from PricewaterhouseCoopers who reported that it would run to at least £40 million. London based healthcare management firm Bolt Partners were called in to lead the recovery and restructure the trust. They provided Mr Morgan, Mr Bolot and Mr Ejdelbaum initially on an interim basis. A trust spokesperson confirmed that Mr Blevins, described as an 'Electronic Patient Record System expert' had amassed 'basic expenses from the hotel to the hospital, meals - some bought from the hotel bar - and non-alcoholic beverages'. She added: ‘The laundry expense was included within the hotel deal package and £4,000 of the monies was allocated as his fare from the United States as part of his contract.’ Last October the hospital told staff that more than 750 jobs would go and wards would close in a bid to save cash. The hospital is currently making cuts in a bid to save £5million. Since then several senior officials, including the chief executive, have left and job cuts have still not been made. A source for the health union UNISON said: ‘There is still no word on when the trust will even begin the process of appointing a new chief executive. ‘Do they really need to keep up this level of spending? We knew the appointment of a new chief executive will take seven to nine months but when will it start.’","Former White House adviser Larry Blevins was employed to improve Rotherham NHS Hospital Trust's failing £40 million IT system .

Her mummified remains were recovered from . a crypt in the town of Vác, Hungary in 1994, along with 242 naturally . mummified people - some of whom were still wearing items of clothing . they were buried in. Scientists . have previously performed molecular analyses of a chest sample taken . from the mummy and deduced that her death was the result of TB. They thought it would be possible to find TB DNA extremely well preserved in her body. However, the team from the university have now used metagenomics to describe the open-ended sequencing of DNA from samples. The discovery could help scientists explore the significance of mixed-strain . infections, especially during times of TB outbreaks, which could lead . to new ways of treating mixed-strain infections. The team, which also included scientists from University College London, Vác Museum and Budapest, had the difficult task of identifying TB DNA in a historical specimen. University of Warwick researchers have recovered tuberculosis genomes from the lung tissue of the mummy using a technique known as metagenomics. Combined with research into contemporary TB (pictured), their discovery could help scientists explore the significance of mixed-strain infections . The technique uses cutting-edge genome . sequencing approaches and avoids the complicated and unreliable process . of using bacteria or amplification of DNA. The results revealed that the woman was infected with two different trains of TB bacterium. The finding is important for tracking the evolution of microbes and could be key to fighting TB, which killed almost 1.5 million people in 2010, according to the World Health Organisation. Mark Pallen, Professor of Microbial Genomics at Warwick Medical School, said: 'Most other attempts to recover DNA . sequences from historical or ancient samples have suffered from the risk . of contamination, because they rely on amplification of DNA in the . laboratory. 'The beauty of metagenomics is that it provides a simple but highly informative, assumption-free, one-size-fits-all approach that works in a wide variety of contexts' A similar approach was used by another group of scientists to recover a leprosy genome from historical material, a few weeks ago. The research will be published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The DNA taken from the mummy, combined with research on contemporary TB, will be used to explore the significance of mixed-strain infections, particularly when tuberculosis is highly prevalent. Professor Pallen said: 'It was fascinating to see the similarities between the TB genome sequences we recovered and the genome of a recent outbreak strain in Germany. 'It shows once more that using metagenomics can be remarkably effective in tracking the evolution and spread of microbes...[and] revealed that some strain lineages have been circulating in Europe for more than two centuries.' This is the sister of Terézia Hausmann - Barbara. The mummies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in the Hungarian town of Vác in 1994 in wooden coffins decorated with paintings of skulls . The mummies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in the Hungarian town of Vác in 1994 in  wooden coffins decorated with paintings of skulls and have been studied to try and unlock the secrets of TB infections. The bodies were mummified because of low temperatures and constant humidity and air pressure in the crypt and gradually dried out, according to a Fox News report from last August. The 242 remarkably preserved bodies represented a cross section of Vác society some 200 years ago and the mummies' bones showed visible signs of TB mutations. Almost 90 per cent of the mummies ranging from babies to people aged over 65, had been infected by TB at some point and 35 per cent were reportedly suffering from the infection at the time.

Two officers in uniform smile proudly for the camera as World War One rages just a few miles away in these newly-unearthed photographs. But all is not as it seems in this fascinating yet seemingly innocuous image, believed to have been taken in October 1916. The young officer saluting and wearing a New Zealand uniform and distinctive 'lemon-squeezer' hat is, in fact, a woman. This image is not of a young, fresh-faced officer in World War One, but a mystery French woman . Lovers or friends? Little evidence about the pair's relationship exists. The pictures seem playful, even intimate, and suggest two people at ease with one another . The discovery of the image has sparked excitement and no little speculation among Great War scholars, who believe they have identified the male officer in the pictures. But mystery still surrounds the identity of the woman, believed to be French and in her late twenties to early thirties. The intimacy of the photos suggest a deep friendship - and possibly even more - between the New Zealand officer and the vivacious, evidently modern lady. He is believed to be Captain Albert Arthur Chapman, born in Tasmania, Australia, in March 1880, and therefore 36 to 38 at the time of the photographs. He was identified from his collar and cap badges as a member of the 7th Southland Mounted Rifles. His companion has put on his first lieutenant's tunic, his New Zealand Division hat, his baggy officer's trousers, belts, puttees and even his spurs. Intriguingly, she has an engagement or wedding ring on her left hand. Speculation also arises from the picture where she is sat on the dashing officer's knee, her hand placed tenderly on his shoulder. New Zealand historian Andrew Macdonald believes he has correctly identified the officer. He said: 'In the records of the New Zealand Pioneer (Maori) Battalion there are only two officers who meet these criteria. One of these did not reach the rank of captain, leaving Albert Arthur Chapman as the prime candidate'. 'His service record fits the man in these images like a glove. He was transferred from the Pioneer Battalion to serve with the New Zealand division headquarter staff behind the lines of the Somme in April, May and June 1916. He was transferred back to the same Pioneer battalion when the New Zealand Division entered the battle [from 15 September]. Transformation: In this photograph it becomes clear that the young officer is actually a woman. But the true nature of the couple's relationship is lost in the mists and murk of the Great War . 'He was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1916. He won the Military Cross in June 1918.' The building seen in the background of the garden shots has been identified by a local historian and blogger, Frédéric Bellegeulle, as the 'Villa des Acacias' on the Rue Saint Denis in Hallencourt, near Abbeville. The pictures were found among a batch of 21 glass photographic plates, found in Hallencourt, 30 miles east of the battlefields of 1916, unearthed as part of The Independent's series of  'lost images' of the First World War. Dominique Zanardi, proprietor of the . 'Tommy' café in Pozières in the heart of the Somme battlefield, was the . first to realise the young officer and the woman were one and the same. Captain Chapman must have visited the woman at least twice because the images show him as both a first lieutenant and later as a captain. Little more than that is known. Is the ring on her finger an engagement ring from Chapman or her wedding ring? Had her husband died in the fighting? Was he still at war? One thing we know for sure - Chapman returned unmarried to New Zealand. Somewhere along the way their relationship, whatever it was, ended. There is one final theory, almost impossibly tragic yet not beyond the realms of possibility. A flu pandemic swept Francein 1918, killing 400,000. Among that grim toll was a sixth of Hallencourt's population. Did he return to New Zealand heartbroken and in mourning? Records show Captain Chapman never married. Was he never able to recover from losing this playful, smiling woman, forever nursing bittersweet memories of an impossibly bright afternoon in a foreign garden? We may never know.","Mysterious 'officer' from Great War is actually a French woman .

Applauded: Tory Party Chairman Grant Shapps has jumped to the defence of BBC broadcaster John Humphrys . The BBC’s coverage of the Government’s welfare reforms has sought to paint them as ‘Armageddon’ for the nation, a senior minister said yesterday. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps accused BBC bosses of letting their ‘personal views take hold’, covering the Coalition’s attempts to rein in the welfare bill as though the world were ending. He spoke out amid a row over the way the BBC Trust censured respected presenter John Humphrys for a programme exposing the truth about the bloated welfare state. The Trust condemned the TV show as a breach of its impartiality rules after it discussed the ‘dependency culture’ in Mr Humphrys’ home city of Cardiff, where he found some claimants prefer life on benefits to working. But Mr Shapps said BBC officials should have ‘applauded’ the Today anchorman and condemned other coverage by the BBC as biased against the Government. He said the corporation must remain impartial and objective, unlike newspapers which are allowed to hold political views. ‘John Humphrys’ report was a robust analysis of our welfare reforms and he should be applauded not lambasted for his forensic analysis,’ Mr Shapps said. ‘The BBC is not a newspaper and needs to remember it’s a state broadcaster who should be providing an objective analysis of events. ‘Too often it seems the senior management allow their personal views to take hold and cloud their editorial judgment when they don’t agree with a policy.’ He added: ‘There was a weekend last autumn where a number of welfare caps were coming in. Watching the BBC you could have been forgiven for thinking this was Armageddon. 'The broadcast was so unrelentingly over the top. I think that is irresponsible.’ Mr Shapps said the public backs the Government’s cap on welfare payments at £26,000 per family to ensure that those out of work do not get paid more than the average working family. The BBC said: ‘Inevitably there will be disagreements about the reporting of any given political story, however we are satisfied that our coverage of the welfare reforms was fair, balanced and impartial.’ Criticised: Today Programme anchorman John Humphrys was slammed by the BBC Trust this week for breaching its impartiality rules in a documentary about the welfare state broadcast in 2011 .","Grant Shapps backs veteran broadcaster over controversial documentary .

The only time that Jason Wise didn't attack his wife was when she was pregnant and so in a desperate attempt to stop the beatings Suzanne tried her hardest to be pregnant as often as possible. There were 13 pregnancies in all, resulting in 4 children. 30-year-old Suzanne finally found the courage to leave her husband and have him arrested after he attempted to kill her in a drunken rage while two of her children were in the house. Suzanne Wise suffered ten years of abuse at the hands of her husband Jason. His final attack in 2009 almost killed her (left) and today she appeared on This Morning (right) to warn other women of the dangers of living with a violent man . She escaped that night by biting him in the testicles so hard that it gave her the chance to run to a neighbour who called the police and an ambulance and Suzanne was rushed to hospital. Jason, 40, is now serving a four-year prison sentence for that attack and today Suzanne appeared on This Morning to encourage other women in similiar situations to leave. She said: 'I can't believe I stayed there so long. When he was charming he was brilliant, the best ...  when he was evil he was the the worst. Scroll down for more . 'The first time he strangled me with a bed frame - about two weeks in to the relationship. 'But I thought it was me making him be like that. 'It got worse and worse and worse. I was lonely and ashamed and a lot of people knew but I kept myself hidden away.' Describing the awful night that she realised he actually wanted to kill her Suzanne, who works as an assistant in a care home, said: 'We were staying apart at the time, he broke in through the bedroom window, I felt some spit on my face, he was crouching down next to me spitting and trying to poke my eyes out. 'He threw me down the stairs, he strangled me. He was hitting me with the side of a knife' 'At one point I thought this was my last breath ... so I reached out and just bit.' Jason is ten years older than Suzanne. The violence started just two weeks after they met and she says she was too scared to say no when he proposed . Gardener Jason was arrested and admitted to a sustained and serious assault on Suzanne and to threatening to kill her and finally sent to prison. Suzanne had made complaints to the police before, but always withdrew her statement soon afterwards. She told The Sun: 'He would always say sorry, promise it’d never happen again and even cry until it was me feeling sorry for him. I started to think, ‘Did I provoke him?’ I was sinking into a really deep depression. I shut everyone else out. 'I couldn’t see it at the time but he was just crushing my confidence until I felt like I needed him and that I couldn’t leave. I’d tell myself that I had to stay with him for the kids’ sake, that I couldn’t cope on my own. He’d beaten all my self-respect out of me. I tried to be a proper wife. I cooked, I cleaned. I kept thinking I could change him. But he couldn’t be changed. In 2009 Jason attacked Suzanne while she was pregnant. The beating was so savage that her liver spilt, but she didn't lose the baby. The police and social services became involved and Jason was given a community order preventing him from coming near . Suzanne. Two months later he broke into her house for his final attack. She added: 'Somehow I knew that it had to happen, that there would have to be a culmination like that. 'I wasn’t even as scared as I should have been because I was so used to his violence by then.'

A Sikh gang was today convicted of slashing a retired Indian general’s throat in a revenge attack for a military operation nearly 30 years ago which left at least 500 dead. Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, 78, was attacked as he walked with his wife Meena, in Old Quebec Street, central London, on September 30 last year. Lt Gen Brar was involved in a controversial military operation - Operation Blue Star - against Sikh militants in Amritsar, north west India, in June 1984. Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, who was involved in Operation Blue Star in 1984, was attacked as he walked with his wife in London last year . Dilbag Singh (left), from London, and Mandeep Singh Sandhu (right), from Birmingham, have been convicted of wounding with intent . The operation left at least 500 people dead and turned Lt Gen Brar into the target of revenge attacks. Mandeep Singh Sandhu, 34, of Birmingham, and Londoners Dilbag Singh, 37, and Harjit Kaur, 39, were all convicted of wounding with intent. The jury of nine women and two men took just an hour to convict them. Southwark Crown Court heard that Barjinder Singh Sangha, 33, of Wolverhampton, has already admitted the charge. The victim’s role in the Indian Army, overseeing 'a number of military operations... made him a target for Sikh extremist groups', the trial heard. The crown argued the defendants launched 'a highly premeditated assault'. Harjit Kaur (left), from London, has also been convicted of wounding with intent. Barjinder Singh Sangha, from Wolverhampton, had already admitted the charge . The trial heard how the victim's role in the Indian Army 'made him a target for Sikh extremist groups' Kaur was described as being key to the ambush. She boarded the same bus as the old soldier and his wife of 28 years to track their movements and phone through reports to the alleged attackers who were waiting. The couple were on their way from their hotel for a night in the West End when the attack happened. They visited London annually for about 15 years. The crown said Sangha 'drew a knife as the other men held the victim'. Sikhs protest after the storming of the Golden Temple at Amritsar . The Indian army attack took place at the Golden Temple of Amritsar, India . The ex-soldier, who was left with a cut running across his jaw and neck and another to the jaw, has survived several assassination attempts . The ex-soldier was left with a 12-inch cut running across his jaw and neck and another three inch cut to the jaw. Operation Bluestar was an Indian military operation against Sikh separatists in Amritsar's Golden Temple. Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi ordered the attack in June 1984 after Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, leader of the Damdami Taksal - a Sikh religious group - and political revolutionary, had been accused of amassing weapons at the Sikh temple and starting an armed uprising, a notion which has been rejected by Sikh scholars. The attack was carried out by army troops with tanks, artillery, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Tensions increased following the attacks as Sikhs across the globe reacted with anger. The increased tensions led to attacks on Sikhs in India. Later that year, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her own Sikh bodyguards, triggering a further wave of retaliation that left nearly 3,000 Sikhs dead. The victim has survived several assassination attempts and still receives death threats. Lt Gen Brar, speaking via a videolink from India, said as a result of the attack his protection ranking was raised to the highest possible in India. The defendants showed no reaction when they were convicted. The trio along with Singh Sangha will be sentenced on September 19 after pre-sentencing reports are produced. Mari Reid, of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Division, said: 'This was a violent and life-threatening attack carried out by Sikh extremists on the streets of London’s West End. 'Lieutenant General Brar sustained deep cuts to his face and neck in full view of his wife near their hotel on Old Quebec Street. 'Lieutenant General Brar was targeted in a highly planned and premeditated attack. Harjit Kaur was instrumental in carrying out reconnaissance of the area and followed the Brars around London. 'The couple were set upon in what was a swift, effective and terrifying ambush; Sandhu and Singh held Lieutenant General Brar down as Sangha slashed at his neck with a knife. 'The group clearly targeted Lieutenant General Brar in revenge for his actions during his military career and today’s convictions are another reminder that the UK will not tolerate extremism of any kind.'","Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar was attacked in London last year .

She nearly lost sight in one eye because of the collision . Police have released CCTV images in a bid to catch off-road bikers who ran down and then left a three-year-old girl for dead in a horrifying hit-and-run. Little Olivia Pollard was struck and flung into the air as she crossed the road with her mother Jessica four weeks ago. Three off-road motorbikes were travelling on a road in East Herringthorpe, South Yorkshire, when one or more of the bikes is thought to have collided with Olivia, before driving off. The toddler suffered serious head and eye injuries, and came close to losing the sight in one eye. She was airlifted to nearby Sheffield Children's Hospital following the shocking collision. Thankfully, she has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home. South Yorkshire Police are still appealing for information to help them catch the culprits - and today released CCTV images of three off-road motorbikes and four people in the hope members of the public will recognise them. Inspector Geoff Young said: 'The response from the public has been excellent. We have received a number of leads and have spoken to several people as part of the investigation. 'Through the amount of CCTV we have now been able to recover and collate, we definitely know that there was more than one group of off-road motorbikes in the area at the same time as the collision and we are keen to identify the owners of the bikes and the riders. 'Olivia is expected to make a full recovery, however she is only a little girl and she has been through a horrendous ordeal. I would still urge the public to please come forward should they have any information they believe may assist the investigation.' CCTV images of three off-road motorbikes and their four riders have been released by officers . Speaking shortly after the accident, which happened on the afternoon of July 3, her devastated mother Jessica, 20, said: 'To think that people could do that to her and then drive off while she lies bleeding in the road makes me sick. 'We'd just got off the bus and were crossing the road when, out of nowhere, three motorbikes came darting round the corner.

They had the sort of summer holidays every child dreams of - adventures in the countryside uncovering and solving strange mysteries. But now house hunters have the chance to enjoy their own 'jolly japes' at the farm where the TV adaptation of the Famous Five was filmed after the owners put it on the market for £2.75 million. Widmouth Farm boasts a luxury main house, 11 holiday cottages, sheep farm, 35 acres of cliff-top land and its very own private beach. Its beach and stunning coastal backdrop situated on Devon’s rugged north coast was immortalised in Five On A Treasure Island, the 1995 TV adaptation of Enid Blyton’s first Famous Five novel published in 1942. Scroll down for videobr {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} . Stunning backdrop: Widmouth Farm and its private beach in Ilfracombe, North Devon, was where much of the 1995 TV adaption of Enid Blyton's first novel was filmed . Home comforts: Widmouth Farm has a luxury main house for the owners, pictured, as well as 11 holiday cottages, a sheep farm, 35 acres of cliff-top land and its very own private beach . The current owners, Jeremy and Elizabeth Sanson, were inspired to begin their own adventure when they quit their lucrative careers in London in 2000 to buy the property. They invested thousands of pounds on the farmhouse and its grounds, transforming it into a very profitable holiday-let business. But the couple are now looking to downsize and have placed Widmouth Farm up for sale for £2.75 million. The value of the land has soared over the last 13 years, not least because of property TV shows like Escape to the Country which sees people quit the rat-race for a rural life. Widmouth Farm is an 18th century former quarry master’s house that has five bedrooms and overlooks Watermouth Harbour, near Ilfracombe. Alfresco dining: The main property has a front patio by the kitchen with stunning views overlooking Watermouth Harbour, near Ilfracombe, where residents can sit to enjoy their meals . Business: Widmouth Farm has been transformed into a successful holiday let business in the last ten years with 11 cottages, pictured, of varying sizes on the grounds . Over the years, 11 outbuildings on the . site have been converted into six two-bed, two three-bed, two one-bed . and one four bed cottages that now rake in a £84,000 a year profit. The 35 acres of land include three apple orchards that supply 150 bottles of cider and countless crumbles a year. A gentle slope in the cliffs lead people down to a remote sandy cove that is ideal for sunbathing. Mr Sansom, 53, said: 'Both our parents live in the area and they are getting quite old so we are trying to free up some time for them which is why we are selling the business. 'We have had the business for over 10 years now which is long enough and it is time for somebody with fresh ideas to come in and give it a go. 'We have increased the turnover by 400 per cent since 2000 and the cottages are let out for 60 per cent of the time. Country living: The kitchen in the main house at Widmouth Farm, Ilfracombe, North Devon, is perfect for a large family . Downsizing: Current owners Jeremy and Elizabeth Sanson gave up their jobs in London to start their own business on the farm in Devon but now want to downsize so they can spend more time with their family . 'It is a ready-made business and lifestyle for anyone to walk into yet there is still a lot of potential to expand it. 'For . example, it would make a great wedding venue and there is a boat house . on the beach where canoes and kayaks could be hired from.' Mr Sansom worked as a chartered surveyor in the city and his wife used to own a management training company. They decided to escape to the country after their daughter Jessica was born in 1997 and made the move three years later. They opted for the north Devon coast as Mr Sansom had happy memories of holidaying in the area as a child. When they first started the business most guests book a week’s holiday but now the focus is more on short breaks. Claim to fame: The current owners have copies of the Famous Five TV series, which was filmed on the ground of the property, pictured, in all the rental cottages . Breathtaking: Widmouth Farm and the surrounding North Devon Coast, pictured, is a popular place for tourists to visit throughout the summer . Mr Sansom said: 'I think people just don’t have the time that they had before, even if it was only 10 years ago. 'People want short, sharp excursions and then take another break later in the year. As a result we book out our cottages on a Monday to Friday and Friday to Monday basis. 'Many people who come here already know about the Famous Five and our beach being used for the filming. We keep copies of the DVD is all the cottages for them to watch.' Stephen Richards, of estate agents Chesterton Humberts, said: 'Properties in the south west of England that have their own private beach are as rare as hen’s teeth. 'In 18 years I have only ever known three such properties. 'The price for Widmouth Farm isn’t over the top considering it is a home, a business and a lifestyle. 'I guess you are looking at people who are thinking about semi-retirement and are moving down here from London or the Home Counties.'

The portico at the Lowther Hotel in Goole, East Yorkshire, had managed to remain unscathed since it was built in 1824.

A woman in police custody should never have been strip searched by four male officers, a watchdog has said. The 22-year-old was arrested outside Supperclub in west London and taken to Chelsea police station where she was left naked in a cell for half an hour. While she was locked up, there were CCTV cameras broadcasting her movements to the custody desk. Arrest: The 22-year-old woman was detained outside Supperclub in west London because she was intoxicated . There was a female officer present, but . the Independent Police Complaints Commission said that all officers . should be of the same gender for such a search and the watchdog has now . called for six police officers to face misconduct proceedings. The clubber was 'intoxicated, distressed and running in and out of a road' when she was arrested. Officers believed she was on drugs and might have illegal substances hidden in her clothing, the IPCC found. IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: 'This incident caused a great deal of distress to the victim. 'I find it difficult to understand why police officers think they have the right to strip a young woman of all her clothes, leaving her naked for half an hour and then expose her to being filmed. 'I am sure, like the complainant, the public will want to understand how this was allowed to happen. I look forward to the misconduct process getting the answers that are needed.' The woman was arrested outside Supperclub in March 2011. The IPCC said that the police sergeant on . duty should face a charge of gross misconduct for failing to make a . written record of the strip search or make sure that it was carried out . in line with the rules. Strip search: The young woman was searched at Chelsea police station and later complained to the IPCC . Five constables should face misconduct proceedings for breaching the guidelines for searches, while another two should face 'management action', an internal measure. One is accused of potentially discouraging the woman from getting legal advice by implying that she would have to stay at the police station for longer if she did so.

The woman complained about her treatment to Scotland Yard, which carried out its own investigation, but she was unhappy with the findings and so went to the IPCC. Scotland Yard said it will hold disciplinary proceedings against the sergeant and the five search officers, but it is reviewing whether the remaining two constables should face management action.

A burglar has been jailed after breaking into a hospital and stealing from a double amputee's bedside as she slept. Richard Henderson, 39, was handed five years behind bars on Tuesday after being convicted of breaking into Hull Royal Infirmary and stealing a handbag from Victoria Johnson. In a victim impact statement read out at Hull Crown Court, Ms Johnson said she could not believe anyone would steal from someone who had no legs. Callous: Richard Henderson has been jailed for five years after being found guilty of breaking into a hospital and stealing a handbag from a patient. Right, Hull Royal Infirmary, the scene of his sickening crime . The court heard Henderson, who had a history of drug abuse, had broken into the hospital on May 3 at 1.30am. He crept into the ward where Ms Johnson was sleeping and stole her handbag from a bedside table. The next day he returned to the scene of his crime and even spoke to Ms Johnson while she had a cigarette outside. She was in the hospital receiving treatment. His twisted crimes were rumbled at 2am when he was seen by a member of staff rifling through the jacket of a colleague in a doctors' consulting room. Police were called and Henderson was arrested at the hospital. It was the second time he had been arrested in the space of just two days. The court heard he had been arrested and bailed on May 2 after causing damage to a car when he was drunk. Jailing Henderson for the theft, Judge Mark Bury told him it was a 'disgusting' and 'despicable' offence. Henderson, of no fixed abode, was also convicted of benefit fraud. He had stolen £6,500 after applying for disability allowance in the name of a disabled man who was ill and infirm. Henderson has previous convictions for burglary, including one for breaking into Bridlington Hospital in December 2011. Henderson pleaded guilty to fraud and two counts of burglary in relation to his latest offences. A spokesperson for Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We're continuing to work with Humberside Police to deliver a safer hospital environment for our patients, staff and visitors.

The daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde was arrested at anti-fracking protests yesterday as ministers warned the South could become ‘the second biggest area of shale in Britain’. Environmental activist Natalie Hynde, 30, had ‘superglued’ herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in West Sussex. The site in Balcombe has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process. But yesterday Energy Minister Michael Fallon said that ‘towns, villages and countryside’ could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered, no matter their location or beauty. Determined: Natalie Hynde superglued herself to Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst to create a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance . Removed: Ms Hynde and her partner Mr Medhurst were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in Balcombe, West Sussex . So far, 25 protesters have been held by police in Balcombe. Arrested alongside Miss Hynde – the daughter of the Kinks’ Ray Davies and the Pretenders’ frontwoman –  was her boyfriend, veteran eco-warrior Simon ‘Sitting Bull’ Medhurst, 55. They had glued their hands together in a ‘human lock’ by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am. A row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for over two hours. The couple were eventually freed by officers using glue thinner. The couple had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate, and had been staying in a small blue tent since the start of the protest a week ago. One activist said their decision to glue themselves together had been made on impulse. He said: ‘For a moment there was no police officer at the gate and they took the opportunity to jump in there and glue themselves together.’ Rock star: Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders . Activism: The daughter of two chart-toppers, Ms Hynde's own passion appears to lie in environmental activism . Controversy: The protest has been ongoing at the village in West Sussex for the past week . The campaign comes as officers warned such protests are putting a strain on police resources and forcing them to delay other operations. Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Mr Fallon warned the village would not be the only site in the South that could see drilling, if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza. In response to comments by Tory peer Lord Howell – father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne – that fracking should be concentrated in the ‘desolate’ North East of England, the minister said: ‘It cannot be right to confine it to areas of the industrial North. Furore: Police worked to free the pair at the protest site, where large teams of officers have been deployed for the past week . Anger: Protestors have been gathered at the site for a week to protest against Cuadrilla's exploratory drilling activities . Strength of feeling: The anti-fracking activists staged a fake 'death' at the rural spot in West Sussex today . Shale exists under towns, villages . and countryside. Shale gas is everywhere and could well be in quantity . under attractive areas of the country as well as industrial areas.’ He added the South could become ‘the . second biggest area of shale in Britain’ and communities could benefit . financially as a result. In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone. Passionate: Ms Hynde said she was 'okay' as she was led to a police van . Industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea – it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years.Now a similar study is being carried out in the South, with results expected next spring. ‘The same survey is now being done of the southern base, roughly from Dorset through Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent,’ Mr Fallon said. ‘We will know in March whether there is much more there than was originally thought.’ Balcombe, which has been selected for exploratory drilling by fracking company Cuadrilla, has attracted a growing number of protesters attempting to block equipment from being taken on site. Despite this, the firm’s boss predicted drilling could begin as soon as today. Although he said he had ‘no intention of ruining the countryside’, he side-stepped questions about whether fracking would take place close to people’s homes, adding ‘we would have to do it in a regulated fashion’. Campaigners who have turned up to the West Sussex site include Bianca Jagger and former Page 3 model Marina Pepper. Miss Hynde and Mr Medhurst were still in custody last night. 'Don't frack my future': Former Page 3 girl Marina Pepper was led away from the site by police earlier this week .

A drink-driver has been allowed by a court to go and live on a luxury yacht in Greece after paying off a community order in the same way as Carlos Tevez. Mark Buckley, 34, agreed to pay a paltry fine of £110 instead of serving the rest of his sentence. His lawyer Kieran Henry cited the case of Argentina striker Tevez, who last month paid a £3,000 fine to avoid the rest of his 250-hour community service order for motoring offences so that he could leave Manchester City and join Italian club Juventus. Mr Henry told Stockport magistrates that ‘what goes for the rich, goes for the poor’ and suggested that the two cases could  lead to many more court punishments being ‘swapped’ because they are inconvenient. Mr Henry said: ‘What happened with Carlos Tevez could open the floodgates. Maybe people with  minor issues could get orders revoked on the grounds of ill-health or change of residence.’ Buckley, from Reddish, near Manchester, was stopped in his Citroën C2 in nearby Bredbury on May 16. A breath test found he had 94 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath – almost three times the legal limit. On May 29, he admitted drink-driving and Stockport magistrates sentenced him to a six-month community order – including alcohol rehabilitation and a supervision requirement. They also imposed a two-year driving ban and ordered him to pay £85 costs. On Tuesday, however, they agreed with Buckley’s plea that he should not have to serve the community order because he wants to live with his parents on their yacht moored off a Greek island. The community punishment was withdrawn, with magistrates ruling that the order was ‘revoked in the interests of justice’. £3000 fine: Carlos Tevez, paid to avoid the rest of his 250-hour community service order for motoring offences so that he could join Italian club Juventus . Mr Henry said: ‘The magistrate said it was an unusual application. ‘I mentioned the Tevez case in  the hearing and said, “If you can  do it for the rich, it can be done for the poor”. ‘What a case like that does is heighten the profile of something that is already there, but not been used in a while. 'The Tevez case opened up a window of opportunity for people like my client to exercise the court’s discretion. Precedent: Mr Buckley's lawyer Kieran Henry told Stockport magistrates that 'what goes for the rich, goes for the poor' 'His mum was prepared to take him to Greece and thought it was better for him to be abroad without an order, away from influences making him drink.’ The basis for the defence is that the defendant is not responsible in law for their inability to comply with  the order. It is only used on rare occasions and has to be paid for privately because it is not available on legal aid. However, Mr Henry said: ‘It is a defence I would consider using again if a client approached me and asked me to. It is being used more often now due to the Tevez case as people know it is available to them.’ In April, Tevez, 29, was banned from driving for six months and ordered to do community service after he admitted driving while disqualified and without insurance. Tevez completed only 28 hours of his punishment, which he was carrying out at Macclesfield’s Community Garden Centre, where he helped adults with learning difficulties. Last month, District Judge Bridget Knight, sitting at Macclesfield magistrates’ court, accepted that there were circumstances beyond Tevez’s control in his inability to fulfil the terms of the order. She said: ‘This is only a technical breach. It is not, I repeat not, a case of a footballer thumbing his nose at a court order.’ It is thought Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. Tevez is believed to have been earning £250,000 a week with Manchester City, making his £3,000 fine the equivalent of half an hour’s work.","Mark Buckley, 34, paid a £110 fine instead of serving the rest of a six-month community order .

An army reservist who died after falling ill during SAS selection training in the Brecon Beacons earlier this month 'adored the army' and believed passionately in his duty, his family have said. Corporal James Dunsby, 31, died yesterday in hospital where he had been in a serious condition after falling ill during the exercise on July 13, one of the hottest days of the year. His death follows that of colleagues Edward John Maher and Lance Corporal Craig John Roberts, who also lost their lives after collapsing during the military exercise on south Wales' highest mountain. James Dunsby was today named as the third army reservist to have died during a training exercise in the Brecon Beacons . In a statement issued through the . Ministry of Defence today the family of Cpl Dunsby, who was a member of . the Army Reserves (The Royal Yeomanry), said the 31-year-old had the . 'most infectious enthusiasm for life'. 'He was the most loving and dependable . husband, not to mention the most handsome of men of whom could not be . more cherished,' they said. 'James was and will remain a dearly . loved, son, brother and husband. He had the uniquely wonderful ability . to endear, enchant and captivate all who he met with his naughty sense . of humour and highly intelligent wit. 'With James as your friend you were ensured loyalty, strength, allegiance, protection and most of all a damn good laugh. 'James adored the army and believed so passionately in his duty as a protector of Queen and country and of the realm. 'James was so dearly loved by so many . and will be sorely missed. Hurrah and Huzzah for James Dunsby; a greater . man you could not meet. 'We ask to be allowed to come to terms with our grief and loss of our beloved son and brother James.' Craig Roberts and Edward Maher, who both died during a gruelling SAS endurance test in the Brecon Beacons during the heatwave. A third man who was airlifted to safety has now also died . Brave Mr Maher had served in Iraq and . Afghanistan. Edward, known as Eddie to friends, served his country in . Iraq and Afghanistan in an elite special reserve unit often behind enemy . lines. His comrade Will Walker took to Facebook to say Edward was a respected a liked member of his unit. He said: 'Eddie you will be missed by all, rest easy now and we will all see you at the re-org. Edward . served in 4/73 Special OP battery - an elite unit within 5 Regiment, . Royal Artillery, tasked with directing artillery fire and air strikes . deep into enemy territory.' Naming . Mr Maher, a Ministry of . Defence spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with his family and friends at . this difficult time. 'Investigations . are being carried out by Powys police and the army. We cannot comment . any further until these investigations are complete.' In . a brief statement released through the MoD, Mr Maher's family said: 'At . this time of great sadness, Edward’s family has asked that they be left . alone to grieve in private.' Further tests will be carried out on the . two soldiers after . examinations have failed to discover the cause of their deaths. Witnesses on the day said they saw two soldiers 'clearly in distress' who pleaded with them for some drinking water. The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts (pictured) was one of two reservists who died while on the training exercise . An inquest at Brecon Law Courts in Powys, mid Wales, gave the medical deaths of the pair as 'unascertained'. Speaking at the brief hearing was Dyfed Powys Police Detective Inspector Ieuan Wyn Jones. He said that L/Cpl Roberts had been pronounced dead on the mountain at . 5.15pm, while Mr Maher died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil . almost three hours later. 'Post mortems have been carried out and the causes of death are unascertained,' he added. 'Further investigations are being carried out.' Sources have said that L/Cpl Roberts and his colleague died from heat exhaustion on July 13 as temperatures hit 29.5C (85.1F). It is believed the group had been taking part in the aptitude training element of the course to become SAS reservists. They had been tutored in how to survive in hostile territory and were embarking on the testing stage of the process. The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its . rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and . mentally for warfare, as well as putting their logistic skills to the . test - making it an ideal area for elite forces personnel such as the . SAS. Pen y Fan is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time .

When news of the deaths broke, tributes poured in for former teaching assistant L/Cpl Roberts, of Penrhyn Bay, near Llandudno. The 24-year-old had reportedly served with the TA for more than five years, including tours of Iraq and Afghanistan. In a statement issued through the MoD, his father Kelvin Roberts said: “We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig. 'This has left a massive hole in all our lives. 'We . wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives . us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of . his dream. 'Next month . Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the Secretary of . State for Education and we were all very proud of him.' In the aftermath of the deaths, investigations have been launched by both the police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The men became ill close to Pen y Fan, which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in South Wales. Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war . Last week Powys Coroner Louise Hunt . said she will also launch her own probe - which she said was covered by . Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. She told the court that, under this piece of legislation, the state had 'a duty to protect an individual’s life'. Before adjourning proceedings, she . said a full inquest would examine all the circumstances leading up to . the deaths and examine any 'failings... if they are identified'. Ms . Hunt also said her investigation was not a 'normal' inquest; any future . verdict given must be independent and have the full involvement of both . victims' families. 'I would also like to place on record my deepest condolences to both families,' she added. Lieutenant Colonel Freddie Kemp represented the Ministry of Defence’s Defence Inquest Unit at the hearing. He said the military’s casualty visiting unit had been working closely with all the families affected. Proceedings were adjourned until September 3, when they will resume for a pre-inquest hearing at Aberdare Coroner’s Court.

A 'bungling' shop manager who faked an armed raid on his store with the help of his boyfriend was caught after police found a photograph of him wearing the robber's balaclava saved on his iPhone. Christopher Usher, 30, was desperate for money  because his mother was throwing him out so he decided to steal the takings from the newsagents where he worked in Lincoln. He and social worker John Skate, 40, acted out a violent robbery in which Skate attacked him minutes after he opened up the shop. But police later checked Usher's phone and found a picture of the robber's outfit, including overalls and the mask. Plot: Christopher Usher (left) staged a fake robbery on his shop with his boyfriend John Skate (right) and the pair have now been jailed . Fatal error: Detectives looked at Usher's mobile and found these pictures: Him in the balaclava and the overalls used . Usher and Skate, both of . Lincoln, each admitted charges of theft and perverting the course of . justice. Usher was jailed for 34 months and Skate for 26 . months. Lincoln Crown Court heard everything initially went to plan with Skate, wearing a balaclava and overalls, bursting on the scene armed with a broom handle to give the impression he had a gun. Items were rearranged in the shop to make it look as if a real robbery had taken place and a light fitting was smashed to give added effect. Usher was locked in a store room before Skate fled from the scene with £8,000 cash and £150 worth of cigarettes. The bogus robbery sparked a serious crime inquiry but he was caught out when officers checked his phone and discovered a photograph of the same set of clothes he had described the robber as wearing. The pair went on to confess that they specially bought the clothes for Skate to wear during the fake hold-up. Now Usher is behind bars along with his partner Skate, who switched careers late in life and obtained a degree from Lincoln University as a mature student before finding employment with  North East Lincolnshire Council working with vulnerable adults. The alarm was raised when an early morning customer called at the McColl's Newsagents at the Brant Road Shopping Centre, Lincoln, and found the door locked. She alerted staff at a nearby store and police were called. Officers were at the scene within minutes. Crime: Usher was locked in a store room at this McColl's Newsagents in Lincoln before Skate fled from the scene with £8,000 cash and £150 worth of cigarettes . Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said: 'They found Usher cowering in a storeroom which had been secured from the outside preventing him from leaving. 'He appeared to be in great fear. It was taken extremely seriously by the police.' Usher told officers he had been attacked by a man with an East European accent and went on to make a 12 page witness statement in which he described the balaclava and overalls worn by the raider. Mr Lody told the court: 'He described in close detail the man's clothing and the fact that he had a shotgun with him.' Police sealed off the shopping centre and set up a major incident investigation with officers poring over CCTV footage from the area in a bid to identify the robber. But during the inquiry Usher told officers he had left his mobile at home that morning. Mr Lody added: 'Usher referred to the fact that he owned a Blackberry which was at his house. The police went to check that and were somewhat surprised that Mr Usher's mother told them he also had an iPhone as well. 'On the i-phone was a photograph of the set of overalls and the balaclava he had described as being worn by the robber.' Defence: Christopher Usher acted out of desperation because of his financial situation and John Skate says he was pestered into it by his partner . The focus of the police investigation switched to Usher and Skate who both went on to confess that they had staged the robbery. All but a few hundred pounds of the money was subsequently recovered from where it had been buried by Skate in a relative's garden. Mr Lody said: 'The two men were partners. Usher had taken out a joint mortgage with his mother on a property. That mortgage fell into arrears. That would seem to be the catalyst which caused him to hatch a plot to stage a fictitious robbery on the shop where he worked. 'The plan was that Skate would dress up as a robber. He would go to the store and a fake armed robbery would be carried out.' Judge Sean Morris told them 'These sentences are to deter others from committing this kind of offending which is a very easy thing to do.' Joanna Staples, for Usher, said 'It was an act of desperation by Mr Usher. Not only was he to be made homeless but his mother also. He was in a state of despair. He saw no other way out of his problems other than this severely misconceived notion of taking this money from his place of work.' Sunil Khanna, for Skate, said 'He initially said no but he was pestered into getting involved. He was blinded by affection for his partner. He simply cannot understand how he got himself involved in this.' Angela Clark, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS East Midlands said “The deception perpetrated by these two defendants caused widespread concern and fear within their community when it was suspected that an armed robbery had taken place. 'They thought they had committed the perfect crime. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Their deception was quickly uncovered and the evidence against them so overwhelming, they had no option but to plead guilty both for the theft and for perverting the course of justice in attempting to hide their crime.'","Christopher Usher and John Skate stole £8,000 cash and £150 of cigarettes .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:53 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:55 EST, 31 July 2013 . Rogue private investigators face being jailed in a crackdown on ‘guns for hire’ acting outside the law. A new strict regime will be imposed, which will make operating as an unlicensed private investigator criminal offence, Home Secretary Theresa May said. The reforms were announced as pressure mounts on the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and MPs to release the names of hundreds of companies and individuals linked to unscrupulous operators. Crackdown: Home Secretary Theresa May unveiled plans to force private investigators to obtain licences to operate, or face fines or even jail . Licences will be granted by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) following a series of vigorous checks. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘I really don’t think it’s right to have private investigators, guns for hire, if you like, acting entirely out of and beyond the rules that apply to other parts of the security industry.’ The scandal of data hacking has widened beyond the cases in the press which triggered the Leveson Inquiry. A total of 22 law firms feature on a 102-strong list of companies to have used private investigators, alongside several insurance companies, financial services groups and two celebrities, among others. Private investigators currently operate without regulation, allowing anyone to take on the role, regardless of their skills, experience or criminal convictions. From autumn next year, the SIA will issue licences only if an applicant has completed training and achieved a Government-recognised qualification, which includes understanding of relevant laws and standards. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg branded private investigators 'guns for hire' Wannabe PIs will also have to confirm their identity and undergo a thorough criminality check. The maximum penalty for working as an unlicensed private investigator or supplying unlicensed investigators will be a fine of up to £5,000 and up to six months in prison. Home Secretary Mrs May said: ‘It is vital we have proper regulation of private investigators to ensure rigorous standards in this sector and the respect of individuals' rights to privacy. ‘That is why I am announcing today the Government's intention to regulate this industry, making it a criminal offence to operate as a private investigator without a licence. ‘Anyone with a criminal conviction for data protection offences can expect to have their application for a licence refused.’ She stressed that journalists will be excluded from regulation to allow them to carry out legitimate investigations in the public interest. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The Home Secretary is absolutely right to warn that some rogue private investigators pose a serious threat to people's privacy, and the move to introduce a system of licensing is a positive step towards protecting people from untoward intrusion and surveillance. For too long private investigators have been allowed to operate in the shadows. ‘The system needs to make crystal clear that irrelevant of whether or not someone calls themselves a private investigator, if they are attempting to gather information about other people by surveillance or investigation then they need a license.’ Soca's list features eight firms that featured in evidence in prosecutions under Operation Millipede, an investigation that led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year, as well as 94 other organisations that were relevant to the inquiry but not used in evidence. There are also five organisations or individuals on the list being investigated as part of Operation Tuleta, Scotland Yard's computer hacking probe. List: Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible . The identities of the firms involved have not yet been revealed, at the request of Soca. But the Home Affairs Select Committee released a breakdown of the sectors they work in, which include law, oil, rail services and the security industry. Private investigators accessed information through methods including phone and computer hacking, blagging - faking an identity to draw information from an official spokesman - and phone interceptions. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Keith Vaz MP has written to Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, who has overall control of the operation, to ask if the force has any further interest in the firms on the list. He has asked Ms Dick, as well as the Information Commissioner's Office, to confirm when the public will be able to see the names on the list. But he also said the names on the list could be kept secret to avoid compromising any investigations being carried out by the police. While he wants to reveal the names - and could do so using parliamentary privilege - he has been told the Information Commissioner and Metropolitan Police may be interested in investigating the companies involved. A final decision on whether to release the names would be taken when the committee publishes its report, he said.","Home Secretary announces £5,000 fines and 6 month jail terms .

"PUBLISHED: . 02:45 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:45 EST, 31 July 2013 . DNA profiles of thousands of suspected sex offenders are being destroyed because of a legal loophole that leaves police powerless to hold them. From October, forces in England and Wales will no longer be able to hold indefinitely genetic information on people arrested on suspicion of sexual and violent crimes once they have been released without charge. Police will be given the right to apply for data to be held for longer, but this appeal process is not yet in place, the BBC said. Changes: Police forces in England and Wales will no longer be able to retain DNA profiles of people arrested on suspicion of sexual or violent crimes indefinitely . Despite the lack of appeal, the Home Office has ordered forces to delete DNA records ahead of the change, Labour says, including the details of 18,000 people arrested but not charged with rape. Labour claims forces are now following government directives to delete records in advance of the change to the law, according to the BBC. The changes to the national DNA . database come in the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act, under which DNA . profiles from people arrested but not charged with a serious offence . such as rape should be destroyed. Police . can apply to the biometrics commissioner to hold a sample for three . years, with an extension of two years, if they have the grounds to do . so. 'Incompetence': Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has accused the Home Office of 'shocking incompetence' But this opportunity to appeal is not yet in place, despite Prime Minister David Cameron telling the Commons in 2011 that safeguards had been introduced, The Times said. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the loophole amounted to 'shocking incompetence' by the Home Office. She told The Times: 'It is appalling that DNA evidence from thousands of rape suspects is now being destroyed, contrary to the promises made by the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary. 'They were warned repeatedly in Parliament and by the police about the risks involved in destroying DNA evidence in this way. 'Theresa May's failure to prevent and deal with this incompetence shows she has not taken seriously enough the risks to rape convictions and crime from her policy.' Ms Cooper demanded an urgent inquiry into 'how this implementation went so badly wrong', saying: 'We need to know if the police have been ignored or overruled by the Home Office and why this has gone so wrong.' A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'In the past, DNA was kept from innocent people, but not taken from prisoners. We are taking samples from the guilty and getting rid of them when people have done nothing wrong. 'Through the Protection of Freedoms Act we are restoring common sense to the system by ensuring only those convicted of a criminal offence will have their DNA retained indefinitely. 'Forces will be able to retain DNA from someone arrested and not charged for up to three years, but only with permission from the biometrics commissioner. And all DNA samples taken by police are checked against the national database before deletion.'","DNA profiles of people arrested but not charged will be destroyed .

Facing jail: Andre Michael Yankey, pictured outside Westminster Magistrates Court, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal . A teenager could face jail after trying to impress a girl with a home-made horror movie showing him butchering a mouse. Andre Yankey, 19, filmed himself using a power tool to slice the animal open and drill into its eye. Yankey sent the film to a friend, who was so traumatised by what she saw that she immediately called the RSCPA. The teenager, who claims he made the video when he was just 16, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected (domesticated) animal at Westminster Magistrates’ Court this morning. Prosecutor Wendy Gutteridge warned the court of the graphic nature of the video, saying: 'Once seen, the video can't be unseen. 'The video clearly shows Mr Yankey using a handheld grinder to purposely injure and torture a live mouse.' She said the gruesome one and a half minute clip shows Yankey at his home with a mouse he has caught on a humane glue trap. Ms Gutteridge continued: 'Mr Yankey is seen brandishing a handheld Dremel multi-tool, he faces the camera and explains how he is a mouse killer. 'He says: ""Mice want to f****** coming into my house, they get terminated with the blade of doom"".' Yankey then cuts open the mouse, drills into its eye, causing blood to spurt out across the room. 'The mouse is clearly still conscious and is frantically trying to free itself', said Ms Gutteridge. 'Mr Yankey is clearly seen to be enjoying himself, saying ""grind that b****, cut that b**** right open"". 'After around one minute and 15 seconds, the mouse ceases to move any further.' Warning: Yankey was warned at Westminster Magistrates Court, in Marylebone, London, pictured, that he potentially faces jail when he is sentenced in August . Ms Gutteridge said blood stains were found on the walls on Yankey's house, and his trainers were ruined during the killing. Yankey . was caught when he sent the video to a friend, Virginie Lambertucci, . via social media Whatsapp, boasting: 'This is what happens when a mouse . comes into my house'. But Ms Lambertucci was so repulsed by what she saw, she called the RSPCA and blocked Yankey's number in her phone. 'She was so traumatised by the video she was unable to sleep, and sent the video to the RSPCA', said Ms Gutteridge. 'She was so distressed and sickened by the video that she told Yankey not to contact her again.' Yankey was arrested on February 5 this year and admitted torturing the mouse when he first moved into his west London flat in 2010. 'He said he felt like a ""complete fool"",' said Ms Gutteridge. 'He said he wanted to kill the mouse and conceded it would have caused pain and suffering. 'He said once he had killed the mouse, he threw it in the bin along with the glue mat and his trainers. 'He had a mouse problem when he moved in, and he hated mice.' She added Yankey was given an animal welfare warning after his pet Staffordshire Bull Terrier was found to be in a poor condition, and a small corn snake was being kept in a tiny tank. His pets may now be taken away as a result of his conviction. District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe warned Yankey he could face jail as a result of his conviction, and adjourned sentencing for reports on him to be prepared. 'I am asking for a pre-sentence report, but I am not ruling out any sentence which could include custody', she said. Yankey, from Paddington, west London, admitted one count of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. He was released on unconditional bail until sentencing at the same court on August 21.","Andre Yankey, 19, sent the gruesome video to friend Virginie Lambertucci .

Worried about the outcome of the election, Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong drew up a list of issues that would have to be tackled by an incoming Labour prime minister. He said: ‘The most pressing are in the nuclear field where manifesto commitments to halt cruise missile deployment, cancel the Trident programme and include the British Polaris force in the current nuclear disarmament negotiations impinge directly on the interests of the United States and of Britain’s other Nato allies. ‘You will wish to look for early advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Defence Secretary on how best to handle these issues so as to avoid or minimise damage to the cohesion of Nato.’ In the end, Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives won the 1983 general election by a landslide .

Abuse: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said using Twitter was not an excuse for 'grotesque' behaviour . Nick Clegg today backed a police operation to arrest Twitter trolls who have posted vile abuse and threats of rape. The Deputy Prime Minister said arrests this week ‘sent out a signal’ that using online messaging is not an excuse for ‘totally unacceptable behaviour’. Mr Clegg warned: ‘Just because you tweet something doesn’t mean you can start behaving in a grotesque, offensive, abusive and sometimes criminal way.’ He spoke out after it emerged internet trolls have been targeting female Cabinet ministers with threats of rape on video website YouTube. Several Cabinet ministers including Home Secretary Theresa May, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and International Development Secretary Justine Greening are among women who have been the target of a series of abusive messages on the Google-owned website. Earlier this week Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy was the target of abusive messages on twitter threatening her with rape. She was told on Twitter she would be tracked down and raped, with the terrifying threat: ‘Shall we meet near your house?’ More than 100,000 people have now signed a petition calling on Twitter to beef up its procedures for dealing with abuse. The petition states: 'Abuse on Twitter is common, sadly too common. And it frequently goes ignored. We need Twitter to recognise that its current reporting system is below required standards.' Miss Creasy was targeted because she had backed feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who suffered similarly vile online messages - leading one alleged abuser to be arrested and bailed. Abuse: One of the shocking tweets aimed at Culture Secretary Maria Miller on YouTube . The MP has also been subjected to abusive messages on YouTube. On Sunday Jack Riley, a car mechanic from Prestwich, Manchester, was arrested and taken to London for questioning over an offensive message he allegedly sent to Miss Criado-Perez after she backed plans to put Jane Austen on the new £10 note. The 21-year-old was later bailed. A 25-year-old man was also held by Northumbria Police on suspicion of harassment in relation to abusive Twitter messages sent to Miss Creasy and Miss Criado-Perez. He was also later bailed. Mr Clegg backed the police moving in to arrest people suspected of posting vile abuse online. ‘We shouldn’t blame the medium for what is totally unacceptable behaviour,’ he said at his monthly press conference. ‘I think it is right - really good . actually’ that the police have sent out a signal by arresting these two . characters – one in Manchester and one in Hull – for sending out these . highly abusive and threatening tweets. ‘I . think it’s good the police have sent out this signal that just because . you are tweeting you can’t suddenly behave in a way that you would never . behave if you were facing that person on the street. 'Just because you tweet something doesn’t . mean you can start behaving in a grotesque, offensive, abusive and . sometimes criminal way' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . ‘I just think sometimes there’s a tendency to believe that just because it’s a new medium you can behave in a different way – well no you can’t. ‘Civilised, grown up appropriate behaviour should be respect by people whatever medium they use.’ Twitter has come under growing pressure to act against people who use the site to issue threats to other users, with calls for a button to make it easier to report offensive messages. But the row wideneded with the revelation that similar threats have been posted on YouTube. Many of the expletive-filled messages have remained on the site's comments section, posted under videos featuring senior female politicians, for as long as two years despite YouTube claiming that it does not tolerate harassment or threatening comments. Targeted: Home Secretary Theresa May, left, and Culture Secretary Maria Miller have both been the target of internet trolls on YouTube . In one of the most shocking posts targeting Ms May, YouTube user Bufon63 adds: 'May, die and painfully. The world will be a better place.' A torrent of abuse posted under a video of Maria Miller MP describes her as being 'evil personified'. Shadow Culture Secretary Harriet Harman is also targeted on the website with one post four months ago reading: 'Exterminate the whore.' Abuse: International Development Secretary Justine Greening has faced vile online messages . The latest revelations of online abuse aimed at female MPs comes after several politicians were targeted by trolls on Twitter. Miss Creasy was the target of abusive messages on Twitter threatening her with rape. The MP has also been subjected to abusive messages on YouTube.

Miss Criado-Perez met Twitter directors on Monday night along with Miss Creasy. 'This will have been a wake-up call for Twitter,' Miss Criado-Perez said.

Ms Harvey told BBC Radio Five Live: 'We don’t have that much information about our users compared with other platforms. We don’t always have that information about where the message came from.

He said: Comments and feedback are a valuable part of YouTube and we’re always disturbed when a minority try to spoil the experience for others. Harassment and threats are not tolerated on YouTube. 'If users come across a threatening comment, they can contact us through an easy-to-use tool.

'Users can decide how they want to manage comments on their videos. They can allow comments, moderate them, or disable them.' Hundreds of internet trolls were prosecuted last year, it was revealed yesterday. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had brought more than 1,700 cases to court involving abuse sent online or  by mobile phone text message in 2012, up 10 per cent on the year before.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 02:41 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:46 EST, 31 July 2013 . A leading surgeon faces being struck off after he conned a wealthy widow out of hundreds of thousands of pounds by persuading her to 'invest' money into joint bank accounts and funding his children's school fees. Dr Ashraf Elnazir, a leading colonic specialist based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, befriended Gabriella Adler-Jensen after her husband Harry died, leaving her a £1.4m estate. The father-of-three persuaded her to buy property, land and 'invest' money in joint bank accounts between 2003 and 2006, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard. Dr Ashraf Elnazir is accused of conning wealthy widow Gabriella Adler-Jensen (right), out of hundreds of thousands of pounds and funding his lifestyle with the money . Dr Elnazira also suggested she transfer large sums of cash into foreign bank accounts then misappropriated the funds for his own gain. Mrs Adler-Jensen's financial position diminished 'in direct proportion' to the doctor's own wealth increasing, the hearing was told. She paid for him to go on a £5,000 holiday to Dubai in 2003, during which the pair developed a sexual relationship, the panel heard. He also used funds to pay airlines, his racquet club, dentist's bills, his children's school fees and to buy cars. The panel found his actions were dishonest and likely to bring the medical profession into disrepute and he could now be forced out of the profession. 'The panel is satisfied that you dishonesty misappropriated Mr's A's money and property,' said panel chair Sandra Sturdy. The leading colonic specialist, based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, denies the allegations and said they never had a close relationship . 'The panel is also satisfied that you utilised Mrs A's financial resources for your own benefit and to the detriment of Mrs A. 'It considered that your actions were dishonest and, as such, in breach of a fundamental tenet of the medical profession. 'That being so, your actions had the very real potential to bring the medical profession into disrepute.' Dr Elnazir became close to the widow after the death of her 84-year-old husband in 2001. They were living in the same exclusive apartment block in Kensington when the grieving widow, who was herself in ill health, turned to the medic for guidance. The friendship blossomed and by the end of 2002 the pair regularly socialised and dined out together. After the decision yesterday Ed Morgan, for the GMC told the panel:  'The doctor was fully aware that Mrs A invested in him that degree of trust and was seeking his assistance to identify both security and safety. 'One symptom of the pattern of behaviour the doctor cultivated was repeatedly and consistently choosing his own interests and aspirations and relegating those of Mrs A,' he added. 'The pair opened a joint HSBC account for . 'business investments' into which Mrs Adler Jensen transferred around . £779,000 between 2003 and 2006' 'The doctor utilised funds and financial resources as his own, not seeking or gaining her consent for their use.' Mr Morgan continued: 'He caused Mrs A to incur significant cost in time, effort and emotional commitment simply to lay claim to that which she was entitled.' Dr Elnazir denied all the allegations against him and, giving evidence, told the panel he never had a close relationship with Mrs Adler-Jensen. 'According to the doctor he was the person who was abused. He classified the whole relationship as bizarre. 'He sought to persuade you that Mrs A was a colleague, that she was a business associate, that he didn't at any time consider her financial security and he didn't think there was any responsibility on him to protect Mrs A from herself,' said Mr Morgan. 'Having seen the opportunity the doctor lost no time in seeking to cultivate it and thereafter harvested the opportunities Mrs A represented under the guise of a close relationship.' In January 2003 Dr Elnazir persuaded Mrs Adler-Jensen to buy his flat in an exclusive block in West Kensington for £429,000, though it was only valued at £375,000. Despite her transferring sums of £134,000 £80,000 and £215,000 for the purchase of the property between February and September, Dr Elnazir retained joint ownership. He later claimed the sums were transferred as gifts for his children or that he considered them as a loan. When she transferred the sum of £215,000 he said he was 'beside himself and horrified' and thought the behaviour was 'bizarre'. But he used the funds to put towards the purchase of a new family home in Chiswick, London. Later that year the pair opened a joint HSBC account for 'business investments' into which Mrs Adler Jensen transferred around £779,000 between 2003 and 2006. The panel found Dr Elnazir withdrew around £70k for his personal use. Dr Elnazir and Mrs Adler-Jernsen also opened a joint US dollar account for currency trading in 2004 and the widow transferred large sums of money to foreign accounts on the doctor's request. She transferred a total of $645,645 including a sum of $440k to buy land in Egypt, which was never bought. On one occasion he told her his brother was in 'serious' financial trouble and asked her to transfer $20,000 because the Egyptian mafia would be 'after' him if the money was not paid. When Mrs Adler-Jensen sought recompense, first at the high court before reporting the medic to the GMC, Dr Elnazir branded her as 'the enemy', the hearing was told. 'Mrs A became the enemy and as the enemy he was able to concoct lies and further statements to her which were dishonest,' said Mr Morgan. 'We say the conduct was sustained, it was deliberate and it was targeted. There has been no expression of regret, nor any apology. 'Even now the doctor closes his eyes to his actions and the consequences that have befallen Mrs A as a result of them,' he added. 'You have found the doctor has been guilty of material acts of dishonesty. Those acts of themselves and collectively are a course of conduct that represents a significant and fundamental departure from good medical practice,' Mr Morgan told the panel. The panel must now decide if the doctor's actions amount to misconduct and if his fitness to practise is impaired as a result. If so he could be forced to work under conditions, face suspension or struck off the medical register. The doctor is not attending this stage of the hearing, which resumed yesterday for the third time after starting last year. The hearing continues today.
