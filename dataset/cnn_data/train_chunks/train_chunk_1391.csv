"Harvard professors have been officially banned from having sex with undergraduate students at the university. While many people assume that such behavior would be forbidden, some colleges and universities have less restrictive policies. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences's  previous policy had only banned sexual relations with 'one's students' rather than students generally, according to Bloomberg News. Professors in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences will no longer be allowed to have sexual relationships with undergrads . A document with Harvard's new rules also states that professors cannot have sex or romantic relationships with graduate students under their supervision. Relationships between graduate students and undergraduates are allowed as long as one of the partners is not grading or evaluating the other. Harvard was among the first to ban professors from sex with students they taught when a policy was made in 1984 after a string of sexual misconduct allegations toward professors, according to the Crimson. Many universities adopted similar or more restrictive policies in the 1980s and 90s. Yale totally banned professor-undergrad relationships in 2010 and University of Connecticut did so in 2013. However, some have voiced opposition such measures. Anita Levy, a senior program officer at the American Association of University Professors, said that the relationships should not be completely barred. 'These relationships are going to occur on campus and you must put as many ethical checks on them as possible, but a blanket prohibition doesn't seem appropriate,'she said. The previous policy at Harvard was to bar professors from having sex with 'one's students' rather than undergraduates generally . 'These relationships are going to occur on campus and you must put as many ethical checks on them as possible, but a blanket prohibition doesn't seem appropriate,'she said. The AAUP did say that such relationships between professors and students could lead to 'exploitation'. The changes at Harvard come as its undergraduate college remains under investigation by the US Department of Education for its handling of sexual assault and harassment cases. It is not clear if any of the complaints were brought in professor-student interactions. Ninety-four universities had pending Title IX investigations against them at the beginning of this year for their handling of sexual assault cases, according to the Huffington Post. Harvard's law school was also under investigation and found in violation of federal rules in December for two cases, including one where the student waited over a year for a decision about her sexual assault complaints. The law school agreed to remedy its sexual assault procedures.","University's previous policy only stopped sex with 'one's students'

"A mother has warned the medication she takes for her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm – and is now speaking publicly about her experiences of getting it back. U.S. blogger Crista Anne switched antidepressants last year and discovered she was unable to reach climax through masturbation. Experts warn that a delay in the ability to orgasm is a common side-effect of many antidepressants, faced by up to half the people who take them. Crista, a mother-of-three, is now sharing intimate details of her sex life online in order to raise awareness to the side effects of antidepressants. Scroll down for video . U.S. blogger Crista Anne (pictured) has warned the medication she takes to treat her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm. Around half of all antidepressant users experience this effect, an expert has said . Crista has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the years she has tried various treatments including supplements, diets, lifestyle behaviours and the most widely prescribed antidepressants known Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). Last year she switched antidepressants and began taking amitriptyline, an older antidepressant which is no longer used as a first-line treatment. It is thought to block the effects of two chemical messengers called serotonin and norepinephrine, regulating mood and controlling depression. But writing on her blog, Crista says while the medication allows her to 'feel alive for the first time', she began to experience side effects such as sleepiness, a dry mouth and the inability to orgasm. She found ways to cope with the dry mouth and sleepiness, but found the lack of orgasm – or anorgasmia, as it is known medically – a bigger problem. She said on her blog: 'After an IUD [contraceptive coil] installation and starting medications for fibromyalgia and an antidepressant, my orgasm disappeared briefly. 'At the time of recording, with partnered sex I was missing my explosive orgasm. Only experiencing gentle waves. Anorgasmia - the inability to orgasm - is a known side effect of some antidepressants. Crista has blogged about her experiences of anorgasmia, and wants to raise awareness to this side effect . 'While those waves were nice, they were nothing close to the restorative experience I so depend on for a mental, emotional and physical recharge.' ‘A few weeks later I can blissfully report that universe creating powerhouse orgasms have returned via partnered sex. ‘The bad news is that orgasm via masturbation is still gone. Nada. Nil. Nothing.’ She has started a project called #OrgasmQuest, in which she aims to achieve one self-induced orgasm a day, with the hope of regaining her ability to climax through masturbation long term. She tweets updates of whether she has been able to achieve orgasm, to break down stigma. For example: . In her first #OrgasmQuest blog post she describes how being able to orgasm on her own has always helped her battle her depression. She said: 'Masturbating is my zen. It’s my meditation. It’s almost my religion. Masturbation is part of my identity, a part that I am not about to give up on. ‘My high sex drive and orgasmic superpower have been the most dependable parts of my identity. 'Sex has been my go-to pick me up for combating depression, allowing myself to feel something other than the darkness. Until now.' Anorgasmia, or the inability to orgasm, is a common side effect of antidepressants. It is not completely clear why some people experience anorgasmia while taking the drugs. David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, said that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm. He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body . 'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another. 'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. But it also delays time to orgasm.' He explained that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm. 'If you stimulate that serotonin receptor, it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax,' he said. 'There's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation.' However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant. Anorgasmia as a side effect of antidepressants is extremely common, David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, told MailOnline. He said almost half of people who take antidepressants experience this side effect. Globally, more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression, according to WHO figures. In 2011, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  identified about 11 per cent of people took antidepressants - a 400 per cent increase since the 1980s when previous surveys were taken. In the UK, recent government figures revealed more than 50 million prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England last year. A 2013 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found 4 million people in the UK take SSRIs. Crista says she has already tried a wide range of treatments for depression, and does not want to stop taking amitriptyline. Writing on her blog, she said: 'The anorgasmia is not enough to make me want to get off this medication or try another, as I believe that I can work through and return to some sort of orgasmic state. My libido has not been affected.' She wants to raise awareness to this problem as there is a stigma associated with discussing sexuality in public. This means means many people taking antidepressants might suffer in silence, she says. 'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' she told the Daily Dot. 'While my doctor spoke to me in depth about it, the stories I get from hundreds of other people are horrific.' One woman says multiple partners have left her because of her ability to orgasm. Professor Taylor explains that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm. He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body . 'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another. 'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' Crista said. She believes there is a stigma about talking about orgasm in public, which prevents people taking antidepressants getting help . 'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. 'But it also delays time to orgasm.' He added that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm. 'If you stimulate that serotonin receptor, it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax,' he said. 'There's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation.' However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant. Antidepressants are a type of medication used to treat depression or prevent it recurring. They can also be used to prevent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is thought antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, can improve mood and emotion, although this process is not fully understood. Increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain. Some of the side effects of antidepressants include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm . Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Some include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm. And while antidepressants can help treat the symptoms of depression, they do not always address its causes. This is why they are usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions caused by emotional distress.

"A French mayor has been ridiculed after building an 'anti-burglary wall' that stands just one metre-high. Steeve Briois is mayor of Hénin-Beaumont in the north of the country and decided to take drastic action following a spate of violent robberies. To keep unwanted visitors away from a residential area, he lobbied for a thick stone wall to be built directly across a street to prevent further attacks. But locals are not laughing at the pitiful protection the wall offers as it has forced some to take a four-mile detour to get around the tiny town. Pitiful: The one-metre high wall in the town of Hénin-Beaumont has been mocked after it was built following a spate of violent robberies in the area . Ridicule: Mayor Steeve Briois has defended the building of the wall, and said 90 per cent of residents voted in favour of it . But Mr Briois, a member of the far-right National Front party, has defended the decision to build the wall after coming under fire from the French press. On his blog, he wrote that 'around 90 percent' of the 200 people in the area had voted in favour of the construction. He added: 'The decision was made after two burglars stabbed a man in his home - including once in the head. Two hundred residents then met up to to find an urgent solution to this intolerable situation. 'The safety of my fellow citizens is a priority...and I won't give up.' But locals have so far been unimpressed with the barricade, and many left frustrated as it causes them to take lengthy detours. Mocked: Mayor of Hénin-Beaumont Steeve Briois who said: 'The safety of my fellow citizens is a priority...and I won't give up' One woman, who voted against the wall, told French newspaper Le Figaro that she didn't think building a wall in the street was 'a real solution' She added: 'Today, my husband had to take an eight-kilometre detour just to get to work.'

"A new report has shed light on US politicians' connections to the EB-5 visa program. Investors from overseas under EB-5 - the Immigrant Investor Program - typically put up funds toward what U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) deems a 'new commercial enterprise.' Mark Obama-Ndesandjo - the half-brother of President Barack Obama - told ABC News that a Chinese firm came to him in hopes he would get on board with a project based in El Monte, California. 'They said they wanted to pay a lot,' Obama-Ndesandjo said. 'But I told them I'm out of this, I don't want anything to do with it.' Per ABC News, Obama-Ndesandjo also stated that surnames like Clinton and Obama give projects cachet. Citing documents, the news outlet reported the El Monte project fell through and is now being investigated by federal authorities. Scroll down for video . Mark Obama-Ndesandjo - the half-brother of President Barack Obama - has said a Chinese firm came to him in hopes he would get on on board with a project based in El Monte, California for the EB-5 program . Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic governor of Virginia, Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) as well as Anthony Rodham - brother to Hillary Clinton - are among those reportedly linked to EB-5, which ABC News described as a 'short-cut to a Green Card for foreign nationals willing to invest $500,000 to $1 million in certain American business and development ventures.' 'Politicians have been an attractive draw for the so-called EB-5 regional centers,' the news outlet explained. 'The privately-run centers have the job of recruiting foreign investors –- most of them coming from China. The centers then pair the investors (and their money) with various hotel developments, business ventures and construction projects.' One regional center, Gulf Coast Funds Management, is led by Anthony Rodham, according to ABC News. A message to the company seeking comment was not immediately answered. ABC News reported  'When Terry McAuliffe, now the governor of Virginia, got involved in an electric car venture that was funded in part with EB-5 investments, he attempted to unclog the government review process with calls and emails to the head of the program, Alijandro Mayorkas, internal emails show. Sen. Harry Reid also used his political muscle to persuade the immigration agency to expedite the processing of visas for investors in a Las Vegas hotel and casino project.' A representative for Reid told the news outlet 'Senator Reid is proud to have successfully fought for a project that creates 8,600 Nevada jobs.' ABC News pointed out that then-gubernatorial candidate  McAuliffe issued a statement after his campaigning for assistance from Mayorkas was used against him. Anthony Rodham, brother of Hillary Clinton, reportedly leads a regional center called Gulf Coast Management. Rodham is seen with Bill Clinton in this 1999 file photo . McAuliffe's statement said that 'The EB-5 program is designed to inject capital into the American economy and to create American jobs (and) it has broad bipartisan support, including from every member of Virginia's delegation and the current administration in Richmond. 'There has been widespread frustration, however, both inside and outside USCIS about the bureaucracy there and the pace of the investment program. Like many business leaders and political officials from both parties, I was among those who expressed frustration on several occasions to multiple individuals. 'I never asked for any preferential treatment, nor did I ever expect to receive any.' He also called out Sen. Charles Grassley at the time, saying 'I find it unfortunate that a Republican Senator from Iowa -- who has a long history of support for the EB-5 program —- selectively released information for the purpose of partisan attacks instead of getting facts.' Grassley told ABC News 'I have run across concerns from whistle blowers that people within the Department of Homeland Security administering this program have... responded to political pressure to do what I call get to yes very quickly.' Meanwhile, Peter Joseph, executive director for Invest in the USA (IIUSA), said in an interview with the news outlet 'Generally speaking, it's very common for congressional offices to undertake issues on behalf of constituents that - involve dealing with federal bureaucracy.'","A new report has shed light on US politicians' connections to the EB-5 visas program used by foreign investors .

"A Spanish family who lost a memory card while on holiday in Scotland have been reunited with over 500 pictures of their holiday of a lifetime - all thanks to a Facebook campaign by a Scottish student. Barry Carruthers, 22, a drama student, said that the memory card had still worked and was filled with pictures of a family taken at Scotland's most iconic sights. In an ingenious move, he selected several and posted them on Facebook, illustrating the family's trips to iconic locations across Scotland, in hopes that someone online would recognise them. The family of four from Barcelona lost their camera while travelling throughout Scotland . From there, the message went global. Social media from Shetland to Hong Kong joined in the hunt for the family, even going so far as to contact American talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres on Twitter, in hopes that she'd spread the world. He said: 'This family had been everywhere, and done it all. 'They went to the Military Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle, the Fringe, the Royal Mile, Knockhill Circuit, Ayr - you name it. Student, Barry Carruthers, found the memory card and posted photos online in an attempt to find the family . The social media campaign went viral and even Ellen DeGeneres was contacted via Twitter to help. Pictured: Eilean Donan Castle in the Western highlands . 'I've lived in Scotland all my life, and there were a few places I couldn't even identify.' After looking through the family-of-four's all-encompassing epic Scottish trip, Carruthers said he felt compelled to reunite the tourists with their photos. The pictures seem to feature a family of four, specifically two parents and their son and daughter, reportedly from Barcelona. The Spanish media have now confirmed that the family had gotten in touch with the student to claim back the pictures. Carruthers found over 500 incredible photos from the family's world travels on their memory card . Eventually, the manager of the Ibis hotel where the family had stayed in Edinburgh contacted Barry . The son then reached out and contacted Carruthers and arranged for delivery of the memory card . Local newspaper La Vanguardia said the family had been identified as Spanish because of the fact that one of the photographs shows the family pointing a red star in reference to the Catalan beer brand and there was another picture of the family next to the car driven by the Barcelona pilot Pepe massot. That allowed the manager of the Ibis hotel where the family stayed while on their trip to Edinburgh to identify them and contact Barry. Carruthers said: 'I have only spoken to the son of the family, but they are from the Catalonia area and the son studies in Barcelona. He is completely shocked. 'The guy from the hotel, Jamie got in touch with the mum after seeing the photos on Facebook and she's delighted.' The family had apparently lost their camera, and whoever found it must have dumped the memory card where it was then found by the student i front of a multi storey car park in Glasgow.","Family from Catalonia lost camera while travelling throughout Scotland .

"A retired Army veteran who claims to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder has been charged with threatening to shoot his wife and others  at the US Capitol in Washington D.C. Michael Bogoslavski, whose wife works inside the Capitol as a Senate staffer, was arrested Monday after he told her over the phone and via text message that he planned to shoot her and anyone who got in his way, according to court documents. The 33-year-old texted his wife, who he suspected was having an affair with a male Capitol police officer - he said he would shot the man and added, 'I'm going to die suicide by cop.' Retired Army veteran Michael Bogoslavski was charged with threatening to shoot his wife and others at the US Capitol (pictured) in Washington D.C. on Monday . The woman responded, 'You come to my job on some crazy PTSD, I will file for divorce. Your choice,' the Washington Post reported. Bogoslavski reportedly responded: 'When I come divorce won't help. Cause I'm making the news today. 'Gun in each hand. 'Probably won't make it all the way up but u will get my last point I will ever make. 'Someone is going on be grieving for their family members today. Including my family. 'I PROMISE YOU THAT.' Bogoslavski was arrested outside his home in Cheverly, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, without ever approaching the Capitol. He told investigators he had been at the gym when he sent the text messages. Two handguns and ammunition were seized from Bogoslavski's house, court documents show. While he was in custody, Bogoslavski told investigators he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and that he was having difficulty adjusting to life as a civilian. US Attorney Rod Rosenstein said law enforcement agencies 'may have prevented a tragic outcome' The nine-year veteran retired from the Army in 2013 after serving two tours of duty in Iraq and another one Afghanistan. Bogoslavski was charged with transmitting in interstate commerce a communication containing a threat to injure another person. He was ordered detained pending trial after making an appearance in federal  court in Greenbelt, Maryland, yesterday. Bogoslavski's wife showed the threatening text messages to a Capitol police officer, according to the documents. The officer then listened on a speakerphone when Bogoslavski called his wife and threatened her. After hearing the threats, the officer alerted law enforcement to find the suspect. US Attorney Rod Rosenstein said: 'Local and federal law enforcement agencies responded to the threat quickly and effectively.' 'Their efforts in this case may have prevented a tragic outcome.' If he is convicted, Bogoslavski faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison followed by three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.","Michael Bogoslavski thought wife was having an affair with US Capitol cop .

"Hackers are using spyware to steal text messages, contacts, pictures and other personal information from iPhones, according to computer security experts. Anti-virus company Trend Micro claims it has discovered new software that infects iPhones running iOS 7 and iOS8. The software is spread via phishing attacks that are sent from the phones of friends and associates to encourage targets to click on a link and install the spyware. The XAgent malware will run on Apple devices like the new iPhone 6 (above) even if they are not jailbroken . Known as XAgent, the spyware will then collect text messages, contact lists, pictures, location data, lists of apps and any software running on the device. This information is then sent to a remote server while the malware will also switch on the iPhone's microphone and record everything going on around it. Trend Micro believe the malware has been created by a group of Russian hackers who have in the past been targetting governments, the military and the media. The XAgent malware is not the first to hack into Apple's iOS software for its mobile devices. iPhone users were left unaware for approximately a year-and-a half that a software bug could have made them the victims of ‘hi-tech eavesdropping’. Security experts warned that past iterations of iOS software - dating from as long ago as September 2012 - had a vulnerability that hackers could have exploited to see financial transactions, emails and Facebook activity. The vulnerability was eventually fixed by an update to the iOS7 software last February. Hackers also claim to have been able to circumvent the fingerprint recognition hardware installed on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6. Some iPhone users reported last May that they received messages telling them their phones had been hacked by Oleg Pliss and demanding money for their devices to be unlocked. However, perhaps the worst breach of Apple security was the hack into the company's iCloud that saw the leak of hundreds of personal and naked photographs belonging to celebrities, Jennifer Lawrence, Kelly Brook and Rihanna. It is thought that XAgent was designed by the group to help them obtain information from specific high profile targets. Trend Micro said it had also identified a second malware programme that is focused on recording audio from so-called 'jailbroken' devices. These devices have had limitations on their iOS software removed, which can compromise the phone's security. Feike Hacquebord, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro, said: 'While spyware targeting Apple users is highly notable by itself, this particular spyware is also involved in a targetted attack. 'The XAgent app is fully functional malware. After being installed on iOS 7, the app’s icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately. 'When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately. 'Installing the malware into an iOS 8 device yields different results. The icon is not hidden and it also cannot restart automatically. 'This suggests that the malware was designed prior to the release of iOS 8 last September 2014.' Nearly three quarters of Apple iPhones and tablets are now thought to be using iOS8, although a quarter are still running the older iOS7 software. This could mean that up to 200 million devices could be the most vulnerable to the spyware. Trend Micro believe the XAgent malware is related to another type of spyware it has been tracking that works on Microsoft Windows' systems called SEDNIT. They claim that the malware has been created by a group of hackers that it calls Operation Pawn Storm. Trend Micro found one route of infection was through a simple lure like the one above that downloads XAgent . XAgent can turn on the microphone of any iPhone it runs on and record the sound going on around it . Experts at Micro Trend first identified Operation Pawn Storm as being behind a series of online attacks targeting military officials and defence contractors in a cyber-espionage operation. Subsequently they have also been linked to attacks against government officials and journalists. Trend Micro said that it is unclear exactly how the new iOS malware is spread, although the group tends to infect the devices of contacts and friends of its targets. Writing on its blog, Mr Hacquebord and his colleagues who have been investigating XAgent, said they had seen one instance where the malware was attacked to a simple link with the words 'Tap Here to Install the Application'. However, they added: 'The exact methods of installing these malware is unknown. 'There may be other methods of infection that are used to install this particular malware. 'One possible scenario is infecting an iPhone after connecting it to a compromised or infected Windows laptop via a USB cable.' MailOnline has contacted Apple for comment. Apple is thought to have sold more than 800 million of its mobile iOS devices including the new iPhone 6 .","Computer security firm Trend Micro detected new spyware called XAgent .

"Primary school children were more familiar with Foster's lager brand than other consumer products . Primary school children recognise the Foster’s lager brand more easily than other consumer products, a survey shows. The Australian brewery giant, which uses two humorous beach characters in its TV ads, was immediately recognised as a drinks brand by 93 per cent of youngsters aged ten and 11. That was higher than the 87 per cent who recognised McCoy’s as a food product, the 86 per cent who immediately knew McVitie’s were biscuits and the 84 per cent for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. The same study found that half – 47 per cent – of primary school age children associate Carlsberg beer with the English national football team, where it is the official sponsor. Similarly, almost six in ten boys associated Chang beer with Everton football club, which is the club shirt sponsor. There was a similar story in Scotland where almost half of children and 60 per cent of boys correctly associated Carling with the Scottish national football team. The brand sponsored the Scottish Football Association until 2014. The figures come from alcohol campaigners and academics who claim they are evidence of a need for radical new controls on the way alcohol is marketed to protect children. This would include a ban on advertising on TV before the 9pm watershed, a phased end to the sponsorship of major sporting events and teams, plus restrictions on cinema advertising. The survey of more than 800 primary school children in England and Scotland looked at the recognition of alcohol brands, alcohol sponsorship, TV and social media use, and whether they had tried alcohol. At the same time as 93 per cent of youngsters knew Foster’s was a lager brand, four in five recognised the characters ‘Brad and Dan’ from its TV commercial. The humour is particularly appealing to teenage boys with one commercial featuring a beach volleyball game and young women in skimpy bikinis. In others, they are seen dispensing ‘agony uncle’ advice from a hut on a golden sandy beach to young British men, including guidance on whether a girlfriend is likely to end up looking like her mother. Advertising: Four in five children recognised the characters ‘Brad and Dan’ from Foster's TV commercial . The commercials have been hugely successful in financial terms with some industry experts suggesting that for every £1 spent on the adverts, Foster’s sold an extra £32 of beer. However, health campaigners say this success is also spilling over to attract youngsters to the brand and the idea of drinking. An expert in marketing and its effects on children, Professor Gerard Hastings, said: ‘This research shows that alcohol marketing is clearly making an impression on our children. ‘Existing evidence shows that exposure to alcohol marketing leads young people to start drinking at an earlier age and to drink more. Half of primary school age children associate Carlsberg beer with the English national football team, where it is the official sponsor . ‘As the Six Nations rugby kicks off with Guinness as its “official beer”, thousands of children across the UK will once again see alcohol associated with a major sporting event.’ The professor is the founder of the Institute of Social Marketing at the University of Stirling and has also advised the government on the issue of advertising and children. New research from the Alcohol Health Alliance shows high public support for better protection for children and young people from alcohol marketing. More than half – 58 per cent – said they supported restrictions on drinks firms sponsoring sporting events and a higher 74 per cent wanted a ban on TV advertising before 9pm. More than eight in ten – 84 per cent- believe alcohol advertising in cinemas should only be shown if films have an 18 certificate. The groups Alcohol Concern, Balance North East, Drink Wise and Alcohol Focus Scotland have come together to call for these measures to be implemented. Head of Policy at Alcohol Concern, Tom Smith, said: ‘This research shows just how many of our children are being exposed to alcohol marketing, with an even bigger impact being made on those children with an interest in sport. ‘Children get bombarded with pro-drinking messages, when the turn on the TV, go to the cinema or walk down the road, and the existing codes are failing to protect them.’ While Foster’s is promoted as Australian it is actually made in Manchester by the Dutch company Heineken. The British Beer & Pub Association, which speaks for brewers, said drinking across all age groups, including the young is falling. It said the UK already has strict controls ensuring marketing is not directed to children. Almost six in ten boys associated Chang beer with Everton football club, which is the club shirt sponsor (pictured is Kevin Mirallas at Goodison Park last month) Chief executive, Brigid Simmonds, said: ‘Any objective look at this issue would highlight that alcohol consumption in the UK is sharply down, by 18 per cent since 2004, and drinking among young people is also down. ‘Advertising designed to achieve brand differentiation does not encourage irresponsible consumption, nor is it aimed at young people. ‘And if we want more young people to get active, why pursue policies that would undermine sports sponsorship? Around £300million comes from alcohol sponsorship, with some £50million going directly to grassroots sport.’","Foster's was more recognisable than McCoy's, McVitie's and Ben & Jerry's .

Julian Edelman acknowledges cheers from the crowd gathered for the New England Patriot's Superbowl parade on Wednesday. A woman has now posted a photo of the player sleeping next to her in bed . But she has since apologised for what was labelled a gross violation of the player's privacy after she suffered a backlash of abuse and was banned from Boston nightclubs. Michael Winter, one of the biggest nightclub promoters in Boston, told TMZ he would blacklist her from the city's nightclubs. He added: 'You're a five if that and he was blackout. I'm sure I speak on behalf of many Boston industry ppl to not show your face in this city.' However, she has since apologised for sneaking the selfie and said she 'made a mistake'. She told TMZ: 'He passed out and I was bored I guess. Some of the players were texting me that they were really disappointed. I obviously made a mistake and I can't take it back.' Sabrina also said it was unlikely that the nightclub ban would last, claiming she had friends who worked in Boston nightclubs who said she was still welcome.

"The owner of a filthy bakery has been fined after inspectors discovered mouse droppings, out of date meat, and grime caked on to the floors inside. Loose rodent bait was found in the flour store, mould was seen growing on the ceiling, and a hole in the roof had been given a 'bodge job' repair - with a bucket used to catch the drips. Richard Broad, one of the directors of The Upper Crust bakery in Norwich, said standards began slipping after the business ran into money troubles when a Tesco and Greggs opened nearby. Grimy: Inspectors found The Upper Crust bakery in Norwich had mould growing on the ceiling, mouse droppings on the floors, and out of date ham on sale . Neglected: Paperwork had also been filled out saying areas had been cleaned when they were in fact filthy (left) while loose rat bait and droppings were found in the flour store (right) Health inspectors first noticed problems at the shop, which supplies the University of East Anglia’s Sportspark complex, the Coach and Horses pub and the Fat Cat inn, in 2013. The owners were given time to clean up their act, but when nothing had improved on a return inspection they were hauled into court. Prosecutor David Lowens told Norwich Magistrates' Court that health inspectors had noticed 'very quickly' that the bakery was in an 'extremely serious' state. Out of date ham was found on sale, worktops were dirty and documents had been incorrectly filled out saying areas had been cleaned when this was not the case. James Landals defended the firm, saying its decline after chain stores opened up nearby was 'a sad story'. He said the business, which used to employ three part-time staff and have two directors, has now gone out of business and the company is in the process of being wrapped up.

"With awards season in full swing, and best-dressed lists being quietly curated, the pressure is on for A-listers to pull out showstopping look after look on the red carpet. Luckily for Tinseltown's leading ladies, they can rely on expert advice from those whose sole job it is to pick out an outfit that's going to garner headlines for all the right reasons. One  stylist shaking things up in Hollywood is Micaela Erlanger, a savvy 29-year-old who has the power to transform actresses from relative obscurity to global style icons. Scroll down for video . Micaela Erlanger (left), a savvy 29-year-old stylist, left, is shaking things up on the red carpet. She began working with Downton Abbey star Michelle Dockery (right) who then introduced her to Lupita Nyong'o . Her work on Lupita Nyong'o is a case in point. When the 12 Years A Slave star stepped out at last year's Oscars in a flowing blue Prada gown,  with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline, she became a style icon. Of course, Micaela, whose first client was Joely Richardson for the Anonymous and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo press tours, was behind the look. Micaela and Lupita were introduced by another stylish screen star; Michelle Dockery. Lupita was a little-known Kenyan actress working on movie Non-Stop with Michelle, who said to her: ‘When you’re ready, I have the perfect stylist for you.' The rest was history. Michaela helped transform the red carpet, which, in the late 90s, was awash with prom dresses loved by Gwyneth Paltrow and the Princess look, as championed by Penelope Cruz. Michelle Dockery, resplendent in Rosie Assoulin, met Micaela through her make-up artist . When the 12 Years A Slave star Lupita Nyong'o stepped out at last year's Oscars, left, in a flowing blue Prada gown, with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline, she became a muse. Her red Ralph Lauren gown at last year's Golden Globes was also exquisite . Lupita Nyong'o looking chic in a Giambattista Valli couture dress at the Marie Claire Fresh Faces Party in 2014, left, and pushing the style boundaries in Prada at last year's MET Ball . The 31-year-old actress's striking minimalist style curated by Micaela has had the fashion world buzzing. Hits have included her silk Prada jersey maxidress with ethereal gold lattice embroidery at the Toronto Film Festival for the premiere of 12 Years A Slave. Her striking red Ralph Lauren number from the Golden Globes was simple yet stunning, while her punky Chanel gown at the MTV Movie Awards showed her ability to experiment with trends. Manhattan-born, Connecticut-raised Micaela, who studied at Parsons the New School for Design, turns to trusted and classic designers, such as Carolina Herrera, great Hollywood couturier Valentina and Chanel but works to pick a dress that reflects her client's personality and tastes. Lupita, for example, landed on every glossy magazine's best-dressed list thanks to her fresh, modern, and compellingly confident style; Micaela helps her take risks but in a wearable way. According to Vanity Fair, Micaela, who began working for the late Annabel Tollman, who was known for styling Scarlett Johansson, creates private Pinterest boards for each client. Here, as well as via text, she shares her ideas with them and what looks and styles she thinks would suit them. 'It's a conversation, a collaboration, down to a T,' she said of the process. Michelle Dockery, left, in a form-fitting Barbara Casasola dress at the Lovegold lunch last January, and, right, at 2013's Emmy Awards in a two-tone Prada gown in ruby-red  satin and burgundy silk . 'We're always looking to tell a story through image. In some ways, I almost feel that the red carpet is the runway now and it’s up to, in some part, the talented actors and actresses that walk that red carpet to show the world what fashion can be.' Speaking about Micaela's influence on the red carpet, Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'Micaela is what every A-lister wants in their life: a friend, fashion insider and super stylist all tied into one. 'She has all the best designers - both established and budding - on speed dial and actually takes the time to get to know her clients and figure out what works for them. She turns to fashion-insider favorites, such as Suno, power players like Prada and fledgling designers such as Rosie Assoulin, who Michelle Dockery looks phenomenal in.' Micaela, pictured with Olivia Munn, creates private Pinterest boards for each client and shares her ideas with them . Micaela, who studied at Parsons the New School for Design, turns to trusted and classic designers when dressing her clients . Micaela won't be the only stylist working overtime around awards season - and it seems most stars have a go-to fashion expert on speed dial. Elizabeth Olsen's on-trend red carpet style has often impressed the fashion pack. But the American Godzilla actress revealed it is thanks to no natural flair of her own. The 25-year-old admitted she was forced to seek the services of Cher Coulter, a celebrity stylist, in order to keep up with the fashionable Hollywood starlets that surround her when she first started out. The younger sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen told The Hollywood Reporter: 'There's no way you can figure it all out, especially when you are working on films. You literally have to use a stylist. 'Whatever you wear is like a huge statement out to the world so you have to have someone help you figure it all out.' Red carpet fashion in the 90s was a whole different story, as proved by Kim Basinger, left, in mint green Escada at the 1998 Oscars and Helena Bonham Carter, right, in an off-pink prom-esque gown at the same event . Gwyneth Paltrow in a candy coloured prom gown as she arrives for the 71st annual Academy Awards in 1999, left, and Uma Thurman at the same event . Fast-forward to 2007 and the red carpet was still all about feathers, drama and show-stopping gowns . The actress added that she 'had no clue' what to wear when she began making public appearances. She said: 'I didn't even like to wear dresses to begin with.' It wasn't until the late 1980s that the 'stylist' was born, with Giorgio Armani being hailed as the gamechanger. He dressed A-listers such as Julia Robers and Jodie Foster in his designs and others began to follow suit. The classic silhouettes of the Nineties were the strapless mermaid look, and the waisted ball gown, loved by Gwyneth Paltrow. Retro glamour was the order of the day but now, stars want to stand out from the crowd and are opting for more spontaenous and somewhat risque designs. Luckily for today's stars, red carpet fashion has come a long way since the 90s. Gone are the days when stars - Cate Blanchett (left, at the Golden Globes in 1999 and, Jennifer Aniston in 2003) - played it safe in black . Cher, left, at the Oscars in 1988, right, Celine Dion in a white tuxedo backwards to the Oscars in 1999 . There are, of course, moments in red carpet history that will go down as game changers. Remember when Cher wore her barely-there Bob Mackie gown to pick up her Best Actress Oscar in 1988? Or when Celine Dion chose to wear a white tuxedo backwards to the Oscars in 1999? These moments of true individuality have, ultimately, paved the way for new stars to be able to express themselves on red carpets the world over. Now, we are all a little disappointed if Jennifer Aniston just wears black, or if Reese Witherspoon chooses another strapless number. We want more from our celebrities. And thanks to the efforts of designers, a lot of whom create up to six collections a year, there are thousands of bold, unique, and sometimes hand-embellished couture dresses to pick from. A prom-style dress, or something that is 'old school' (and not in a good way), won't cut it anymore. Stars such as Tilda Swinton, Kate Hudson, Julianne Moore and Lupita  are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries. And it has made the world a much brighter place, fashion-wise. Stars like Kate Hudson, left, at the Oscars 2014, and Julianne Moore, right, at the Golden Globes, are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries, shunning standard black dresses for more daring cuts and textures . The more extreme dressers, like Lady Gaga and Rihanna, are pushing the envelope even further, often championing new and emerging designers; something we wouldn't have seen years ago. And we mustn't forget the late, great Joan Rivers - the one fearless, say-what-she-thought red carpet critic who single-handily turned red carpets into a thing to be watched by the whole world. Speaking about the shift, celebrity dresser and HTC selfie stylist, Alexis Knox, who has worked with the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rita Ora, said: 'Red carpet style makes me so happy because it's not necessarily about sticking strictly to trends but more about wearing what you love and letting it be an extension of your personality. 'We've seen everything from tuxedos to top and skirt combos and while I think it's important to dress appropriately, you only get one shot on the red carpet so you may as well maximise your experience through your outfit. Getting ready is half the fun!'.","Micaela Erlanger is a 29-year-old stylist renowned for her work with Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyong'o .

"A high-end brothel employing only married women for clients wanting to sleep with another man's wife has been raided by Russian police. Most of the women's husbands had no idea their wives had been working as prostitutes- charging as much as £250 an hour for their services- until the exclusive bordello was shut down. The desperate housewives were lured into working in the red light business by other home-makers at the brothel with the promise of earning a little extra spending money, according to police. The housewives cover their faces as Russian police raid the brothel which allowed men to sleep with married women . Potential prostitutes were instructed to bring a marriage certificate before they were allowed to work at the specialist brothel which was set across a seven-room apartment. Prices for services were more than six times higher than a typical outfit with women charging as much as £250 an hour compared to the normal rate of around £40. Officers are now hunting the brothel's madam, known only as 'Mamma' who managed to escape during the raid. Prices for services at the specialist brothel were more than six times higher than other bordellos with men paying as much as £250 an hour for their services (file picture) Police spokeswoman Margarita Maslova said: 'A seven room apartment had been turned into an exclusive brothel where prostitutes were allowed to work only if they brought a marriage certificate confirming they were somebody else's wife. 'We arrested 11 people although the woman that was running the business, who they were instructed to call 'mamma', managed to escape and is being hunted.' The women caught will now face just a £20 fine from police but may have a little more explaining to do when they get home to their husbands.","The specialist brothel only employed married women to cater for their clients .

"A 12-year-old member of a Japanese pop group has been in a coma for more than a week after inhaling helium during a television show stunt. The unnamed girl is a member of the 3B Junior group, a collective of 25 singers aged between 10 and 16 that are hugely popular in the country. She was inhaling helium from a canister as part of a game that involved changing her voice, when she fell unconscious and has yet to recover. Popular: The unnamed 12-year-old is part of the 3B Junior group, a collective of singers aged between 10 and 16 who are hugely popular in Japan. She fell into a coma after inhaling helium gas, which can prove fatal . She was immediately rushed to a Tokyo hospital, where local media reported she was found to have suffered an embolism in the blood supply to her brain. A spokesman for TV Asahi revealed the girl was one of five youngsters taking part in the recording of a variety show on January 28 when the incident happened. The girl is believed to now be  showing signs of activity, including the moving of her eyes and limb, and the spokesman added: 'There are signs of recovery, but she is still not fully fit.' Despite the young girl's public status, her name has not been revealed because she is a minor. TV Asahi has apologised for the incident and said an internal probe into the case was under way. The canister from which she inhaled the gas was marked for adult use only, the channel admitted. Local media said police had also launched an investigation on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in injury. 3B Junior: Despite the girl's public status, her name has not been revealed because she is a minor. Police are investigating the incident and the television station involved has apologised . Inhaling helium is a common party trick, but can prove fatal and deaths have previously been recorded. The UK's Public Health Agency warns that 'breathing in helium...deprives vital organs of essential oxygen' and can can cause 'dizziness, headache and suffocation'. Japanese TV is internationally renowned for the outrageous nature of their game shows, which often feature members of the public and celebrities compting in shows that involve dangerous or humiliating tasks. In 2012, a popular comedian broke his back when he jumped into a swimming pool as part of a programme.","Girl is rushed to hospital and remains in coma after TV stunt goes wrong .

"The grave of a woman who appears to have died in childbirth 7,700 years ago, has yielded a surprising new discovery, years after being found. Archaeologists studying the Siberian grave found evidence of twins who died during a traumatic birth, along with their mother. The bones are thought to be the oldest example of death by obstructed labour and the earliest known evidence of twins so far. Scientists studying the bones of a woman who died in childbirth 7,700 years ago (pictured) , discovered tiny foetus bones in her pelvic area and between her thighs - the oldest known example of death by obstructed labour. Tiny bones can be seen under the skeleton's left rib cage, on her pelvis and between her thighs . The grave was first discovered in 1997 in a Stone Age cemetery in Irkutsk, which lies near the south of the oldest freshwater lake in the world, Lake Bailkal, LiveScience reported. The ‘Lokomotiv’ cemetery was unearthed in 1897 when the Trans-Siberian Railway was under construction, but is partially unexcavated because some of it is covered by buildings. A total of 101 skeletons, thought to be members of a hunter-gatherer community, have so far been recovered from the site. In 2012, Angela Lieverse, an archaeologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, took a fresh look at a skeleton in storage at Irkutsk State University. Duplicate foetal bones (pictured) revealed that woman, who was between 20 and 25 years old, died while giving birth to twins - the earliest known evidence of twins so far in the archaeological record . The grave was first discovered in 1997 in a Stone Age cemetery in Irkutsk, which lies near the south of the oldest freshwater lake in the world, Lake Bailkal. The ‘Lokomotiv’ cemetery (marked on the map) was unearthed in 1897 when the Trans-Siberian Railway was under construction . The occupant of the grave was initially thought to be a mother aged between 20 and 25 years, with a single child. But by studying the foetal remains, Dr Lieverse, realised there were duplicate bones. By studying the position of foetal bones positioned in the mother's pelvic area, Angela Lieverse thinks the woman, who was aged between 20 and 25, died in childbirth. She believes that one of the twins may have been in the breech position – with their feet pointing down – and was only partially delivered. The second twin appears to have died in the womb, trapped behind the other, leading to a fatally obstructed birth. ‘Within five minutes, I said to my colleague, “Oh my gosh; these are twins,”’ she told Live Science. The foetal bones were all situated in the mother’s pelvic area and between her thighs. Dr Lieverse came to the conclusion that the mother probably died during a particularly traumatic birth, after analysing the original placement of the tiny bones. She believes that one of the twins may have been in the breech position – with their feet pointing down – and was only partially delivered. The second twin appears to have got trapped behind the first and  died in the womb, with the mother dying from the obstructed birth. Dr Lieverse said of her theory: ‘It might be a bit circumstantial, but I think it's quite strong.’ The mother was buried lying on her back with a handful of marmot teeth positioned on her body, which is not unusual in ancient graves at the site. The bones are thought to be the oldest example of death by obstructed labour and the earliest known evidence of twins so far. The temporal bone (part of the skull) of 'foetus two' is shown on the left and both temporal bones of 'foetus one' are shown middle and right . Dr Lieverse thinks that the teeth indicate members of the community were either unaware that the woman was pregnant or that her type of death was not unusual. While death as a result of childbirth was likely common in ancient times, evidence of it and instances of twins are incredibly rare in the archaeological record. They are particularly rare in Italy, for example, because an ancient Roman law called Lex Caesaria decreed that babies had to be removed from their mother’s womb before burial. Furthermore, gases from a decomposing body sometimes push a foetus out of a mother’s body after burial, resulting in what is known as a 'coffin birth' and the bones of unborn babies are incredibly fragile and often decay. The discovery was reported in the journal Antiquity.","Grave was uncovered in Irkutsk, Russia, near Lake Bailkal in 1997 .

"Like clockwork: Edwin James Ross had this mugshot taken when arrested for trespassing . A convicted killer with 'Clockwork Orange' tattooed across his forehead has been arrested in the US. Edwin James Ross found himself behind bars on Monday night in Eugene, Oregon, for trespassing. He was booked into the Lane County jail on a misdemeanor charge. The most striking thing about his mugshot was his face tattoo - an apparent reference to Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film, famed for its 'ultra-violent' content. Ross, 33, who was released from custody on Tuesday, has a criminal past. In 2003, he was arrested on suspicion of murder after being accused of shooting his 19-year-old male friend in the head. He later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Last June, he spent time in the Lane County lockup on charges, including domestic violence and reckless burning. In act of unusual self-censorship, the controversial film was banned in the UK by director Kubrick in 1973 amid fears it had encouraged gratuitous copycat attacks.

Take a day trip to Rockingham where you can enjoy epic views of pristine water and swim with dolphins. Alternatively, spend your day cycling around Rottnest Island searching for quokkas and snorkelling. 3. HOBART .

Located at the entrance to the Derwent River, Hobart is an adventurers dream. Take a guided tour of Battery Point which is within walking distance of Hobart’s waterfront.

You will get unrivalled views of the magnificent harbour and even get in some exercise at the same time. Catch a boat from Circular Quay and visit Taranga Zoo. The giraffes have been known to have the best view in Sydney. The city definitely caters to tourists and what tourists don’t love  fireworks? Every Saturday night at Darling Harbour there is a pretty spectacular fireworks show which attracts an impressive crowd. While we all know about Sydney’s most famous beach at Bondi, venture further into the eastern suburbs and stop at Coogee Beach or Bronte. Coogee’s Pavillion bar and restaurant is the newest outdoor bar to take over the city and the rooftop views will not fail to impress.

The tropical climate of Darwin makes it one of the most attractive cities in Australia. Filled with amazing water pools and refreshing waterfalls, this city is closer to Bali than it is to Bondi. Sail across the harbour from Darwin to the Tiwi Islands, glide across wetlands and spot local wildlife, or cool off under a waterfall in Litchfield National Park. There are more crocodiles in the Northern Territory than anywhere else in the world, so jump in a boat or visit a park and meet the real locals. When it's time to relax, catch a movie in one of the twilight cinemas or watch the sunset at the world famous Mindil Beach. Market stalls are huge in Darwin and are where some of the best produce in Australia is sold. Pop into one of the stunning restaurants on the main strip and after dinner hit the party scene for some dancing.","Melbourne has been named the top city Australians most want to visit .

The move was aimed at discouraging young Bosnians, some of whom, particularly from rural areas, have in recent years adhered to the puritanical Wahhabi sect, from going to fight in Syria. In September, Bosnian police detained 16 people on charges of financing terrorist activities, recruiting and fighting for radical groups in Syria and Iraq, authorities said.

"A pizza parlor customer who wrote a bad check in 2002 has written an apology letter and paid the bill after 13 years of feeling guilt - and they even included interest. The customer explained in the letter that they were 'going through a very difficult time financially' and had a 'hungry child to feed' when they wrote a check they knew would bounce. A money order for $54.39 was included with the letter to account for an 8 per cent compound interest on the $20 bill. A pizza parlor customer who wrote a bad check in 2002 wrote an apology letter (pictured) and included a money order of $54.39 to pay the bill, with compound interest, after 13 years of feeling guilt . The writer, who said they had worked hard and 'built up a solid business over the last decade', admitted they thought about the bad check often and were still 'incredibly ashamed and embarrassed at my behavior'. 'I have visited your store several times in the last few years and have always wanted to confess and ask you to forgive me,' they continue. 'But I have not been able to summon up the courage, so I just eat my pizza and leave.' The pizza parlor owner, identified only by the username 'morgan_freemun', posted the letter under the heading 'received this today, I'm speechless' on Reddit, where it has amassed more than 4,000 comments in one day. He said he didn't remember the bounced check and felt 'bad for the poor guy'. The owner posted the letter under the heading 'received this today, I'm speechless' on Reddit, where a user advised him to hang up a sign on his pizza parlor so that the writer would find out he had been forgiven . 'I probably forgot about him when I wrote the check off as a loss and never gave him another thought. This poor dude has been dwelling on this for over a decade.' The owner called the letter a 'big showing of character' and said if he ever finds out who the anonymous writer is, he wanted to have a beer with them - drinks on him. There was no return address or identifying information on the letter. After one Reddit user suggested the parlor put up a sign saying 'all is forgiven, letter received', the owner said he would get working on it right away. 'I really hope to find out who it is, but if not that's cool too,' he said. 'I don't want to embarrass the guy.' The owner said he opened his pizza shop 15 years ago and used to get bad checks all the time in the early 2000s, until he stopped accepting them in 2006. Some Reddit users were inspired by the letter and shared their own stories of helping people who were down on their luck. And one user told the owner the letter had added a 'real spring' to their step and that they 'liked being reminded that good people truly exist.'","Customer paid 8 per cent compound interest with the $20 bill .

"One of the pleasures of travel is getting to sample the local cuisine. But would you tuck in to a developing duck embryo straight from the egg in southeast Asia? Or sip fermented mare's milk in Mongolia? Perhaps a warming bowl of dog soup in Korea? Laura Siciliano-Rosen, co-founder of Eat Your World, a guide to local foods around the globe, says: 'Tasting the locally distinct foods and drinks of a place is absolutely essential to a trip, as they illuminate that region’s unique culture, history, geography, and lore. And seeking those foods out inevitably brings a traveler into closer contact with the local people, allowing for a richer travel experience.' Extra protein? Shirako, which translates as 'white children' is a Japanese dish made of male fish genitalia containing sperm . But not everything on the international menu screams 'eat me'.  In Mexico, spicy grasshoppers, known as chapulines, are a popular snack on sale at the market stalls of Oaxaca, while tacos de sesos - that's beef brain tacos to you and me, are a well-loved treat (which comes with a Bovine spongiform encephalopathy - or mad-cow disease - warming). Feeling thirsty in Mongolia? The local tipple, aireg, is a fermented, alcoholic dairy drink traditionally made from mare's milk. And snake wine  is the drink du jour in China, Vietnam and southeast Asia. Produced by infusing whole snakes in rice wine or grain alcohol, the drink was once believed to have medicinal qualities. There's something fishy about the Swedes' national delicacy. Surströmming, is bulging tinned herring. Why does it bulge? Because inside the fish is slowly festering. And Greenland's offering, Kaestur Hakarl, is fermented shark. Popular South Asian delicacy, balut, is a ready-to-hatch duck embryo that is half-boiled and eaten in the shell. Yum? 'As for how to go about finding these foods: A little pre-trip research goes a long way,' says Siciliano-Rosen. 'But on the ground, it's as simple as asking people where they eat and what their city is known for. Ask your cab driver, your waiter, the person next to you on the metro-anyone. And keep your eyes open - you can probably guess where locals versus tourists are eating by the look of a place (and, often, the prices on the menu). Southest Asia is a hotbed of interesting edibles. Deep fried chicken feet are a popular street food in China, Indonesia, Korea and Malaysia. Balut, is a developing duck embryo that is boiled and eaten in the shell - a favourite in the Philippines. Boshintang, found commonly in Korea, is also known as dog meat soup. Shirako, which translates as 'white children' is a Japanese dish of male fish genitalia containing sperm. In Venezuela, the meat of the largest rodent in the world - the capybara - is a popular dish. Closer to home, there's the humble haggis: a savoury pudding containing sheep's heart, liver and lungs, traditionally cooked in the animal's stomach. Deep fried chicken feet anyone? Fowl extremities are common all over Asia, but would you indulge? But beware of Korean delicacy, Sannakji, which consists of live small octopus and is best served still wriggling. The sucker pads on each squirming tentacle have been known to stick to the inside of diners' throats. Siciliano-Rosen adds: 'When trying new foods, especially if it's from the street, use caution. Of course, be wary of anything made with tap water, including ice, unless you’re sure it’s safe to drink; same goes with raw, unpeeled produce. 'Choose established venues, or eat where lots of locals are eating, particularly women and children. Always wash your hands before eating; in some countries, carrying hand sanitizer or your own utensils is a good idea. And before you travel, check that your vaccinations are up-to-date.' Super carb Cassava is a shrub commonly found in South America, and a great source of carbohydrates - but if it isn't prepared properly it can contain enough cyanide to kill you. In Nambia, the Giant Bullfrog is a delicacy, but they're only safe to eat after the mating season. Eating at the wrong time of year could result in  you kidney failure. Blood clams are considered a delicacy in China. But not cooking them properly can result in hepatitis A, E, thyphoid, and dysentery. When the Ackee, the national fruit of Jamaica, is unripe, its seeds are poisonous and can result in potentially deadly Jamaican vomiting sickness. Japanese dish, Fugu, or pufferfish, contains deadly amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin. Chefs leave just the right amount of poison in to give the diner a tingling sensation on the tongue. Tacos de sesos, or brain tacos, a delicacy in Mexico has a spongy texture, which is not entirely popular with tourists . Something fishy: Kaestur Hakarl is a traditional dish and delicacy of Greenland consisting of fermented  shark . Spicy grasshoppers, known as chapulines, on sale at the Benito Juarez Market in Oaxaca, Mexico . Korean delicacy, Sannakji - a small live octopus, best served still wriggling. The sucker pads have been known to stick in diners' throats . In Mongolia, aireg is a fermented, alcoholic drink made from mare's milk; while in Korea, dog meat soup - or Boshintang - is a favourite dish . Rotting fish anyone? In Sweden, fermented herring - or surströmming - is a favourite (if a little pongy) dish . Snake wine is Produced by infusing whole snakes in rice wine or grain alcohol, the drink was once believed to have medicinal qualities . In Venezuela, the meat of the largest rodent in the world - the capybara -  is a popular dish. Seen in meat form, right .

"Gemma Kyle and her daughter, Selma, (above) have been given £2,900 online by strangers . Kind strangers have donated £3,000 to help a young mother and her toddler daughter move out of a mouldy, rat-infested flat. Gemma Kyle appealed to friends and family for money after growing tired of living in the bedsit in Romford, Essex, with two-year-old Selma and her fiancee, Atakan Koskal. The 22-year-old had been applying for a council house, but was told it would up to five years to find a suitable property. Just two weeks after setting up a Gofundme page, Ms Kyle, a Muslim convert, has received £2,900 in donations from friends and strangers. Appealing for help on the page called Help to give Selma a better life, the young mother wrote: 'I currently live in a bedsit that is infested with mice and mould. 'I have been here for 3 years with very little or no help. 'After 3 years of living like this and being forced to watch my family suffer ive decided I can't take it anymore, so decided to take action myself, my council seems to think it is okay to live like this.' As donations piled in, the young mother spoke of her frustration with the council for not being able to find her a home. 'People think because we live in Britain everything is okay and that people aren’t living in poverty - but the reality is different. 'I’ve got mice traps in the kitchen and the bedroom we share is tiny. It would be okay for one person but not a whole family.' The former shop assistant moved into the property which costs £360 a month in 2012 before giving birth to Selma. As the flat's condition deteriorated, the young mother contacted the council for help and claims she was told she lived in 'overcrowded' and 'unsanitary' housing. The family have been forced to set mice traps and share a bathroom with other people in the building . Ms Kyle appealed to strangers online, asking for donations so that she may give her daughter a better life . Despite having to set traps for rodents and see her partner sleep on the floor, Ms Kyle claims she was told there were other people in worse housing than she is . More than 100 people have donated money to the young mother so that she may be able to move out of the property . The family say they are desperate to leave the flat in Romford, Essex, but had no prospects until recently . Ms Kyle - who takes her fiance's last name, said she started crying when online donations reached £500 . Later this was allegedly contradicted, with another official telling Ms Kyle others lived in worse properties. She was then told she could face waiting up to five years to move into a council property. But after setting up the online donations page, the family is hopeful they will be able to move out in the near future. 'When I saw the donations came in - one as much as £500 - I started crying because I couldn't believe it. 'Unfortunately I could not even message them to say thank you as it was anonymous. I’m so grateful for their support.' Barking and Dagenham Council refused to comment but said in a letter: 'Ms Kyle is bidding regularly for houses but is accepted that it is a matter of personal choice. 'The waiting time for a house in generally longer than that for flatted accommodation. 'With the registered level of priority and increased demand on housing, it is unlikely Ms Kyle will be rehoused during this period.' 'So grateful': Ms Kyle thanked well-wishers for their support after raising almost £3,000 in just two weeks .","Gemma Kyle has been living in her rat-infested Essex home for three years .

"From sexy lingerie to nail varnish, it seems any products can be linked to the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film. But now JD Williams has turned the erotic novel on its head by launching its 'Over 50 Shades of Grey' lingerie campaign. Aimed at the more mature woman, the range is far from the leather and lace usually associated with the EL James books, and is all modeled by women over the age of 50. JD Williams have turned the erotic novel on its head by launching their 'Over 50 Shades of Grey' lingerie campaign . The women hold signs proclaiming 'Age is just a number', and 'We're over 50 shades of grey', while proudly showing off their figures in simple but elegant shapewear from the retailer. The campaign is in direct response to research showing that three out of five UK women aged 50 plus feel underrepresented in the media. The mature market currently stands as the UK’s fastest growing fashion sector, which is now worth £6.7bn and is emerging as Britain’s most powerful consumer group, yet it’s widely ignored. The brand hopes that the images, which will be shown online, will promote body confidence for all women regardless of age, shape and size. Modeled by women over the age of 50 and hair various 'shades of grey' the campaign makes a tongue-in-cheeky connection with the upcoming film adaptation of the erotic novel .

JD Williams spokesperson Carie Barkhuizen said: 'We can expect to be bombarded with images of young women looking luscious in lingerie at this time of year, but what about the more mature woman? 'Interestingly, our research also discovered that 52 per cent of UK women feel most confident over the age of 45, so what better way to showcase that confidence by featuring mature models over 50 looking just as fantastic – and sexy – in lingerie as their younger counterparts? 'Age is just a number and I think our campaign proves that you can good in lingerie at any age!'","JD Williams' campaign inspired by Fifty Shades of Grey film release .

"The family of a hostage shot during a shootout in Stockton between bank robbers and police blamed officers for the death on Wednesday in a claim asking the city to bear responsibility. Misty Holt-Singh, 41, was shot 10 times at the end of a high-speed chase as police fired more than 600 rounds at three robbers using her and two other hostages as human shields after a bank heist. Gregory Bentley, a lawyer for the family, argued that by exchanging gunfire during a chase through Stockton, officers acted irresponsibly and broke with protocol. Claim: The family of Misty Holt-Singh, 41, filed a claim Wednesday that officers acted negligently and broke protocol, which may have resulted in her death during a shootout between bank robbers and police . 'The police department's primary duty is to protect the hostage,' Bentley said. 'Shooting while Misty was in the vehicle violates every standard practice of police protocol.' The family's claim against the city alleges that the gunmen used Holt-Singh as a human shield during the shootout, during which two other hostages were wounded and two gunmen were shot and killed. Stockton City Attorney John Luebberke said that a pending internal investigation is already underway and that the city would wait for it to reach a conclusion. Luebberke said 'officers faced suspects who were intent on violence, firing hundreds of rounds from an automatic weapon and showing every potential for taking their rampage to any number of locations, including schools or private homes.' Holt-Singh was survived by a husband and two children, and the family is expected to file a lawsuit if the city denies the claim for unspecified damages. Holt-Singh visited the bank to withdraw $40 from the ATM as her daughter waited for her in the car outside. Family: Holt-Singh's two children and husband are asking the city for unspecified damages after police fired 600 bullets into a car where the hostages were being used as human shields, according to the family . Pending: The family is expected to file a lawsuit if the city denies their claim, though the city says an internal investigation is still being conducted . Victim: Holt-Singh had stopped to pick up $40 at the Stockton bank when one of the robbers pulled her into the bank and later used her as a human shield during the resulting shootout, the family claims . On his way in, one of the robbers forced Holt-Singh into the bank before she ended up in the car in the chase from police, Bentley said. Stockton police spokesman Joe Silva referred calls to the city manager's office.

"Often they provide a sanctuary for some of the world’s most endangered species. But one zoo is turning out to be rather a dangerous place for some of its inhabitants, a whistleblowing member of staff claims. First, a rare male warty pig brought in to breed with a resident female ended up eating all of their offspring – then fatally injured his mate. Then an endangered species of monkey fell into a pond where it was attacked and eaten by hungry otters. And finally three prize birds found their way out of their living quarters and flew away. Scroll down for video . Elvis (pictured) was brought to Bristol Zoo to father young. But the resident female warty pig Manilla was already pregnant. When she gave birth to piglets, Elvis ate them all then killed her . Never had a chance: These are warty piglets like the ones that were eaten at Bristol Zoo shortly after birth . The whistleblower at Bristol Zoo claimed the deaths and escapes, which have all happened since December, were avoidable. But the zoo, which prides itself on its conservation projects, said all three incidents had caused great distress to the keepers. The first came after Manilla, a female warty pig native to the Philippines, was joined by her new male friend Elvis last September. At the time assistant curator of mammals Lynsey Bugg said: 'We hope the 'King' takes a shining to Manilla and the two become proud parents in the future.' Eaten alive: In the same month, a golden lion tamarin (like the one above, pictured at Bristol Zoo) was eaten alive by American otters after falling into a pond where it became trapped . Hungry group: The American otters are a popular attraction at Bristol Zoo, which has more than 7,000 animals . A spokeswoman for the zoo, which has more than 7,000 animals, said: 'In November Manilla showed some subtle changes to her behaviour and keepers alerted our in-house vet team. 'She showed no physical signs of being pregnant and, as she had not been with a male between July and October, she was well outside the known birth window for this species.' When Manilla unexpectedly gave birth to extremely rare piglets having shown no signs of being pregnant, Elvis ate them all in their enclosure. The zoo worker said: ‘He then also attacked the mother by eating her rear end. She was so badly injured she had to be put down. 'This meant the loss of a family of rare warty pigs that could have been avoided by keeping the male separate.’ Warty pigs are so rare that their numbers are unknown; the species is listed as ‘critically endangered’. A couple of weeks later an endangered golden lion tamarin monkey escaped and fell into a pond surrounding its island enclosure. The whistleblower said: ‘It was trapped in a drainage valve, and then eaten by American otters.’ The monkey is native to Brazil, where only 10,000 remain in the wild. And a week ago three rainbow lorikeets, usually found in Australia, escaped through a hole in their cage and flew off. Alone: Elvis the warty pig was seen trotting around his enclosure today two months after eating his partner's piglets before fatally wounding her . Devoured monkey: Two of the American Otters who ate the rare golden lion tamarin after it fell into their pond, pictured at Bristol Zoo today . The zoo worker said: ‘Only two were recovered. There is still one lorikeet loose somewhere in Bristol.’ A spokesman for the zoo said: ‘Manilla showed no physical signs of being pregnant. The birth of her litter and the subsequent incident with the male was completely unforeseeable.’ She added that the zoo has the ‘highest standards of animal welfare, education and conservation in Europe, as well as world-class in-house veterinary care’. Will Travers OBE, President of the Born Free Foundation, said: 'Wherever wild animals are kept in captivity, accidents can happen. 'However, tragedies can sometimes be prevented and the behaviour of the male Visayan warty pig in this case was hardly impossible to predict. 'Males of many species are widely known to be a threat to infants, especially in captivity. 'It would appear that better understanding of animals' needs and behaviour may have prevented such a tragedy. 'The general public have an expectation that zoos know what they are doing, and that they have in place measures to protect their animals and to avoid such incidents occurring. 'The tragedy at Bristol Zoo is almost certainly not isolated. 'Predictable and preventable 'accidents' regularly occur and the zoo industry, and the Government which oversees the standards, licensing and inspection of zoos, must do more to protect the captive animals for which they are responsible.' Escaped: In another embarssing incident, three rainbow lorikeets recently escaped from Bristol Zoo and one is still on the loose .

"Disturbing footage of a mother koala and her joey plummeting to the ground as their tree is bulldozed by loggers has revealed the grim fate that could face thousands more as plantations continue to be cleared at record speed. The marsupials were spotted clinging onto a tree at an Australian Bluegum Plantation (ABP) in Bessiebelle in south west Victoria by a distressed local mother and her daughter who filmed the incident. Friends of the Earth's spokesperson Anthony Amis told Daily Mail Australia that they have since chosen to remain anonymous after being abused for confronting those involved. Scroll down for video . The marsupials were spotted clinging onto a tree at an Australian Bluegum Plantation (ABP) in Bessiebelle in south west Victoria by a distressed local mother and her daughter who filmed the incident . 'There were verbal threats from apparently the spotter and the machinery operator and there was a threat made to push the woman's car off the road – this behaviour isn't unusual with logging companies,' Mr Amis said. While the mother koala has been reported to have survived the fall, Mr Amis said the woman who filmed the ordeal returned to the same area the next day to find three other injured koalas. 'It is believed that it was a mother and her joey. I've heard that the animal survived the fall but there are still concerns from the footage takers that it could be injured and they don't know what happened to the baby,' he said. 'The person that took the footage went back to the site a day later and found three very sick and injured koalas - one had to be euthanized because it had maggots in it. 'There would have been a wound in the animal that became infected and flies have moved in and laid eggs, then the maggots hatch and start eating into the wound.' They have chosen to remain anonymous after allegedly being verbally abused and threatened by the plantation workers . Wildlife Victoria spokesperson Karen Masson said: 'We do have some people in the area who are monitoring that koala, she has scurried up another tree and rather than stress her any more we are just monitoring her from a distance and hopefully she'll be OK' Daily Mail Australia has contacted ABP for comment. Their website states that it is 'committed to the hardwood plantation industry's ultimate goal of zero harm to koalas' Mr Amis explained that most plantation companies had 'spotters' that walk ahead of the machinery, whose operators can only see ahead, and try to spot koalas before their tree is cut down. 'In this instance, someone wasn't doing their job properly,' he said. 'The Wildlife Act offers koalas protection in Victoria and we think it has been breached in this instance and we will be talking to lawyers in the next day or two about what our options are.' This sentiment was repeated by Wildlife Victoria spokesperson Karen Masson, who told Channel Seven News that authorities were monitoring the koala mother that was filmed falling alongside her home. 'We do have some people in the area who are monitoring that koala, she has scurried up another tree and rather than stress her any more we are just monitoring her from a distance and hopefully she'll be OK,' Ms Masson said. 'We would like to see these people prosecuted – this is cruelty.' Tens of thousands of hectares of blue gum trees have been planted in the region as part of the plantation in the last 15 to 20 years, according to Mr Amis. The woman who filmed the incident returned to the site the next day where she found three other injured koalas, one of which had an infested wound and had to be euthanized (pictured) 'There would have been a wound in the animal that became infected and flies have moved in and laid eggs, then the maggots hatch and start eating into the wound' Due to a lack of alternative native forest, hundreds of koalas are believed to have moved in and now call it home. But as loggers start removing the trees, Mr Amis has predicted a 'koala blood bath'. 'According to top koala expert Steve Phillips, he estimates that on the most nutrient rich soils we could be looking at a koala on each hectare – that's a lot of animals,' he said. 'Not all of the plantations would be that high, but we imagine that 80 per cent of the plantations would have koala activity. 'Now the plantations are being cut, they're being logged at a great rate. There are more blue gums being harvested than ever before, so the impact on the animal is going to be severe.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted ABP for comment. Their website states that it is 'committed to the hardwood plantation industry's ultimate goal of zero harm to koalas'. Daily Mail Australia has contacted ABP for comment. Their website states that it is 'committed to the hardwood plantation industry's ultimate goal of zero harm to koalas' In June, a post to their website said that 'significant improvements' had been made to its koala management and protection program over the previous six months.These are listed as having independent koala spotters and the implementation of new technologies and work practices. In an ideal world, companies would perform a population assessment in their plantations before the logging begins and if animal numbers are high, the area is not cut down until the animals have moved on. 'I don't think population surveys are being done by this company- I think they're meant to leave a few trees standing if they spot a koala and just log around it,' Mr Amis said. 'What we need is corridors and linkage inside the plantation so companies need to dedicate a large proportion of their land to rehabilitate native forests within their holdings.That will provide safe movement within and beyond the plantation boundary for koalas. 'There needs to be approved relocation programs that identify suitable habitats, and there needs to be designated exclusion zones. 'All tree felling should cease within a two-tree distance of any koala observed and should not resume until it has moved on or been relocated. They need to train koala spotters and have rescue kits and people who are capable of handling and processing koalas who are also linked with vets and trained to treat injured koalas.'","A distressed local mother and daughter captured the moment on camera at an Australian Bluegum Plantation in Bessiebelle in south west Victoria .

Untimely death: Brandon Holt's family said that they once thought about what their son would be when he grew up but now they can only think about what he could have been . He was charged with keeping a loaded .22-caliber rifle unlocked in his bedroom, where his son found it in April 2013. The boy took it outside and shot Brandon Holt once in the head.

When it was time for Christine Holt to make a statement she told the judge that she and her husband used to imagine what their son would be when he grew up. 'Now we can only imagine what he could have been,' she said, her eyes erupting into tears. She said she has recurring thoughts that she didn't do her duty as a mother.

'I couldn't protect him. I couldn't save him. It's my job. I would have given anything to do so,' she said. Christine Holt said that because her family cannot afford to move from their home she becomes terrified every time she sees Senatore's home where the shooting occurred just two doors down from them. Holt said that even though Sentaore will go to prison his sentence will not bring back her son. The courtroom was filled with nearly three dozen members of the Holt family all of whom were visibly heartbroken. Brandon's older step-brother, Skylar Watins had a message for the Senatore family. 'I just want them to please lock them up. Be safe,' he said of the family keeping guns. You destroyed me and my family and worst of all my brother's life. Don't do the same to your own,' he added.

I have been a God-fearing law-abiding citizen.' He went on to say that like many Americans he uses guns to hunt and fish and he never imagined something as horrible as Brendan's death could occur. 'One horrible mistake, one terrible lapse in judgment which will haunt me for the remainder of my days,' he said. Senatore said he can only imagine the pain the family feels following the death of their son since he has children of his own. 'My wife and my children are my life, which makes what happened...so very painful,' Senatore said. 'I cannot begin to fathom the loss of any of my children, therefore I cannot imagine the depth of pain and sorrow that Ron and Christine experience on a daily basis.'

"A Florida woman is facing child abuse charges after she hit the brakes 'while going 10mph' because her children were bickering. Lorena Sullivan Simpson, 43, from Port St Lucie, was trying to stop her nine-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter from fighting in the back seat when she put the car to a stop near their home. Her 12-year-old daughter was sitting in the front seat not wearing a seat belt and slammed her head into the windshield. Port St Lucie mother Lorena Sullivan Simpson, 43, slammed on the brakes when her children in the backseat were fighting and her daughter, 12, hit the windshield . Mrs Sullivan Simpsons said the girl was leaning forward and not wearing a seat belt before she left a crack on the glass . Department of Children and Families arrived at Mrs Sullivan Simpson's home three days later. She was arrested, but claims she never harmed her daughter on purpose and didn't know she wasn't wearing a seat belt. Police say that the windshield was cracked and the girl complained of dizziness and headaches, but was not taken to the doctor by her mother. 'There was no bump, so I'm sorry but I guess I did the wrong thing,' said Mrs Sullivan Simpson, who is out on bond, told WPBF. She said that she was travelling at 10mph and her daughter was bending down texting when she was jolted forward and her ponytail hit the windshield. The children are now with their father in Kentucky. Third degree felony charges in Florida can carry up to five years in prison upon conviction.

"Joke: Myleene Klass has mocked parents at her daughter's school for soliciting donations towards children's birthday presents . It wouldn’t be the first time a child’s birthday party has led to a bust-up in the school playground. But in this case it’s the parents who are at war – and one of them is broadcaster Myleene Klass. She has angered fellow mothers by mocking emails two of them sent suggesting that other parents club together to buy their children birthday gifts, including a Kindle. Her sarcastic response, in which she said she was going to collect money to buy her seven-year-old daughter Ava a unicorn for her birthday, led to a confrontation with one of the mothers at the £5,000-a-term school yesterday. Problems began after 36-year-old Miss Klass, the former pop star turned Classic FM presenter, posted on social media two emails she had received ‘from some school mums’, after first changing the names. The first email read: ‘Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. Sarah would like a Kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on February 9. ‘If you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [sic] school bag, marked for Jane/me that works too. I will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party. Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.’ A second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £10 would be a ‘popular amount’ to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £200 – but adds: ‘Feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.’ Shortly after, Miss Klass published her stinging reply in which she said she was collecting ‘unicorn money’ towards a ‘real, live unicorn’ for Ava. Warming to her theme, she added: ‘I’d like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too.’ And making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners, she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com. Scroll down for video . Mockery: Ms Klass posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response . Miss Klass, who lives in North London, entitled her reply ‘Let’s put the fun back into Bdays!’ and shared it with her 459,200 followers on Twitter and 75,000 on Instagram. Hours later, she was confronted in the playground as she picked up Ava from her school. A fellow parent, whose daughter was one of the subjects of the email, called across the playground: ‘Why did you do it, Myleene? Why?’ Miss Klass called back: ‘If you’ve got a problem with it, talk to me in private.’ Other parents have written to the headteacher. One wrote: ‘It was a very distasteful and cheap shot.’ Another mother said: ‘She has belittled us so publicly. Lots of people have complained,’ while a third added: ‘She isn’t going to have any friends left.’ Mother: Ms Klass was making fun of parents whose children attend the same school as her daughter Ava . Gift-giving has become a big business in many top private schools as parents vie to curry favour with teachers. Tatler magazine reported last year that some teachers had been given presents as lavish as £1,000 handbags, diamond necklaces and cases of vintage wine. At one school, parents even offered teachers the chance to use their private jet. A mother at a London prep school said that she was emotionally blackmailed into donating £90 - the minimum amount acceptable - to a fund for teachers' gifts. Some schools have had to introduce new rules capping the value of presents teachers can accept - at Stowe, for example, staff must declare any gifts above £50. One defended the arrangement over buying presents, saying: ‘It is to make it easier for parents so they don’t buy expensive presents that nobody wants. There is no obligation. Myleene has misunderstood the school’s community spirit.’ Others claimed that the emails were actually a year old. On parenting website Mumsnet, opinion was divided. One wrote: ‘Well good on her for shaming these grabby idiots. It’s crass and rude to ask for money instead of a gift.’ Another posted: ‘One of the mums asked to do this at our school! I think it’s so rude!’ But others sided with the parents asking for money. One wrote: ‘What’s wrong with asking for contributions towards a larger present? It seems much more sensible than getting 30 presents which you have to find room for and may not be played with.’ A spokesman for Miss Klass, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Hero, declined to comment.

"Shares in Greek banks crashed by more than a quarter yesterday as Athens urged Berlin not to go on humiliating a ‘proud nation’. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s new finance minister, issued an extraordinary defiant statement invoking the rise of the Nazis when Germany was crippled by debts between the wars. After a tense meeting with his German counterpart in Berlin, Wolfgang Schaeuble, he declared: ‘We didn’t even agree to disagree.’ Tension: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (right) asked Germany's Wolfgang Schauble to bring to an end the 'gross indignity' that his country is enduring as they battle a debt crisis . Markets took fright after the European Central Bank (ECB) said it would no longer accept Greek government bonds in return for lending – an aggressive move which last night prompted large protests on the streets of Athens. The ECB’s stance forced the Greek central bank to provide tens of billions of euros in emergency funding to the country’s banks. Shares in Greek lenders slumped by as much as 28 per cent at the news and analysts warned the risk of the country crashing out of the EU was now greater than at the height of the last crisis in 2012. Mr Varoufakis, whose far-Left party Syriza swept to power last month, compared Greece’s plight to that of inter-war Germany. Denial: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already made it clear that her country is determined to oppose to any reduction to the Greek debt . Germany was crippled by huge debts after the First World War and experienced hyperinflation, wrecking its economy. Its financial woes helped fuel the rise of Hitler. Mr Varoufakis said: ‘If you humiliate a proud nation for too long and subject it to the worry of a debt deflation crisis, without light at the end of a tunnel then things come to the boil.’ He warned about the rise of Greece’s neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, which came third in the country’s general election. ‘It is one of history’s greatest ironies that Nazism is rearing its ugly head in Greece,’ he said. Mr Schaeuble, speaking after the talks, ruled out any possibility of writing off a chunk of Greece’s debts, which stand at more than £240billion. He said Greece ‘belonged in the euro’, but added: ‘Some of the measures the new government announced ... don’t necessarily go in the right direction in our view.’ Syriza was elected on a promise to renegotiate the terms of Greece’s bailout, seeking a 50 per cent debt write-off. Mr Schaeuble claimed he and Mr Varoufakis had ‘come much further than anyone expected’. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras pledged to ‘put an end once and for all’ to the EU’s austerity policies. ‘Greece is no longer the miserable partner who listens to lectures to do its homework. Greece has its own voice.’ Tour: Mr Varoufakis this week met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne as the new Greek leaders tour Europe seeking support for a new debt deal . Speaking on a visit to Leeds, Chancellor George Osborne said the stand-off was now the largest threat to the British economy. ‘We’ve known from our recent experience we are affected when there is instability in the Eurozone so it’s in our interests to come to an arrangement,’ he said. Greece’s Attica Bank recorded the biggest single loss, down 28 per cent at one stage. Piraeus Bank, the biggest lender, fell 27 per cent and National Bank of Greece 26 per cent. Giuseppe Maraffino, an analyst at Barclays, said: ‘The probability of a Greek exit is clearly now higher than at any time in 2012.’","Yanis Varoufakis asks for an end to the 'gross indignity' of austerity .

"British businessman Paul Dunham, 59 (pictured) has been jailed for four years over a £1m fraud . A retired British businessman who took an overdose with his wife to try and avoid extradition to the U.S. over a £1million fraud has been jailed for four years. Paul Dunham, 59, and his wife Sandra, 58, used fraudulent expense claims to pay for a time share in Barbados,  luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa and other personal expenses, the  US authorities said. The pair had been extradited  in May last year, after losing a High Court battle against standing trial in the U.S. over fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham's company, Pace. Their extradition came days after they attempted to take their own lives at their Northampton home. Mr Dunham has now been sentenced for one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one of money laundering over the scheme. Michael Evans, Mr Dunham's solicitor, said the defendant would not seek repatriation to the UK, so he can serve his sentence near to his family. He added that 11 other charges were dismissed against him at the Maryland District Court in Greenbelt as part of a plea deal. Mr Evans said: 'The US prosecutors have agreed that they will not attempt to block Paul's repatriation to the UK and I will now work with the Ministry of Justice to facilitate his return to serve his sentence in the UK, near to his wife and grandchildren. I look forward to his safe return to the UK.' A Justice Department spokeswoman said that a U.S. district judge Paul W Grimm today sentenced Dunham to four years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. The authorities told how the defendants had worked for Pace Worldwide, located at various times in Maryland and North Carolina, and had a subsidiary in the United Kingdom named Pace Europe Ltd. Pace produced parts for the repair and reworking of electronics for the military and others. Mr Dunham held a number of executive positions there, including president and chief operating officer. Mrs Dunham was initially hired to work for the European subsidiary in the accounts department, and eventually became the director of sales and marketing for Pace Worldwide. Mr Dunham and his wife Sandra (right) used fraudulent expenses claims to pay for a time share in Barbados, along with luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa and other personal expenses, the US authorities said . The Dunhams moved from the UK to Maryland then North Carolina, and were provided with corporate credit cards. Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement that falsely described the expenditures as business expenses, the authorities said. For example, Mr Dunham represented that $3,007 (£1,900) had been spent on meals during business meetings, when in fact the money was spent on luxury bedding for his North Carolina residence. Mrs Dunham also sought reimbursement for $8,397 (£5,330) which she represented as expenses incurred to cancel a holiday due to a business meeting. These expenses were actually mortgage payments the couple made on two separate time share units they had bought in Barbados. The paid were extradited to the U.S in May last year, days after they attempted to take their own lives at their Northampton home . Other personal expenses which were falsely described as business expenditures included personal legal fees, expensive furniture, a domed pet residence and a dog sofa. The couple also fraudulently billed Pace Europe Ltd for business expenses already paid by Pace Worldwide, obtaining duplicate reimbursements, the authorities said. In addition, a substantial portion of the scheme involved Mr Dunham abusing a private position of trust to manage and direct others, including his secretary, in the execution of the scheme. Moreover, he repeatedly forged receipts and invoices to create the false appearance that they were for business, rather than personal expenses. Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement, U.S. authorities said . As a result of the lengthy scheme, one million dollars (£635,500) in actual losses were incurred. The couple have agreed to forfeit and pay restitution of that amount, the statement said. Mr Dunham was originally indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland, in December 2011. Mrs Dunham was accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him. In April, they lost a high court battle against extradition. The next month, they were taken to Northampton General Hospital after taking a drug overdose the night before they were due to hand themselves in to police and in turn to U.S. marshals. Journalists due to take a statement outside their home alerted police when the couple did not answer the door. House: The Dunhams were found by police officers at their detached home in Northampton in May . Senior District Judge Howard Riddle at Westminster Magistrates' Court concluded that they had deliberately taken an overdose to avoid or delay extradition. Later the couple, from Northampton, were handed over to U.S. marshals at Heathrow by officers from the Metropolitan Police's extradition unit. They then pleaded guilty in December last year. Last week, Mrs Dunham was sentenced to two months imprisonment with credit for time already served in custody, with the judge ordering she serve the remaining 18 days under home detention. Gary Procter and Deborah Boardman, the couple's US defence attorneys, said after today's hearing that the couple had been through an 'extraordinary ordeal' over the past five years. 'We are disappointed that Paul will have to spend additional time in prison before he is reunited with his family and friends in the UK, but he can finally see light at the end of this long, dark tunnel,' they said in a statement. 'As for Sandra, we are very pleased that she will be returning to the UK in a couple weeks where she will await Paul's return.'

"A top Tory has said that he would not 'shed a tear' if Britain votes to leave the European Union. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said that the 'most important thing' was for voters to be given a choice on the issue – but said he would not mind they chose to leave. Mr Javid also lashed out at the police for using anti-terror powers to 'undermine' the freedom of the press by accessing journalists' mobile phone records. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said that he would not 'shed a tear' if Britain votes to leave the European Union . The millionaire former banker, speaking at a Westminster lunch, insisted he was 'not making any plans to lead any party' after being questioned about his future ambitions. It comes amid growing speculation that Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, is being lined up as the candidate of the Conservative Eurosceptic right. The Culture Secretary said has previously said Britain should not be frightened of cutting ties with Brussels. But, when asked if he would regret Britain leaving the union, he said: 'The most important thing is that the British people are given a choice. I'm pleased that the Conservatives are absolutely committed to that, and that is what will happen if we win the election. 'Would I shed a tear? No.' The remarks came after he announced new safeguards requiring police to obtain authorisation from a judge before accessing journalists' phone records could be put in place before the general election in May. The protection was recommended by a report from the Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Anthony May, which Home Secretary Theresa May accepted in full on Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has written to Mrs May urging her to bring forward legislation before the end of the month. Mr Javid told a lunch of Westminster political journalists he was 'shocked' by the extent of official snooping on journalists revealed by Sir Anthony' s report. He said there was 'no excuse' for the authorities using powers created to tackle terrorism as a tool to prevent scrutiny by reporters. The Culture Secretary said: 'Democracy needs journalists to function. David Cameron today insisted he would 'definitely' give voters an in-out EU referendum in 2017 . That is why last month's attacks in Paris struck a chord around the world. They weren't just an attack on a magazine, they were an attack on the ideals that underpin our way of life. 'Our journalists also face insidious threats from other quarters, be they commercial, judicial or political. Yesterday, we learnt the full extent to which Ripa (the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) was used to monitor journalists and their contacts. 'Like many of you, I was shocked by what was revealed. 'In Paris we saw terrorists attacking the fundamental freedoms of the media, so I was appalled to discover that legislation created to hamper terrorists was now being used to undermine those very same freedoms.' Home Secretary Theresa May will bring forward plans to stop police accessing journalists' phone records without a warrant . Mr Javid said he had raised concerns with ministerial colleagues and welcomed Mrs May's announcement that the law would be reformed. 'The Prime Minister has confirmed that judicial approval will now be required before Ripa is used to access journalists' data,' he said. 'It is a great victory for everyone who believes in press freedom. 'I want to see the law changed to make it happen during this Parliament, because there is no excuse for using anti-terror legislation to threaten legitimate reporting, no matter how awkward that reporting might be. 'Blowing a whistle on council corruption doesn't warrant undercover surveillance. A front page that embarrasses a senior politician is not a threat to national security. Journalism is not terrorism.' Mr Javid said that the correspondents reporting on politics in the parliamentary lobby were 'just as much part of our democracy as the MPs that sit in the chamber' and told his audience of political journalists: . 'If you are not free to go about your legitimate business, it is our democracy that suffers.' Sir Anthony's review of the use of the Ripa surveillance powers was launched in October after alarm was expressed about incidents such as Scotland Yard accessing the phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row. The report found that Ripa did not 'provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources' and concluded: 'It is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information.' In a statement welcoming the findings, Mrs May said: 'A free press is fundamental to a free society and the Government is determined that nothing is done that puts that at risk.' In his report, Sir Anthony found that over a three-year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists. Some 608 applications for such data were authorised by a ranking officer. But the report stressed that was just 0.1% of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation. It also concluded that police had not used Ripa to circumvent other legislation and forces were not 'randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources'.","Sajid Javid said 'most important thing' was for voters to be given choice .

'Anthem’s own associates’ personal information – including my own – was accessed during this security breach,' he said. 'We join you in your concern and frustration, and I assure you that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data.'

"These heartwarming pictures capture the incredible transformation of a poodle cross puppy who just two weeks ago was barely recognisable as a dog. The one-year-old animal, called Dave, was one of nine of the breed found in a shocking state - caked in mud while blinded by their horrendously matted fur. After being found on the side of the road in Winchester, the dogs were painstakingly shaved and nursed back to healthy by the RSPCA - with their touching story prompting more than £4,000 in donations to pay for their care. Scroll down for video . Appalling treatment: This harrowing picture was released by the RSPCA two weeks ago and shows two poodle cross puppies resembling bundles of rags.  Dave is circled . What a difference! This heartwarming image captures the incredible transformation of Dave the poodle cross puppy, who just two weeks ago was severely ill anf blinded by its matted fur . Dave was pictured bounding around a garden today with astounding energy considering he was unable to walk two weeks ago, while also suffering from severe illness and depression. It took rescuers around three hours to shave each dog, and so terrified were the animals of being touched that vets fear they may have been beaten by their owners. The total mass of hair weighed a staggering 12kg, filling three plastic bags. All nine dogs are still being given medical treatment and will not be able to go to new homes until they are healthy and also micro-chipped and neutered. New lease of life: The one-year-old, one of nine dogs abandoned on the side of the road in Winchester, was unable to stand just two weeks ago but was seen running around in a garden today . Happy again: The energetic white puppy was pictured today with RSPCA inspector Jan Edwards . Bounding around: It took rescuers around three hours to shave each dog, and so terrified were the animals of being touched that vets fear they may have been beaten by their owners . Three different RSPCA centres are now taking care of the canines - Mount Noddy, Chichester, West Sussex and Ashley Heath and The Ark, both in Stubbington, Hants. Donations for the dogs have flooded in from members of the public hoping to give the animals a healthy future - raising £4,298.77. One couple, Roderick and Hazel Ross, from Warsash, Hants, pledged £2,000 to the cause. And donations from as far as Canada came in after their heartbreaking story reached the country. Saved: One of the dogs is pictured after being painstakingly shaved of its matted fur last month . RSPCA inspector Jan Edwards said: 'There's a lot of love for these dogs. We have had masses of people wanting to re-home them. 'That amount of money is amazing. We are very very grateful for people that have given their hard earned cash. 'It's going to cost around that much to keep the dogs because they will all not be well enough for re-homing for some time.' Speaking about the Ross' donation and Hazel, she said: 'Their donation was above and beyond. 'I want to go and visit them, show them pictures of the dogs, talk about my experiences with them, and thank them.' All nine dogs are still being given medical treatment and will not be able to go to new homes until they are healthy and also micro-chipped and neutered . Bags of fur: The matted and filthy hair which was shaved from the dogs was enough to fill three large sacks . After the dogs were found, vet Martha Edwards said the puppies' mother Sian had to be sedated while her fur was cut off, adding: ‘She had stones trapped between her paw pads which had obviously been there for some time. 'It is disgusting. I have never seen a dog in this condition before.’ An animal welfare expert said it was likely the nine dogs had been kept in ‘unlivable’ conditions for their whole lives before being ditched ‘with no concern for their welfare’.","One-year-old Dave pictured bounding around a garden in Hampshire today .

"The flu jab will protect just three per cent of patients this winter, health experts warned last night. They say the virus that causes the illness has mutated so much that it no longer ‘matches’ the current vaccine, which was only developed a year ago. The 3 per cent figure predicted by experts at Public Health England would be the worst in at least a decade. The NHS spends around £100million each year on the flu vaccination programme, with each jab costing £7.60. Although it is never totally effective, it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients. Last night questions were being asked about why health officials did not raise the alarm earlier. The flu jab will protect just three per cent of patients this winter, health experts warned last night (file picture) Researchers at Public Health England assessed the effectiveness of the jab by looking at saliva samples from 1,314 patients with flu.They found that only 3 per cent had the H3N2 strain of the virus, the remainder had a mutated form. Yesterday experts blamed flu for a sudden spike in death rates – particularly among the elderly, even though most have the jab every year for free on the NHS. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that just over 25,300 over-65s died in the last two weeks until January 23, a rise of 40 per cent compared to the previous year. The death toll attributed to flu by the spring is now predicted to be the worst since 1999/2000, though latest NHS figures suggest the season has passed its peak. The three-year high last month may have contributed to the recent crisis in A&E. Millions of patients have the flu jab every year including certain ‘at risk’ groups such as the elderly, pregnant woman, those with underlying illnesses such as asthma and health workers who get it for free. In addition, other individuals pay for it privately or receive it from their employers. Experts are now urging GPs to prescribe antiviral tablets – which treat the illness rather than prevent it – to all vulnerable patients as soon as they show symptoms. The problem has come about because the vaccine started being developed in February last year, nine months before the flu season typically gets under way in November. The NHS spends around £100million each year on the flu vaccination programme, with each jab costing £7.60. Although it is never totally effective, it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients (file picture) Experts predicted H3N2 (pictured) would be the most dominant virus but it has now mutated . It is made up of a tiny amount of the strain of the virus that experts predict will be the most dominant – this year it is H3N2. This is enough to kick-start the patient’s immune system to develop a resistance to the virus. But this year, the virus has mutated so it no longer matches the vaccine and the majority of patients aren’t protected. Experts say the vaccine will still protect against two other strains of flu that could emerge later this year. Experts hope this year is a one-off and stress that the effectiveness of the jab in previous years shows it is still the best method for preventing flu. The 3 per cent figure emerged in a study by Public Health England and published in the journal Eurosurveillance. Professor John Watson, the country’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: ‘The latest data show that levels of flu are generally decreasing in the UK. ‘We do see “drift” in the flu vaccine from time to time, but even so, I want to reassure people that it is still the best overall way to protect yourself and your family from flu, along with good hand hygiene.' But Katherine Murphy of the Patients’ Association, branded the disclosures ‘extremely worrying’ for those who thought they were protected against flu. She said: ‘It beggars belief that health officials weren’t aware just how badly the vaccine was working a long time ago. If they didn’t realise the scale of the problem until now they aren’t doing their job properly.’","Flu jab, which costs £7.60 a time, usually protects around 60% of patients .

"It's billed as the 'ultimate once-in-a-lifetime Valentine's Day experience' inside one of London's tallest buildings, and comes with an eye-watering £5,000 bill. For those who can afford it, this expensive meal-for-two boasts exotic dishes and a bottle of vintage Champagne - all served by your very own private butler. However, while the five-course bespoke menu served inside 20 Fenchurch Street - also known as the Walkie-Talkie due to its shape - is certainly not run-of-the-mill grub, it does include less exciting items such as artichoke soup, chicken wings and yogurt granola. The dinner will be served in the private area of Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill, The Vinoly Room . The pre-dessert course of warm chocolate tart, glazed banana, honeycomb, peanut butter and gold leaf . The feast will be served on the 37th floor of the venue - affording diners a stunning view across the capital - in the private area of Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill, The Vinoly Room, which will be reserved just for two people. And during the evening diners will be able to drink their way through two glasses of Champagne Ruinart Brut Rose, one bottle of Dom Perignon, one bottle of Chateau Gruaud-Larose 1997, and two glasses of Beres Tokaji. The meal kicks off with an amuse bouche of truffled Jerusalem artichoke soup with girolles and smoked bacon brioche. For starters there is a choice of roasted veal sweetbreads morels, glazed chicken wing and sherry, or butter poached lobster, hand-rolled macaroni, duxelles (finely chopped mixture of mushrooms or mushroom stems, onions, shallots and herbs sauteed in butter) and Champagne sauce. For entrees, there is a choice of grilled turbot, whipped potato, oyster cream and caviar, or sirloin of Aberdeen Angus beef, glazed short rub, foie gras and truffled Madeira sauce. Outstanding views: The £5,000 meal takes place on the 37th floor of 20 Fenchurch Street . Diners will be able to enjoy incredible views across London, including The Shard . This is accompanied by fine wine Chateau Gruaud-Larose 1997, 2eme Cru Classe, St Julien, Bordeaux, France. The menu also offers two desserts. First is warm chocolate tart, glazed banana, honeycomb, peanut butter and gold leaf while the main dessert is homemade yogurt granola served with a coffee and clementine marmalade, served with two glasses of Beres Tokaji 5 Puttonyos Aszu 2007. But while the menu alone may not seem like it should warrant the £5,000 bill, the view (and private dining element) is what really bolsters the price of this romantic offering. As the Walkie-Talkie is the fifth tallest building in the city, diners will be able - if it's a clear day - to feast while enjoying unprecedented views in the floor-to-ceiling-window restaurant - part of the building's Sky Garden - including The Shard and Tower Bridge. 'The Vinoly Room provides an exclusive, utterly luxurious dining room. A dedicated butler serving a five-course menu of the highest quality ingredients, including lobster and turbot, alongside matched wines and champagnes, and what are arguably the best views in London this Valentine's Day, comes at a premium,' a spokesperson for Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill said to FEMAIL.

"Darren Scott, 26, allegedly attacked his flatmate with a kitchen knife midway through a massage at his luxury Mayfair flat, a court has heard . A psychology graduate was 'possessed' when he stabbed his friend at his Mayfair apartment and told him to 'stand still I need to finish the job.' Darren Scott, 26, is said to have inflicted 21 injuries after plunging a kitchen knife in to his victim's neck during a massage as rap music blared in the background. The Old Bailey heard Scott, who denies charges including attempted murder, screamed as the victim locked himself in the en-suite bathroom. Scott, a graduate from Hull university, is accused of carrying out the attack at the victim's plush three-storey apartment on July 3 last year – leaving the master bedroom soaked in blood. The horrified victim, an art curator who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he was sure he had been murdered. He said Scott, who he had only known for two weeks, had confessed to enjoying kinky bondage games in the past and had become 'intimidating' the day before the attack. He became weary of Scott's wide-eyed stare and told friends he feared he was a 'psychopath, he said. Giving evidence, he said Scott started looking for a vein in his neck after offering to give his new friend a massage. Midway through, Scott said he was going to get some salt water from the kitchen, the court heard. He then allegedly told his friend to lie on his back and put a T-shirt over his face, before changing the soothing music to 'quite loud and angry' sounds. He then pulled out the knife and started stabbing him repeatedly, the court heard. 'Darren was not doing much, he was rubbing mainly my chest and I was very aware that, unlike what he was doing on my back, he was not doing anything significant other than rubbing close to my neck and the upper part of my chest, only with his left hand', he said. 'I became very anxious that Darren was just buying time, rubbing my neck and not doing much. I had a bad gut feeling. 'I distinctly remember listening to the lyrics of the music as thought there was something bad going on.' He said Scott then tapped his neck ""like a nurse looking for a vein"". 'I froze and thought there was something not right, in fact there was something dangerous', he added. 'I don't know how long it went on for but I felt there was something sinister. By that time, Darren had put his knees on my arms so I was locked under him.' He told the court Scott had confessed to enjoying kinky bondage massages with past partners, and had a rope and handcuffs with him in his bag. The court heard Scott moved in to the Mayfair flat just a day after they met in July last year. But within a few days his host started to suspect Scott was taking advantage of his hospitality. He said he was preparing to tell Scott to leave but allowed him to give him a massage as he had slept badly the night before. Scott, of no fixed address, is on trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) and denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud . He continued: 'In a flash, Darren's body moved and as soon as his body moved I turned myself away from Darren's right. 'Darren struck me, not where he was tapping, but here, below my ear. I knew Darren had stabbed me. 'I managed to throw Darren off my body and the next thing I remember I was fighting off the knife in the middle of the room. 'Darren stabbed me repeatedly around the same area of my neck. I fought with my arms and kept Darren off me.' The victim said he struggled to stay on his feet due to the amount of blood pouring from his wounds on to the floor. 'Within a short amount of time, a great deal of blood had already splashed out of me', he said. 'When I got up there were repeated blows from the knife. I was simply trying to stop Darren from getting the knife into me.' 'Darren was like a possessed, vicious man who was staring in my eyes, telling me: ""What did you think this was all about - stand still I need to finish the job"", he said. 'When Darren first moved to strike, I think he made a sound. I can't remember if these sounds are in my head or I heard them. 'Darren was using his left hand, trying to put his fingers into my neck wounds and rip them open them with his hand as he was striking with the other one and I was shouting ""murder""'. But he managed to struggle free and lock himself in the en-suite bathroom, while he had blood gushing from his neck. 'I was sure that I had been murdered and I had a very short time to live', he told jurors. 'The only thought I had in my mind was why I had been so patient, and that I had a gut feeling - an uncomfortable gut feeling - and I had been too patient. 'I was now dying because I had been murdered, these are the last minutes of my life and this is how my life has come to an end.' The court heard Scott eventually let the injured man call for an ambulance after he had barricaded himself in the bathroom and he received emergency treatment to his injuries. Scott was later arrested while socialising in a jazz bar in Brough, near Hull. The court heard he had used his alleged victim's bank card to pay for the £280 train fare. After he had moved in to the luxury apartment, Scott began taking pictures of the apartment and sending them to his friends, claiming it was paid for by his new employers Procter and Gamble, the court was told. But it later emerged Scott had forged documents, falsely claiming that he worked for the company. Another document showed a £420,000 payment into a bank account that did not exist, the court was told. Scott also allegedly used his new friend’s bank card to go on a £1,700 spending spree at House of Fraser. Scott, of no fixed address, denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud. He has admitted a second count of fraud over the House of Fraser shopping. The trial continues.

"First, many parents decided to avoid giving their children the MMR jab because of alleged - and now disproven - links to autism. Now, the rejection of vaccines seems to be catching on with pet owners, potentially putting animals at risk. Among the jabs that they are refusing, are canine distemper and parvovirus, which can both prove fatal, New York magazine reported. However, it is illegal for owners not to protect their pets from rabies. A number of vets in the US have noticed a trend for people who are reluctant to vaccinate their pets. Among the jabs that owners are refusing, are those for canine distemper and parvovirus, which can both prove fatal. A stock image of a dog being given a jab is shown . MailOnline has asked a handful of UK organisations if there is a similar trend in the UK. Christopher Brockett, president of the New York State Veterinary Medical Society, is one of the experts who have seen pet owners skipping vaccinations. The fewer animals that are being vaccinateed for canine distemper, (pictured), the greater the chance of a 'firestorm', one vet said . ‘The fewer animals that are getting the vaccine [for canine distemper], the greater the likelihood that you’re going to have a firestorm if something that is that highly communicable comes along,’ he said. Blog posts advocating skipping jabs, claim they can cause arthritis, cancers and epilepsy among other diseases, but these claims are largely unproven. Writing in an article for Pet MD, Dr TJ Dunn Jr said: 'Part of the drive for reconsideration of vaccine protocols has been coming from holistic veterinary practitioners, many of whom believe that repeated vaccinations diminish the animal's immune resources and can actually create disorders such as degenerative joint diseases, immune mediated disorders such as Lupus, and can actually depress the animal's ability to ward off diseases ""naturally"". 'A few holistic veterinarians believe that all vaccines are harmful.' Brennen McKenzie, a blogger and past president of the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association, told the magazine that the trend for ignoring vaccinations may be because views about human medicine have spilled over into the veterinary world. It is thought that more dogs are suffering from canine distemper, which causes potentially fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal problems, but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence. Computer artwork of canine parvovirus is pictured . Canine distemper is a viral disease that affects dogs and racoons, for example. In dogs, it attaches the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts as well as the spinal cord and brain. Symptoms include: high fever, eye inflammation, laboured breathing, vomiting and diarrhoea, loss of appetite and lethargy, and hardening of nose and footpads. It's caused by an RNA virus from the same family of the virus that causes measles in humans. It's highly contagious via inhalation and fatal half the time. Canine parvovirus is spread by direct or indirect contact with dog faeces. Symptoms appear within three and seven days, including: lethargy, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, which can lead to dogs getting dehydrated and anaemic. If the virus progresses, white blood cell levels fail, resulting in shock and even death. ‘Over the last 10 or 15 years there has been an increase in mostly unfounded concerns about vaccine safety for people - and that, I think, has raised people’s awareness and level of concern about vaccinations for their pets,’ he said. Unlike with children, no agency tracks how many pets get their recommended vaccinations, so no-one knows how bad the problem may be if a nasty disease was to sweep a city’s parks. It's thought that more dogs are suffering from canine distemper, which causes potentially fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal problems, but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence. Some vets advocating alternative medicine even advise avoiding vaccinations. Rosemary Manziano, a homeopathic veterinarian in New Jersey, reportedly recommends taking puppies more than 12 weeks old – whose immune systems are fully formed - to the park to play with other animals instead of getting them vaccinated against canine distemper. This advice seems to echo that of parents who take their unvaccinated children to ‘pox parties’ in the hope that by mixing with others who have chickenpox or measles, for example, their children may build up natural immunity. Other vets claim that it is impossible to introduce a puppy to an environment in order to pick up a disease without putting the dog, or other animals, at risk. A spokesman for the British Veterinary Association  and British Small Animal Veterinary Association told MailOnline:‘Vaccinations are an extraordinary tool in our armoury in the fight against diseases, both in animals and humans. 'Under the Animal Welfare Act owners have a duty to protect their animals from pain, injury, suffering and disease. We know of no better, and scientifically proven, way to protect against disease than vaccination. Sadly, we know from the MMR vaccine in children that scaremongering can lead to a loss of public confidence in vaccination and knee-jerk reactions that can lead to outbreaks of disease. 'Distemper and parvo virus are still killers – and the reason we no longer see these on a wider scale is because most owners sensibly choose to vaccinate.’","Some vets in the US have noticed a trend for people not vaccinating pets .

"The former home of the screenwriter who penned Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago has been almost entirely destroyed by a fire. Firefighters were called to the blaze at the cottage in Butleigh in Somerset after the thatched roof of the cottage, previously owned by screenwriter Robert Bolt, caught alight. Crews spent almost 20 hours battling the fire, which left 75 per cent of the thatched roof destroyed. Scroll down for video . Fire crews spent almost 20 hours battling a fire at the former home of Oscar winning screenwriter Robert Bolt . The late Robert Bolt, who won two Oscars for his works, lived at the cottage and is believed to have penned A Man for All Seasons while he was there. At the height of the blaze 12 crews were trying to control the flames as they licked the roof of the cottage and plumes of smoke could be seen from miles around. Firefighters said they managed to rescue a number of possessions from inside the cottage, limiting damage. The fire started at about 2.30pm on Wednesday and crews were still damping down at the scene at 7am today. Crews were called at 2.30pm on Wednesday to the fire and were still at the site of the blaze at 7am today . Large plumes of smoke could be seen coming from the Somerset cottage from many miles away . Fire crews tirelessly stripped thatch from the roof in a bid to stop the fire spreading any further . At the height of the fire 12 crews were battling to keep the large blaze under control and limit the damage . Police and firefighters sealed off the road in Somerset and the cause of the fire is being investigated . Crews from Street, Glastonbury, Somerton, Wells, Castle Cary, Cheddar and Bridgwater and Shepton Mallet attended the fire and spent yesterday afternoon stripping the thatch to prevent spread of the flames. Bolt, who wrote play A Man for All Seasons, twice married Sarah Miles and died in 1995 after a series of strokes. Firefighters left the scene at mid morning today and confirmed no one had been injured. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. The large thatched and stone cottage in Butleigh in Somerset was where Bolt penned A Man for All Seasons . Robert Bolt twice married Sarah Miles, who nursed him after he was paralysed following a stroke . Robert Bolt was an English playwright and double Oscar-winning screenwriter. He won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay for Doctor Zhivago and A Man for All Seasons. Between 1943 to 1946 he served in the RAF. Bolt only became a full-time writer at the age of 33, having previously spent many years worked as a teacher of English and History. His first play, The Critic and the Heart, was presented at Oxford Playhouse in 1957. But it was his second work, Flowering Cherry, that earned him critical acclaim. Robert Bolt (left) was well known for his screenplay of Lawrence of Arabia, starring Peter O'Toole (right) Bolt was best known for his original play A Man for All Seasons, produced in 1960, but most of his work was writing screenplays. He was well known for his screenplays Lawrence of Arabia  (1962) and Doctor Zhivago (1965). The writer's final script was Political Animal which was made into a film in 1991 and was about the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. He was awarded a CBE for his works in 1979. The writer spent two weeks in prison in 1961 after he joined controversial group Committee of 100, which strongly opposed the nuclear arms race. He was arrested for taking part in a mass sit down protests in Trafalgar Square and sentenced to a month in prison when he refused to be bound over. Bolt wrote play A Man for All Seasons (left) and is known for his screenwriting of Dr Zhivago (right) He was eventually persuaded to sign a treaty to keep the peace because at the time he was writing the screenplay for Lawrence of Arabia and the director was keen to start filming. Bolt was released after two weeks. Bolt had four children and was married four times. He twice married Sarah Miles, who he remained with until his death in 1995 at the age of 70. Miss Miles nursed Bolt after he had suffered several strokes and was left paralysed in 1979. His wife agreed to his eccentric funeral plans - which included meditating beside his body for two days, and burying him in a huge scarlet gown and pink scarf, in a cardboard coffin sunk beyond the croquet lawn in the grounds of their Sussex home.","Robert Bolt was the screenwriter for Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago .

"It's been more than 20 years since the original cast of Saved By The Bell walked the halls of Bayside High School. But on Wednesday evening Mario Lopez - who played A.C. Slater on the popular 90s sitcom - was joined by his former co-stars for a reunion on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The show's heartthrob was joined by fellow hunk Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), the beautiful Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) and Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski), as well as Dennis Haskins (Principal Belding). Scroll down for video . Hooray! On Wednesday evening the former cast of Saved By The Bell reunited for a hilarious skit on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . Brick phone: Gosselaar (right) is seen taking a phone call as he stands next to 'new student' Jimmy Fallon . Missing from the line-up was Dustin Diamond (Screech) and a Lark Voorhies (Lisa). Dustin is accused of stabbing a man during a bar fight on Christmas, while Lark has withdrawn from the limelight as she is reportedly battling bipolar disorder. During the evening Lopez took to Instagram to share behind-the-scenes snaps with his nearly 400,000 followers. Where was Screech? Dustin Diamond was recently charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon'; pictured in his mug shot (L) and in 1993 (R) Missing: Lark Voorhies who played Lisa (Screech's love interest) was absent from the reunion as she is reportedly battling mental illness, pictured in LA in May . In the photos, the 41-year-old Extra host barely looked a day older than his teenage self, wearing a pair of high-waisted bleached trousers and a bright blue short-sleeve shirt with black vintage print. Mario even showcased his former trademark hairstyle - curly locks with a mullet-like section in the back. In one of the pictures he is seen posing beside Gosselaar - who models spray-painted blonde hair. Flashdance? While in character for their skit, Mario busted out some impressive ballet moves . One on the way: Then, Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) appears and announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump. The actress is currently expecting her second child, a boy, with husband Brady Smith . She's preggers! Kelly arrives on the scene with some big news . Nothing has changed: Jessie confuses Slater with an emotional outburst . The Franklin & Bash actor, 40, also donned his respective character's wardrobe - khaki trousers, a blue print shirt and a salmon button-up shirt over top - for the realistic parody. In their hilarious skit the group of stars are  joined by a new Bayside High student - Jimmy Fallon. As Jimmy stands at his locker he begins talking with Gosselaar and soon the duo are joined by Mario dressed as Slater. Spinning for joy: Mario showed off his incredible physique in a leotard . Oh oh! The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins . He walks in with a too-cool-for-school gait and greets them with, 'What's up, preppies?'. Team spirit: The five friends bonded as they discussed future plans . Hurrah! The parody came to a close as they all leaped for joy . The three guys begin discussing the upcoming 'big Valentine's Day dance' and who they're each bringing as a date. A short time later they are joined by Mario's former flame from the show, Berkley. Mario rips off his attire, revealing a skintight black leotard, as he performs an impressive ballet dance. High school sweethearts: Tiffani posted a photo with her former on-screen love on her Instagram (L) which proved they hadn't aged a bit since 1991 (R) Spot the difference! Elizabeth (L) didn't look a day older than she did while filming the show in 1991 (R) Better with age: Mario was looking leaner and perhaps even younger 25 years later . Back in the day: In a photo from 1992 the cast is seen posing together. (From left to right) Elizabeth Berkley, Mario Lopez, Tiffani Thiessen, Dustin Diamond, Lark Voorhies and Mark-Paul Gosselaar . Shortly after, Gosselaar receives a phone call from his beloved girlfriend, Kelly, played by Tiffani. As they wait for Kelly to arrive Jimmy confesses that he is moving to New York City. He says, 'I love it here but I want to be on Saturday Night Live. Host my own talk show, who knows, maybe one day, date Nicole Kidman'. The comedian pokes fun at himself following a recent awkward revelation on his show, in which Kidman said she had been interested in dating the star many years ago but thought he wasn't interested in return. The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins. The principal: Haskins pictured during the reunion (L) and in 1989 (R) Reunited: Mario - who played A.C. Slater - and Mark-Paul Gosselaar - who played Zach Morris - were each dressed in their former character's favorite garb . Former TV flame: Mario also posed with co-star Elizabeth Berkley - also known as Jessie Spano - who he dated on the television programme . After he leaves Tiffani joins them in the hall way where she  announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump in her cheerleading uniform. The actress is currently expecting her second child, a boy, with husband Brady Smith. The couple already has a four-year-old daughter Harper. Diamond and his fiancee Amanda Schutz were arrested on December 25. He was charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon', according to People. Throwback: Mario Lopez shared the behind-the-scenes snaps to his nearly 400k Instagram followers . Back to school: Elizabeth cuddles up to Mark-Paul . Meanwhile, Diamond's onscreen love interest Voorhies (Lisa)  has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to her mother. Lark, now 38, has largely shied away from the spotlight following her tenure on Saved By The Bell, which wrapped in 1993, unlike her co-stars. Her mother told People Magazine in October: ‘There are things that have traumatised her. I care deeply about my daughter and I want her to resume her life.’ Also backstage: Mario then shared a picture with LA Lakers basketball star Kobe Bryant, who has been recovering from surgery on his shoulder . Special guests: Mario saved a snap of the Saved By The Bell signage from backstage of The Tonight Show . The 64-year-old shares a home with her daughter, who found fame aged 15, in Pasadena, California. But it seems Lark is not willing to face up to her condition. When asked by the magazine if she is suffering from any chronic condition including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, she responded: ‘Oh no. We’re alive in a major time of all-in-all prophecy.’ The Jehovah’s Witness also said her long lapses of silence during conversations were merely moments in which she is praying, and added: ‘I have a strong spiritual sense.’","Saved By The Bell ran from 1989 to 1993 .

"A subterranean cycle and walking network using London's abandoned Tube tunnels is being proposed. The London Underline would be lined  with kinetic paving, which uses friction from cycle tyres and shoes to generate electricity to power the project. Although the plan may look unlikely it won the Best Conceptual Project at the London Planning Awards last night, presented to designer Gensler by Mayor Boris Johnson. The route could run under central London from Holborn in the east to Green Park in the west with docking stations for the capital's 'Boris Bike' scheme dotted along the tunnels. Scroll down for video . Grand plan: Maverick designers are proposing an underground cycle and walking network using central London's disused tunnels . Connected: The proposal, which won a prestigious design award last night, would be linked to the capital's existing transport network like the cycle superhighways, and it would be lined with kinetic paving to generate electricity from friction . London Underline would also be connected to overground cycle lanes and bridges spanning the Thames. Ian Mulcahey, co-director of Gensler London, says 'Now that London has reached the highest level of population in its history we need to think creatively about how to maximize the potential of our infrastructure. 'The adaptation of surplus and underutilized tube and rail tunnels could provide a quick and simple addition to our infrastructure network.' Gensler designers also believe that there could be room for a network of shops and businesses and even space for an underground park. Tunnels would not be the only spaces used, with former telephone exchanges, stations even and reservoir chambers part of the plans. New use: The empty tunnels and other spaces could be used for businesses, events and even public art to generate money . Connectivity: The focus would be on a main tunnel running from Holborn in the east to Green Park in the West. The route would also be linked to existing and new bridges . Architect Trevor To said: 'Gensler's proposal brings back an ignored part of the city through the collective efforts of its citizens. By harnessing the kinetic energy of every one's footsteps, a whole new urban space is unlocked underneath the city. 'This self-sustaining approach to urban infrastructure is key to a carbon-neutral community, and London could lead the world once again in merging tradition with innovation to create a better future.' London Underground would also offer new sites for pop-up businesses, exhibitions, retail and event space to generate money.","The London Underline may look unlikely but it has won a prestigious design award given by Boris Johnson .

"Foreign patients will have to prove they are entitled to free NHS care in a clampdown on health tourism. In order to register with a GP, EU nationals will be required to show their European Health Insurance Card. The UK has, until now, been far less efficient than other countries in reclaiming the money owed for treating foreign citizens. As a result, the NHS is losing an estimated £400million a year simply because it is failing to identify EU patients and claw back the cost of their treatment from their governments. Scroll down for video . Requirement: Receptionists will for the first time ask all new patients from European countries to show their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), pictured, otherwise they will be barred from registering . Under proposals obtained by Pulse magazine, GP surgeries will begin the process of redressing the balance. The move could eventually be extended to cover patients from other parts of the world in a bid to save the NHS an estimated £2billion a year. Receptionists will for the first time ask all new patients from European countries to show their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), otherwise they will be barred from registering. This will allow the NHS to flag up patients whose home countries should be paying for their treatment, particularly if they go on to be seen in hospital. Under an EU agreement, citizens can be treated free of charge in other countries as long as their government repays the cost. But the UK claws back only £1 for every £15 we pay for Britons to be treated abroad. Last year the Government managed to collect £50million from EU countries but paid out £750million. A pilot scheme due to begin later this year is the first stage of an ambitious plan to recoup the cost of treating overseas patients. The Department of Health is asking for ten practices to sign up. Receptionists will ask all new patients from the EU – including British citizens – to present their EHIC card when registering with surgery. Many British patients have these cards but if they do not they should be able to use their passport or other form of identity as proof they are entitled to NHS care. Patients from other EU countries will be recorded on a computer system so that NHS officials can compile a bill for the costs of their GP appointment and any further treatment. Currently, certain NHS services – including GP appointments, A&E, maternity and any treatment deemed urgent or life-threatening – are free for everyone. But overseas patients – which include anyone who has lived here for less than 12 months – are meant to pay for all other hospital treatment, such as X-rays, consultations and operations. In reality, however, staff rarely recover these costs at present. GPs are being used to identify those from whom cash can be reclaimed because they are the gateway to the NHS for most patients. Some senior GPs criticised the move, suggesting it would turn them into debt collectors and may prevent seriously ill foreign patients from seeking help. Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chair of the British Medical Association and a retired GP in Lancashire, said: ‘The Health Secretary would be wise to concentrate on the major pressures on the NHS. ‘If this plan comes to fruition it will at best reduce the role of doctors to debt collectors. At worst it will deter them from registering migrants and asylum seekers as well as setting up a new system of charging that could be extended.’ Waste: The NHS is losing an estimated £400million a year simply because it is failing to identify EU patients and claw back the cost of their treatment from their governments. Above, file image . But Dr Dean Marshall, a member of the BMA’s GP committee who has been working on the plans with the Department of Health, said they were designed to get staff used to asking for cards routinely. He added: ‘We need to pilot it and see how much work it is. It will be extra administrative work potentially but it will hopefully clarify who is and who isn’t entitled to NHS care and clearly there is a huge amount of money being spent in the NHS on people who are not entitled to it. What we have been absolutely clear about is that this isn’t about the GPs becoming a police force.’ The Government is consulting on other plans which include making overseas patients pay 150 per cent of the cost of treatment, which would make it profitable for hospitals to chase the bills. Ministers are also consulting on proposals to introduce a £200 annual health levy for migrants who are here longer than six months. The Department of Health said: ‘We are absolutely committed to improving the way the NHS recovers costs from international visitors.’","EU nationals will need European Health Insurance Card to register with GP .

"Failing to pay your TV licence will remain a criminal offence after peers voted down Government plans to water down the draconian punishment. Peers voted by 178 to 175 to keep the non-payment of the licence fee a criminal offence, amid fears that thousands of families may refuse to pay if the system was overhauled. Tory peer Lord Grade, a former chairman of the BBC, warned that 'dark forces' were at work – and said he was 'deeply concerned' about the uncertain effect of decriminalisation on the BBC's budget. Tory peer Lord Grade, a former chairman of the BBC,  said he was 'deeply concerned' about the uncertain effect of decriminalisation on the BBC's budget . He warned: 'I would love to see the licence fee decriminalised, but there are risks in doing that. 'There are risks the enemies of the BBC will see it as an opportunity to then move the compulsory element of the licence fee and move the BBC to a subscription model which would completely undermine the whole concept of public service broadcasting. I think there are dark forces at work.' Lord Grade said that if the licence fee was to be decriminalised, it needed to happen as part of longer-term funding plans for the corporation. 'We need to reflect on that in the context of Charter review not in a hurried order from Government just months away from Charter review,' he said. 'I see no reason at all to interfere with the BBC's financial planning and I see every reason to support this amendment in order to take a measured look and so that we don't interfere with the delicate financial arrangements for the BBC.' Lady Benjamin said there was a 'potential impact on children's programming' as, if licence fee evasion increased to around 10%, it could result in a reduction in the BBC's revenue of £200 million. 'This could mean that children's original UK content could suffer,' she said. Lord Fowler told peers: 'We know nothing about the future of the BBC, we know nothing about the future of the licence fee and we know nothing about the impact it will have on the finances of the BBC. 'This is all basic information that Parliament is entitled to have before making a change of this type. 'What we do know is that some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this change are opposed to the licence fee to any event. 'This is just a mini sideshow as far as they are concerned. They are opposed to the BBC as a public broadcaster and they advocate a subscription system. 'We know that that is the case.' Culture Secretary Sajid Javid today said he would keep 'all options open' about the future of the TV licence . Lord Cashman said: 'I see it, quite frankly, as an attempt to constrain the BBC - it is a seat belt wrapped over the BBC. It will stop them being able to do any long-term planning. 'This great public service broadcaster will be inhibited from going into contracts of employment with their own staff, let alone staff that they need to bring if their long-term planning is to produce the programming that we demand.' Baroness Howe of Idlicote, an independent crossbench peer who put forward the amendment, said: 'Under the current settlement the BBC has been able to plan its programme-making years in advance and budget accordingly. 'Any changes to the licence fee enforcement regime coming into effect before April 1 2017 would have a significant impact on the content the BBC provides.' David Cameron has backed proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence . But Labour peer Baroness Corston, who wrote a landmark report on women in prisons, opposed the amendment and called for an early end to the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee. She pointed to the effect on women who were sent to prison and lost their children because they were unable to afford to pay the licence fee. 'I know that 50 people a year are imprisoned because they don't pay a television licence,' she said. 'They are not imprisoned if they don't pay council tax and local authorities seem to survive.' She added: 'We should not allow the continuing criminalisation of this penalty because of the malign effect it has on an admittedly small number of people. 'I do not think that the signal we are sending that the status quo is alright is acceptable.' Viscount Colville of Culross, a BBC producer and an independent crossbench peer, said that going ahead with decriminalisation would 'blow a huge hole' in the corporation's budget. Labour peer Lord Rooker, who chaired the committee that scrutinised the Bill before it was considered by Parliament, warned: 'The risk to the BBC of what might happen is so substantial because of the forces charged up against the BBC under other guises.' For the Opposition, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara said that when the licence fee settlement was announced in 2010 the then culture secretary Jeremy Hunt said there would be 'no new financial requirements or fresh obligations of any kind' placed on the BBC before 2017. He said: 'I call on the Government to honour that commitment, which it can do in part by accepting this amendment.' A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said David Cameron believed decriminalisation was an idea that 'warrants proper consideration, that's why we have put David Perry in place to conduct an independent review of that'. She added: 'That's due to report back this June and the PM's view is that we should have the flexibility to act on the recommendations in that review.' The amendment passed in the Lords 'does not give the flexibility to act sooner (than the licence fee settlement) and that is exactly the point I think during the parliamentary process we will continue to make and seek to preserve'.","Peers voted  to keep the non-payment of the licence fee a criminal offence .

"A mystery severed hand and fresh evidence from a nurse has raised suspicions of a political cover-up over Germany's deadliest post-war terrorist attack, it emerged today. Thirteen people were killed and more than 200 injured when a huge bomb ripped through the crowd at Munich's world-famous Oktoberfest in 1980. Police quickly concluded the explosives were planted by a lone-wolf extremist, the 21-year-old neo-Nazi Gundolf Koehler who died in the attack. But late last year, German prosecutors reopened the investigation after growing concerns that there may have been a cover-up among the political elite. Now new evidence has emerged surrounding a severed hand which was found at the scene of the bombing that night. Fresh evidence surrounding a mystery severed hand has raised suspicions of a political cover-up over the 1980 Oktoberfest bombing (above) which killed 13 people and injured more than 200 others . Police ruled the hand could only have belonged to Koehler, even though its fingerprints were never found in the geology student's car he drove the scene, only at his flat. A nurse has now spoken for the time about treating a young man whose lower arm was missing in the aftermath of the bombing, suggesting Koehler may have had an accomplice. The unnamed medic told Germany's ARD television channel last night that the arm had been injured in the explosion and had to be amputated, according to the Independent. She said: 'He wouldn't say how he got hurt - he was proud of it. I went into his room and he was smiling all over.' She added that he was only ever visited by 'groups of men' and left discharged himself having his stitches out. Police quickly concluded the explosives were planted by a lone-wolf extremist, the 21-year-old neo-Nazi Gundolf Koehler (left) who died in the attack. But there is mounting concern he was aided by accomplices . Ulrich Chaussy, the journalist behind the ARD documentary, claims to have evidence that police were forced to eliminate any suggestion of a group attack from the inquiry by then Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Josef Strauss, who was bidding to become German Chancellor at the time. Mr Chaussy claims to have proof that Mr Strauss feared politically damaging accusations that he had failed to tackle a major right-wing extremist group who had initially been implicated in the attack. As a result, Mr Strauss - who died in 1988 -  instructed investigators to pin the bombing on Koehler, Mr Chaussy alleges. Six members of the neo-Nazi paramilitary group called the Hoffmann Military Sports Group were briefly detained over the atrocity but never charged. Mr Chaussy told Bild newspaper: 'As the evidence mounts, the lone attacker theory is crumbling.' The evidence adds further weight to previous claims that unknown co-conspirators may have worked alongside Koehler which prompted prosecutors to reopen the investigation in December. Chief prosecutor Harald Range said the investigation would 'pursue all leads... anew and comprehensively' adding: 'There is no statute of limitations on murder. Detonated in a bin by one of the festival's exit points at the height of the Friday night rush, the improvised explosive was made from a hand grenade packed with nails. Three covered bodies after the bomb attack on the popular German beer festival. Fresh evidence from a new witness may suggest that Koehler had co-conspirators who helped him with the attack . Koehler, described by German media at the time as a loner and a gun nut, was known to be a supporter of the neo-Nazi paramilitary group called the Hoffmann Military Sports Group. The extreme right-wing militia named after its leader Karl Heinz-Hoffman, was banned by the German government. But while the original investigation said their had been indications that others had been involved, prosecutors could find no conclusive evidence to prove this before it was shut down in 1982. Nonetheless, many victims, local politicians and lawyers have questioned the 'lone attacker' theory. Among them was lawyer, Werner Dietrich who told The New York Times last year that the case was reopened because of a call he had received from the new witness in September. Declining to name her, he told the paper that just hours after the bombing she found fliers lauding Koehler as a 'hero of the right' in a home where she was teaching in Silesia, a region of central Europe located mostly in Poland. She had told police at the time but they had not followed up her claims, he said, adding that he had heard a similar story from three or four men who were among the injured. Those witnesses said they had seen Koehler arguing with other people before the bomb went off. The bombing was the worst terrorist act attributed to the right wing in Germany after 1945. However, throughout the 1970s and 1980s Germany saw several far-left terrorist attacks including the murder of prominent public figures and hijackings.","Thirteen killed and 200 injured in bomb attack at the Munich beer festival .

"A vigilante cyclist has been dubbed 'the most hated man on two wheels' after using hidden cameras to help convict scores of drivers for motoring offences. Bus driver Dave Sherry, 37, uses three video cameras on his helmet and bike to capture footage of driving he deems dangerous. He also has a loud trucker's horn fitted to his handlebars to ward off vehicles. During the 40-mile round-trip commute from his home in Harlow, Essex to a depot in east London, bus driver Mr Sherry lets motorists know his views on their driving. He has even given a police officer a ticking off. Scroll down for video . 'Vigilante cyclist' Dave Sherry uses three cameras mounted on his bike in his campaign against bad driving . He takes his evidence to police and councils and says the footage has been used to secure 70 convictions for driving offences including speeding, overtaking too close and running red lights. He says he has secured two convictions for assault on him by angry drivers and is having a taxi driver investigated over claims he went the wrong way round a roundabout. Mr Sherry says he is now so notorious that he often has to fend off attacks from irate drivers, including several who have thrown punches. The London bus driver said he is now 'Britain's most hated cyclist'. He said: 'I do what I do because I want to make our roads safer for everyone. If people follow the Highway Code there would be so many fewer accidents and casualties.' Mr Sherry started filming drivers cycling from Harlow to his east London bus depot two-and-a-half years ago after he was involved in an accident. He said: 'Someone hit the back of my bike and the police said they couldn't do anything because it's my word against them. 'That spurred me on, so I went and got my cameras.' A number of the videos show cyclist Mr Sherry being attacked by drivers angered by his actions . As well as helping police investigate driving offences - he says two drivers have been prosecuted for assaul . Father-of-five Mr Sherry dismisses the vigilante label he has received but has faced a backlash from motorists and has been assaulted twice on the roads. He said: 'It might be strange that I'm also a bus driver too but I'm just trying to make a difference. I sit on the fence. 'I'm a cyclist, I'm a driver, I'm just trying to ensure there's space on the road for all of us by bringing bad drivers to justice. 'I'm doing the nitty gritty stuff people don't want to do. I might have a bad reputation as Britain's most hated cyclist, but so be it - I'm proud of what I do. 'If they want to call me a vigilante then fine, you have to play the bad guy sometimes, but I don't commit offences I just record them.' He added: 'If I catch you, you are going to be very, very sorry. I'd rather act as a deterrent than see someone on the floor - it is like a war zone out there.' Mr Sherry, who has driven buses for 12 years, got a van driver cautioned after he was physically assaulted after capturing a display of dangerous driving. In the latest video Mr Sherry posted to his Youtube account, he caught a woman endangering his life by pulling out in front of him at a roundabout in Waltham Forest, north London. He said: 'I reported it at when I finished work and got an email at 10am the next morning saying they are going to prosecute her. 'She got a lovely little note from the police that morning. Everyone must remember: we have a right to ride a bike but it's a privilege to use a car - and you can lose it at any time.' Films he has shot using the cameras are posted on YouTube and show drivers remonstrating with him . Mr Sherry claims to have helped secure 70 convictions using the three cameras on his bike and helmet . The bus driver insists he posts the videos to highlight bad driving and to keep the roads safe for cyclists . Mr Sherry is unapologetic to those caught by his cameras and says: 'It's like a war zone out there' Mr Sherry straps £1,000 worth of cameras to his bike for his daily rides and even resorted to wearing body armour for protection against motorists. To stay safe he dresses head to toe in fluorescent clothing and took to wearing £80 body armour after he was assaulted in the line of his self-appointed duty. He was punched in the stomach by a furious van driver, who police confirmed received a caution for ABH, in June 2013. He said: 'He just saw red and went for the attack. He properly knocked me back with a punch and I smashed the back of my head on rocks behind me. 'I had to go for an MRI scan and I had a minor concussion but luckily no bleeding on the brain. 'I've been verbally assaulted plenty of times too. But I don't have time to mess about with them any longer.' Mr Sherry captures up to 30 driving offences in a busy week, carries nine spare batteries so he can change them for every journey and rides a £2,000 carbon fibre Mekk 2G bike. He also has a £200 Garmin computer on his bike to record the time and location of each traffic violation he captures. As well as a camera mounted on his helmet, he also had one of the front and one of the rear of his bike . Mr Sherry is not the only cyclist to attempt to shame drivers with videos shot from helmet and handlebar cams. Lewis Dediare - also known as 'Traffic Droid' - has a camera mounted on a three-foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle. The 39-year-old also carries a ruler to measure  his distance from cars and brandishes  a 'red card' at offending road users. Like Mr Cherry, he also uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter and will often hand it over to police so the drivers can be further punished. Lewis Dediare - aka 'Traffic Droid' - also posts footage from his helmet and handlebar cams online . Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers last year. He says his naming and shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every year, as well as several prosecutions. The telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane while out cycling. He broke two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to cyclists.","Bus driver cycles to east London depot from Harlow in Essex .

"Becks' fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle from 2007 was voted his biggest style shocker in a poll . He may be a champ on the field, a doting father to four children and dutiful husband, but David Beckham is less successful when it comes to fashion. From garish hairstyles to bizarre clothes choices, he's committed his fair share of 'embarrassing dad' style crimes. Ahead of his 40th birthday in May, a new poll has revealed Becks' worst fashion fails. His biggest style shocker was his fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle when he was playing for Real Madrid in 2007, which contrasted starkly with a slight burned tan. In second place is the matching his-and-hers Versace leather outfits worn with Victoria Beckham  in 1999. In third place was the famous cornrow hairstyle from 2003, which showed off inches of pink scalp. The dodgy sarong Becks showcased  at the 1998 World Cup while again out with his wife - complete with clunky leather slide-ons - came fourth. In fifth place was his now deeply unfashionable 'curtains' haircut he had during the years when he was first dating Victoria back in 1996. Plenty of  gel meant his locks were permanently shiny and finely separated. And in sixth place was the bushier beard he grew five years ago, which looked more 'I haven't slept in days' than stylishly manly. Thankfully, the football star prefers to crop his beard more closely these days. The father-of-four is often considered somewhat of a British style icon, but as well as often hitting the right note, he's certainly tried and failed many times. His seventh biggest howler was the spiky highlighted hair he had in 2002 shortly before leaving Manchester United. In eighth place was his Mohican haircut from 2001 and coming in at ninth place was the disastrous, misspelled Sanskrit tattoo in tribute to his wife Victoria from 2002. When translated, it spelled 'Vihctoria'. In second place is the matching Versace his-and-hers leather outfits worn with wife Victoria Beckham in 1999 (left) while the dodgy sarong (left) he wore at the 1998 World Cup out with his wife came fourth . Another hairstyle from Becks' Madrid years is his tenth fashion fail - this time, it was the ponytail he wore to control his growing locks in 2003. Becks' fashion disasters were chosen in a poll of 1,000 people by the menswear brand Theidleman.com. Beckham has freely admitted to some spectacular fashion fails in the past - not least those leather jackets. He has said: 'What were we thinking. I look back on some of the stuff and think, ""I can't believe I actually wore that."" 'I have no regrets, though - I knew at the time it was good! 'Maybe I've sometimes overstepped the mark with something that a footballer in the past wouldn't wear, and that's led to trends or people trying new things. 'Some people would probably look at me wearing the sarong - that's been mentioned so many times over the years. But I thought it was great.' David's famous cornrow hairstyle (left) from 2003 was voted third worst look and his deeply unfashionable gelled 'curtains' haircut (left) from 1996 came in at fifth place . In sixth place was the bushier beard he grew five years ago, which looked more 'I haven't slept in days' than stylish (left) and his seventh biggest howler was the spiky highlighted hair he rocked in 2002 (right) Beckham is a firm champion of self-expression, which sounds like a promise of further fashion howlers from our national hero. 'Everyone should be allowed to be who they are and dress how they want,' he said. Becks said he was adventurous with fashion choices even as a child. He explained: 'I was a pageboy and had a choice between wearing a boring old suit or a pair of knickerbockers with ballerina tights and slippers. I went with the tights.' Oliver Tezcan, founder of British young menswear e-tailer The Idleman.com, said Beckham remained a style icon for millions of men and he should be applauded for his boldness when it comes to fashion. Tezcan said: 'Beckham has done more to improve the dress sense of British men than probably any other man this century. 1 Going platinum blond in 2007 while playing for Real Madrid. 2 David and Victoria Beckham's matching leather jackets at the Versace launch in 1999. 3 His cornrow hairstyle from 2003. 4 The sarong he wore while out with wife Victoria at the 1998 World Cup. 5 The curtains haircut he had when he was first dating wife Victoria way back in 1997. 6 The bushier beard he wore in 2009. 7 The spiky highlighted hair he had around 2002. 8 His famous Mohican hairstyle from 2001. 9 The disastrous Sanskrit tattoo which misspelled wife Victoria's name. 10 The ponytail haircut he had while playing for Real in 2003. David's Mohican look (2001)was only voted eighth worst fail, while his misspelled 2002 tattoo came in ninth . Becks' tenth fashion fail is the double ponytail he wore to control his growing locks in 2003 . 'But it is notable that only one of his top ten fashion fails has come in the last five years - his rather unfortunate bushy beard. 'The fact is, Beckham is now a father-of-four who will be celebrating his 40th birthday in May. 'He looks as good as ever but there is no doubt that his sense of style is becoming far more conservative. 'He changes his hairstyle a lot less frequently and has a well-cropped beard more or less constantly. 'You can't imagine him ever having a Mohican again or going platinum blond. 'I'd love to see the sarong-wearing Beckham re-emerge in his 40s to shake things up again. 'I guess you have to ask whether the big brands he represents these days want one of their ambassadors sporting a Mohican.' As he approaches the big 4-0, Beckham's sure to have lots more style blunders up his sleeve.","Footballer's peroxide blond haircut from 2007 is voted his worst look .

"A man wanted in the killings of an elderly Ohio couple and in armed robberies in three states was arrested early on Thursday in Arizona after a high-speed chase and nationwide manhunt that lead to three police cars catching on fire. An FBI spokeswoman in Cleveland said 29-year-old Robert Clark was arrested by the Mohave County sheriff's office in Kingman. One of his companions, 26-year-old Tabatha Hazel, a suspect in the armed robberies, was arrested with him. A third companion, 28-year-old Jeffrey Caley Jr., fled and is still being sought by authorities. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Robert Clark,  wanted in the killings of an elderly Ohio couple and in armed robberies in three states, was arrested early on Thursday in Arizona after a high-speed chase and nationwide manhunt . Dead: Robert Clark is wanted for the murder of Doyle, 88, and Lillian Chumney, 79, who were found dead in their burnt vehicle on a remote dirt road 30 miles away from their burglarized home last month . Escape van: The chase began when police spotted the suspects’ green 2003 Dodge Caravan and tried to conduct a traffic stop which led to a chase when Robert Clark did not stop . Fox 8 reports that the chase began when police spotted the suspects’ green 2003 Dodge Caravan and tried to conduct a traffic stop. The suspects did not stop but instead tried to evade police. The suspects' van eventually turned onto a dirt road where it became disabled, and the suspects fled on foot. During the chase, three police cruisers pulled up on brush and desert debris and caught on fire. As smoke and flames filled the air the deputies were able to arrest Clark and Hazel, but during the fire, Caley was able to escape. Clark has been charged with one count of murder in the deaths of 88-year-old Doyle Chumney and his 79-year-old wife, Lillian. On the run: One of Robert Clark's alleged companion Jeffrey P.

Robbed at gunpoint: Surveillance video from shows Robert Clark holding a sawed-off shotgun and Jeffrey Caley holding a pistol at the gas station . Their remains were found inside their torched car on a country road January 22, the day after they were reported missing from their home. The Chumneys had four children. Their daughter Diane Enama, who found her parents' home ransacked January 21, declined to comment on Thursday. The FBI had offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Clark's capture. It wasn't immediately clear Thursday whether anyone could claim the money. A second suspect in the slayings, 21-year-old Jeffery Stewart, was arrested Saturday. He is charged with one count of murder and is being held on $2 million bond. Authorities have said Stewart implicated himself and Clark in the killings. Clark, Caley and Hazel are suspected of being involved in the armed robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in West Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia on Saturday and Sunday. No one was hurt in the robberies. The trio was last seen during a robbery in Donalsonville, Georgia, on Sunday night, said Tom Couts, a Coshocton County sheriff's detective. Surveillance video shows Clark holding a sawed-off shotgun and Caley holding a pistol as a clerk walks in front of them. Hazel went inside the store before Clark and Caley entered, Couts said. Caley and Hazel were not involved in the Chumney slayings, Couts said. It appears that Clark and Stewart knew each other through a landscaping service where they had worked, Couts said. Clark was released from prison in May after serving a 4 1/2 -year sentence for robbery and other charges. Couts said authorities believe the Chumneys were driven to a country road in Coshocton County where they were shot before their car was set on fire. Authorities received a break in the investigation after surveillance video was released to the public that shows Clark's van at a gas station where Stewart bought a gas can and filled it, Couts said. Stewart called police after seeing the video. He was arrested on a traffic warrant and provided statements implicating himself and Clark, Couts said. Accussed of murder: Jeffery Stewart.

Meanwhile, Melanie Chisholm roared with laughter at one of Charles's jokes. The singer, who wore a knee-length dress with white, silver and pleated panels, stood out as one of the only attendees not wearing all-black. Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood made a statement in a shiny blue dinner jacket, his black hair brushed into their signature spikes. While his wife Sally Humphreys glowed in a berry-coloured high-necked dress. Comedian and actor Rob Brydon - and onscreen sparring partner of Steve Coogan - regaled His Royal Highness with a story on the red carpet, while the royal listened politely.

The dinner was hosted by Gandhi actor Sir Ben Kingsley and Samantha Bond and the lucky guests were treated to performances by pianist Jools Holland, Ronnie Wood, Melanie C and Dynamo. Magician Dynamo, whose real name is Steven Frame, credits the Prince's Trust with his success today. Bullied at school and suffering from debilitating Crohn's disease, he launched his career with a cash grant from the Prince's charity and now he's an ambassador for the charity. It's not the first time Dynamo has performed for the royal, in 2013 an illusion that made it look as though he was breaking his own fingers, prompted Charles to clutch his face with his hands. Charles looked highly impressed at Dynamo's skills, though the magician seemed to be feeling the pressure . Dynamo, who launched his career with a Prince's Trust grant, may have used Charles as a warm-up to his act .

"Triple J has defended its decision to publish an opinion poll on how many Australians support the death penalty following claims the station should be held accountable if the pair are executed. The poll, titled 'Australians think Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran should be executed', found 52 per cent of Australians, in principle, support death sentences for overseas drug traffickers. After news the two men lost their last chance of escaping after a second judicial review was rejected on Wednesday, supporters of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan said the decision was skewed by the poll. In a statement read out by Hack presenter Tom Tilley on Thursday, the station stood by its decision and said media outlets must uphold freedom of speech. 'It would be a dangerous precedent for journalists not to report these things because they are fearful of how politicians may react,' he said. A judicial review application submitted by Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan (right) and Myruan Sukumaran (left) has been rejected by Indonesia's courts . Radio show Triple J commissioned the research by Roy Morgan Research and also posed the question on their Facebook page . The radio show published the results of their poll on 26 January saying '60 per cent of young Australians don't think the government should do more to stop the execution' Tilley said while he and his colleagues held the deepest sympathies for the two men and their families, media publications regularly use polling in news reporting stories. Supporters of the two men have been heart-stricken by news they will be the next to face execution. Their Australian lawyer Julian McMahon said: 'The boys have really turned their lives into very constructive lives for other prisoners so the families are very proud of them.' 'There's a lot of closeness there but from my observation what'll be happening now is that the two clients will be looking after their families, who will be shattered.' Greg Craven, the vice-chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, said the poll should not have been cancelled. 'If these two men really are executed then the radio station that commissioned the poll, the people who delivered that poll, and the people who answered that poll in the affirmative will know that they have had a part, no matter how small, in the death of two other people,' he said. He hopes to disprove the poll, and has urged all Australians to keep pleading with the Indonesian authorities to show mercy towards the two men. The question that was actually asked in the poll was much broader and was only referring to death sentences in principle and not the two men's specific case. 'In your opinion if an Australian is convicted of drug trafficking in another country & sentenced to death, should the penalty be carried out?,' the question said. Mr McMahon told SMH the result 'is now a tool being used to get my clients killed'. 'The AG and the ambassador have publicly relied on the SMS poll as a factor justifying execution. They say that it pushes them to do it, that they have Australian public support,' Mr McMahon reasoned. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Triple J Hack show for comment. Gary Morgan, executive chairman of Roy Morgan Research, defended way the poll was carried out to the SMH. When the poll results were originally published Morgan said in a statement: 'A slight majority of Australians (52%) say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed. A text message poll found 52 per cent of Australians say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed . Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail . Indonesia has used results from radio host Tom Tilley's (pictured) Triple J listeners to justify sending Aussies to the firing squad, according to the Bali Nine ringleaders' lawyer . 'However, there is a clear gender split with men (60%) in favour of the death penalty being carried out while only 46% of women believe that convicted drug traffickers overseas should be executed.' Indonesia's courts rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Chan and Sukumaran again on Wednesday despite a strong campaign for mercy being pushed from the 'highest level' of Australian government. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott promised they 'continued to raise the cases' with the Indonesian government. 'My personal view is that an execution of drug traffickers will not stop the problem of drugs in and out of Indonesia, that there's a much broader approach that needs to be taken, however, the Indonesian government seems to be intent on pursuing the death penalty for drug traffickers,' Ms Bishop said. It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions . Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail. Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected. The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted. 'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali. Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop said she and Tony Abbott have 'continued to raise the cases' of Chan and Sukurmaran with the Indonesian government.

Hasoloan Sianturi, spokesman for Denpasar District Court, with the judicial review application for condemned Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . It comes after a slight glimmer of hope from the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, who was yet to make a decision on the matter on Tuesday. 'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono previously said according to News Corp. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Mr McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006. 'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp. It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan. From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.","Triple J stands by its decision to publish an opinion poll on the death penalty .

"Photographs of a father who handcuffed his daughter to his wrist because he was terrified she might be kidnapped have illustrated the shocking growth of child abductions in China. The images were taken at Beijing South railway station and showed father Chen Yen and his daughter waiting for a train with a whole host of security devices intended to keep her safe. An estimated 70,000 children are kidnapped in China every year as the country's tough one child policy has led to very few children being put up for adoption, in turn fueling a chilling black market in kidnapped children for couples unable to have their own. Taking no chances: The images were taken at Beijing South Railway Station and showed father Chen Yen and his daughter waiting for a train with a whole host of security devices intended to keep her safe . Keeping her safe: Chen Yen said that he and his daughter were travelling to celebrate the country's Spring Festival with her grandparents when a photographer took images of the pair handcuffed together . Mr Chen said that he and his daughter were travelling to celebrate the country's Spring Festival with her grandparents when a photographer took images of the pair handcuffed together. Before the trip Mr Chen heard about the daughter of one of his neighbours being snatched outside her school and vowed to do everything he could to avoid the same thing happening to her. One the day of the journey he had also seen a television broadcast warning travellers that pickpockets and thieves would be out in force during the festival, and to remain vigilant. Speaking of his decision, Mr Chen said: 'I have a neighbour in Beijing who went to collect his child from school and she had been snatched. 'I don't intend to wait until it's too late and I'm taking no chances with my daughter,' he added. 'I saw a warning by police on the TV to take care as traffickers and pick pockets would be out stealing in the holiday rush,' Mr Chen said. 'I don't care about pickpockets but I do care very much about losing my daughter,' he went on. Safety: Mr Chen said the handcuffs are not the only security measure he and his daughter use when travelling in public. 'She also has a [yellow] watch that lets me find her at any time, and her [silver] necklace has my telephone number on it,' he said . Still together: Before the trip Mr Chen heard about the daughter of one of his neighbours being snatched outside her school and vowed to do everything he could to avoid the same thing happening to her . Despite a recent crackdown on the illegal black market in kidnapped children, an estimated 70,000 children still go missing every year. The majority of them thought to have been taken by criminal gangs who then sell them to couples unable to have children for various reasons. China's one child policy is fueling the trade as it has led to far fewer children available for adoption. Mr Chen said the handcuffs are not the only security measure he and his daughter use when travelling in public, although he admits he does not feel totally safe unless she is tied to him. 'She also has a watch that lets me find her at any time, and her necklace has my telephone number on it,' he said. 'It is the very least a parent should do, I can't believe that people let their children play on the streets and then complain when they are abducted,' he added.","Father chained himself to daughter to avoid her being kidnapped by gangs .

"Scientists could be closer to finding water on the moon - a discovery that could help create rocket fuel and breathable air for future colonies. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool, Nasa scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon craggy deposits. And they've found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area; the slopes of craters in the moon's southern hemisphere facing the South Pole. Nasa scientists have found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area; the slopes of craters in the moon's southern hemisphere facing the South Pole. Pictured is a Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter mage of the moon's Hayn Crater, located just northeast of Mare Humboldtianum . These slopes could be mankind's best hope finding drinkable water on the lunar surface, they claim. Hydrogen could be found as either hydroxol - which is a single atom bound with a single oxygen atom — or it may be two hydrogen atoms bound with oxygen. Scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking or its components – hydrogen and oxygen – may be used to manufacture rocket fuel or even breathable air. 'There's an average of about 23 parts-per-million-by-weight (ppmw) more hydrogen on Pole-Facing Slopes (PFS) than on Equator-Facing Slopes (EFS),' said Nasa scientist, Timothy McClanahan. This is the first time a widespread difference in the spread of hydrogen on the moon has been detected. Using data from the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter's Lend tool (artist's impression pictured), Nasa scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon's surface . The cause of the discrepancy between PFS and EFS may be similar to how the sun move or redistributes frozen water from warmer to colder places on the surface of the Earth. There are different possible sources for the hydrogen on the moon. Comets and some asteroids contain large amounts of water, and impacts by these objects may bring hydrogen to the moon. Hydrogen-bearing molecules could also be created on the lunar surface by interaction with the solar wind. The solar wind is a thin stream of gas that's constantly blown off the sun. Most of it is hydrogen, and this hydrogen may interact with oxygen in silicate rock and dust on the moon to form hydroxyl and possibly water molecules. After these molecules arrive at the moon, it is thought they get energized by sunlight and then bounce across the lunar surface; and they get stuck, at least temporarily, in colder and more shadowy areas. 'Here in the northern hemisphere, if you go outside on a sunny day after a snowfall, you'll notice that there's more snow on north-facing slopes because they lose water at slower rates than the more sunlit south-facing slopes' said McClanahan. 'We think a similar phenomenon is happening with the volatiles on the moon – PFS don't get as much sunlight as EFS, so this easily vapourised material stays longer and possibly accumulates to a greater extent on PFS.' Slopes closer to the South Pole show a larger hydrogen concentration difference. Broader slopes provide stronger hydrogen signals than smaller slopes. Since the 1960s scientists thought that only in permanently shadowed areas in craters near the lunar poles was it cold enough to accumulate this volatile material, but these results suggest that hydrogen on the moon is more widespread. At the moment, however, it's uncertain if the hydrogen is abundant enough to economically mine. 'The amounts we are detecting are still drier than the driest desert on Earth,' said McClanahan. The team now wants to see if the hydrogen abundance changes with the transition from day to night. If so, it would back up existing evidence of a very active production and cycling of hydrogen on the lunar surface, according to McClanahan. Since the 1960s scientists thought that only shadowed areas in craters near the lunar poles was it cold enough to accumulate this volatile material, but these results suggest that hydrogen on the moon is more widespread .","Hydrogen was found in larger quantities on slopes of the lunar south pole .

"Scientists have managed to peer into the brains of mice so clearly that they watch as memories are formed. They saw how certain proteins changed and clustered on nerve cells, as memories were forged after tickling the creatures’ whiskers. The technique could shed light on how we learn as well as what goes wrong in disorders like autism, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. Scroll down for video . Scientists have managed to peer into the brains of mice so clearly that they can see how memories form. This is a single nerve cell in the cortex of a live mouse. Individual branches are shown in different colours and the bumps on the branches are where synapses form . ‘As far as we know, no one has ever been able to look at receptor proteins in live animals before,’ said Professor Richard Huganir, director of the Department of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ‘This allows us to get a more accurate picture of what’s really happening as the brain processes experiences into memories.’ Researchers at the university in Baltimore, Maryland, studied AMPA receptors, which are proteins on the outside of nerve cells that receive signals in the form of the molecule glutamate. Glutamate is the major mediator of  electrical signals in the central nervous systems of mammals and is involved in most aspects of normal brain function including cognition, memory and learning. The receptors themselves play a role in strengthening synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells that form memories. Up until now, scientists were limited to studying AMPA receptors in nerve cells in tissue samples, or grown in the laboratory, but neither of those methods could preserve the complex circuitry, hormones and neurochemicals of a living brain. Researchers studied AMPA receptors - proteins on the outside of nerve cells that receive signals and play a role in strengthening synapses, which firm memories.This image shows the formation of synapses on a nerve shaft in a mouse's brain after different periods of time, after its whiskers were stimulated . To solve that problem, Professor Huganir’s team, led by Dr Yong Zhang, engineered mice whose AMPA receptors glowed under the light of a special microscope. The type of microscope they used is capable of focusing at a depth of half a millimetre, meaning it can peer into the brain’s outer layer - the cortex. Thousands of nerve cells carry information to the cortex from every part of the body and each of a mouse’s whiskers has a group of dedicated nerve cells called barrel fields. The team took images of animals’ brains immediately before and after researchers tickled a single whisker on each mouse for an hour, according to the study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. They were surprised to find that tickling increased the number of AMPA receptors on nerve cells and strengthened the synapses of the barrel fields of the tickled whiskers, forming memories. Thousands of nerve cells carry information to the cortex from every part of the body and each of a mouse’s whiskers has a group of dedicated nerve cells called barrel fields. The reserachers took images of animals’ brains immediately before and after researchers tickled a single whisker on each mouse, for an hour . After monitoring the mice over a few days, they discovered that the AMPA receptor levels remained high, suggesting that the whisker-tickling experience had a long-term effect on the mice’s memories. Dr Zhang explained: ‘The mysteries are the purpose that is served by strengthening these synapses, and whether more AMPA receptors are being made or if they are moving in from somewhere else. ‘Future studies will address those questions.’ Professor Huganir explained: ‘This technique opens up many more possibilities, like visualising learning at the molecular level as it is happening in the intact brain in healthy mice and in mouse models of brain disorders.’ The researchers plan on using the new technique to see what happens as mice learn a complex task. They hope to peer deeper into the brain to areas like the hippocampus, which has a crucial role in memory formation and has been implicated in neurological disorders like autism, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, once optics technology improves.

"A stunned shopper has ridiculed troubled supermarket Tesco after being told she needed ID to buy fruit because it could ferment and turn into alcohol. Kate Lancaster, 37, from Plymouth, was trying to buy a packet of melon and grapes at the self-service checkout of a Tesco Metro  when a warning appeared saying the product was age restricted. She left the store when no staff member came to help, and when she contacted Tesco to complain she was told the fruit was age restricted because it can be turned into alcohol. Kate Lancaster, 37, from Plymouth, was asked for ID while buying a pack of melon and grapes from a self-service till in a Tesco store, and was later told this was because it could ferment and turn into alcohol . In an email she was also told that all Tesco fruit could soon become age restricted in case natural fermentation occurred. Ms Lancaster said she couldn't believe the response, adding that it was 'crazy' and went against health advice to get children to eat more fruit. Ms Lancaster, who works in Plymouth University library, said: 'It just seemed like a bizarre reason. When I got the response from Tesco I told my friend at work and we fell about laughing. 'It’s just ridiculous, you couldn’t make it up. They would be doing the exact opposite to what is recommended, they promote healthy eating in kids.' Government health advice suggests eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day, but some experts want this upped to seven after a study by University College London. Their research showed that eating more fruit and vegetables cuts the risk of premature death by 42 per cent, cutting risk of cancer by a quarter and heart-related deaths by a third. The study also showed that canned or frozen fruit and veg is not as healthy as frozen, and raised questions about the benefits of juice, which currently counts towards the five-a-day total. Ms Lancaster said she 'fell about laughing' after reading the letter, which added that all fruit could soon be age restricted. Tesco have since clarified that this is not company policy (file image) In order to ferment fruit into alcohol it usually has to be chopped or mashed into a pulp, then mixed with water and yeast and allowed to stand for just over a week. This will produce a weak alcoholic mixture, and will either need to be fermented further to produce wine, or distilled in order to produce a hard spirit. A Tesco spokesman said: 'Our customer service colleague’s comment about natural fermentation was meant as a joke – we’re sorry if it was taken literally. 'Of course we have no plans to age restrict fruit sales. Our team have apologised for any confusion and are sending Mrs Lancaster a fruit basket as a gesture of goodwill.' The spokesman added that it was not immediately clear why an alarm on the till had gone off, but said the store does not think it was related to ID.","Kate Lancaster, 37, was buying fruit from self-service till in Tesco Metro .

"Fourteen former MPs given huge payoffs when they were kicked out by voters at the last General Election have been selected to stand again in May. The 12 Labour and two Liberal Democrat MPs were each given 'golden goodbyes' worth up to £55,000 when they lost their seats in 2010. Between them they were handed a total of £650,898. Miss Keeble was criticised during the expenses scandal for claiming £4,112 for windows under the second home allowance, £3,072 for a new boiler and £950 for 'essential maintenance' on her bathroom. Andrew Dismore received a payout of £54,403 after leaving the Commons . But just five years after they were handed the 'resettlement grants', the former MPs are trying to get their old jobs back. All have been reselected by their parties in the same seats they contested five years ago. Many of the so-called 'retreads' were kicked out after finding themselves embroiled in the expenses scandal. In addition, Alex Salmond, who stood down as an MP in 2010 and received a £65,000 payout, is standing again for Westminster after resigning last year as Scottish first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party. After tax, Mr Salmond received about £50,000 and donated half to a charity named after his late mother. Andy Silvester, of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'These payments were totally excessive. It makes sense to provide winding-up expenses, but nobody should expect politics to be a job for life. It will be for voters to decide whether they want to reselect MPs embroiled in the expenses scandal.' Among those who received a payout is Sally Keeble, who was the MP for Northampton North for 13 years from 1997 until 2010. She was entitled to a resettlement grant of £54,403. Miss Keeble was criticised during the expenses scandal for claiming £4,112 for windows under the second home allowance, £3,072 for a new boiler and £950 for 'essential maintenance' on her bathroom. Ex-Labour MPs Patrick Hall, Nick Palmer and David Drew are all trying to make a Commons comeback . Lib Dem Julia Goldsworthy, and Labour's Joan Ryan and Dawn Butler want to win back their seats in Parliament . John Grogan, Mike O'Brien and Rob Marris want to return to the Commons five years after they left . Lib Dem Richard Younger-Ross lost his seat in 2010, when Labour's Bob Blizzard and Paul Clarke also left . Joan Ryan, Labour MP for Enfield North from 1997 until 2010, received a payoff of £50,517. During the expenses scandal she was ordered to repay some £5,000 in mortgage interest which she had 'overclaimed'. She had also claimed more than £4,500 for work on her home, including fence repairs, cleaning the back garden and redecorating her living room. Last night the expenses watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said it is powerless to recover any payments if MPs are re-elected. After the last election a total of £10.4million was paid in resettlement grants to 220 MPs, but the system was deemed so lavish that payments have been slashed for any who are kicked out in May. An analysis of the Tory party's list of prospective parliamentary candidates suggests that none of them was previously an MP. A Labour spokesman said last night: 'Under rules drawn up independently by House of Commons authorities, MPs of all parties are entitled to these grants when they lose their seats. 'It is not unusual for former MPs to seek re-election – indeed, there are 14 current Conservative MPs who previously lost their seats.'","Fourteen MPs each given 'golden goodbyes' when they lost 2010 seats .

"A pregnant mother who had an unexpected delivery on her bathroom floor ended up giving birth to a daughter who tipped the scales at 4.01 kilograms. It was a day full of surprises for Peta Muller and her husband Craig who welcomed their second child April Joy Muller after keeping her gender a secret during pregnancy until she arrived. The 35-year-old went into labour on Thursday morning and gave birth to her healthy daughter just 13 minutes after her water broke inside their Wollongong home, 82 kilometres south of Sydney. Peta Muller and her husband Craig welcomed their second baby daughter April Joy Muller on Thursday . ‘As soon as my water broke, I knew I had the urge to push,’ Mrs Muller told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I told my husband I couldn’t make it to the car so he quickly called triple-0. My sister Chloe was with us and by the time she could help, the baby’s head was already out. ‘It was overwhelming – everything happened so quickly. Craig was getting our daughter Mia ready for day-care while making coffee for my sister when my water broke in the bathroom. ‘I didn’t feel scared or frightened but I remember looking around the room to find Craig. But it happened in the comfort of our home and I never once felt uneasy or could ask for anything more.’ With their bags packed and a checklist ready to go, the couple had plans to deliver their second daughter in hospital but things took a different turn - and fast. ‘A few weeks ago, I told our midwife that I had this strange feeling that I might not make it to the hospital but I’m glad I had that conversation with her,' she said. Baby April tipped the scales at 4.01 kilograms - she was delivered inside her family home unexpectedly . Pictured: Peta Muller with her husband Craig and their daughter Mia and baby April on Thursday . ‘She gave me advice and warned that it was much safer to deliver the baby at home than the side of the road – so we were quite aware of what to do this morning. ‘Craig cut the umbilical cord after the ambulance arrived less than 15 minutes later. They were really good and they took me to the hospital at around 7am so I could deliver the placenta.' Welcoming their second daughter into the world, the mother of two said April’s weight also came as a surprise to the family. 'We didn't anticipate a four kilo baby so I had no idea how heavy she was until Craig placed her into my arms,' Mrs Muller told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We hadn't decided on a name either because we didn’t know what sex she was until she arrived but as soon as Craig said ""April"" - we knew that was her name. ‘It was on our list of names that we had shared a few days earlier. April's middle name Joy is named after my mother-in-law and our midwife’s middle name happened to be Joy as well.' Despite it was her first home birth, Mrs Muller said it was a worthwhile experience to consider for other mums . Despite it being her first home birth, Mrs Muller said it was a worthwhile experience to consider for other mothers. ‘It was a really nice delivery and we were lucky to enough to arrive at the hospital around 7am and check out by midday,’ she said. ‘It was a completely different birthing experience compared to my first daughter who didn’t arrive until four and a half hours later. 'There's the comfort and safety of giving birth at the hospital but it's definitely an option to look into. Although it was messy and unexpected - it was definitely a pleasant experience.'","Peta Muller gave birth to a healthy daughter on Thursday morning .

"People who use emojis in text messages have more sex than those who don't, according to Match.com's annual dating survey. The Singles in America study polled more than 5,600 single people of all ages, ethnicities, incomes and walks of life; and found that emoji users were more likely to report having sex at least monthly than non-emoji users. The 'wink' is the most widely used emoji overall, but when you separate men and women, men are more likely to pepper their texts with 'kiss' and 'heart eyes' emojis, while women prefer 'smileys'. Score! Match.com's Singles in America study polled more than 5,600 single people of all ages, ethnicities, incomes and walks of life, and found that emoji users were more likely to report having sex at least monthly . According to biological anthropologist Dr Helen Fisher, who helped lead the study, emojis are popular simply because they help us communicate more effectively in a medium (texting) in which sentiments can otherwise fall flat. 'Technology is dramatically changing how we court, but it can’t change the brain systems for romance', she writes for Match.com. Indeed, around 50per cent of men and women agree that emojis 'show personality' and around 35per cent of both sexes say they make 'expressing feelings' easier. Just don't spell your feelings wrong. The study also found that 54per cent of single women and 36per cent of men find misspellings and incorrect grammar to be the biggest text message turn-offs.

The correlation between sex and emoji use held true for men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and the more regularly people use emojis, the more active they reported their sex lives to be. And it's not all about flings and casual sex. Emoji users are also twice as likely to want marriage one day. Or perhaps they're just better at expressing their desires.

"So, how did Dry January work out for you? Did you storm through to February smug and sober? Or were there some booze-soaked, Saturday-shaped slip-ups along the way (guilty)?

I could not get a picture of what it was they would offer to support me to help myself. 'A behaviour change approach gave me the power to make the change I wanted. Now I want to use that knowledge to build a movement, developing tools that people can tailor to their needs, and growing a social network that can support their journey. 'Behaviour change when it comes to drinking is not easy. But starting by joining in the community effort of a dry January gave you a head start. 'So whether you managed the whole month or not take heart. You changed something. You tested it out. You felt a little of what it can be like to not drink on a night out or wake up without a hangover. You can do it again.' HOW TO CHANGE YOUR DRINKING AND STILL HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE by CLUB SODA . 1. Check in weekly and set your battle plan . Once you've set your goal, it helps to track your progress regularly. This is good for keeping an eye on how you're doing, and whether you're moving towards reaching your goals. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the past, and prepare for the future: What has been easy and what has been difficult? What could you do differently? Is there anything else you need to change in your life? It may help you work out your trigger times and know what you will do instead. Club Soda member Lucy said: 'I completely changed up my routine as there were times when the cravings would crescendo so for me it was between 6-8pm. I would go for a run, go food shopping, get online and read sober blogs, get in the bath, go to the cinema. 'Sober treats are a great way of rewarding yourself too so that you don't feel deprived - a nice coffee or chocolate bar or cake (in my case).' 2. Be a social animal . Good news, you don't have to sit in a darkened room on your own. A whiff of a fine merlot will not turn you into a gremlin. In fact staying the wonderful fun-loving human being you are is important to success. You may just need to try some new things and be more ambitious about the things you do with your time. Find interesting events where drinking is not the star of the show. After all, you can now drive to and from an event a bit out of town if you have wheels. The website also recommends rewarding yourself in ways other than a stiff drink . The Club Soda blog has lists for lots of places in the UK and MeetUp and Eventbrite are two useful resources for finding new things to do. Yoga, dancing, walking and even gardening feature high on the new passions of energised Club Soda members. Have a local? Ask them to get in what you want to drink (what's the worst that they can say?). Mix up pub visits by starting a booze-free pub social. Having one non-drinking night a month in the pub will help you stay strong the rest of the time. And try to chat to others with similar goals online, where you will find useful tricks and helpful tips, and your common goals will encourage you all. 3. Put nice things in your mouth . Giving up alcohol may cause big changes in your body that you didn't expect. So you may want to think about your diet as well. Some of your cravings will be psychological (you are used to holding a glass in your hand and sipping something) and some will be physiological (you are quaffing far less calories and less sugar). So plan nice things to eat, such as the best quality chocolate. Stock up your fridge and cupboard. Discover new drinks. While some swear by juice and soda in the pub, your thing may be a heady of mix of ginger beer, lime and fizzy water. If you are used to having a pint glass in your hand, then ask for your drink by the pint. Founder Laura likes to take her own posh teas with her into a pub, and ask for hot water in a pint glass. Make it a voyage of discovery. The good news is that the alternatives are getting better and better all the time. Non-alcoholic beers are a million times tastier than they used to be (top tip: you can trust German quality here as well!). 4. Take care of yourself . Cut yourself some slack if you aren't always perfect, or if you don't reach your goals straight away. We know from our experience that it can take several attempts, and trying many different approaches, to fully change your drinking. But we also know that every step, no matter how small, will help you to get there. And we want to shout from the rooftops that you should never feel guilty, but instead be nice to yourself. If you are gutted that you did not do so well this week, then take a nice bath, watch your favourite movie, go for a massage. Even doing a little bit of mindfulness can be a reward, as well as a great aid in supporting you achieve your goals. Guilt won't help you succeed, but taking care of yourself will. … and ask for help when you need it . Some people are lucky, they are able to change their drinking on their own. Good for them! But if you need a helping hand then seek out some experts: life coaches, nutritionists, many kinds of therapists even yoga instructors have specialist skills that could make all the difference.","Dry January is over but many want to cut back on booze permanently .

"A mother has hit out after a Princess Elsa entertainer at her daughter's fifth birthday party looked nothing like the Disney character. Luci Hindmarsh, from Hackney, east London, had previously provided her own entertainment  at daughter Misty's birthday parties, but decided to pay £175 this year for the professional Frozen act. She has been left furious after the entertainer turned up late and wore an ill-fitting wig and a sweaty dress that kept falling down. Scroll down for video . A mother had hit out after performance firm AEIOU Parties sent this entertainer - who was supposed to be Princess Elsa, the snow queen from Disney's hit musical Frozen - to her daughter's fifth birthday party . Ms Hindmarsh said the entertainer  sung a 70s rock ballad rather than hit song from the Disney film . Ms Hindmarsh, 35, and husband Adam, 40, paid party firm AEIOU Parties £175 to provide the entertainment, but were left waiting 20 minutes for the performer to arrive and a further 15 minutes for her to put on her costume. Ms Hindmarsh said the entertainer looked 'like she'd left a rave at 6am' and sung a 70s rock ballad rather than hit song from the Disney film. Writing on her blog, she wrote: 'Apparently the Elsa outfit had been worn by another entertainer earlier that day and was wet with sweat. 'So our entertainer decided to put the outfit on over the top of her own clothes, which happened to be black. 'She didn’t even bother to put the costume shoes on and wore a pair of tatty black flat shoes. The dress came undone at the back, someone did it up for her, but it wouldn’t stay done up, so she left it to hang off.' When one of the children asked the woman where Princess Elsa was, she replied: 'Elsa couldn’t come to the party, so I am here instead.' Ms Hindmarsh added: 'The last thing our daughter said quietly to me before she went to bed that night was: ""Mummy, why didn’t Elsa come to my party?” Which is not how I had imagined her birthday party day would end. Ms Hindmarsh said parents struggled not to laugh as the stand-in performer struggled through the act . 'The poor service also ruined the party for my husband and me. Previously we’ve done the entertainment ourselves at parties, and this year we had wanted to relax and enjoy watching our daughter having fun at her party. 'This was our daughter’s 5th birthday party, it was meant to be a really special and magical occasion for her. We worked really hard as parents to make it happen. We were totally let down.' Ms Hindmarsh - who had paid half up front - phoned up the agency to complain during the party, but was told to hand over the rest of the cash otherwise she couldn't later complain. The married mum, who runs blog Mums Make Lists, posted a photo of the apparent-lookalike on her personal website, which has been viewed more than 30,000 times. One mum wrote said: ""Genuinely appalled at @AeiouParties - be ashamed of yourselves! Princesses spread magic, not shatter dreams!? The company, which said an alternative performer had to be brought in at the last minute, has apologised to Ms Hindmarsh and agreed to pay a 50% refund. Explaining the appearance of the entertainer in the photos, a statement on its website read: 'Sometimes pictures, we all know, can look worst than reality because of the moment too. Anyway we agree that she didnt have the time to prepare all well.' The statement went on: 'We, entertainers, are humans, and as any other person, feel pressure and go down when we feel nothing we do is ok. The entertainer suffered a lot of judgement and it made it much more difficult. 'We assume the responsibility of the delay, the wet costume and therefore not having the right amount of time to prepare, but I think that if the party was so important as we also think it should be, Luci should have go to the entertainer [sic] and give the time she needed to look great.' There has been a surge in demand for Princess Elsa performers since the animated film hit cinema screens .","Parents paid £175 for hour-and-a-half entertainment by performer .

"A former drug dealer who went on The Jeremy Kyle Show to have a paternity test  has accused producers of forcing him to wear a tracksuit before the show's host ripped into him over the outfit. Gareth Evans, 27, was dubbed an 'ex-drug dealer in a tracksuit' by  Kyle, told to 'shut up' and called 'scum' after going on the show to find out if he was the real father of nine-month-old baby Damien. Girlfriend Charmaine Wright, 21, added that the show's staff had been manipulative, 'egging' the pair on before the cameras started rolling. Scroll down for video . Mr Evans said he turned up to the studio wearing a smart jumper, but was told by Kyle's team to take it off and put on a tracksuit top - moments before the host attacked him for wearing it . Gareth Evans, 27, said he was left feeling manipulated and humiliated after going on Jeremy Kyle with girlfriend Charmaine Wright, 21, to prove nine-month-old Damien is his son . She also said Kyle turned the audience against them, saying that Mr Evans was 'not a good dad'  and asking them to 'show the world how you welcome a drug dealer to my stage' when he walked out in front of the cameras. When Miss Wright revealed Mr Evans had been a drug dealer Kyle then gloated: 'I love mornings like this.' The DNA test proved Mr Evans is Damien's father, and he has vowed to be a good parent to his son . The episode, called 'I'll prove my drug dealing ex is the father to my baby', aired on January 26. The troubled couple, who have been together nearly three years, went on the ITV show after baby Damien was born with ginger hair, leading Gareth to think he might not be his. Mr Evans, from Barnstaple, Devon, says he turned up to the studios dressed in a smart Officers Club jumper, but was told he would have to remove it because it had a logo showing. Instead the production team told him he would have to change into a tracksuit, before Kyle attacked him over the clothing. Mr Evans said: 'He slated me for the tracksuit but it was his tracksuit so he slated himself. 'I wanted to go on the show to be sure Damien was mine, but we 100 per cent regret it. I only went on the show for my son.' DNA tests eventually proved that Damien was Mr Evans' son, and he has vowed to be a good father to the boy. The episode was available to view this morning via streaming service ITV Player, but has since been removed. MailOnline has made several attempts to contact The Jeremy Kyle Show and ITV for comment, but has so far not received a response. The incident is not the first time The Jeremy Kyle Show has been accused of influencing how guests appear on the programme. In 2007 the show came under fire after an alcoholic who appeared on the show claimed he had been plied with lager to 'stir him up for a fight'. Peter Davies, an ex-heroin addict, was a guest on the show as he tried to find out why his father cut him out of his will. 'They basically wanted me to make a fool of myself - and that's exactly what I did,' he told The Sun. 'I was half-cut by the time I went on stage. They knew I was an alcoholic and they should never have given me a drink.' A spokesman for the show said at the time: 'Peter was not encouraged to drink and was not given four or five cans of lager as he claims. Fazakerly Hospital banned the show from its television screens in 2009 . 'He was given two small cups of weak lager over a two-and-a-half-hour period to counteract alcohol withdrawal symptoms.' Later that year a former producer on the show told the Guardian that staff wind up guests 'like a coiled spring' before they take to the stage. Charlotte Scott said the production team would 'talk up' guests, giving them advice on what to say and how to be confrontational when they are questioned by Kyle. A spokeswoman for ITV said: 'We do not seek to ""wind up"" guests.' In 2009 the show was banned from being shown at Fazakerley Hospital, in Liverpool, after bosses decided it was upsetting patients. The hospital switched from ITV to BBC One after a number of complaints about the show from people in the waiting room. A spokeswoman for The Jeremy Kyle Show said many patients would be disappointed by the hospital's edict. 'It is the hospital's decision at the end of the day,' she added.","Gareth Evans, 27, said he arrived for filming wearing smart jumper .

"Comedian Ken Dodd, 87 (pictured), who was made an OBE in 1982 for services to showbusiness and charity, said he would like to receive a knighthood during an awards ceremony in London on Tuesday . The acquittal over his tax affairs failed to dent his popularity but scuppered his chances of a knighthood. However try telling that to Ken Dodd. Yesterday the comedian declared he deserved to be given the honour. Dodd, 87, said: ‘Of course I would like one [a knighthood], it would keep my ears warm in bed. No but seriously, I don’t know why I have not had one. It is up to them. You wait for the call, if you get it you get it. There is no harm done.’ Dodd, who was made an OBE in 1982 for services to showbusiness and charity, is best known for his variety style comedy routines. He is the king of the diddymen, the squire of Knotty Ash and the clown with the tickling stick. And he is also known as a singer, having been Britain’s highest-selling pop artist of the Sixties. Unlike many of his comedy peers, Dodd continues to tour with his ‘Happiness Show’ and will perform 31 dates before the end of the year. However, while he remains one of Britain’s favourite entertainers, on paper he is not a perfect candidate for a knighthood. Dodd made headlines when he was charged with tax evasion in 1989, before being later acquitted after a three-week trial. More than 20 years later, Dodd admitted he prefers to ignore letters from the tax office. He said: ‘My tribulations were 25 years ago. It is history. It has gone. They still write to me you know...the little brown envelopes, those dreaded brown envelopes with OHMS on...Oh Help Us Miserable Sods. They sent me a Christmas card saying “It is more blessed to give than it is to receive”. ‘They sent me a form recently saying “estimate your income for next year”. They are not satisfied with the blood they have had from this year. I am not going to sign it, they can guess what I am earning next year if they can guess who sent it in.’ Dodd added that he recently returned an invitation to the tax office, pretending it had been sent to the wrong address. He said: ‘[Wrote] on the envelope “Gone away, not known at this address. Cannot be reached”. The tax office is full of grinning tax inspectors, squeezing stones.’ Dodd is not the first star to criticise the lack of recognition for comedians. In 2012 Sir Bruce Forsyth, 86, said he was delighted to receive a knighthood but said it was rare event for comedians from his era. He said: ‘It seems the comedy field and the entertainment field are never recognised in the same way [as others]’. Dodd made headlines when he was charged with tax evasion in 1989, before being later acquitted after a trial . Asked whether he thought it was wrong he hadn’t received a knighthood sooner in his career, Sir Bruce said: ‘but neither did Morecambe and Wise, or Tommy Cooper.’ Ronnie Corbett, 84, has also questioned why so many talented entertainers had never been given knighthoods. He said Ronnie Barker – the other half of The Two Ronnies – should have been given one before his death and also singled out Tommy Cooper, saying: ‘There are many who did not live to receive one.’ Dodd made his comments as he was presented with the Oldie of the Year Award at the annual ceremony on Tuesday. Other winners included Michael Buerk, 68, who picked up the Jungle Survivor of the Year award for his 19-night stint on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! and Lord Falconer, 63, who was named Slimmer of the Year.","Veteran comedian Ken Dodd, 87, said he would like to receive a knighthood .

"Leona Doherty, 35, has two wombs and two vaginas due to a rare condition - but she has beaten the odds to give birth to a healthy son, Hugh . A woman with two wombs and two vaginas has spoken of her joy at finally giving birth to a 'miracle' baby. Leona Doherty, 35, was born with the incredibly rare medical condition uterus didelphys. Only three per cent of women are born with such an abnormality -  which can cause complications with pregnancy - and she suffered four miscarriages as a result. Mrs Doherty's chances of conception were halved because each of her wombs had just one fallopian tube and one ovary - which makes having a baby even more difficult. But after 14 years of trying to have a child with husband Gary, 41, she conceived a healthy baby in one of her wombs. Their son Hugh was delivered by Caesarean section on December 9 - weighing just 5lbs 9oz. His birth  came after 12 months of serious health problems, in which Mrs Doherty nearly died and her husband battled depression. She had a stroke and was rushed to hospital with  liver and kidney failure. Mrs Doherty, of Derry, Northern Ireland, said: 'Hugh's birth was the most amazing, unbelievable feeling. 'I still can't believe he's mine, even now. 'For 14 years we tried to have our own children and we never gave up hope. He's our miracle. We've been through so much to have him, but I never gave up hope. 'Always have faith and hope. Despite everything I honestly believe that there's always something good at the end of it.' 'It is just amazing - you forget about all the pain. I love being a mum. We are just enjoying every minute with Hugh.' Doctors made the shocking discovery she had two wombs when investigating why Mrs Doherty was having difficulty conceiving. Only one in 5 million women are said to be affected by the rare condition uterus didelphys. The condition is normally diagnosed during an examination, a smear test or in a scan during pregnancy. It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ. Hugh was delivered by Caesarean section on December 9 - weighing just 5lbs 9oz. His parents Leona and Gary Doherty, 35 and 41, had faced a battle to have their own child, after Mrs Doherty had suffered four miscarriages. The risk of miscarriage is increased in women with uterus didelphys . However sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ - so the woman is born with two wombs. As in Mrs Doherty's case, sometimes women with the condition will have pregnancy complications because each uterus can be smaller than normal. Although Mrs Doherty has two vaginas, she has sex normally but becomes pregnant in one uterus. Had she given birth naturally, it would have been through the vagina attached to that uterus, Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline. However, Caesarean sections are usually recommended in these women, to reduce the risk of complications. Mr and Mrs Doherty had always wanted children since meeting at work in 2000. But after a year of trying with no success, the perplexed couple sought medical advice. Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case. It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ — the uterus. Sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs. It often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan. In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb. Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case . It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb. Some women are also born with two vaginas, although they can have sex and menstruate in the same way as people with just one. 'They may know they have two and be able to find them, or they may not realise,' Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & Obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline. 'It can be painful because there are two squashed in the same area, so sometimes we do an operation to join them together, but its not necessary. 'They could also have abnormalities of their kidneys and the tube which bring the urine from the bladder.' Women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage, premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy. Often Caesarean sections are recommended, to reduce the risk of complications. There is no treatment or cure for the condition. Mrs Doherty, who at that stage weighed 19 stone, was told by her doctor to slim down - and she dropped more than 10 stone in two years. But concerned doctors also examined her uterus - and made the  discovery of her double womb, cervix and vagina. She said: 'They told me I had a rare condition that meant my womb had split in two while I was in my mother's womb. 'As a result, I have two wombs, two cervixes and two vaginas. 'But I never had any idea. It was devastating. All I could think was would I ever have a family?.' The couple married in 2003, still hoping they would one day become parents. Then, in 2006, Mrs Doherty endured a year of terrible ill-health. She suffered a mini-stroke in the May, her first miscarriage in the August and was diagnosed with epilepsy in the October. Mrs Doherty said: 'Talking now about that year, it seems a bad year, but we just got through it. 'My family were amazing, I couldn't have done it without their support. 'That first miscarriage happened very early, I was only about six weeks pregnant. We hadn't even the time to get excited or be that happy. 'But it was reassuring to know that we had fallen pregnant naturally.' The next few years revolved around ovulation, conception and timings. Despite IVF, the couple endured the heartbreak of three further miscarriages between 2009 and 2011. After the last miscarriage, Mrs Doherty was referred to a specialist to see whether it would be possible to connect her two wombs, in the hope that it would help her carry a baby to full term. The stress and heartache of their losses weighed heavily on her husband, too. 'My mother had passed away just before we lost the baby and I fell into a depression,' said Mr Doherty. 'I was off work for three months. It was hard.' Determined to help her husband, Mrs Doherty made it her mission to put him first. 'I made it my mission to get Gary well again and back to work. 'I always encouraged him and finally he was able to go back part-time and build his hours back up.' The  couple then began to consider fostering. 'I kept saying that even if we had our own children I would like to foster,' Mrs Doherty said. 'So we went through the process, which was long and hard, and finally in May 2013 a seven-year-old boy came to live with us.' Having children was the last thing on her mind - and in September that year she nearly lost her life. She began to have cold sweats and hallucinations; her temperature plummeted to 35.1C and she became hypothermic. She was rushed to hospital and slipped in and out of consciousness for the next eight hours. The doctors called her family to the hospital as her organs began to fail. Mrs Doherty spent a month in hospital recovering what doctors diagnosed as ischemic hepatitis - acute liver failure - caused by low blood pressure and dehydration - before she was flown back home to Northern Ireland. The fourth miscarriage sent Mr Doherty (left) into a depression in which he needed three months off work and Mrs Doherty (right)  forgot all about conceiving while supporting her husband to become well again. So when she fell pregnant for a fifth time and gave birth to Hugh (centre), the couple were over the moon . As she recovered, the couple did not talk about conceiving - but she admitted that it was always in the back of her mind. And six months later Mrs Doherty became pregnant naturally. 'I couldn't believe it when it was positive,' she said. 'Our obstetrician was amazing and saw us every week for the first 12 weeks. 'Getting to that milestone was a first for us and then we focused on 14 weeks. They then put a stitch in my cervix.' At the 20-week scan, the thrilled couple were told they were having a boy. But the pregnancy was not straightforward and a month later, Mrs Doherty was given steroid injections for the baby's lungs in case it was born early. 'Nobody knew when I was going to have the baby because of the half womb,' she said. 'I had to take it really easy, just in case anything would happen. 'I was so nervous throughout the whole pregnancy and had to inject an anti-clotting medicine every day,' she said. However, having a son made all the worry worthwhile, as she and her husband – and their entire extended family – are overjoyed. She said: 'I never thought my dad would get to see my children but on Saturday we christened Hugh and the priest who baptised him was the same priest who married my parents 37 years ago.'","Leona Doherty has uterus didelphys, which affects 3 per cent of women .

"A collection of vintage Nasa photographs - including some of the first ever images from space and the first cosmic 'selfie' - are set to fetch a whopping £500,000 ($760,000) at auction. The archive of more than 600 photographs, many of have never be published for public viewing, covers Nasa's groundbreaking space programme from its beginnings in the late 1950s through to the triumphant moon landing of 1969 and beyond. The collection will be up for sale at Bloomsbury Auctions in London on 26 February. Scroll down for video . #outofthisworld: A collection of photos are to go up for auction at Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions' saleroom in London on 26 February. Pictured is Buzz Aldrin taking a 'selfie' during the GEmini 12 mission in November 1966. It is estimated to sell for £800 . One of the stars of the collection is the first ever photo of Earth from space, which was taken on a camera mounted on a rocket in 1946 that was blasted 65 miles above the atmosphere. The camera snapped away at one frame every 1.5 seconds before the rocket plummeted back to Earth. The camera smashed on impact but the film role was salvaged and developed. The resulting grainy black and white photographs were stitched together to make one shot - and it changed man's relationship with space forever. Another highlight is a 'selfie' taken by legendary astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the Gemini 12 mission of 1966. Aldrin, the mission pilot, took the shot of himself looking back towards Earth, unbeknownst that he was almost 50 years ahead of the trend. The only known-of photo of Neil Armstrong's historic first steps on the Moon also features in the archive, as does an iconic 1972 shot of Apollo 17's Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt on the Moon with the Stars and Stripes in the foreground and Earth in the distance. The pictures taken by John Glenn, the first astronaut to take a camera into space, and an album of shots of Ed White performing his 1965 spacewalk, the first by an American, are in the collection too. Many of the photos remained unseen in the vaults at Nasa until the late 1980s when they were discovered by archivists. This is the first photograph ever taken of Earth from space, stitched together by engineer Clyde Holliday from a V2 rocket, on 24 October 1946. It is expected to sell for £1,000 . Valued at £1,000, this image, taken by astronaut Eugene Cernan, shows Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt with Earth above the US flag, during the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972 . The curvature of Earth is seen from the orbiting spacecraft Gemini 11 in September 1966, estimated to sell for £800 . Shown left is a £300 time-exposure of the Gemini 10 launch on 18 July 1966. Pictured right is a view of the giant Saturn V rocket ahead of the launch of Apollo 4 on 9 November 1967, on the pad at dawn with the moon in the background. It is estimated at £300 . This photo by astronaut Richard Gordon on the Gemini 11 mission in September 1966 shows Libya, United Arab Republic and Sudan from space, looking a bit more like Mars than Earth. The image is expected to sell for £800 . This photo by astronaut James McDivitt shows the first US Spacewalk, by Ed White  over South California, during the Gemini 4 on 3 June 1965, and is expected to sell for a huge £5,000 . This is the only clear photograph of Neil Armstrong on the Moon, during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, estimated at £1,500 . The incredible collection of original photos has been painstakingly pieced together over several decades by a private collector. He has now decided to sell the archive because it contains so many of the most significant space photos ever taken that it is complete. The photos are being sold in individual lots and range in price from £300 ($460) to £10,000 ($15,250) at London's Bloomsbury Auctions. It is the first time such a comprehensive collection of vintage Nasa photographs has ever been sold at auction. A spokesman for the auction house said: 'This extraordinary collection ticks off all of the most significant moments in the history of Nasa space exploration. 'I can't think of a significant moment that doesn't feature in the archive. 'A collector has put together the remarkable collection over the space of a few decades. 'He has decided to sell it because he got a thrill out of collecting photos of the most significant moments in space history, and now the collection is all but complete the thrill is gone. 'The photos are all vintage, meaning they were printed from period negatives shortly after they were taken. 'It is certainly the largest collection of vintage Nasa photographs ever to come to auction.' Buzz Aldrin's boot in lunar soil, during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, estimated at £750 . Buzz Aldrin prior to becoming second human being to set foot upon the Moon during Apollo 11, estimated at a whopping £6,000 . Astronaut James Irwin's 360-degree panoramic view with David Scott and one of the Apollo rovers is seen beside Hadley Rille, Station 9A on the lunar surface during Apollo 15 in August 1971. It is estimated to sell for £8,000 . This eclipse of the sun by Earth was taken during the Apollo 12 mission November 1969, and is estimated at £750 . An image from Ed White's personal photograph album of the Gemini 4 mission, June 1965, estimated at a staggering £10,000 . Sarah Wheeler, head of photographs at Bloomsbury Auctions, added: 'It is incredible to realise that many photographs in this auction were unknown to the general public for decades until the complete Nasa photographic archive began to appear digitally on the internet. 'This is particularly true of the collection of mosaics, real boots-on-the-ground panoramas taken by the Apollo astronauts as they explored the lunar landscape. 'These spectacular images were pieced together from individual Hasselblad frames for internal use by Nasa scientists. We know of no such collection ever having been offered at auction. 'These photographs are more than merely documentary, many are simply sublime. 'They represent a golden age in the history of photography as well, when a few men went to the unknown to bring back awe-inspiring pictures. 'The view of the first Earthrise over the lunar horizon changed Man's relationship with the cosmos forever.' The auction will be held on February 26.

"Amelia Warner is married to one of the sexiest men on the planet, who is about to be come the pin-up for millions of bored housewives across the globe. Not many women would be up for the task, but Amelia is not your average woman. The 32-year-old had a fake marriage  with Colin Farrell at the age of 19 and was cast in a raunchy Hollywood blockbuster opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Michael Caine at the tender age of 17. Scroll down for video . Jamie Dornan and his wife Amelia Warner at the Golden Globe last month. The couple have been together for seven years and the actor calls her his rock . She is also an accomplished singer-songwriter, whose tracks have featured on adverts for the likes of John Lewis and Orange mobile phones. Amelia is well-placed to deal with the heat from the Fifty Shades of Grey film as she was born into a showbiz family. Her mother is the actress Annette Ekblom, who starred in Brookside, Cracker and Blood Brothers the musical and her father is the actor Alun Lewis. Her parent’s relationship didn’t last long though and her mother raised her alone from early on, first in Liverpool and later moving to Ladbroke Grove in west London at the age of six, where her mother still lives. Amelia was a strong-willed child who inherited her mother’s outgoing character from an early age. Amelia's mother Annette Ekblom . She said of her first acting role – in her school’s nativity play: ‘I've got this idea that who you play in the nativity relates to who you are in life. ‘When I was four, I was Mary. But I wasn't a lovely ethereal Mary, I was a right bossy cow. ‘I stopped the play in the middle to tell Joseph he was doing it all wrong. So that's me.’ Amelia was a good student at the independent Royal Masonic School for Girls in Hertfordshire, although her attention was often swayed by her passion for acting. She won a place at the Royal Court's youth-theatre group and at the age of 16, she moved to the College of Fine Arts in north London to do her A-Levels. She said: ‘I began acting at school in Hertfordshire and I always liked it, though I didn't necessarily think I'd do it for a living. 'My plan was to go to Goldsmiths to study history of art, but someone saw me in a play at school and told me that I should meet this agent. ‘I started to get work and so I deferred my place at university. By 14, Amelia had already had her first Hollywood film part, in Mansfield Park in 1999, as a teenage Fanny Price, and bit parts in TV shows like Kavanagh QC and Casualty, but her main roles came in her later teens. At the age of 17, she played the part of Lorna Doone in the 2000 film about a farmer who falls in love with the ""queen"" of the notorious Doone clan. Amelia in Lorna Doone in 2000 . In that same year, Amelia was awarded the part of Simone on the films Quills, which had an all-star cast featuring Michael Caine, Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix. She said of the part: ‘I met the casting director for Quills, auditioned for the part, went on tape and got it. It happened just in the straightforward way.' The movie was to change her life in a large way, although not through acting. At the film premiere for Quills, she met the Hollywood heart throb Colin Farrell and the pair started a whirlwind relationship. Just four months after they met, the couple married on the island of Tahiti, although it was never legalised. Colin and Amelia at the American Outlaws premiere in 2001 . As a symbol of his love, Colin had Amelia’s name tattooed onto his ring finger. But they split just four months later. She said afterwards of the wedding: ‘It was just a thing we did on holiday. ‘We went shark feeding and then we did that. ‘We booked them both on the activities desk at the hotel ... It really wasn't this secret wedding that no one was invited to. ‘It was lovely, it was silly, it was sweet but by no means was it a serious thing and I think my mum thought it was quite funny.’ Amelia with Colin and her mother in 2001 . Although their wedding was a joke, the couple were also properly engaged to be married though and Amelia was devastated when they split. She told The Sun a couple of years ago: ‘Maybe if we had lasted longer as a couple, we would have legalised it. ‘I still look back at that time with him with such fondness, I adored Colin, and I always will — but we're just good friends now.’ After the couple split, Amelia threw herself headfirst into her acting and did back-to-back films for a few years. In 2005, she played the younger sister of Charlize Theron in the science fiction film Aeon Flux. Bit parts followed in Winter Passing, Alpha Male, Gone and The Dark Is Rising opposite Christopher Eccleston, but Amelia failed to get a huge box office hit. Charlize Theron and Amelia Warner in Aeon Flux in 2005 . But even while she was getting work as an actor, it was clear that her heart wasn’t in it. She said in an interview to promote Gone in 2006, ‘I do love films, it is exciting as a medium. And acting is a very cool job, but I can't imagine doing it for ever. ‘Ultimately, I would like to be more involved in writing.’ Amelia's first album: Renditions by Slow Moving Millie . Then just a couple of years later, Amelia quit the movie industry and decided to turn her attention to music instead, declaring that ‘music is my soulmate.’ She said of the switch: ‘I got fed up with acting because my heart was never in it - the feedback that I always got was that I didn't want it. ‘I was up against lots of actresses who would fight tooth and nail for a part but I didn't have the passion.’ Amelia renamed herself Slow Moving Millie and released an album of cover hits of Eighties songs by stars like Bananarama and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The record also featured two tracks written by Amelia, called Beasts and Hart With A Crown & Chain. Her cover version of Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths was made the soundtrack to the Christmas advert for John Lewis in 2011. It was during this reincarnation in 2007 that she met Jamie – the pair were introduced by mutual friends as a party in Hollywood – and the pair have been together ever since. After a period of dating, the couple moved into a house in Notting Hill together, around the corner from Amelia’s mother. Amelia and Jamie attend the GQ Men Of The Year awards  at The Royal Opera House in September 2014 . They also bought a bolthole in the Cotswolds, where they head to when the world of show business proves too much. The couple’s attitude to celebrity is identical – Amelia despises stardom and actively avoids the more glamorous side of Hollywood. She said in her early days of acting: ‘I want to stay below the radar and make good films. I have to be careful, I don't want my life to change. 'I really don't want to be a movie star.’ The couple married in 2013 and last April she gave birth to their first child, Dulcie. Although they have a base in London, Amelia is hugely supportive of Jamie – she even arranged to give birth in Vancouver when Jamie was filming Fifty Shades Of Grey there. He told The Telegraph: ‘A lot of people would have had a sh** fit at 30 something weeks pregnant hearing, ‘Darling, we’re going to Vancouver this week for four months - we’re going to have a Canadian baby and I’m going to do a film where, for parts of it, I will be naked.” ‘That’s a tough pitch but my wife is an incredible person.’","Amelia Warner is married to Fifty Shades Of Grey actor Jamie Dornan .

'Huge thanks to our passionate and dedicated audience who have played such an important part in making 6 Music a unique and exciting destination.' He added that he was also 'delighted' by Mr Evans' performance.

"It was built as a countryside haven by a wealthy heir who fulfilled his dream of becoming a farmer - and for nine years it was the perfect family home. But half a century later, this once-opulent six-bedroom mansion looks anything but lavish. With its smashed windows, decaying plaster and graffiti-sprayed walls, Overstone House has become an eerie and empty shell visited only by ghost-hunters. Scroll down for video . Lifetime ago: The empty mansion in Leicestershire was once the countryside haven of a wealthy man who had inherited a fortune . The enormous property, constructed with a tennis court, swimming pool and spiral staircase, was built in 1966 by Patrick Loyd after he had inherited a large sum of money from his grandfather. The young man, who was a student at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, spent around eight years working the surrounding land as an arable and beef farmer. He moved into the property aged just 24 and stayed there with his wife and three children until 1974 - when he left the UK for Guernsey for tax reasons. Hidden away from any main road in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, the house overlooks the River Jordan away from the public gaze. Decayed: Wealthy heir Patrick Loyd paid £150,000 for the property to be built in 1966 but was forced to leave in 1974 for tax reasons . Disrepair: A long-abandoned swimming pool has been reclaimed by nature as shrubs and moss coat the hidden water's surface . Mr Loyd paid £150,000 for it to be built - more than 30 times the price of an average property at the time, which was around £4,000. The former farmer, 72, was not reachable today, but his son Richard, 46, recalled fond early memories growing up in the house, having lived there until the age of six. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'It was a very nice, dreamy sort of home to grow up in and I'm sure I would have made more use of it had we stayed there longer. 'The few memories I have of it are extremely fond. My father bought the house while he was an agricultural student and said he had inherited the money to pay for it as a beneficiary of Baron Overstone, his grandfather. 'I never knew what inspired him to build the place or exactly why we had to leave. My parents were fairly private people and we've never really discussed these things. Long-abandoned: The once-opulent six-bedroom mansion has hardly been occupied since its construction almost half a century ago . Eerie: The huge house happens to lie on an ancient site where excavations have uncovered a Neolithic tool resembling a knife . Smashed windows: Mr Loyd paid £150,000 for the house to be built - around five times the price of an average property at the time . 'It was the sort of upbringing where children were meant to be seen and not heard. When we left England, my dad was about 32.' After the Loyds left, the property was lived in by a Mrs Leslie before briefly being used as offices for commercial businesses. The site has since been purchased by Careys Homes who plan to turn Overstone House into 50 new homes. The mansion lies on an ancient site where excavations have uncovered a Neolithic tool resembling a knife. Many more discoveries have been made on the site showing evidence of Bronze Age and Roman activity - with pottery, coins, metal objects and glass were all being recovered in archaeological excavations. Fifty years later: Hidden away from any main road in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, the house overlooks the River Jordan . Set to become flats: The abandoned site has been purchased by Careys Homes who plan to build 50 new homes on the land .

"STRANGER THAN FICTION: THE LIFE OF EDGAR WALLACE . by Neil Clark . (The History Press £17.99) Fleet Street has always produced — and attracted — spectacular characters. None was more spectacular, in his day, than Edgar Wallace. He was simply the most prolific and successful popular journalist-novelist of the start of the 20th century — as much of a household name as any filmstar, politician or writer; as recognisable as Lloyd George or Churchill, Conan Doyle or Somerset Maugham. I grew up avidly reading his adventure stories about the rulers of the British Empire, such as Sanders Of The River, and mysteries, such as The Four Just Men. Cascades of thrillers poured from him, as well as many hit West End plays. British crime writer, Edgar Wallace was the most prolific and successful popular journalist-novelist of the start of the 20th century . You couldn’t keep up with him. He was also one of the sights of the West End, where his yellow Rolls-Royce was instantly recognised. He liked to keep it and his chauffeur waiting outside his hotel or club, in case he should suddenly want to go racing — which he did a great deal. To me, he was a legend of early Fleet Street, especially of Northcliffe’s Daily Mail. Like many hopeful young journalists, I stood in Ludgate Circus, where Fleet Street begins, looking at his profile set in a wall plaque and reading the inscription: ‘Of his talents he gave lavishly to authorship — but to Fleet Street he gave his heart’. What makes this so poignant is that it is set above the spot where Wallace stood aged 11 in 1886, selling a newspaper called The Echo, which brought in his only income of three shillings a week. An orphan, he was given away as a baby by his touring actress mother and raised by a Billingsgate fish porter and his family as foster parents. He was fated, obviously, to be a labourer all his life. His escape into the playgrounds of the gilded rich he owed entirely to his pen, his fecund imagination and his insatiable appetite for work. He had huge talent, but hardly any writer, except perhaps Simenon, has turned out books as quickly and as successfully as Wallace did. Staggering statistics abound in this story. Let’s settle for a few: in four years of the Twenties, Wallace published 74 books — equivalent to one title almost every three weeks. It was claimed that a quarter of new books sold in Britain in those years were by him. In 1965, more than 30 years after his death, his worldwide sales were claimed to top 50 million in 28 languages. Ah, but he is little known to younger generations today. So were they so much trash, mere Penny Dreadfuls? They can’t have been. 1933: A scene from the classic monster movie 'King Kong', the book was written by Edgar Wallace . The thriller, like the detective story, was then the new fashion, and Wallace combined the appeal of both. Many of his stories revolved around the unmasking of a Moriarty-like villain concealed among the leading characters. ‘Can you guess which?’ was a game he played with his readers. Unlike the stuffy, upper-middle-class settings and characters of Agatha Christie or Dorothy Sayers, his lower-class or classless characters are convincing. He was one of them. His criminal gangs, locked- room murder mysteries, multiple disguises and chases were always inventive and sensational. ‘You can’t fail to be thrilled by Edgar Wallace,’ promised the blurb. Those who were thrilled included the highest in the land. Queen Mary bought four to read to a sickly George V (admittedly not known as an intellectual). Prime Ministers Baldwin and Balfour were fans, and the famous barrister F. E. Smith, Lord Birkenhead, said he had never failed to be excited by a Wallace Story. P. G. Wodehouse complained he couldn’t find anything new to read until the next Wallace appeared. Dozens of his stories have since been filmed and televised. He himself wrote and sometimes directed his own films. He was script-writing in Hollywood when he died unexpectedly in 1932 of pneumonia, possibly aggravated by his years of chain-smoking through a long cigarette holder, which was his trademark. The long catalogue of his successes cannot help but become repetitive in Clark’s workman-like chronicle. The most interesting passages describe how Wallace fought his way out of poverty and into journalism. His very name was fiction. The name ‘Wallace’ was made up — it was claimed to be that of his father when his birth was registered by his mother, the touring actress Polly Richards. His actual father was the son of her company manager, who was about to marry someone else. She didn’t care to embarrass him. The boy (and later the man) was known by his first name, Richard or Dick. ‘Edgar’ was the surname of his real father and ‘Wallace’ never existed. Leaving school at 12, which was then the rule, he kept changing one menial job for another until, in desperation, he joined the army at Woolwich. Soon, he was sent to South Africa for the start of the Boer War as a medical orderly. He had been writing verses for local magazines in Cape Town when Rudyard Kipling was to pay a visit. His welcoming verse in Kipling’s style appeared on the front page of the Cape Times. Kipling was tickled by it and invited him to dinner. So a working-class private soldier-poet hobnobbed with Britain’s most famous author. This got him known. He contributed verse to other papers, became a local columnist, then a war correspondent for Reuters news agency, covering the British forces fighting the Boers. These reports were picked up by the new Daily Mail, first published in 1896. The Mail made him its own correspondent. Wallace’s ingenuity in getting round the fierce censorship of news gave the Mail several scoops, including the long-awaited peace declaration. Alfred Harmsworth, the future Lord Northcliffe, welcomed his young reporter back to England with a celebration dinner. Wallace became the Mail’s top reporter — until he was fired by Northcliffe for having trusted a false tip about a mutiny that never was. By then, he was addicted to horse-racing. He became a racing writer and tipster for several papers. His adventure stories were beginning to sell. The money was coming in. So, he took the plunge as an author. Deciding that his typing took too long, he began to dictate his stories to a trusted typist, direct to the page. He reached the point where he could start dictating at midnight on a Friday and have a 75,000 book complete in typescript by the following Monday. O ne of the jokes triggered by his productivity was of a man who asked for him on the telephone and was told, ‘Mr Wallace is writing a book.’ ‘Fine,’ said the caller, ‘I’ll hold on.’ He earned plenty of money, but spent it as fast as it came in. Men who begin life in great poverty often hang onto their wealth. He loved spending it — not just on himself, but on others. For Royal Ascot week, he took a box with its own restaurant and invited dozens of friends to enjoy the racing with him. He would tell them he had put £10 on the last race for each of them. Whichever horse won, he would claim this had been the one they had backed — and he paid out all his guests, often out of his own pocket. In the course of this overworked life, he acquired two wives, sometimes living amicably with both in a ménage-a-trois. When he died, his debts far outweighed his bank account. Everything — houses, racehorses, motor cars — had to be sold. A year later, the motion picture he had been working on in Hollywood appeared. It was King Kong — billed as ‘Edgar Wallace’s Last Story’. In fact, the script he wrote was mostly unused and the ideas were partly his and partly those of a co-writer called Merian Cooper. However, it was all his idea that King Kong climbed the Empire State Building — which is what everyone remembers.","Edgar Wallace was given away as a baby by his touring actress mother .

"Just over a year ago, Sian Clarke weighted just three and a half stone and nearly died of a cardiac arrest. The 20-year-old, from Solihull, was battling anorexia so severe  her own mother considered planning her funeral. With a BMI of just nine, she was moved between six hospitals in less than a year – including to a secure ward with very unwell and violent patients. But none of the facilities seemed able to treat her illness, prompting her mother to accuse the NHS of 'leaving her to die'. But now Miss Clarke is on the road to recovery, planning her 21st birthday party and acting as a mentor to others with eating disorders. Sian Clarke, 20, has battled anorexia since she was 15 and bullied at school. In June 2013, she suffered a cardiac arrest and nearly died. Now, after a course of treatment, she is on the road to recovery and is mentoring other people with eating disorders . Miss Clarke, pictured here in hospital, has been treated at six different hospitals since 2012. Her mother says the NHS 'left her to die' and that she received 'appalling care' After her cardiac arrest, Miss Clarke was put on a course of treatment and is on the road to recovery. She is staying at Beverley House, a mental health centre in Birmingham, but hopes to move back home soon . Miss Clarke first developed an eating disorder at 15 years old. She was being bullied at school and couldn't cope with it, and started worrying about her weight. Things went from bad to worse and she spent much of her teens in and out of treatment centres. But doctors struggled to find her the appropriate way to help her - and her weight continued to drop to dangerous levels. In October 2012, she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. This led to her being passed between six different hospitals for treatment - a move her mother Denise calls 'appalling'. Mrs Clarke, 41, said: 'It's no joke to say that I would be planning her funeral now if she hadn't finally made it to the centre that helped her. It's shocking, and I'm absolutely appalled. 'The NHS has got a lot to answer for. This is somebody's life - but everyone seems to blame someone else.' In October 2012, Miss Clarke was was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. This led to her being passed between many hospitals for treatment - a move her mother Denise has described previously as 'appalling' 'Sian was left to die. She was passed between different hospitals, and none of them could treat her anorexia. 'The doctors told me that she was on the brink of death.' In June 2013, when Miss Clarke was 19 and being treated at the Cygnet Hospital in Derby, she went into cardiac arrest. This is where the heart stops pumping blood around the body – usually because the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead. Miss Clarke collapsed and stopped breathing - a moment her mother described as 'hell'. 'I would say to those who are going through the same thing: you have to believe in yourself. You can beat this thing,' Miss Clarke said. She is pictured in hospital with her mother Denise . At one point, Mrs Clarke, 41, began planning her daughter's funeral. But now mother and daughter are now  planning Sian's 21st birthday party instead . 'It's a mother's worst nightmare. She was so close to death,' said Mrs Clarke. 'We had a bedside vigil and I started thinking I would have to start planning her funeral. 'I could easily be visiting her grave now.' Miss Clarke was rushed to the Derby Royal Hospital, where she underwent emergency treatment. She had a BMI (Body Mass Index) of just nine and was not expected to live. The typical BMI for a healthy 19-year-old girl ranges from 18 to 26. 'No-one should technically be alive at three-and-a-half stone,' her mother said. 'Sian was so emaciated you could see every bone, and her teeth were protruding out of her mouth.' Anorexia can lead to a life-threatening cardiac arrest because the heart needs adequate amounts of potassium, sodium and other electrolytes in a certain balance. Miss Clarke now wants to raise as much awareness to anorexia as possible, including posting this striking image of herself on Facebook . Starving the body depletes these electrolyte and the electrical activity of the heart is interrupted, leading to heart rhythm problems or cardiac arrest. Miss Clarke was put on a course of treatment and gradually started to get well. While she has not fully recovered, Miss Clarke hopes to return home from the treatment centre soon. And grateful at being given the chance to live, she now wants to help others with eating disorders recover. Her mother said: 'Sian says to me now ""Mum this can't happen to anyone else"".' In order to raise awareness, she has put a striking image of herself, leaning over a toilet, on Facebook. The accompanying message reads: 'A struggle is an easy thing to mistake for attention. 'You can't see it by merely looking at someone, or even begin to know what happens behind closed doors. 'The pain, anguish, torment and overall, the fight. Stand up to eating disorders.' She also helps to mentor other people with anorexia, and has been awarded a national Service Users Award. 'I feel great,' Miss Clarke said. 'Don't get me wrong, I have my off days. 'There are times when I get on the scales and think: ""What have I done?"" 'This illness has taken over my life since I was 15 years old. I have not been able to live a normal life. 'I would say to those who are going through the same thing: you have to believe in yourself. 'You have to focus on the reason you are doing what you are doing. 'You can beat this thing.' A spokesperson for NHS England (West Midlands), who are responsible for Miss Clarke's care, said: 'We are committed to ensuring that patients have access to safe, effective and high-quality mental health services. 'An investigation into the care and treatment of this patient has taken place and a full response has been shared with the parents and family. 'If there are any further concerns, we would encourage the family to contact us to discuss them further. 'NHS England takes complaints very seriously and regrets that on this occasion the patient was unhappy with the care and treatment that they received.'","Sian Clarke, 20, developed anorexia at 15 years old after being bullied .

"Every bride dreams of the perfect wedding, but Nancy Sanchez was happy to forget the bouquet, bridesmaids and room full of guests for her big day. For the 18-year-old's new husband Anthony Carrion is on remand in San Bruno jail in San Francisco, awaiting trial for attempted murder, two robberies, attempting carjacking and kidnapping. Like other inmates who marry behind bars, they said their vows over the phone, separated by bulletproof glass and won't be alone until his trial date is set - but the teenager says she knows Anthony's 'the one'. Scroll down for video . Nancy has no aisle on her special day, instead going through the San Bruno jail's metal detectors . The pair are married through the bullet proof glass in the jail visitor centre, saying their vows down the phones, with only Nancy's best friend and the prison chaplain present . The couple are just two of the estimated 1,800 pairs who get married behind bars each year in California alone. Her story is featured in a Channel 4 programme, Married Behind Bars, airing Thursday night. Nancy drove herself to the jail with her best friend as sole wedding guest. Once they made it through security, she and Anthony - wearing a government-issue orange jumpsuit - were married by the prison chaplain, Pastor Nation. The ceremony lasted just 10 minutes and was conducted over the phone, the newlyweds separated by bulletproof glass. No rings were exchanged. She said: 'I'm just 18 and a lot of people are like ""oh you're getting married so young"", and I'm just like yes, so?' Gang member Anthony, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, smiles as he says his vows . Anthony, who does not yet have a date for his trial, has told Nancy that if found guilty he will likely spend six years in prison. However he knows if convicted he will be probably be sentenced to 29-year to life. The pair met while in  school together, where Nancy had a crush on Anthony, who was two years above her. Like many of the males in Nancy's neighbourhood, Anthony joined a gang as a teenager, getting the gang symbol of four dots tattooed on his face under his left eye and on his hand. Further stress is placed on their relationship by the face that Anthony and Nancy's family are from two rival gangs. She explained: 'I've had a crush on Anthony ever since middle school. He was in a different crew and I would never see him in school because he would always skip. 'We never went out. He had his girlfriend and I was with my boyfriend five years. But then my boyfriend broke my heart.' Nancy stayed with her uncle's family in Chicago to get over the break-up, but she always maintained feeling for Anthony. It was after she returned to San Francisco and was visiting a friend in San Bruno jail that Nancy spotted Anthony in the visitors' room and they began talking again by phone. Then three weeks later  Anthony proposed. Despite being just 18, and having become engaged after only dating three weeks, Nancy is confident of their relationship and beams throughout the 10 minute ceremony .

"Chimpanzees have special 'words' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups. Primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in Holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in Edinburgh. Their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects. Previously scientists had believed such calls in response to food and alarm calls were an expression of their excitement and cannot be controlled. Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are. Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet. The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting -  are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle. But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual. Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them. The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts. Many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture. Now research by scientists at the University of York and the University of Zurich is challenging this assumption. Dr Katie Slocombe, a psychologist at the University of York who led the study, said it could have new implications for the evolution of language in humans. She said: 'An extraordinary feature of human language is our ability to reference external objects and events with socially learned symbols, or words. 'This represents the first evidence of non-human animals actively modifying and socially learning the structure of a meaningful referential vocalisation. 'The socially learnt nature of referential words in humans is likely to have ancient evolutionary origins.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal of Current Biology, watched a group of adult chimpanzees from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in Edinburgh Zoo. By analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples, they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010. While the Dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the Edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds. After a year of integration, the grunt calls for apple were still different, but after three years the calls produced by the Dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from Edinburgh. Louis was a male in the original group of chimpanzees at Edinburgh Zoo that used a specific call for 'apple' Frek, above, a Dutch chimp changed his high-pitched call for 'apple' to a softer grunt like the Scottish chimps . The Dutch chimpanzees (left) had different preferences for apples compared to the Edinburgh chimps (right) The researchers found that by this time the chimpanzees had formed strong friendships and the groups had joined together into one. Dr Simon Townsend, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Zurich who also took part in the study, said: 'Three years after the integration, the grunt calls of the new chimpanzees very much resembled the grunt calls produced by the Edinburgh chimpanzees. 'The preferences for apple in these chimpanzees stayed the same during this period, but the grunt calls changed.' He added: 'The fact that both humans and now chimpanzees possess this basic ability suggests that our shared common ancestor living over 6 million years ago may also have been socially learning referential vocalisations.' The findings are the first evidence that chimps like the one above can learn new calls for foods and objects . Scientists studying the Sonso chimpanzee community living in Uganda's Budongo Forest have been able to witness how the animals teach each other to use tools. The analysis began when one chimp called Nick, the 29-year-old alpha male chimpanzee, made a moss sponge while being watched by Nambi, a dominant adult female. Over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges. Six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way. The scientists also recorded a 12-year-old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge. A further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique, but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first. By using a technique called network-based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a 'naïve' chimpanzee observed moss-sponging, this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour. This striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role.","Biologists studied chimps moved to Edinburgh Zoo from the Netherlands .

"Rumours about an Apple streaming service have been around for years, but they ramped up last year when the firm bought Dr Dre’s Beats brand. And it now seems we’re just months away from seeing the service being rolled out across iPhones and iPads. Sources told 9to5Mac that Apple is planning to integrate a Beats-powered service into its iOS software and could unveil the changes at this year’s World Wide Developer’s Conference in June. Sources told 9to5Mac that the Californian firm's service will be integrated into music libraries and users will be able to search, stream and add songs to their iTunes account. It is thought the service will borrow features from the Beats Music app (pictured), such as Mixes and Playlists, but will be a standalone product . The claims were made by multiple, but unnamed, sources from ‘within Apple and the music industry’. They said Apple will integrate Beats technology into iOS, iTunes and Apple TV using a modified version of the firm’s current Music app. It is thought the service will borrow features from the Beats Music app, such as Mixes and Playlists, but will be a standalone product. Reports continued that the service will link with a user’s music library and people will be able to search for songs in the iTunes and Beats catalogue. Apple bought the Beats brand from Dr Dre last year. Reports said its streaming service will include songs from the iTunes and Beats catalogue. There are even rumours Apple will add social networking features in which people can follow artists, for example . Rumours about a streaming service surfaced in 2013 when Apple held talks with  Dr Dre. Reports of a bundled subscription service then originated in November. At that time, sources said the streaming service would launch as early as March, but this is now said to have been delayed. Apple has previously announced updates to its music range, such as iTunes Radio in 2013, at its annual developer’s conference and it may instead unveil the streaming service at this year’s event, likely to take place in June. Sources told 9to5Mac that Apple's service will be integrated into music libraries and users will be able to search, stream and add songs to their iTunes account. It will include a number of Beats Music’s current features such as Mixes and Playlists and prices are expected to start at $7.99 a month - making it cheaper than Spotify and Rdio’s $9.99 monthly subscription fee. From there, they will be able to stream or buy a song, which will be added to their iTunes account either stored on their phones, or kept in the cloud. There are even rumours Apple will add social networking features in which people can follow artists, for example. Beats Music costs $9.99 a month, which puts it on par with the likes of Spotify and Rdio, but an Apple service could undercut this price. 9to5Mac said Apple had initially discussed charging $5, but it’s more likely to charge $7.99 per month.

"An angelic-looking teenager described as the 'devil child' of his village has been warned he faces jail if he breaches the terms of his second ASBO. Blond Matthew Dodd-Flemming, 17, tried to get dogs to bite a newsagent, flashed his bare buttocks to school staff and fired an air rifle through a window in Rhydyfelin, near Pontypridd, South Wales. The teenager also fought in the street, kicked balls at neighbours' homes, smoked cannabis, drunk alcohol in public, climbed scaffolding and looked into the windows of an old people's home. Matthew Dodd-Flemming, (pictured), described as the 'devil child' of his village has been warned he faces jail if he breaches the terms of his ASBO . Dodd-Flemming has now been given his second ASBO in a bid to prevent him from menacing the village. The ASBO bans him from climbing onto any scaffolding or roof, throwing stones, eggs or waste, playing ball games in the street, or swearing at passers-by. David Jones, head of community protection, said: 'We are committed to protecting the community of Rhydyfelin from unacceptable behaviour such as this. The teenager also fought in the street, kicked balls at neighbours' homes, smoked cannabis, drank alcohol in public, climbed scaffolding and looked into the windows of an old people's home . 'Dodd-Flemming is an unusual case. He faces immediate arrest and imprisonment if he decides to breach the terms of his ASBO. 'We hope this serves as a reassurance to the community that we are working as hard as we can for as long as it takes to manage an offender who causes such harm to the area in which he lives.'

"When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a joint session of the U.S. Congress on March 3, an important chair in the House chamber might be empty. White House press secretary Josh Earnest refused to say on Wednesday whether Vice President Joe Biden would attend. His absence would be conspicuous – not only because he represents President Barack Obama, but also because he officially presides over the U.S. Senate. 'The Vice President's schedule for that week has not yet been set,' Earnest told reporters. 'So as we get some more details worked out of his schedule, we'll be able to let you know whether or not he'll be able to attend that joint session.' America's Constitution gives vice presidents the role of Senate 'president,' a role that's largely ceremonial but can include casting tie-breaking votes when legislation hits a 50-50 deadlock. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW: Vice President Joe Biden greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warmly in 2011 when he addressed a joint session of Congress, but he might not show up this time at all . White House press secretary Josh Earnest won't make any commitments that Biden will be on Capitol Hill in his customary chair when Netanyahu comes on March 3 . Biden and House Speaker John Boehner are seen sitting behind Obama each year during his State of the Union address, which takes place in the same forum Netanyahu will enter. Members of both houses of Congress have gathered in the House chamber 18 times since Obama took office, including those annual presidential speeches. 'The vice president has only missed one,' Earnest said Wednesday. 'He missed one back in March of 2011 when then-Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke before a joint session of Congress.' Biden was overseas on visits to Finland, Russia and Moldova at the time. Other heads of state have also addressed Congress in the Obama era, including the leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Mexico, Ukraine. And Israel, too. Netanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress in May 2011, delivering a passionate defense of his country to thunderous applause and 29 standing ovations – four more than Obama had received during that year's State of the Union address. Biden was among those cheering. But his attendance in March, Earnest said, 'is going to be contingent on his schedule.' Netanyahu's speech in 2011 was aimed squarely at Obama, a flat rejection of using Israel's 1967 borders as a starting point for a peace deal with the Palestinian Authority. 'Israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967,' he declared. 'Israel on the 1967 lines would be only 9 miles wide,' Netanyahu added later. 'So much for defensible borders.' This time around the israeli prime minister is concerned about the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, and is preparing another rhetorical cruise missile to lob at the Oval Office. Obama has fended off threats from members of both parties in Congress to level new sanctions on Tehran as the Islamic republic's mullahs drag negotiatons over their nuclear program to a slow crawl. House and Senate leaders believe Iran is playing for time while it gears up a weapons program, but Tehran insists it wants to maintain reactors for energy – although Iran sits atop the world's third-largest oil reserves. The White House, however, insists that tightening the screws now would give Iran a rationale for ending the talks entirely. The latest spat unfolding along the length of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. was put on ice when senators agreed to hold off on a new round of sanctions until March 24. Netanyahu is a fierce critic of how Obama and his State Department have handled the years-long negotiations. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who presides over the House of Representatives, extended his invitation on January 21., decidedly going behind Obama's back and putting the White House in a difficult position. Earnest announced the next day that Obama wouldn't be meeting with Netanyahu while he was in Washington. Netanyahu received 29 standing ovations during his 2011 speech – that's four more than Obama got during that year's State of the Union address . 'We have a longstanding practice of not meeting with democratically elected officials shortly before their election,' he said, noting that the Israelis will go to the polls on March 17. 'And the reason for that is we want to avoid even the appearance of any kind of interference with a democratic election.' Earnest continued to snipe at Republicans on Wednesday, dismissing Boehner's invitation as a 'breach in protocol' that could elevate relations between U.S. Republicans and Israel's Likud Party above America's broader relations with Israel. He also acknowledged that several senior Democratic lawmakers have openly discussed boycotting the March 3 speech. 'The president believes that individual members ought to decide for themselves,' Earnest said. 'That's certainly appropriate.' Several prominent Jewish Democrats including New York Rep. Steve Israel met with Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer on Wednesday, airing their complaints. RABBLE-ROUSER: Rep. Steve Israel hosted a group of disaffected Jewish Democrats for a meeting with Israel's Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer . TICKED OFF: California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (right) says having Netanyahu address Congress is 'obviously political' NO RSVP YET: Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois says he may or may not show up for Bibi's speech . Yuli-Yoel Edelstein, the speaker of Israel's Knesset – its parliament – met separately with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Israel told the Associated Press that Democrats became furious when Boehner 'decided that Israel would be a political football and he'd spike it in the end zone.' Others in the meeting included Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, New York Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nita Lowey, Florida Rep. Ted Deutch, Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who also chairs the Democratic National Committee. Boehner insists that the House of Representatives is part of a branch of the U.S. government that's co-equal with the White House, and has the right to invite Netanyahu to 'talk to the members of Congress about the serious threat that Iran poses and the serious threat of radical Islam.' In the Senate, California's Dianne Feinstein is also weighing a boycott. 'My concern is that it's obviously political, and it uses the backdrop of the United States House of Representatives, and the Senate and the House, two weeks before a political campaign, and violates all the protocol that's always existed in terms of working this out with the president,' she told The Washington Post. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said he may or may not go: 'I haven't made up my mind.' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who along with New Jersey Democrati Sen. Bob Menendez has been pushing for a new sanctions regime on Iran, said empty seats on March 3 would be a disgrace. 'I think that would not be appropriate treatment of the prime minister of Israel, and I'm sure they can respond to their constituents as to why they would do that,' McCain fumed. Menendez told The Wall Street Journal that he won't miss Netanyahu's speech. 'From my perspective, if he is here, I'll probably be attending,' he said. Netanyahu has other challenges on his mind with his position at stake in the March 17 election. His Likud Party has launched an ad mocking rivals Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni as unqualified stewards of Israel's children – while he, the 'Bibisitter,' can take better care of their futures. The two challengers, known to Israelis as 'Buji and Tzipi,' would trade off prime minister duties if their coalition can drive Likud from power.","Republican House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli prime minister to address a joint session of Congress on March 3 .

"A report by the Royal College of Nursing in London shows the NHS is projected to spend £980 million on agency nurses this year (file picture, posed) The NHS will shell out a billion pounds hiring agency nurses this year to plug severe staffing shortages on wards, experts warn. Figures suggest spending has doubled in the last year as the numbers of full-time nurses in hospitals has not kept pace with the rising patient demand. A report by the Royal College of Nursing shows the NHS is projected to spend £980 million on agency nurses this year, an average of £4.2 million per hospital trust. This is up from £485 million in 2013/4 and £327 million in 2012/3. And previous figures have shown that some hospitals have been forced to pay agencies £1,800 to hire one nurse to work a single bank holiday shift. The College says hospitals have been left at the mercy of these agencies as staffing cuts have left them so short of their own full-time nurses. It also warns that many demoralised nurses are quitting their jobs and going to work for agencies as the pay is so much higher. Earlier this week MPs on the Public Accounts Committee highlighted a similar trend amongst doctors who are leaving to earn £1,700 a day as locums. Dr Peter Carter, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursoing said the NHS was ‘leaving itself at the mercy of agencies because it refused to invest sensibly in the past. ‘Over-reliance on agency staff is bad for continuity of care, and that is bad for patients. ‘Cutting the supply of nurses was reckless and short-sighted but concerns were batted away in a misguided attempt to save money.’ Last Summer, figures obtained by Sky News showed that University Hospitals Bristol had paid an agency £1,800 for one nurse to cover a 12-hour bank holiday shift. The agency would have taken a substantial cut of this money although the nurse will have earned far more than in a full-time NHS post. Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘The over-reliance on agency staff is not just wasteful of NHS finances but it can also damage staff morale and result in poorer patient care. ‘Nurses who’ve had a pay freeze for years will find it galling that the agency bill is going through the roof. The Royal College of Nursing in London (pictured) says hospitals have been left at the mercy of agencies as staffing cuts have left them short of their own full-time nurses. It also warns of demoralised nurses quitting . A Department of Health spokesperson said: ‘Patient safety is top of our agenda, and so in the wake of Mid Staffs agency workers have been used to correct historic understaffing. ‘Since May 2010, we already have 21,300 more permanent clinical staff working in the NHS, including nearly 8,000 more nurses on our wards. ‘We want to reduce reliance on agency staff in the longer term, and committed in the recent pay deal to work with the unions to bring the bill down.’","NHS is projected to spend nearly £1billion on agency nurses this year .

Sources claim Glass' new boss Tony Fadell (pictured) wants to redesign the Google headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until it's complete. One unnamed source told the New York Times that Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect' The claims were made by 'several people with knowledge of Mr Fadell's plans' to Nick Bilton at the New York Times. Following last month's announcement, Google said Glass would be graduating from being a Google X experimental project to a division in its own right. The firm brought in Tony Fadell from Nest - a home automation company Google bought in 2014 - to lead the team, replacing previous boss Ivy Ross. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But, as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Ms Ross still works on the project and runs 'day-to-day' operations. In a statement in January, Mr Fadell said: 'Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike. 'I'm excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products.' An unnamed source added Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect.' The previous Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (£990), and was launched in the US in 2013, and the UK last summer.

"Bryan Henderson is among the top 1,000 most active Wikipedia editors for his dedication to correcting the misuse of the phrase 'comprised of' As grammatical errors go, it is perhaps so obscure that most people would read on without giving it a second thought. But the misuse of the term 'comprised of' bothers one obsessive Wikipedia editor so much, he has spent nearly a decade correcting the mistake 47,000 times. Software engineer Bryan Henderson, known online as Giraffedata, spends an hour every Sunday evening fixing between 70 and 80 cases of the error that have appeared on Wikipedia over the previous week. Using software the 51-year-old designed himself, he sends a request to Wikipedia's server for articles containing the phrase, Medium.com reported. Pages containing it are then extracted and compared to a database of articles he has edited in the past six months. Any matches between the two sets of results are then removed from his list, in order to avoid bothering editors who have become overprotective of their pages. Links for the remaining articles are then presented for him to click through, edit and upload - a process which takes approximately ten seconds for every correction. Despite making the fixes reasonably quickly, Mr Henderson says that is down to having practiced the art since 2007. He said: 'An edit typically takes about ten seconds, but that’s because I’ve gotten really, really good at it. 'I’m actually putting a lot of thought into those ten seconds. Some of them take a lot longer; some of them take minutes.' The essay written by Mr Henderson and published on Wikipedia which explains his obsessive amount of intervention . Mr Henderson claims the phrase 'comprised of' is 'completely unnecessary'. He said: 'There are many other ways to say what the writer means by ""comprised of"". It adds nothing to the language.' The Wikipedia user suggests 'composed of' or 'consists of' as possible alternatives to the forbidden phrase. Mr Henderson's argument is that 'to comprise' means to include, as in: 'Britain comprises all of England, Wales and Scotland.' By this definition, the phrase 'Britain is comprised of...' does not make sense. Remarkably, his case for why it is ungrammatical is laid out in a 6,000-word essay in which he claims it stems from confusion between the phrases 'composed of' and 'comprised'. Within the essay, he also responds to critics who have regularly labelled him a pedant. He writes: 'I won't offer a rebuttal of that, because an individual editor's allocation of his time shouldn't be anyone else's concern.' His grammar campaign has not been welcomed by everyone, with some Wikipedia page creators reverting his edits. One user erased his changes on 30 pages, in the same order which he made them. Despite making the fix 47,000 times, Mr Henderson is still only scrapes into Wikipedia's top 1,000 contributors - in 978th place. The top editor - going by the name Koavf - has made almost 1.5million edits.","Bryan Henderson has spent the past eight years correcting the same error .

"NBC's Brian Williams wants you to know he's sorry about the lies he's told about having been shot down in a helicopter ambush in Iraq.

Did Amelia Earhart go down with Brian Williams? @robx_d says yes . It came to a head during the Nightly News broadcast this past Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him. 'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize' he said. In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the ‘fog of memory over 12 years’ for his error. ‘I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,’ he wrote. ‘Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area -- and the fog of memory over 12 years -- made me conflate the two, and I apologize.’ Twitter user @robx_d also puts Williams alongside the flag as it was raised at Iwo Jima . Reporting live from the moon: ""That one live shot I did from the moon"" #BrianWilliamsMemories (via @DutraWeather) Saving Private Brian? @IvanTheK puts Williams in the 1998 classic WWII film . Since the 2003 incident, Williams’ Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown. NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC’s Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.' However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News  it stated that a ‘chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.’ Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade. 'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.' In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a ‘flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters’. ‘Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours. 'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,’ he recalled. By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.' 'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote. 'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.' The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his. ‘Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,’ he told Letterman. Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now ‘the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.’","#brianwilliamsmisremembers quickly began to trend across social media as people mocked his fabricated memory of the invasion of Iraq .

"Militants working for ISIS' all-female police force in Syria have released a manifesto on the role of women - claiming children as young as nine should be encouraged to get married and condemning beauty parlours as the work of the devil. The chilling document, titled 'Women in the Islamic State', demands women live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle and that their role in life should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. The manifesto urges 'pure' females to ensure they are married by 16, 'while they are still young and active', but insists that children as young as nine can 'legitimately' marry adult men. It goes on to state that beauty parlours and shops selling fashionable clothes must not be tolerated as they are both instruments of the devil designed to encourage women to spend vast amounts of money to change God's design. The document is the first of its kind to be released by ISIS' all-female Al-Khansa Brigade and while it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS' leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women living under the terror group's barbaric regime can expect to be viewed and treated. Scroll down for video . Covered: Members of the all-female Al-Khansa Brigade are seen walking in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa . The document is the first of its kind to be released by ISIS' all-female police force, the Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured),  and while it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS' leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women living under the terror group's barbaric regime can expect to be viewed and treated . The document was originally released by the Al-Khansa Brigade last month but as it was written in Arabic, it failed to make an impact on Western ISIS jihadis or supporters. To avoid the crucial information being lost to English-language terror experts, the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam has now fully translated the manifesto and released its own analysis of its contents. In stark contradiction to the way life under the rule of ISIS is  portrayed on social media, the document explains that the primary duty of Western women who join the terror group is to marry a jihadi, then spend their life cooking, cleaning and raising a family. It suggests that young Western women who spend their time online boasting of leading an exciting and fulfilling lifestyle under the rule of ISIS are lying, possibly under pressure from the group's leadership who want to encourage a greater number of women to travel to Syria and marry fighters. The document describes how women in the once relatively Westernised Syrian city of Raqqa are now 'liberated' by laws demanding they are fully covered in public, as it prevents their 'humiliation'. Despite talk of mass hunger, struggling hospitals, electricity blackouts and a near collapse of the local economy, the Al-Khansa Brigade writer insists that ISIS has eradicated poverty in the areas under its control and that hospitals are full of 'modern medical technology that could treat all those suffering from chronic diseases, including cancer'. 'Women benefit from a substantial amount of these services, for example the maternity hospital, which provides specialist care for mother and son who are examined by pediatricians who give them the cures they need, the document says. Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, and joined the Al Khansa Brigade in Syria in June last year after becoming radicalised online . In training: Earlier this week one of the Halane twins tweeted this picture, captioned: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters' In stark contradiction to the way life under the rule of ISIS is portrayed on social media, the document explains that the primary duty of Western women who join the terror group is to marry a jihadi, then spend their life cooking, cleaning and raising a family . The manifesto begins with a lengthy rejection of Western values, including financial systems and scientific research. The author attacks studying 'the brain cells of crows, grains of sand and fish arteries' as a distraction from the fundamental purpose of humanity, to worship God. In one of many moments of hypocrisy in the document however, the Al-Khansa Brigade writer states that certain scientific research 'that help facilitate the lives of Muslims and their affairs are permissible', outlining such necessities as including medicine, agriculture and architecture. The bulk of the manifesto focuses on the role of women, slamming feminism as contrary to God's plan and insisting that the roles of men and women have become confused as women no longer fully submit to their master husband. This, the author claims, is largely the fault of men, who have allowed their 'God-given right' for dominance over women to dwindle, 'forcing women away from their true role' and leaving them 'confused and complacent' within the home. 'Because men are serving women like themselves, men cannot distinguish themselves from them... if men were men then women would be women,' the author states. The implication is those fighting for ISIS are 'real men', whereas men living in the West have become weak and submissive. This is something the Al-Khansa Brigade believes angers a God who made women 'from Adam and for Adam'. Shocking: Earlier this year British Al-Khansa Brigade member Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria. She was standing alongside young children at the time . Inside the Islamic State: The leader of Al-Khansa is believed to be a six foot tall woman named Umm Hamza, who carries a gun, electric cattle-prod and daggers beneath her religious gowns . Describing everyday life in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the manifesto says that the city has become the primary destination for all foreigners looking to join the Islamic State. 'It is a haven for them to flee with their religion from the oppression of tyrants in the east and west and place in which they are privileged with elegant homes that harbour friends of God,' it says. 'The way of life for women in Raqqa does not differ from that in Mosul. Security, justice, fairness, healthy living, education and healthcare are all of equal importance in the Caliphate,' it adds. The document paints life in the city as extremely multicultural, with the author listing her immediate neighbours as  an Arab, a Chechen and a Kazach. 'There is no difference between Arabs and Persians, blacks or whites. All are under the rule of Islam. It is not possible to live in this Islamic way in any place ruled by tyrants, who implement nationalism over religion and patriotism over Shariah,' the document states. 'Tribes are merged and races join under the banner of monotheism, resulting in new generations within which are gathered the cultures of many different peoples, one a beautiful meeting, and harmonious alliance,' it adds. Everyday life: Describing everyday life in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the manifesto says that the city has become the primary destination for all foreigners looking to join the Islamic State . Guns and children: Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage shows several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS . Little is known about ISIS' Al-Khansa Brigade, although they are thought to act as a kind of all-female police force inside Raqqa and in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Dozens of young British women have used social media to boast of joining the force – claiming to be doling out savage beatings, punishment lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of Yazidi sex slaves are imprisoned and raped daily after being sold for as little as £27. Britons including privately-educated Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood, 20, and Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22, are understood to have joined the Al-Khansa Brigade in Raqqa, helping to patrol the city with guns and daggers hidden beneath their religious robes. Other Britions believed to have been joined the Al Khansa Brigade include the Manchester-born 'terror twins' Zahra and Salma Halane, who have 28 GCSE's between them. The group, which is largely made-up of educated Western women, operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in the city - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. Thanks to the head-to-toe niqabs all women living in ISIS-held territory are forced to wear, the Al-Khansa Brigade also acts as a Stasi-esque secret police force - with members covertly spying on men suspected of wrongdoing, before reporting them to ISIS' feared Hisbah religious authority. Although the figures are impossible to independently verify, the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) believes as many as 60 British nationals are currently members of Al-Khansa.","ISIS report details life of extreme oppression faced by women joining ISIS .

"To date, astronomers have found about 1,000 planets in the Milky Way, with just a handful of these thought to be potentially habitable. But, in the hunt for Earth-like planets, a new study says we should be optimistic - as there may be more than 200 billion in our galaxy alone. The remarkable declaration is based on the estimate that the average stars has two Earth-like planets in orbit, and the Milky Way has about 100 billion stars. Australian scientists say our galaxy could be teeming with habitable worlds (illustration shown). If each star has an average of two planets, there will be 200 billion. They base this on a 200-year-old method called the Titius-Bode relation. This was used to predict some planets in our own solar system . The researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) made the finding using a 200-year-old method. Known as the Titius-Bode relation, it predicts the existence of planets based on their sequence around the sun. It was correctly used to predict the orbits of the dwarf planet Ceres and ice giant Uranus in our own solar system. In this case the team look at multi-planet systems that were known to contain at least three planets, as detected by the Kepler space telescope. 'We use a generalised Titius-Bode relation to predict the periods of 228 additional planets in 151 of these Kepler multiples,' the researchers wrote. Using this, they say there are an average of two planets in the habitable zone of each star. Also known as the goldilocks zone, this is the distance from a star where liquid water, crucial for life, can exist. The Kepler space telescope is biased towards seeing planets very close to their stars, that are too hot for liquid water, but the team extrapolated from Kepler's results to make their findings. This would suggest that are hundreds of billions of potentially habitable planets in the galaxy that could support life. In 1776, German astronomer Johann Daniel Titius wrote that the position planets from the sun - then only confirmed to be just Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - could be predicted by a mathematical relation. The relation is the number four plus another number, which is zero, three, six, 12 - and so on, doubling each time. So, for example, Mercury is four plus zero ‘parts’ from the sun - four in total. Venus is four plus three - seven - while Earth is four plus six - ten - and so on. The work was followed up fellow German Johann Elert Bode in 1772. He postulated that, using the relation, one noticed a gap in the pattern of the planets. He found that, after Mars, there was a rather large gap to Jupiter. ‘Can one believe that the Founder of the universe had left this space empty? Certainly not,’ he wrote at the time. Thus, he predicted the appearance of the dwarf planet Ceres between Mars and Jupiter. The relation also predicted the orbit of Uranus. There is no solid theoretical explanation as to why this law works, although possible explanations involve the orbital resonance of a planetary system - namely, a condition where all the planets are stable. Its accuracy and use has been called in to question, though. In our solar system, it failed to account for the asteroid belt, Pluto, and many other bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The team look at multi-planet systems that were known to contain at least three planets, as detected by the Kepler space telescope (illustrated). 'We use a generalised Titius-Bode relation to predict the periods of 228 additional planets in 151 of these Kepler multiples,' the researchers wrote .

Also known as the goldilocks zone, this is the distance from a star where liquid water, crucial for life, can exist. This would suggest that are hundreds of billions of potentially habitable planets in the galaxy . 'The ingredients for life are plentiful, and we now know that habitable environments are plentiful,' said Dr Charley Lineweaver, from the ANU Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Research School of Earth Sciences. He adds, though, that it remains a mystery why we have still not made contact with an extraterrestrial race, if life is so abundant. 'The universe is not teeming with aliens with human-like intelligence that can build radio telescopes and space ships. Otherwise we would have seen or heard from them,' he said. 'It could be that there is some other bottleneck for the emergence of life that we haven't worked out yet. Or intelligent civilisations evolve, but then self-destruct.'","Australian scientists say our galaxy could be teeming with habitable worlds .

"A 14-year-old boy in Mexico was diagnosed with a rare condition, gerascophobia - an excessive fear of ageing (picture posed by model) A 14-year-old boy was so terrified of growing up he took extreme steps to curb his physical growth, stopping eating and distorting his voice. The teenager also adopted a stooped posture to appear shorter and scoured the internet to learn how not to ejaculate. A new report, in which experts discuss his case, reveals the boy's phobia started when he was around 12 years old. Having learned nutrients in food would cause him to grow, the boy ate less, and lost more than 26lbs (12kg) - almost two stone - in the process. Specialists at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, in northern Mexico, diagnosed the boy with gerascophobia - an excessive fear of ageing. They noted the teenager 'felt his body development was a threat, to the point where he took extreme measures to stop or otherwise hide growth'. The report reveals: 'Every time he notices a physical change that indicates that he is growing, he feels fear and anxiety, to the point that he has considered undergoing multiple surgeries to hide it. 'If people tell him that he is taller or older, he becomes extremely upset and cries.' The psychiatrists assessing the teenager noted he had a history of separation anxiety, dating back to when he was five. They also revealed he was sexually abused by a neighbour as a six-year-old, and suffered regular bullying. The researchers said all three factors caused the boy to suffer anxiety and depression and focus his attention on certain physical characteristics. However the teenager argued the expectations adults face as they get older are 'excessive', for example, getting a partner, being independent, and having more responsibility and financial solvency. The report adds: 'He also believes that once he reaches that age, he is more likely to get sick and die, all of which are very overwhelming.' The psychiatrists assessing the boy said after carrying out a number of searches they found only one other article where two similar cases of a fear of ageing are reported. Despite the diagnosis, other medical professionals told Livescience they might have put the teenager's condition down to body dysmorphic or gender dysmorphic disorders. Martin Antony, a professor in psychology at Ryerson University in Toronto said: 'Somebody else might well diagnose this as a different problem than what the authors have.' Meanwhile Dr Luis Gonzalez Mendoza, director of paediatric endocrinology at Miami Children's Hospital agreed. The boy went to extreme lengths to try and prevent himself growing up, stopping eating, stooping to appear shorter and distorting his voice to speak in a higher tone, specialists analysing his case revealed. Pictured, a statue of the character Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up . He attributed the boy's symptoms to gender dysmorphia, where a person fails to identify with his or her biological gender, and fear puberty because they don't recognise their changing bodies. The teenage boy was treated by doctors at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León with the antidepressant fluoxetine. He also underwent psychotherapy and family therapy. The treatment appeared successful, with the boy standing upright and speaking in his natural tone of voice. His attitude to food also improved, and he gained 13lbs (6kg) - almost a stone. The report added: 'He is able to imagine the future, living on his own and working as an actor, and this is an idea he likes; he continues to express a fear of commitment and responsibilities that he feels will be required of him in adult life.' The report was published in the journal Case Reports in Psychiatry.","14-year-old suffers gerascophobia - an intense fear of ageing .

"A teenage mother who left her five-month-old baby to starve to death  has had her appeal for a more lenient sentence rejected - and instead had it increased by 30 months.

But judges were outraged by her attempts to shift blame and instead increased her sentence by a further two-and-a-half years.

Her lawyer Oleg Kiyashko claimed she had asked the child's father to help look after their daughter. He claimed: 'Yes, she left the child at times. Although she left her, sometimes she came back in the morning or the father was at home, so he could still look after the girl.' At the time, judges rejected a defence plea to alter her charge from the murder of a minor with cruelty to causing death by negligence and sentenced her to 10 years hard labour.","Alena Itapova, 19, nicknamed 'Monster Mum' for letting baby Veronika die .

"She was the victim of female genital mutilation (FGM) at the age of nine and has been fighting the mental and physical scars ever since, frightened that she would never experience the joy of becoming a mother. Now 26-year-old Khadija Gbla is celebrating what she describes as a ‘miracle’ after she gave birth to a beautiful, healthy, baby boy, weighing almost three kilos, on Monday night. Samuel Williams Jr, named after his father, was delivered by emergency caesarean section in Adelaide’s Women's & Children's Hospital at 11.14pm after Khadija went into early labour. The FGM campaigner said there are no words to describe the anticipation she felt as the doctors were ‘tugging and pulling and getting him out’. The pregnancy that she had sometimes imagined was an impossible dream suddenly became real. ‘When they showed him to me, I didn’t think I’d ever seen a more beautiful sight in my life. He is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.’ Scroll down for video . Khadija Gbla with her beatuiful baby boySamuel Williams Jr who was delivered by emergency caesarean section on Monday night . Samuel was named after his father (left) and has been described as a 'miracle' after Khadija never believed she would be able to have her own children . ‘Sometimes I thought FGM had won but when I saw him I finally thought “yes I am really having a baby”. It is such a miracle and a gift,’ she said. Khadija, who lives in Adelaide with her husband Samuel, was nine years old when her mother took her into the bush in Gambia, Africa, and pinned her down while an old lady 'operated' on her with a rusty knife. Khadija was nine-years-old when her mother took her into the bush in The Gambia to have her circumcised . ‘She started hacking away. I remember the pain and trauma of it. The knife was so rusty it felt like it was going on forever,’ she told Daily Mail Australia in December while she was 10 months pregnant. ‘I thought they were going to slaughter me. She lay on my body above what I now know as a clitoris and cut off that piece of flesh,’ she recalled. Khadija was born in Sierra Leone but when war broke out in 1991 her family moved to The Gambia for safety and then on to Australia when they were granted refugee status in 2001. As a child Khadija didn’t know what had happened to her or why and for years a state of amnesia stopped her recalling that terrifying day. She now runs the charity NO FGM Australia providing help and advice to other survivors and the one in three girls a day who are still at risk of having their genitals 'mutilated' in Australia. When Khadija became pregnant she was honest about how her FGM experience was impacting on what should be a happy time. She had to deal with health professionals with ‘a lack of knowledge and sensitivity’ and just two months before her due date she still did not know if she would be able to have a vaginal birth due to her scarring. ‘I’m scared it’s going to be like FGM all over again,’ she said in December. Internal vaginal scarring could have caused her baby’s head to become stuck if she gave birth without a caesarean. So when her contractions began on Monday night, Khadija felt a sense of panic when she called the pregnancy hotline and was simply advised to tell her husband to get the towels ready. ‘I thought “oh no I’m not having this baby vaginally”… they rushed me to the hospital but they said if the baby’s head was too low already it might have to be a virginal birth. When Khadija became pregnant she was honest about how her FGM experience was impacting on what should be a happy time and she felt like medical staff had a lack of knowledge about her situation . The pregnancy that Khadija had sometimes imagined was all an impossible dream finally feels real . ‘I thought “this can’t be happening”… but they got me to hospital and that’s when my waters broke. They still had time to get me into theatre and stop my nightmare coming true,’ she said. ‘For a couple of hours I was in a lot of pain and there were a lot of F words.’ ‘It all worked out in the end… for my baby to come into the world in the least traumatic way possible for both of us. There was drama but I wouldn’t have had it any other way,’ she added. Khadija is cherishing her first few days as a new mother. ‘I don’t want to let him out of my sight. I didn’t let my husband hold him, I said “he’s mine, he’s mine”,’ she laughed. ‘I keep thinking “wow I made that, that came from me, it’s overwhelming. He’s absolutely gorgeous”.’ And she can already spot signs of baby Samuel’s personality. ‘His eyes are wide open, he’s very peaceful, he eats a lot and is a little mini Khadija, he’s very feisty and already a strong, strong man,’ she gushed. Khadija was born in Sierra Leone but when war broke out in 1991 her family moved to The Gambia for safety and then on to Australia when they were granted refugee status in 2001 . Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve altering or injuring the female genitalia for non-medical reasons, the United Nations says. It is recognised internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. Over 140 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of FGM. If current trends continue, about 86 million additional girls worldwide will be subjected to the practice by 2030. FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and age 15. FGM causes severe bleeding and health issues including cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths. WHO IS 'AT RISK' OF FGM IN AUSTRALIA? A girl is 'at risk' if: . When her husband saw Samuel for the first time ‘he fell in love at first sight’. ‘It was absolutely beautiful to see a man get emotional like that and he didn’t want to give me the baby either, there is a bit of a competition. ‘It’s so surreal for both of us watching him sleep and thinking he’s here, he’s finally here.’ She hopes Samuel will be ‘a happy healthy baby’, who grows into ‘a man who is compassionate and kind and a feminist - if I have anything to do with it’. Despite still being in hospital recovering from the dramatic birth of her first child, Khadija can’t wait to get back to advocating. The tireless campaigner said the last nine months have been ‘such a learning experience’. And now she’s ready to put what she’s learned to good use for other FGM survivors. ‘There is no down time. This is my passion. This is not work. This is what I live for… it’s too important not to do,’ she said. 'There is no down time': Khadija can’t wait to get back to advocating for FGM survivors and will do it with baby Samuel by her side who she hopes will grow up to be a 'feminist' Friday marks the United Nations International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation and Khadija hopes her story can encourage more people ‘to break the silence’. ‘The silence allows abuse to continue. When you break the silence you say “no” to the abuse.’ There’s no doubt about it, Khadija will continue fighting to give FGM survivors their ‘womanhood back’ with access to mental and physical health services and she won’t stop campaigning to make people realise that mutilating children is child abuse and not a cultural problem.

"An 18-month-old child in Massachusetts suffocated to death from a plastic bag that was placed over her head during a mayonnaise lice remedy (file photo) An 18-month old child in Massachusetts suffocated to death from a plastic bag was placed over her mayonnaise-covered head during a home treatment for head lice. The girl had apparently fallen asleep when the bag slipped down and covered her face, asphyxiating her. Springfield officers said the infant was left unattended for hours before anyone checked on her. There was a second child in the house who had lice at the same time but the family decided to shave his head. Sgt. John Delaney said police responded to a call last Saturday that a child was not breathing, according to Masslive.com. Police have not filed charges and the matter is under investigation. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families is also investigating the incident. Public information director Cayenne Isaksen said any children in the house had been removed and are currently in a relative's care. She would not specify how many children were living in the residence. Mayonnaise is listed as a common home remedy for head lice on a number of web sites, but most suggest the treatment be carried out with a shower cap. The CDC states that individuals infected with lice should be treated with over-the-counter or prescription medication. It says it does not have sufficient scientific evidence to determine if head lice can effectively be treated with mayonnaise. Deborah Altschuler, president of the National Pediculosis Association (the scientific name for lice), discouraged any home remedy treatments involving plastic bags. 'We've been warning the public about this since the first time it was recommended,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'Plastic around a child's head is a bad idea no matter what, especially if you're going to put them to bed that way.' Altschuler said the most effective treatment for head lice was 'early detection and manual removal' and she discouraged against 'pesticide' medications. She said if parents 'know what to look for' before their children have it and use a good comb to screen hair, they'll get to the head lice early enough that it becomes a non-problem.","18-month-old was left unsupervised for hours, say Massachusetts police .

"Hundreds of children working in hazardous factories in southern India have been saved by police to be reunited with their families. Police say they have rescued some 400 children in a series of raids on leather tanning and plastic factories in Hyderabad over the past ten days. The children, mainly boys,  hail from India's Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal states, and have today been returned to their hometowns on special trains. Rescued: Some 400 children hailing from some of India's poorest areas have been rescued from factories in southern India where they were forced to work 12-hour days in 'deplorable conditions' Raids: The children, mainly from India's Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal states, were rescued during raids on factories conducted by the city police and labour department officials in Hyderabad . Heading home: Two former child labourers rescued by police look out from a train as they prepare for their journey to their hometowns . Police say they found the children working long hours in deplorable conditions, despite a nationwide ban on child labour. 'We found the children confined to their work place in inhuman conditions,' said V. Satyanarayana, a top police official in Hyderabad. 'They were forced to work for nearly 12 hours a day without any respite.' 'Many of the children were suffering from skin and other diseases as they were forced to work in unhygienic and unventilated dark rooms,' Satyanarayana said. He said their employers would monitor them with video cameras and any child who stopped working would be beaten.

Police in Hyderabad have arrested five men accused of supplying children to the factory owners. Raids on factories to check for child workers will be carried out twice a month, a labour welfare official said. 'We are taking effective measures to eradicate the mafia behind bringing children from other states to work in hazardous industries in Hyderabad,' R.V. Chandravan said. India has laws aimed at fighting child labour by making education compulsory up to age 14 and prohibiting their employment in hazardous occupations. Despite the laws,  grinding poverty still causes many children to be pushed into work, with factory agents promising their wages to their parents. The 2011 census found that about 4.35million children between the ages of five and 14 were employed across India.

"Worst fears confirmed: Arthur Neal Jr, 86, who was last seen alive at his home in Detroit December 20, has been found stabbed to death . An 86-year-old Detroit man who went missing in December after winning $20,000 in the lottery has been found stabbed to death. The body of Arthur Neal Jr., who was reported missing December 28, was discovered Sunday afternoon inside a vacant house in the 15800 block of Mansfield Street, about three miles from his home. Police say Neal was found in the basement of the residence, and his body was covered. An autopsy determined the octogenarian died from multiple stab wounds, the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office said. Family members told local media that Neal won $20,000 in the lottery December 19, and it is believed that he vanished the next day. A missing persons reported was filed a week later. Police have not been able to confirm the lottery win, said Detroit Police spokeswoman Nicole Kirkwood. Neal's death is now being investigated as a homicide. 'He's 86 years old. He can't hurt anybody. Why would they do anything like this? I don't understand,' Neal's granddaughter Christina Hall told the station WXYZ. Hall has made an appeal to the public asking for anyone with information on her grandfather's killer to come forward. Neal was last seen alive at his home on Trinity Street in Detroit December 20. His other granddaughter Lawanda Marshall said a few days after his disappearance they had become concerned after he failed to show up for Christmas, as he would not have missed Christmas with his family. Scroll down for video . Grisly find: Neal has been found with multiple stab wounds in the basement of this vacant house in the 15800 block of Mansfield Street . According to his relatives, Neal  had recently won  $20,000 in a lottery game, but had no plans to leave town. There is no word at this time if Neal had cashed his prize before his killing. Marshall said that the information about his lottery win was widely publicized and his family think this could be the reason he has vanished into thin air. Marshall said: 'It bothers me greatly because I don't think that's the type of information that should have seeped out – if that was the case – especially that neighborhood in which he was staying and reside.' Neal's family said they went to his house to check on him and found his home in disarray and a door left ajar, which raised their suspicions  further. Marshall described her grandfather to Mlive.com as a physically and mentally strong man who still did masonry work despite his advance age and was 'joyful.'","Arthur Neal Jr, 86, was found stabbed multiple times in vacant home in Detroit Sunday .

"She is the faceless Australian criminal who was spared from execution back in the 1800s despite murdering her two youngest children and stabbing four others before they escaped. The incredible details of Martha Rumph's history has until now remained scarce with her family doing everything in their power to erase the shame of her crimes by destroying all records and photos. But a descendant has remarkably managed to piece together elements of Martha's twisted story and unravel further drama that plagued the Rumph family almost 150 years ago. Martha Rumph was committed to The Hospital for the Insane (pictured) at Gladesville, north-west of Sydney, in March 1894 several years after murdering two of her young daughters and stabbing four others . Martha, who emigrated to Australia with her husband Michael and son George from Germany in 1856, lived in the Snowy Mountains region of NSW and gave birth to six more children in the years to follow. She brutally murdered her two youngest children - two-year-old Elizabeth and seven-month-old Wilhelmina - on January 11, 1871. Martha stabbed four of her other children, Mary, 10, Annie, 7, William, 6, and Martin 4, before they managed to escape and run for their father who worked as a shepherd on a squatting run. When her husband arrived at the scene, he found Martha lying in their bed with their two dead daughters and a butcher's knife. Martha, who emigrated to Australia from Germany in 1856, murdered her children Elizabeth, 2, and seven-month-old Wilhelmina in the family home (pictured) in the Snowy Mountains region of NSW in 1871 . Martha stabbed four of her other children, Mary, 10, Annie, 7, William, 6 (pictured here later as a school teacher), and Martin 4, before they managed to escape and run for their father . The death certificates of Elizabeth and Wilhelmina Rumph were uncovered during a general family history search some 20 years ago and led descendant and Ancestry member Patricia Moon to uncover the gruesome story. At Martha's murder trial at Darlinghurst in Sydney on February 16, 1871, medical experts argued that she was suffering from puerperal mania - a psychic condition that affects women after the birth of a baby. Members of her tight-knit community rallied in support of Martha saying she should be treated in an asylum and not jail because she must have been in a trance-like state when she murdered her daughters. 'She was found not guilty on the grounds of insanity. She would have been hanged if she had been found guilty in those days,' Ms Moon told Daily Mail Australia. 'That’s the incredible part of it, she was sort of forgiven by the community, the judge, the government, her family – if she had been found guilty, that would have been it.' While Martha was freed from jail three years after the murder, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital at Gladesville in March 1894 where patients were often strapped into straighjackets (pictured) Hospital records showed Martha was confined to a single room because other patients didn't want to sleep with her due to homicidal attempts. Doctors said she was delusional and would talk to herself . Martha lived out the rest of her life in asylums. She was initially placed at The Hospital for the Insane at Gladesville (pictured) before being moved to Kenmore Hospital, south of Sydney . She was later transferred to Kenmore Hospital, south of Sydney, where she died of Bright's disease on April 26, 1902. Martha's grave is among the 1,200 psychiatric patients buried within the hospital grounds . There are no photos of Martha after her granddaughter, Minnie Hare, left orders in her will in 1951 to destroy any information or photos Martha appeared in to try and erase the shame . Martha was deemed sane three years later and was sent back home. The Rumph's run of bad luck continued when she returned after her eldest son George was kicked in the head by a horse and died when he was 21. Martha's daughter Annie, who survived the stabbing, was also found dead in 1884 when she was just 19. 'She took a job as a servant on some property down in Bega. One of the men on the property seduced her and told her he would marry her,' Ms Moon said. 'She got pregnant and then he refused her. She left her saddle and a note on the side of a  river and drowned herself. 'The doctor who did the autopsy said they knew who she was because she had a slit across her throat from where her mother had cut her. 'They found a six-month-old foetus inside her.' The Rumph's run of bad luck continued when Martha's daughter Annie, who survived the stabbing, committed suicide in 1884. She threw herself in the Bega (pictured) river after falling pregnant to a man she worked for . The doctor who did the autopsy on Annie said they knew who she was because she had a list across her throat from where her mother had tried to cut her . Up until 1894, Martha had managed to maintain her relationships with her family despite her crimes some 20 years before. But when she had another manic episode and attacked her nephew with a fork, Martha was sent to The Hospital for the Insane at Gladesville, north-west of Sydney, in March 1894. Hospital records show Martha was confined to a single room because other patients didn't want to sleep with her due to homicidal attempts. Doctors said she was delusional and would talk to herself. Martha lived out the rest of her life in asylums. She was later transferred to Kenmore Hospital, south of Sydney, where she died of Bright's disease on April 26, 1902. Only three of Martha's children lived on into adulthood, including William (pictured here with his children) who was just six years old when his mother tried to slash his throat . The death certificates of Martha's two children that she murdered in 1871 identified that their throats had been slit by their mother . The death certificates of Elizabeth and Wilhelmina Rumph were uncovered during a general family history search some 20 years ago and led to the gruesome story being uncovered . Martha's grave is among the 1,200 psychiatric patients buried within the hospital grounds. Ms Moon spent years trawling through records and old newspaper clippings to piece together Martha's story. 'This is all sort of hidden in history,' she said. 'She fell through the cracks. The family didn't ever speak about it.' Her granddaughter, Minnie Hare, left orders in her will in 1951 to destroy any information or photos Martha appeared in to try and erase the shame. The family of Martin Rumph, one of Martha's three children to survive, still live on the family property in the Snowy Mountains region.

"Two parents were arrested this week after their three young children - including an 11-month-old infant - were found alone locked in a filthy run-down house, starving and shivering in 40-degree temperatures. Parents Mark Dorson and Amanda Ann Foley, both 33, appeared in Snohomish County, Washington Court on Wednesday where a judge ordered them held on $100,000 bond for charges of  felony criminal mistreatment and abandoning a child. The couples' children were saved from the deplorable conditions on Saturday, after a woman stopped by the family's house on the 9700 block of 11th Place in Lake Stevens to collect a debt from Dorson. Scroll down for video . Deplorable: A 7-year-old girl, 3-year-old boy, and 11-month-old boy were found abandoned by their parents in this unheated and filthy home in Lake Stevens, Washington on Saturday . Arrested: On Wednesday, parents Mark Dorson (left) and Amanda Foley (right), both 33, appeared in Snohomish County Court where they were ordered held on $100,000 bond on child abandonment charges . Run down: Above, a view of the family's now-condemned home in Lake Stevens where the children were found on Saturday . When she found the couple's 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son unattended in the downstairs portion of the house, she called police. Officers who arrived on the scene found the sister and brother huddled together under a blanket on a couch to keep warm in the unheated home, surrounded by animal feces and trash, according to a police affidavit. 'The condition of the home looked like it was being torn down, with drywall missing, insulation missing, water coming through the ceiling,' Lake Stevens Commander Dennis Taylor told KOMO. 'There was only an empty snack-size potato chip bag and an empty Pringles can. There was no sign of any food; no empty wrappers, no empty cans, certainly no food in the home,' Cmdr Taylor added. Police were eventually able to coax the girl to open the door, and she insisted that her parents were upstairs sleeping. While police didn't find the parents upstairs, they did discover the couple's 11-month-old son in a bedroom - which was locked and unreachable by the two older siblings. While all three children appeared to be malnourished and struggling to keep warm in the unheated house, it was the infant who was in the worst condition according to police reports. Resecued: The children were discovered Saturday by a woman who stopped by the house to collect a debt from Dorson. Above, investigators wearing respirators and covered shoes look over the filthy home . Cold: The 7-year-old girl and 3-year-old boy were found huddled under a blanket on the couch to keep warm in the unheated home. Animal feces and other trash were found littering the home . Locked away: The youngest child, an 11-month-old boy, was found locked in an upstairs bedroom - unreachable by his two older siblings . The baby barely reacted to touch when officers arrived on the scene, and after being rushed to the hospital, doctors pronounced that the boy was suffering from hypothermia and dehydration. The infant also had a low 94-degree temperature and was unable to move his extremities. Thankfully, the boy reacted well to treatment 'and is doing much better now' according to Cmdr Taylor. The two other children were also treated at the hospital, and the siblings have now been placed in foster care. 'If it weren't for the person who was owed money; if it weren't for their insight to call us, we'd be dealing with a much more tragic situation,' Cmdr Taylor said. 'It's 40 degrees inside the home because there's no heat; no insulation. It's very possible the one child could have perished from hypothermia.' It's still unclear how long the three children were left alone at the home, or if their parents even noticed they were missing. However, the couple never attempted to contact authorities and it took until Tuesday for police to track them down and arrest them at a business in nearby Monroe, Washington - about 30 minutes south. New home: The infant was treated for dehydration and hypothermia and is recovering. All three children have been transferred into foster care . Criminal history: Dorson and Foley both have extensive criminal records. Dorson was sentenced to prison in 2002 for shooting and wounding a man while Foley was convicted of stealing an SUV . Authorities say the parents have been investigated by Child Protective Services on several occasions in the past, when their eldest daughter continually showed up unkempt and hungry to school. Her school had also informed CPS when she failed to show up for school for a week straight. However, neighbors were completely unaware that the children were being left alone or the state that the house was in. They did confront Dorson about the condition of the exterior of the home, when it started to stick out in the community. 'He pretty much threw attitude, and said he was doing the best he could. And we said ""OK, well, it needs to be taken care of,""' Neighbor Matt Eberharter told KIRO. The stench in the house was so bad that investigators had to don respirators and plastic boots to look over the home a few days later, and a building inspector has now condemned the house as uninhabitable. While there was running water in the home, inspectors also found mold and water damage, in addition to dangerously disabled smoke alarms, exposed wires and uncovered light fixtures. According to court records, both parents have had several run-ins with the law. Dorson was sentenced to prison in 2002 for shooting and wounding a man, while Foley graduated from drug court in 2009 and was later convicted of stealing an SUV. The woman who discovered the children living in the filthy conditions on Saturday says she paid Dorson for car repairs that he never followed through with. Dorson's Facebook shows him working to upgrade several cars, many of them parked outside the home where he allegedly abandoned his children.

"Andy Murray has been spotted out and about for the first time since landing in Heathrow on Tuesday after the tumultuous Australian Open. But as he and fiancee Kim Sears donned wellies, hats and fleeces for a snowy dog-walk, his four-set defeat by Novak Djokovic on Sunday was a world away. The couple strolled with their border terriers Maggie May and Rusty near their £5 million home in Oxshott, Surrey, yesterday. Scroll down for video . Kim kept her  gloves on but Andy looked at this smartphone while walking their dogs Maggie May and Rusty . Kim wrapped up in a burgundy and grey striped scarf that matched her snug trousers and gloves . Andy Murry and Kim Sears enjoyed a stroll through snow-covered Oxshott yesterday afternoon . The 27-year-old Scot smiled as he walked and chatted to Kim, although at one point he checked his phone before his hands got too cold and he put them back in his pockets. Andy wore a black wool beanie and a grey jumper over a zip up top. His trousers were by Under Armour, the US clothing brand he has a four-year deal with. Both he and Kim, 27, wore matching navy Hunter wellies but she held on to the dogs' leads. The pet portrait artist pulled her hair into a loose bun but protected her ears with a grey headband. A burgundy, grey and black scarf was knotted around her neck but she kept her navy jacket, worn over a loose grey top, open. She wore snug claret-coloured trousers and matching gloves for their walk before they climbed into a grey Land Rover and drove away. Andy Murray wrapped up warn in clothing by his sponsor Under Armour while Kim held the dog leads . This is the first sighting of the pair since landing in Heathrow after Andy's four-set defeat in Melbourne . The walk will no doubt have done wonders for their jet lag after a 24-hour flight back from Australia, which is 11 hours ahead of the UK. Andy was in the country for two weeks competing for the Grand Slam title with Kim by his side. And while Andy's defeat at the final hurdle grabbed headlines, it was also an eventful tournament in Australia for his fiancee Kim Sears. During the semi-finals she whipped up a storm of controversy after she was seen swearing in an expletive-filled tirade at Czech player Tomas Berdych live on national television. Despite his defeat to Novak Djokovic, Andy seemed to be in good spirits, smiling and chatting on the walk . The couple wore matching navy Hunter wellies and Kim swept her blonde locks into a loose messy bun . But she revealed her self-deprecating sense of humour the following day when she wore a black T-shirt with the phrase, 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content'. Kim, Andy's partner of nine years, became an internet sensation with social media erupting with messages of approval. Nigel Sears, a coach and pundit, was asked about his daughter's expletive-filled tirade as she watched fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday. The 57-year-old joked: 'she's always had a potty mouth - gets it from her mother of course' before expressing his surprise that Miss Sears' 'feisty' support had created such a furore. Kim was in charge of the dogs as they strolled on the snow-covered grounds, leading the Border terriers . Ever gracious in defeat, Andy tweeted after the match, 'Ready to take off back 2 London.Thanks 2 everyone @ausopen for making it such a special event, well done on number 5 Novak incredible record.' Adding once he landed: 'Thanks to everyone who's been supporting me and believing in me after a tough year. I'll keep working hard to get better....Treat yourself.

"A Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate was advised 'not to be associated' with party leader Nick Clegg - and was warned to dodge a visit to his constituency by the Deputy Prime Minister last week. Maajid Nawaz, the Lib Dem candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn  was told that being seen with Mr Clegg would 'blunt the progress we are making' in the constituency. The email from Lib Dem campaigner James Newsome, who stood for the Lib Dems as a local councillor for Camden Council this year but failed to get elected, advised the prospective MP to 'let Nick do his own thing'. Liberal Democrat candidates have been advised not to be pictured with the leader Nick Clegg . The remarks from Mr Newsome, a city banker who has worked at Mr Nazaw's press officer, were made in an email he accidentally sent to his local paper, the Ham & High. In the email he raised concerns about a visit by the Deputy PM to the Tavistock Centre, an NHS-run mental health centre, which Mr Nawaz was also invited to last Friday. In the email from Mr Newsome to Mr Nawaz, he stated: 'M, I am on same page as I was when this visit first came up. We don't need to be there. 'In fact you being associated with the leadership right now blunts the progress we are making with these young volunteers and the crossover pledge momentum we are getting.' He added: 'You are a top 500 Briton in Debretts Guv, let's let Nick do his own thing, which is good in itself, right? J.' Mr Nawaz, 37, is a former member of the radical Islamist organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir - who was jailed for four years in Egypt in his mid-20s before being released and setting up anti-extremism think-tank Quilliam. He was recently named in Debrett's 500, a list of the UK's top 500 most influential people. Mr Nawaz, however, did not follow the advice from Mr Newsome and attended the visit with his party leader last Friday. Maajid Nawaz, the Lib Dem candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn was told that being seen with Mr Clegg would 'blunt the progress we are making' in the constituency . Local Benjamin Tailor, 43, said: 'Maajid is doing good things around here and people like and respect him. 'He needs to follow his own path, but he also needs to stick by his leader - whether or not he is good for his image or not.' Another local, who asked not to be named, however, said Mr Nawaz should 'stay away from toxic Clegg', adding: 'Nick Clegg has abandoned all that I thought the Lib Dems stood for since going into coalition with the Tories. 'He has backtracked and U-turned so many times it's a wonder he knows which direction he is facing - he is toxic and can only hurt Maajid's chances of being elected.' A Lib Dem spokesman, asked to comment on the email, said this week: 'Maajid joined Nick on his visit to the Tavistock, he has been at Nick's side in the past and will be in the future as he fights to win Hampstead and Kilburn.'","Maajid Nawaz told being seen with Clegg will 'blunt progress we're making'

"For Royal Marine Andy Grant an operation to amputate part of his leg after he stepped on a bomb in Aghanistan had a surprising consequence. The Liverpool fan from Plymouth in Devon woke up to be told by his doctor that while the operation to remove his leg below the knee had gone well, his tattoo in tribute to the football club had suffered. Instead of reading 'You'll Never Walk Alone', the father-of-three discovered it now had the word 'Alone' missing after a flap of his skin had to be moved. Scroll down for video . Former Royal Marine Andy Grant had his leg amputated after he stood on an IED in Afghanistan and doctors had to move a flap of his skin to cover the bone, changing his Liverpool tattoo to read 'You'll Never Walk' But rather than let the amputation hamper him, Mr Grant said he was inspired by the 'You'll Never Walk' tattoo to become a medal-winning runner and plans to compete in the paralympic games. He also uses the anecdote in motivational speeches. 'It is ironic that it says I will never walk as I have gone on to run 10k in 40 mins,' said the 26-year-old. 'At the moment I am just two minutes off a record for the 10k for a single leg amputee and I have that in my sights. 'It is bizarre and I just laugh about it. But it adds to my story I guess. 'The fact is that regardless of what the words says, the operation allowed me to walk and run and do so much else. You have got to see the funny side of it.' As well as completing several runs Mr Grant won gold medals at the Invictus Games and has abseiled down the shard. Mr Grant (right) recalls the conversation with his surgeon Commander Anthony Lambert (left) after the operation when he told the former Royal Marine that his tattoo had been changed following the amputation . The tattoo, originally reading 'You'll Never Walk Alone' now reads 'You'll Never Walk', which the father of three said he finds funny and has used to inspire him to try and complete record-breaking runs . Mr Grant had the operation four years ago and endured vigorous rehabilitation sessions for 18 months. In 2009 he was serving with 45 Commando when he accidentally stepped on an IED. This severed his femoral artery and took out a 'big chunk' of his thigh. He broke both the fibula and tibia in his right leg and lost 6cm of bone. But two years after he decided to have his right leg amputated after watching comrades with similar injuries enjoying activities with their prosthetic legs. He can still recall the conversation he had with surgeon Anthony Lambert when he woke up. Mr Grant suffered was a 20-year-old commando in Afghanistan when he stepped on the IED . The blast severed Mr Grant's femoral artery, took out a section of his thigh and broke bones in his lower leg . Mr Lambert told him: 'Well, we had to raise a flap of skin on your leg to cover the bone ends... and it's meant that your Liverpool Football Club tattoos are a bit messed up. 'The Liver bird is a bit all over the place, and your tattoo now says ""you'll never walk.""' The date of his blast, February 3, and the date of his amputation, November 25, are both anniversaries that Andy marks. He said: 'I am very proud of my achievements and like to turn my story around to try and inspire other people about what they can achieve in the face of adversity. Mr Grant had the amputation in 2010 and now competes in 10k races and does motivational speaking . The former Royal Marine is a Liverpool fan and is pictured with one of his idols, Robbie Fowler (right) The Liverpool motto 'You'll Never Walk Alone' appears on the gates at Liverpool's ground at Anfield . 'I am all about looking forward. I cannot undo what happened and I have no regrets. I am all about making the best of a bad situation.' Mr Lambert now works as an inspirational speaker, going to events around the world. He has also determined to keep up his fitness. He added: 'I have three children and an amazing family, I'm looking to row across the Atlantic, and I'm hoping to be picked for the Paralympics next year. 'My life has moved on in an amazing way and it's all down to what happened. 'It's given me more of a life than I probably would have had.'","Andy Grant was a Royal Marine on patrol in Sangin in Afghanistan in 2009 .

"They may be one of the ugliest animals on the planet, but naked mole rats may hold the key to finding new ways to protect people from developing cancer. Scientists have discovered a new protein that appears to be responsible for giving the hairless subterranean rodents their remarkable resistance against cancer. The short-sighted creatures, which are more closely related to porcupines than rats, have never been seen to develop cancer despite living for up to 32 years. Naked mole rats, like the one above, can live underground for up to 32 years but never develop cancers . Researchers have found that the creatures have a cluster of genes that produce four proteins responsible for preventing damaged cells that might cause cancer from multiplying and so prevent tumours from growing. With wrinkly skin and walrus like teeth, naked mole rats are never going to win any beauty contests. Yet these creatures, which live underground in the deserts of east Africa, are one the medical marvels of the natural world. If a human was to have the same lifespan as a naked mole rat, relative to its size, they would live for up to 600 years. As well as being resistant to cancer, they have very low respiratory and metabolic rates, meaning they use oxygen sparingly. Scientists have put considerable effort into sequencing the creatures' genome in an attempt to understand its secrets. The machinery that translates their DNA into the functioning molecules in the cells, proteins, have also been found to be highly accurate. This means their proteins contain few errors compared to other mammals, and meaning their is less chance of something malfunctioning. Humans and mice, which both develop cancers, are known to have the same cluster of genes, but they produce just three proteins from it. The scientists found the fourth protein in mole rats is formed by the fusion of two of the other proteins to form a 'super protein' that is much better at stopping cancer from forming. The researchers hope it may now be possible to use this newly discovered protein to develop new treatments that can help stop cancers from spreading or even developing in the first place. Professor Vera Gorbunova, a biologist who helped to lead the study at the University of Rochester, in New York, said: 'While our work doesn't eliminate the possibility that the protein exists under some conditions in mice and humans, the results suggest that it's highly unlikely. 'The better we understand that gene and control its mutations, the better our chances of controlling some cancers.' Naked mole rats are one of only two species of mammal that are known to live in social colonies in the service of a single breeding queen. The creatures are the only mammal unable to regulate their own body temperature but also do not feel pain from acid or chilli peppers. The animals are also remarkably long lived compared to other rodents - mice have a lifespan of just a few years, for example. Tumors form when cells malfunction leading to uncontrolled growth, like in the colon cancer cells above . Naked mole rats spend their entire lives below ground and live in social colonies with a breeding 'queen' Prevoiusly scientists found that a molecule that endows the naked mole rate with its spingy wrinkled skin also plays a role in preventing the spread of tumours. A sugar called hyaluronic acid oozes from cells in the creature's connective tissue and forms cages around the cells to prevent them from replicating unchecked, as happens in tumours. Professor Gorbunova and her colleague Professor Andrei Seluanov have in the past found that this sugar activates the cluster of anti-cancer genes called INK4. It is this cluster that they have now studied in more detail in their latest work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and found that it produces three proteins also found in humans - p16INK4a, p15INK4b and ARF. However, in naked mole rats a fourth protein forms that is a hybrid of two of the others that they have called pALTINK4a/b. Naked mole rats like the one above are unusual creatures and do not feel pain from acid or chilli peppers . Professor Gorbunova said: 'We believe it may contribute to the longevity of the naked mole rat, including its ability to prevent tumours from developing.' The researchers found that the new hybrid protein appears to increase when cells become crowded together when hyaluronic acid is present, making naked mole rats more likely to arrest the growth of cells if they are at risk of becoming malignant. They also found that the hybrid protein also has the potential to prevent the uncontrolled cell growth in human cells too. The scientists hope that it may be possible to use this protein to develop new types of drugs that can be used to control the growth of cancers in patients. Professor Seluanov said: 'INK4 is the most commonly mutated gene locus in the human cancer. 'When that gene is deleted or silenced, it often results in the formation of tumors. 'Understanding the regulation of the INK4 locus is critical for cancer and aging research.'","The discovery was made by scientists at the University of Rochester in NY .

"When I was in Rotherham recently talking to victims of sex abuse, I heard a terrifying story. If it is to be believed — and after the events of this week it seems increasingly credible — it speaks volumes about how corruption and cover-up in the town reached right to the heart of the council. I was told that a girl in her late teens was at home one evening when the door-bell rang. It was in the run-up to the local elections last year, and people were canvassing for votes. She opened the door of her family’s house — and found herself staring into the face of a man she recognised. He had been part of a gang who had sexually abused her time and again when she was a child, between the ages of 12 and 14. Scroll down for video . New report says Rotherham council and many of its staff remain in denial over the sex abuse scandal . He was also, as the girl discovered that night, involved in local politics. She screamed with horror, slammed the door and ran upstairs, leaving him on the step. ‘I thought he had come to find me and that the rapes would start all over again,’ she later told her friends. This girl, and hundreds of others like her, were not believed or listened to when they related accounts of sex abuse to authorities in the town at the centre of one of Britain’s biggest-ever child exploitation scandals. Now, with every passing month, the stench of a cover-up grows stronger. Files from an independent youth group which counselled the victims — because no one else in officialdom seemed to care — were taken away by Rotherham Council staff, then they mysteriously disappeared and the organisation was shut down. In another incident, a council worker writing a report for the Home Office on how to stop grooming gangs in the area had her documents stolen from a locked office. Even today, 17 years after the start of the shameful scandal which led to so many girls being abducted, beaten, threatened and forced to witness other rapes, a new report says that Rotherham Council and many of its employees remain in denial over the abuse. Louise Casey (pictured) was asked to inspect Rotherham Council after the child abuse scandal emerged last year and said it is 'not fit for purpose' Yet the truth, however, uncomfortable, is irrefut-able. When I took an early victim of the sex abuse gangs into Rotherham town centre one night last year, she was able within a few minutes to point out by name men who had systematically raped her as a 13-year-old schoolgirl. They were free, on the streets, driving their flashy cars around, and — as the girl told me — almost certainly still picking up young girls to abuse. The young woman herself is now a counsellor to abused girls. She claimed she knew some young mothers in Rotherham who have five illegitimate children apiece. They are the product of rapes by the gang members who groomed, attacked and pimped them with total impunity. ‘These children are going to school now. Everyone knows where they came from,’ she told me. ‘As for their abused mothers, they will have thought that gang rape was just a normal part of growing up here.’ I first warned in the Mail five years ago of young girls being traded in provincial towns as sex slaves. I was accused by social workers, police, councillors and even faith organisations of making it up. In fact, I had learned the truth from parents who rang or emailed me in desperation, saying that no one was heeding their warnings. Later, I heard it from the girls themselves. Yet when I wrote about the scandal, I was branded racist. The reason? I dared mention the truth: that most of the victims were white or of mixed race, while all too often the perpetrators were of British-Pakistani heritage. Vindication came in a major report last year by Professor Alexis Jay, who confirmed that the greatest number of abusers were from this community. Of course the vast, decent majority of Muslims must, surely, be as disgusted as the rest of us at the abuse. But this racial element remains an uncomfortable aspect of these obnoxious crimes, which was confirmed again yesterday. And so we reach the crux of the problem. I believe the crimes were not tackled — and, indeed, were covered up in Rotherham — because the racial make-up of the sex gangs made the whole issue taboo for politically correct politicians, social workers and police. In modern Britain — so ultra-sensitive on matters of race — the authorities were terrified of being accused of racism if they targeted the culprits. Rotherham Borough Council (pictured) faces new elections and new management after the latest damning report over the town's child abuse scandal . Time and again, the authorities which should have been protecting the girls blamed them for being out of control, wilful youngsters who consented to sex with men old enough, in some cases, to be their fathers in exchange for a ‘good time’ — alcohol, free food and a ride around in a flash car. Lies were leaked to the media: that the girls were from dysfunctional families, had been put into care to protect them, and could not be persuaded by social workers or police to stop their wild sexual behaviour. This was far from the reality. Virtually all of the victims of child grooming I’ve interviewed — whether it be in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford or Derby, all places where these predators have operated — are from caring families. It has taken nearly two decades for the truth to emerge, but only now are we discovering the chilling extent of the abuse, and the level of cover-up.","Sue Reid warned of girls being traded as sex slaves in provincial towns .

"A tiny amusement park in Texas is bringing back a very special ride from yesteryear. ZDT's Amusement Park, located in Seguin, is building the Famous Switchback Railway, a wooden shuttle coaster that will be the first of its kind in over a century and is set to open this summer. The ride will feature a 63-foot-tall lift hill that drops riders at 45 mph into a pair of airtime hills, a 104-degree overbanked turn and another pair of airtime hills, even weaving through an old warehouse at one point. Then, like other shuttle coasters, the riders will repeat the same route backwards. ZDT's Amusement Park (above) in Texas is set to open the first shuttle coaster in a centurt .

"Travellers  who fought to stop new caravans moving onto their site because it would be too crowded have lost their 'not in my back yard' battle. Councillors voted unanimously to add the new pitches near Port Talbot, south Wales - saying they have housing targets and travellers should be treated like everyone else. A handful of residents on the Caegarw Gipsy and Traveller Site formed an angry petition last year after  council chiefs won funds from the Welsh Government to expand their camp. Not in our back yard: Residents of this traveller site near Port Talbot, south Wales, wanted to block plans to add 11 caravan pitches to their camp - but they were overruled unanimously by local councillors . The plans included 11 new caravan pitches, two new play areas and toilet blocks along the length of a new road. One resident told MailOnline at the time: 'Most people here are happy with the way things are and don't want this changed. 'This site is already overcrowded and expanding it will only attract more people, it's like an advertisement. 'If it goes ahead people will be heading for Port Talbot and setting up in the first car park they come to. That's what I'll be doing. 'We have lived here since it opened 30 years ago, a lot of people have, but this will drive them back to their old way of life. Expansion: The plans will add 11 pitches, toilet blocks and two play areas to the 2.5-acre rural site . 'If this expansion happens there will be overcrowding at local schools and at the doctors. It's disgraceful. 'The council would be better off saving its money. We are happy with things the way they are.' Labour councillor Rob Jones, who was approached by the residents, said 'ten to 12' residents had signed a petition which was handed to Neath Port Talbot council. Labour councillor Rob Jones: 'The gipsy community is being treated no differently to anyone else' But none wrote formal letters of complaint or turned up to the planning committee meeting which ruled in favour on Tuesday. There councillors decided unanimously to expand the rural 2.5-acre site near the village of Pyle despite the travellers' complaints. Mr Jones told MailOnline: 'I think it's going to enhance the site and at the end of the day we're catering for the gipsy and traveller community. 'When it comes to brick and mortar houses we have to deliver 6,500 to 7,000 in the next few years. 'The gipsy community is being treated no differently to any other section of the community. 'I welcome the planning committee's decision.' Previously Mr Jones had confirmed he was approached by angry residents. 'They don't want an expansion on the site,' he said. 'They started a petition within their community to prevent the council from going ahead. 'If you live in a lovely, countryside area, in a close-knit community, would you want strangers coming in?' Families at the Cae Garw camp previously said there was a divide over the council plans between those who had been there for decades and newcomers. Jeffrey Jones, a long term resident at the site, said: 'It's not a question of the people, it's the space. 'How would these councillors suddenly like a lot of houses built opposite where they live? Nobody wants that.' Rural location: The site is on the edge of the south Wales village of Pyle. Jeffrey Jones, a long term resident of the site, said previously: 'It's not a question of the people, it's the space... Nobody wants that' But mother-of-seven Lucy Price, 30, originally from Ireland, welcomed the expansion plans. She said: 'I know some people here are against this but they tend to be the older generation. 'People here with families support the expansion. The children would like to see a park built as well. 'I think more people should be able to come here if they want. There are more people for this than against.' Gareth Nutt, director of environment at Neath Port Talbot Council, said there was a need for additional pitches up to 2026. Councillor Suzanne Paddison said: 'It is pleasing to see that our council is providing adequate spaces for these communities.'","Travellers complained 21-caravan site in south Wales was too crowded .

"A devoted husband has built what could well be Britain's smallest chapel in his back garden for his wife who only realised it wasn't a shed when he installed the stained glass windows. Jon Richards, 69, told his wife Muriel, 68, that he needed a proper shed in their garden in Studley, Warwickshire, with enough space to practise his wood work. However, he was actually building a  private chapel complete with stained glass windows, antique pews and prayer books.

The couple now hold regular services at the miniature chapel, which seats just 12 worshippers and could be Britain's smallest.

Mr Richards spent two and a half years perfecting the Chapel of the Crosses - which measures just 12ft by 8ft . Mr Richards spent two and a half years perfecting the Chapel of the Crosses - which measures just 12ft by 8ft and did not need planning permission - in his back garden, pretending it was to be a shed with 'space for a radio'. Instead he was building a replica of their parish place of worship, the Church of Holy Ascension in Mappleborough Green. 'It was a gift for my wife - I wanted somewhere sacred and special for her,' he said. Once the building work was complete, the couple toured the country's reclamation yards and scrap dealers to source original artefacts for their own private holy place. The couple have travelled around the country to find artefacts to fill their chapel, including this bronze statue of Jesus (left) and a stone font (right) - which is too large to fit inside . The visitors' book at the chapel, which now hosts regular church services throughout the year . This tapestry depicting the Last Supper was discovered by the couple at a market in Spain . 'As the project progressed, we started travelling around the country to reclamation yards to find appropriate pieces,' said Mr Richards. 'Finding all the ornaments was the hardest bit. 'Everything in the chapel was previously used in a church and that’s what makes it special.' The centrepiece of the altar is bronze statue of Jesus they purchased at a reclamation yard in Bristol. 'We discovered the bronze centrepiece at a reclamation yard in Bristol,' said Mr Richards. The chapel is named after a ceremony which takes place in the village every Easter, when three crosses are placed on the hill where the couple live . Mr Richards says filling the chapel with artefacts was the most difficult part of his task . 'Never realising the price of solid bronze, we were shocked that he wanted so much for it and so we left it there thinking we’d be able to find something else for the altar. 'But in all our travelling around we never found anything that was suited and so we went back to the dealer in Bristol. 'When we told him what we were doing he was so touched that he knocked lots off the price. 'He said that a small chapel was where a statue of Christ deserved to be.' The couple also rescued full-length pews from a church in Leominster which was having a refurbishment, but had to cut them down to just 3ft by 6ft so they fitted into the tiny building - seating two worshippers apiece. A Last Supper tapestry, discovered at a market in Northern Spain, hangs on the wall, but the stone font has had to go outside as it is too big to fit. The couple also rescued full-length pews from a church in Leominster which was having a refurbishment, but had to cut them down to just 3ft by 6ft . Space was also an issue when it came to a church organ. Mr Richards had considered a scaled down instrument, but decided against it as it would have cut the capacity of the chapel by two. Instead built-in speakers play hymns from a CD player operated by Mrs Richards at the back of the church. Mr Richards, who owns a number of holiday cottages, says he has no idea about the exact total cost of the project, but believes he has spent no more than £10,000 on his miniature place of worship. However, he admitted that he probably would not have started the building work if he had known how much it would come to.

Once the chapel was completed, Mr Richards invited  local clergyman, the Reverend Andy Shearn to see the finished product. He was overwhelmed when Rev Shearn suggested they hold occasional services there, and the vicar now hosts a mid-week service in the chapel four or five times a year, as well as Christmas and Easter services. 'People are sometimes overwhelmed by their reaction when they enter,' said Mr Richards, who described his chapel as 'the most calming place'. 'At Easter there is a procession though the village and we place three crosses on the hill where we live - that’s why we named it the Chapel of the Crosses.'

"Wonga will not be prosecuted despite sending bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments, police said today. The payday lender was ordered last year to pay more than £2.6million in compensation to people who received the bogus demands. But City of London Police said today that, after a 'thorough review', it has concluded 'there is not sufficient evidence to progress a criminal investigation'. Consumer groups and politicians believed there was clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should have pursued them through the courts. Decision: Wonga will not be prosecuted despite sending bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten customers who were behind on repayments, police said today . Shadow consumer affairs minister Stella Creasy said she was 'very surprised' at the decision while the Law Society, which represents around 160,000 solicitors across England and Wales, had demanded the police investigation. Ms Creasy said: 'The Financial Conduct Authority seems to have enough evidence to make Wonga pay compensation to customers for scaring them like this - why don't the police?' The MP believes it is an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 Solicitors Act while it could also be and act of fraud. While the company presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with its friendly TV ad puppets, an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority last year found extensive evidence of 'thuggish' behaviour. Critic: Shadow consumer affairs minister Stella Creasy said she was 'very surprised' at the decision and believes what Wonga did was illegal . Among Wonga's victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage. The FCA said Wonga sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared to be two law firms, called 'Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon' and 'Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries' – but these two companies were invented by Wonga to put pressure on customers. In some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters. Last June, Wonga agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to pay £2.6 million in compensation for the letters it sent to 45,000 consumers from non-existent law firms. But thousands of people who are in line for a payout are yet to receive their compensation offer from Wonga. Around three-quarters of the 45,000 people impacted have received their compensation offers so far, and the company expects that the remaining quarter will have received their offers by April this year. A Wonga spokesman said: 'Our focus remains on putting things right for customers affected by this historic issue.' Wonga is Britain's biggest payday lender, with more than one million active customers. After the compensation announcement was made last summer, the City of London Police confirmed that it would reassess whether Wonga should be subject to a criminal investigation. Police had discussed the case a year earlier but it was decided that the matter should be left to regulators so that compensation payouts would not be delayed. The statement issued by the police today said: 'The central allegations were that Wonga had deceived its customers by sending letters falsely purporting to be from lawyers with the aim of recovering outstanding debts from customers. 'After a thorough review of all the material gathered, the City of London Police has concluded there is not sufficient evidence to progress a criminal investigation.' The case, which was described by consumer campaigners as a 'shocking new low' for the payday industry, saw Wonga add charges to some customers' accounts to cover administration fees for sending the letters. Scam: London-based Wonga, pictured, sent letters from two companies invented to put pressure on customers. Further legal action was threatened if the debt was not repaid. These firms did not exist and Wonga was using this tactic to pile the pressure on customers to pay up, the FCA said. The FCA could not impose a fine on Wonga for what it described as 'unfair and misleading' debt collection practices, which happened between October 2008 and November 2010, because the failings were uncovered by a previous regulatory regime and it does not have powers to issue retrospective penalties. Wonga has previously apologised 'unreservedly' and has said all 45,000 customers who received correspondence from the fake law firms would be pro-actively contacted and offered a flat rate of £50 for distress and inconvenience and admin fees charged for the fake letters would also be refunded. Additional compensation payments may also be made, depending on individual circumstances. Scandal: The money lender, founded by Errol Damelin, has still not paid all its compensation . Appearing before the Treasury Committee last November, Wonga's chief credit officer Nick Brookes set out the difficulties Wonga had had in trying to contact customers due for compensation, saying: 'We've had to go back a substantial way in terms of firstly the identification of those customers and then the contact with those customers.' Wonga has previously said that the 'few' people who were directly involved with sending the letters are no longer in the business. Law Society chief executive Desmond Hudson said last year: 'It seems that the intention behind Wonga's dishonest activity was to make customers believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a genuine law firm.' Wonga has undergone significant changes as a company in recent months and has said that it expects to be smaller and less profitable in the near term. Last July it brought in the former chief executive of the RSA insurance group, Andy Haste, to head the group, replacing founder Errol Damelin who had left earlier in the year. Wonga has recently tightened up its lending procedures, as well as removing its adverts featuring elderly puppet characters from British TV screens. The payday lending industry generally has been subject to a huge clampdown after coming under the FCA's regulation last April. Firms have only been granted interim permission to operate under the FCA's toughened regime and they will have to apply for full permission to continue operating. Wonga is due to apply for full authorisation later in the year. Payday lenders are now no longer allowed to roll over a loan more than twice and and they can make only two unsuccessful attempts to claw money back out of a borrower's account. Last month, the rules across the industry were tightened further, with a cap being placed on the overall cost of a payday loan as part of moves to stop such debts spiralling out of control.","Payday lender was ordered to pay £2.6m after 45,000 bogus legal letters .

"A U.S. district court has fined TV host Ryan Seacrest's Typo Products  for violating an injunction barring it from selling a $99 iPhone case found to have likely infringed on BlackBerry patents. U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco ordered Typo on Wednesday to pay BlackBerry $860,600 (£567,303) in sanctions, plus attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with Typo's violation of the injunction. BlackBerry had filed a suit in January 2014 against Typo, co-founded by 'American Idol' host Seacrest, alleging that the physical keyboard it makes for some of Apple's iPhone devices infringed on the Canadian smartphone maker's design patents. Scroll down for video . The Typo Keyboard, pictured, costs $99 (£60) and is due to launch in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas for the iPhone 5 and 5S. Other phone and tablet versions will then follow later next year . Although the keyboard slides onto the bottom of the phone, it actually connects to the software via Bluetooth. When a user wants to write a message, . email or Facebook post, for example, they can type on the physical . keyboard and the key strokes will be sent wirelessly to the phone in . real-time. The case adds a quarter of an inch thickness to the bottom of the Apple handset, and around an inch to the length. In March, the court issued a preliminary injunction that barred Typo from selling the physical keyboard iPhone case. A spokeswoman for Typo in an email said that the ongoing litigation and fine relates to the initial Typo product and does not impact its since redesigned keyboard product. 'It has no impact on the Typo 2 product currently in the marketplace, or our other planned product releases for the tablet,' the company said in an email, declining to comment any further on the matter. BlackBerry, which had asked the court to fine Typo $2.64 million for violating the injunction, declined to comment on the matter, stating merely that the court order speaks for itself. The court, in an order issued on Wednesday, said that Typo had sold nearly 19,000 of the keyboards after the preliminary injunction had been issued. Typo argued that BlackBerry has not shown that it has lost any sales as a result of Typo's conduct and that a fine would constitute an undeserved windfall for BlackBerry. The judge agreed it was unclear to what extent BlackBerry had been damaged, but added that 'Typo's not so clever attempts to evade the court's preliminary injunction' were quite transparent. 'The amount of sanctions awarded is only a third of what BlackBerry sought and is directly tied to additional revenue that Typo could have expected from its illegal conduct,' said judge Orrick, in the order. Seacrest is said to have invested $1million in the phone keyboard, and he is shown as a co-founder on the Type Products company website.

The gadget is set to launch at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. The . company added: 'For several years, many of our friends carried two . phones: one for typing and correspondence and an iPhone for virtually . everything else.

"A giant crocodile appeared to have bitten off more than it could chew when it clamped its jaws around the trunk of an elephant. These incredible photographs captured the moment the four meter reptile was lifted almost clear out of the water as the panicked bull elephant attempted to free himself from its jaws. The large mammal had been enjoying an afternoon bath with the rest of the herd at a watering hole in the Sabi Sands game reserve in South Africa. That's got to hurt! A crocodile is almost lifted clean out of the water after it clamps its jaws round a bull elephant's trunk . But as it tried to leave the water, an enormous crocodile latched onto the animal's trunk with its sharp jaws. Tourists saw the terrified elephant rear up on its hind legs and trumpet loudly in fear and pain as it tried to free its trunk. The hungry crocodile was even dragged out of the water and into the air as the two animals tussled but it stubbornly refused to let go. Eventually the bull struck the reptile with his knee and stabbed with his tusks to escape its jaws before making a very quick get away. The elephant had been walking back up the bank after an afternoon swim at the watering hole when the enormous crocodile latched on . Panicking, the elephant tries to pull his trunk out of its jaws but the crocodile refuses to let go at Sabi Sands Game Reserve, in South Africa . Ashley Lewis, a 31-year-old fitness marketer, from Michigan US, caught the fierce fight on camera during a trip to the game reserve in December. Ashley said: 'We had been sitting in our truck on the river bank. Suddenly, about 300 yards upstream we heard loud and frantic trumpeting from an older bull elephant. 'It was initially hard to make out why, but when he arched his trunk and reared up on his hind legs, it quickly became clear that a crocodile had latched on to his trunk. 'The elephant reared up and down, taking the croc with him as if he was waving around a toy. 'Eventually, when the croc wouldn't loosen his grip, the elephant slammed him on the ground and put his knee, and the full weight of his body, on to the croc and then jabbed it with his tusks. Trumpeting in pain and fear, the bull elephant yanks back it's trunk and the four-metre crocodile comes with it . Eventually, the elephant is able to free himself and makes a quick getaway trampling over the crocodile which also survived . 'This finally got the croc to relent and the elephant ran up the hill of the bank faster than I thought possible for an animal that big. 'I was in awe. It was hard to say anything other than this is insane. 'I've never seen anything like it, and it appeared that neither had our guide, tracker or any of the staff and Lion Sands - it was pretty unique. 'I remember our guide yelling, 'cameras! cameras!' as if this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, he was not wrong.' Although the elephant sustained injuries to his trunk, rangers expect him to make a full recovery. The crocodile may have suffered more serious wounds.","Elephant had gone for a swim in Sabi Sands Game Reserve, South Africa .

"Google has been hiring Arabic speakers to help crack down on jihadi groups using its YouTube video platform to radicalise recruits. The web search giant has been recruiting moderators around the globe to help prevent YouTube from being hi-jacked for propaganda by militants. The search giant will not disclose the number of new staff, but sources said it now has Arabic speakers in every time zone to deal with the problem. Google has been hiring Arabic speakers to help crack down on jihadi groups using its YouTube video platform to radicalise recruits . The 22-minute film of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burned alive was first uploaded to YouTube, where it remained for a number of hours before moderators removed it. However, by that time, images were already being circulated on Twitter. Jonathan Russell, of Quilliam, a counter-extremism think-tank, said the tactic has had a major effect in helping Islamic State to radicalise new followers. Hen said: 'They want to show that they're sticking it to the man, that they're fighting the West, and that they are willing to use violence. They want to show that they're not scared and that people are scared of them.' He added: 'People are flocking to IS because it is winning the branding war among jihadis. In every other sense [apart from violence], they act like a multinational corporation.' Mr Russell welcomed Google's decision to take action, saying that the American technology giant was among a number of major technology companies that had started taking more action against extremist content in the last six months. The 22-minute film of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh (pictured) being burned alive was first uploaded to YouTube, where it remained for a number of hours before moderators removed it . 'I really see a sea change,' he said. 'It is pretty young still. It hasn't been long enough to see a shift in results, but I am [gratified] that they are tackling it in the right way.' Guidelines ban YouTube users from uploading videos that 'incites others to commit violent acts', but it does not filter content before it goes online. Instead, the general public can flag up controversial content. The company has also handed special powers to users such as the Home Office, which reliably flag extremist content, making it easy for them to report hundreds of controversial videos at a time. Google's army of moderators then comb through the content and decide whether it is suitable for YouTube, whether it needs to be removed, or censored with a warning or age-barrier. It allows 'graphic violence' to remain on the site if it is deemed to have enough documentary value - for example as a news source - but it deletes the most extreme footage and bars any accounts run by terrorist groups. A spokesman said: 'YouTube has clear policies, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users.'","Sources say search giant now has Arabic speakers in every time zone .

"These are the chambers inside the 23,000-acre chemical plant that sprawls underneath to Coloradoan countryside. While green pastures lie above, these concrete bunkers are full to the brim with the largest stockpile of chemical weapons since the Second World War. And they are about to be destroyed. In a landmark move toward complying with a 1997 treaty banning chemical armory, the Pueblo Chemical Depot in southern Colorado plans to start neutralizing 2,600 tons of aging mustard agent in March. Scroll down for video . This Colorado bunker is filled with the largest stockpile of chemical weapons since the Second World War . The United States is about to begin destroying its largest remaining stockpile of chemical-laden artillery shells . 'The start of Pueblo is an enormous step forward to a world free of chemical weapons,' said Paul Walker, who has tracked chemical warfare for more than 20 years for the U.S. government. After nightmarish gas attacks in World War I, a 1925 treaty barred the use of chemical weapons, and the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention set a 2012 deadline to eradicate them. Four nations that acknowledged having chemical weapons have missed the deadline: the U.S., Russia, Libya and Iraq. Pueblo has about 780,000 shells containing mustard agent, which can maim or kill, blistering skin, scarring eyes and inflaming airways. Mustard agent, a thick liquid, is colorless and almost odorless but got its name because early versions smell like mustard. The plant can process up to 60 shells an hour, but the explosion chamber can destroy just six shells a day. Pueblo expects to finish the job in 2019 - more than 55 years after some of the shells there were produced. The Army will use two methods for the Pueblo stockpile. In March, the first of an estimated 1,400 shells that are leaking or otherwise damaged will be placed in a sealed steel chamber with walls up to 9 inches thick. Pueblo has about 780,000 shells containing mustard agent, which can maim or kill, blistering skin, scarring eyes and inflaming airways. Here, inert simulated 155mm chemical munitions are pictured . Four nations that have chemical weapons have missed the deadline: the U.S., Russia, Libya and Iraq . The plant can process up to 60 shells an hour, but the explosion chamber can destroy just six shells a day . Explosives will tear open the shells, and the mustard agent will be neutralized with chemicals. The remaining hundreds of thousands of shells will be run through a partially automated, $4.5 billion plant starting in December or January. It will dismantle the shells, neutralize the mustard agent in water, and then add bacteria to digest and convert the remaining chemicals. The end product can be disposed of at a hazardous waste dump. The work starts less than a year after chlorine gas killed 13 people in Syria in April 2014. International inspectors concluded last month that the gas had been used as a weapon. Before the chlorine attack, 1,400 people were killed in a 2013 nerve gas attack in Syria, the U.S. said. The cost of safely destroying the weapons, and concerns about public health and the environment, have slowed the process, experts say. Violence in Iraq also has been an obstacle. Pueblo expects to finish the job in 2019 - more than 55 years after some of the shells there were produced . In March, the first of a 1,400 shells that are leaking or damaged will be placed in a sealed steel chamber with 9in thick walls. Explosives will tear open the shells, and the mustard agent will be neutralized with chemicals . An ordinance technician uses a robot to to handle inert simulated chemical munitions used for training . Libya expects to finish in 2016 and Russia in 2020, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention. Iraq's completion date is unknown. The U.S. amassed 30,600 tons of chemical weapons, both mustard agent and deadly nerve agent, much of it during the Cold War. The Army described them as a deterrent, and the U.S. never used them in war. Nearly 90 percent of the U.S. stockpile has been eliminated at depots in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, Oregon, Utah and Johnson Atoll in the Pacific, mostly by incineration. Coloradans worried, however, about mercury vapor from incineration, said Irene Kornelly, a member of the Pueblo Citizens Advisory Commission, a liaison group established by Congress. The opposition in Colorado and in Kentucky, where chemical weapons are stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, prompted Congress to order alternatives. Officials who oversee the Pueblo operation insist it is safe, citing years of careful planning and training . Army Lt. Col. Mike Quinn declined to discuss the specifics of security at the 36-square-mile depot, but signs warn, 'Use of deadly force authorized.' Blue Grass won't start destroying weapons until 2016 or 2017, finishing in 2023, Army spokeswoman Kathy DeWeese said. All told, it's costing about $11 billion to destroy remaining U.S. chemical weapons. Blue Grass has 523 tons of chemical weapons, only about one-fifth as many as Pueblo, but it has nerve agent, and some of the mustard agent is so old it has solidified and is more difficult to deal with, DeWeese said. Officials who oversee the Pueblo operation insist it is safe, citing years of careful planning and training, as well as the remote location - an empty expanse of sagebrush some 15 miles from the city's outskirts. Army Lt. Col. Mike Quinn declined to discuss the specifics of security at the 36-square-mile depot, but signs warn, 'Use of deadly force authorized.' Kornelly said she has no remaining concerns, but she's not ready to celebrate. 'I think once we start seeing the weapons go through, there'll be a feeling of accomplishment,' she said. 'Right now, everyone's on pins and needles.'","Pueblo Chemical Depot in Colorado has largest chemical stock since WW2 .

"The Dawn spacecraft has returned yet another series of stunning animations of Ceres as its moves ever closer to the dwarf planet. At a resolution of 8.5 miles (14km) per pixel, the  pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world, which Dawn is due to arrive at on March 6. When it does, it will become the first human-made probe to visit the 'Death Star' planet - and scientists hope it will uncover the secrets behind its mysterious white spot. Scroll down for video . This animation, enhanced with a star field and projected onto a sphere, showcases a series of images the Dawn spacecraft took on approach to Ceres on February 4 . The dwarf planet has been likened to the death Star from the hit film Star Wars . The latest set of images - which are stitched together in an animation - were taken on February 4th at a distance of about 90,000 miles (145,000 km). 'We know so little about our vast solar system, but thanks to economical missions like Dawn, those mysteries are being solved,' said Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at Nasa. The new Dawn images come on the heels of initial navigation images taken in January that reveal an 'alien' white spot on the dwarf planet and the suggestion of craters. While Nasa has not provided an explanation, scientists suggest it may be a frozen pool of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflects light. We can confirm that it is something on Ceres that reflects more sunlight, but what that is remains a mystery,' Marc Rayman, mission director and chief engineer for the Dawn mission, told Space.com . Over the next weeks, Dawn will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world. 'We know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet Ceres. 'Now, Dawn is ready to change that,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. At 8.5 miles (14km) per pixel, the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world, which Dawn is due to arrive at on March 6 . At 43 pixels wide, these older images taken in January are more than 30 per cent higher in resolution than those taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope in 2003 and 2004 at a distance of over 150 million miles . The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtles its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . On the left is a processed image, taken January 13. It hints at craters on the surface of Ceres. Dawn's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles (383,000km) from Ceres. On the right, is a zoomed-in raw image . Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes. Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.' The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface .","The Ceres asteroid orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter, and may have water gushing from its surface .

"Speculation over a secret meeting of potential Liberal leadership hopefuls has led Malcolm Turnbull to live-tweet his train trip to the NSW Central Coast. 2GB talkback radio host Ben Fordham caused a stir on Thursday morning when he tweeted: 'Interesting fact: Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop have arranged to meet at his Sydney home today'. After one of Mr Turnbull's spokesmen denied the report to media including Daily Mail Australia, Fordham insisted the Communications Minister himself would not deny the allegation. So Mr Turnbull tweeted a picture of himself seated on a Sydney train, grinning. The message to Fordham: 'You need to improve (your) surveillance! Scroll down for video . Cheeky grin: Malcolm Turnbull tweeted this picture as evidence of his current location . Contenders? Mr Turnbull and Ms Bishop have been at the centre of leadership speculation in recent days, with Ms Bishop issuing a statement earlier this week saying she would not challenge the Prime Minister . 'I am on the train to Tuggerah. (Politics in the Pub) North Wyong tonight',' Mr Turnbull said. The Communications Minister followed up by insisting he was at a National Broadband Network meeting in North Sydney this morning, where he boarded the train. He then posted a series of images of his train crossing the Hawkesbury River, featuring mangroves and settlements along the riverside. The trip concluded with Mr Turnbull arriving at Tuggerah train station (and sharing a picture of the moment) before he emphatically insisted he has not and would not meet Ms Bishop today unless she came to the Dam Hotel, North Wyong, this evening. The spat provoked Ms Bishop to join the fray, insisting she was in Canberra this morning and a shopping centre in Penrith, greater western Sydney, with a local MP after that. 'I did not meet Malcolm Turnbull at his home - I even told you (the) Qantas flight I was on! So what's the point you're (not) making?' she wrote, even adding in her trademark emoji in a later post. Regardless, Mr Turnbull and Ms Bishop are set to cross paths this weekend, according to reports.

"Bobby Jindal took pot-shots at President Barack Obama – and at his own Republican party – on Thursday during a speech to a conservative family-valies group in Washington, D.C. In his remarks to the American Principles Project, the anti-abortion, anti-gay marraige Louisiana governor blasted his fellow GOPers, without naming them, for being 'cheaper Democrats.' Jindal is on a tear this year, castigating proponents of 'Common Core,' the Obama administration's plan to nationalize education standards and take control away from local governments. Some moderate Republicans, most notably former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have embraced the plan. Bush, now a 2016 front-runner, faces a difficult road ahead convincing social conservatives that he's right. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is road-testing a laundry list of rock-ribbed conservative positions in advance of deciding whether to run for president, but his passion is battling 'Common Core' federal education standards . 'DEMOCRAT-LITE': Jindal bashed moderate Republicans with swipes that seemed aimed at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush . 'Overreach of the federal government into every corner of our lives,' Jindal said Thursday to applause, also railing against the Obamacare insurance system and 'government elites.' 'I have more faith in the moms than I do in any collection of bureaucrats,' he said. 'They think they know better than you. They think you're not smart enough to educate your children.' He could ride the Common Core issue far into the 2016 primary season, hitting Bush over the head with it at every turn. But is he in the race? 'Look, we're thinking about it. We're taking a serious look at it,' Jindal told Daily Mail Online during a post-speech press conference in which Republicans and President Obama took turns as his punching bag. 'My wife and I are praying about it. We'll make that decision in the next couple of months.' If he ran, he said, his campaign 'would be about standing up to the left.' Jindal reserved harsher words for Republicans, baiting them in a way that seemed to forehadow the 2016 presidential primary race. American, he said, don't want 'for us to be cheaper, paler versions, weaker versions of the other party.' 'If all we are is cheaper Democrats, if all we are are Democrat-lite, we don't deserve to be the governing party. We don't deserve to win the election. We don't deserve to have a majority in the Congress or the White House.' 'If this election was all about getting bigger and better office space for John Boehner and for Senator Mitch McConnell, let's give the office space back,' he blasted. NO COMPROMISE: Jindal insists that Americans will vote for an 'authentic' conservative . 'GRAHAMNESTY': South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham would attract slings and arrows from Jindal if he entered the 2016 White House contest because of his Obama-esque views on immigration . Jindal drew lines of comparison between the Democratic Party and some Republicans who have softened their opposition to the Affordable Care Act over time. 'You need to repeal and replace the entire thing (but) that's not what many Republicans are saying here in Washington, D.C.' he said. 'They say, ""Oh ,no, there's a new baseline. That means that if we just replace some of the taxes, or some of the spending, that's progress"".' 'That's nonsense,' Jindal nearly barked in mid-crescendo. 'When they were campaigning, they talked about repealing and replacing all of Obamacare.' Jindal favors scrapping the system and replacing it with standardized income tax deductions that would permit Americans to spend money on whatever insurance plan they chose, and would possibly lower prices across the board by letting Americans buy policies issued in any of the 49 states where they don't live. Democrats have opposed those measures since the 1990s days of HillaryCare, am even more sweeping overhaul than Obamacare, which was proposed by then-first lady Hillary Clinton. OBAMASCARE: Jindal says Republicans who ran with promises that they would repeal the Affordable Care Act need to follow through, lest they become a 'second liberal party' 'I think we've had enough of on-the-job training with our current president,' Jindal said of Barack Obama . Jindal fears that the Affordable Care Act will calcify in place, and that the GOP will go along – virtually erasing the policy differences between Republicans and Democrats. 'We don't need two liberal parties,' he told Daily Mail Online during a Q&A.. 'We have $18 trillion of debt. We have Obamacare interfering with the relationships between patients and doctors. We've got a middle class suffering in his economy,' Jindal exclaimed. 'We need in the Republican party leaders who have the courage, the honesty to tell us the truth, to stand up to the left.' 'I think we've had enough of on-the-job training with our current president,' he said later. 'Let's elect someone who's actually balanced a budget and run a state government.' That's a massive hint that he has a bias toward governors, rather than members of the U.S. Senate, winning the White House. 'The advantage of having a governor is that they've got a track record,' Jindal said, analyzing Gov. Bush's chances next year. 'They've had to govern with results,' Jindal said. 'This president,' on the other hand, 'gave some good speeches, and that's all he's given.'","Louisiana governor says he's considering a run for president .

"Jordan has released a slickly-edited video that shows its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against Islamic State jihadists in Syria. The footage, understood to have been broadcast on state TV, shows troops messages on plane-mounted missiles before the fleet of fighter jets are launched from the base. The mission - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in memory of the pilot brutally killed by ISIS - is the latest show of force from the nation, which has promised a 'harsh' war against the terror group. It comes just hours after Jordanian fighter pilots made a diversion over the hometown of their murdered comrade, Moaz al-Kasasbeh, on their return from an air raid this morning. Dozens of jets bombed ISIS training centers and weapons storage sites in Syria and struck targets neighbouring Iraq for the first time - intensifying attacks against the militants. The assault came after Jordan's King Abdullah II visited the grieving Kasasbeh family in Aya village. Scroll down for videos . Airstrike: The slickly-edited video also contains aerial shots that appear to show Jordanian strikes on Islamic State targets. The Royal Jordanian Air Force launched strikes on Syria this morning . Preparation: A woman is seen writing a message in Arabic on a plane-mounted missile before the air assault . Take off: A plane belonging to the Royal Jordanian Air Force, above, is seen taking off in the latest video . Dozens of Jordanian fighter jets bombed ISIS training centers and weapons storage sites on Thursday. Above, aerial footage from the video released today appears to show a pilot seeking a target . It has now been two days ISIS released a horrific 22-minute long video showing the pilot being burnt alive while locked in a cage. The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and has sent waves of revulsion across the region. In response, Jordan executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS, including Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. The air strike video, released today on the YouTube channel of a national radio station, is the latest show of strength. It is understood to have been recorded at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base. The military's statement, read on state TV, was entitled, 'This is the beginning and you will get to know the Jordanians' - an apparent warning to ISIS. It said the strikes will continue 'until we eliminate them.' With its stirring soundtrack and complex editing, the video is similar in style to those released by ISIS, which have been striking in their professional use of camera and editing equipment. The clip shows uniformed people, believed to be members of the Jordanian military, writing messages in Arabic across plane-mounted missiles. One reads 'for you, the enemy of Islam'. Target: This footage is believed to show Jordanian forces bombing Islamic State sites in Syria today . The video also features a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants. The message is based on a passage in the Quran . Show of force: A fleet of Jordanian F-16 fighter jets are lined up at a base ahead of air strikes in Syria and Iraq . The video also features a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants. There are aerial shots that appear to show Jordanian forces bombing ISIS training centres and weapon storage sites in Syria. As part of the new campaign, Jordan is also attacking targets in Iraq, Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said. Until now, Jordan had only struck ISIS targets in Syria as part of a U.S.-led military coalition. 'We said we are going to take this all the way, we are going to go after them wherever they are and we're doing that,"" Judeh told Fox News. Asked if Jordan was now carrying out attacks in both countries, he said: 'That's right. Today more Syria than Iraq, but like I said it's an ongoing effort.' He added: 'They're in Iraq and they are in Syria and therefore you have to target them wherever they are.' The militant group controls about one-third of each Syria and Iraq, both neighbors of Jordan. The Jordanian military said dozens of fighter jets were involved in Thursday's strikes on training centers and weapons storage sites.

The tribute came as Jordan's King Abdullah II (centre) visited Moaz al-Kasasbeh's grieving family including his father, Saif (left) - in Aya village and one day after he vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against the militants . Tribe members of slain Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh receive mourners at the memorial tent set up for the murdered pilot in his home village of Aya near Karak in Jordan this morning . Looking for revenge: The Jordanian fighter jets carried out new air strikes a day after King Abdullah (left) vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against Islamic State militants who control parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq . Earlier today, war planes roared overhead as the King paid a condolence visit to the tribal family of the pilot in his village in southern Jordan. State television showed a sombre-looking King sitting alongside the army chief and senior officials while visiting  Aya, a village  60 miles south of the capital Amman. Thousands of Jordanians flocked to pay respects in traditional Arab Bedouin style in a part of the country where influential tribes form an important pillar of the Hashemite rule, supplying the army and security forces with its manpower. At one point the King pointed out the aircraft as he sat next to the victim's father, Saif al-Kasasbeh. 'You are a wise monarch. These criminals violated the rules of war in Islam and they have no humanity. Even humanity disowns them,' he told the King. The Jordanian fighter jets carried out new air strikes a day after King Abdullah vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against Islamic State militants who control parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq. The army statement did not say which country was targeted. Condolences: Local television showed the King (right) sitting alongside Moaz al-Kasasbeh's father Saif (left) Jordan's King Abdullah II embraces Fahed al-Kasasbeh, the uncle of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh . Brutal: This morning's show of force came two days after ISIS released a horrific 22-minute long video showing the pilot being burnt alive while locked in a cage . Distraught: The pilot's father surrounded by family members and security forces during a mourning ceremony in the city of Karak, Jordan, on Thursday . Uncompromising language: King Abdullah II has said Jordan's response 'will be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values' Activists carry pictures of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh in Amman earlier this week . Jordan is part of a U.S.-led military coalition that has bombed IS targets in both countries since the autumn, but until now Jordanian warplanes are only known to have carried out raids in Syria. King Abdullah II has said Jordan's response 'will be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. In Washington, leading members of Congress have called for increased U.S. military assistance to the kingdom. Currently, the United States provides Jordan with $1 billion a year in economic and military aid. Not true: False rumours spread online yesterday that King Abdullah II is preparing to personally take part in airstrikes against ISIS. The Royal Hashemite Court's official Facebook page later shared this image of the King wearing a pilot's uniform, which some mistakenly took to mean he had carried out an air raid . Clean cut: 26-year-old Moaz al-Kasasbeh is seen wearing his pilot's uniform before being captured by ISIS . Return home: King Abdullah of Jordan arrives as Jordanians stand along the way between Amman and Queen Alia airport waiting to greet him upon his arrival on Wednesday . The visit comes after a Jordanian government spokesman denied rumours that the King is preparing to personally take part in airstrikes against ISIS. In a statement Mohammed al-Momani branded said the reports that the King - who is a trained pilot - will soon conduct raids himself are unfounded and baseless. Rumours spread online yesterday that the King was considering a combat role in the war after he promised to fight back against ISIS, insisting Kasaesbeh's death 'will not be in vain'. The Royal Hashemite Court's official Facebook page later shared an image of the King wearing a pilot's uniform, which some mistakenly - including several Iraqi news outlets - took to mean he had carried out an air raid. Other social media users then starting sharing old photographs on the King sitting in a plane's cockpit, suggesting the images were taken on his return from a sortie to Syria. Before becoming king, Abdullah was a military general who headed the Jordanian special forces. He is also a fully qualified Cobra Helicopter pilot and in 1980 joined Sandhurst - the British Royal military academy also attended by Prince William and Prince Harry.

"A Miami-based designer and illustrator has reimagined major fashion campaigns by replacing the featured supermodels with real-life 'super women' - including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, actress and LGBT activist Laverne Coz and feminist icon Gloria Steinem. Elisa Rodríguez-Vila was inspired to edit these powerful women into popular fashion ads after seeing Celine's latest campaign starring 80-year-old literary icon Joan Didion. 'The crazy idea of casting women who don’t fit the supermodel mold - yet are super heroes in real life - is actually not that crazy at all,' she wrote in an essay for Fusion. 'Choosing these women wouldn’t be a risk, it would be a sure-fire hit.' Scroll down for video . Power couples: Miami-based designer and illustrator Elisa Rodríguez-Vila recreated major fashion campaigns by replacing the featured supermodels with real-life 'super women' - including Ruth Bader Ginsburg . Bright idea: Ms Rodríguez-Vila put Orange Is The New Black star and LGBT advocate Laverne Cox into this colorful Versace ad . Ms Rodríguez-Vila referred to the industry's repeated use of the same models and celebrities as 'a fashion Groundhog Day'. With that in mind, she took it upon herself to create her own 'dream castings', which included Mrs Bader Ginsburg for Chanel, Miss Cox for Versace and Ms Steinem for Chloé. She also envisioned writer Roxane Gay for Saint Laurent, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai for Louis Vuitton, Little League star Mo’Ne Davis for Céline and transgender rights activist Janet Mock for Calvin Klein. Perfect fit: Feminist icon Gloria Steinem exudes the iconic '70s-inspired beauty that Chloe is known for . Inpiring change: Ms Rodríguez-Vila paired Pakistani activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai with Louis Vuitton's iconic luggage . Bad feminist: Writer and blogger Roxane Gay was pictured modeling for Saint Laurent . 'I enjoy flipping through fashion magazines just as much as the next person, but I didn't fully realize how bored I had become with fashion ads until I saw the Joan Didion Celine ad,' she told HuffPost Style in an email. Ms Rodríguez-Vila added: 'This was a woman who was beautiful and stylish, but those characteristics were just footnotes to the amazing life she has led. It got me thinking how easy it would be to recreate that feeling with in fashion ads.' She explained that she has nothing against professional models, like Gisele Bundchen and Cara Delevingne, who dominate the industry, nor does she think they are 'completely void of intellect or live totally un-interesting lives'. Throw like a girl: Little League star Mo’Ne Davis is the perfect fit for Celine . Breaking boundaries: Ms Rodríguez-Vila thought transgender rights activist Janet Mock would make a beautiful underwear model . She said the project was simply about adding more diversity. 'Women who are older, or who don't fit into the traditional standards of beauty and gender can make amazing models, and shouldn't be excluded,' she said. But Ms Rodríguez-Vila's vision already seems to be catching on in 2015. Last month, New York-based jeweler Alexis Bittar paired 93-year-old interior designer and fashion icon Iris Apfel with 18-year-old Rookie magazine editor Tavi Gevinson for his label's new spring/summer 2015 campaign. And earlier this week, Mrs Apfel was revealed as the new face of Kate Spade's spring 2015 collection along with 22-year-old Karlie Kloss.

"Five babies under the age of one have been diagnosed with measles at a suburban Chicago daycare center. Health officials are investigating the outbreak at the KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine and have already warned there will be more cases. It is not yet known whether it has been linked to those infected at Disneyland or another case in the city last month. Scroll down for video . Outbreak: Five children under the age of one have been diagnosed with measles at the KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, suburban Chicago. Health officials warn there will be more cases . The Cook County health department confirmed a resident over the age of 18 had been diagnosed last month and identified three areas where others could have been exposed. Those infected at the center, which a spokesman says had been thoroughly cleaned, are too young to have received the MMR vaccine. Everyone affiliated with the day care has been notified and anyone not vaccinated for measles has been instructed to stay home and away from unvaccinated individuals for 21 days. Terry Mason, the chief operating officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, told the Chicago Tribune: 'There will be more cases. … We shouldn't be surprised about that. The cat is out of the bag.' Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a statement: 'These cases underscore the need for everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to ensure that they have been vaccinated. There are certain individuals who, because of their age or clinical condition, cannot be vaccinated.' One adult in Illinois was recently diagnosed with measles. The diagnoses for the adult and two of the babies have been confirmed through laboratory testing, health officials said. Precuations: A childcare worker helps a child off of a District 211 school bus outside of the daycare center. The school has told anyone who not vaccinated to keep them away for 21 days . Test results for the other three cases are still pending, but they have been diagnosed based on clinical and epidemiological criteria, officials said. On the advice of health officials, the KinderCare center is excluding until Feb. 24 unvaccinated children and staff who may have been exposed to the virus, according to a statement from Knowledge Universe, KinderCare's parent company. The center was given a 'deep clean' on Wednesday night, the statement said. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can be fatal in some cases. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have led a minority of parents to not have their children inoculated. Last year, the United States had 644 cases from 27 states, the most since 2000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Concern: Terry Mason, the chief operating officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, said: 'There will be more cases. … We shouldn't be surprised about that. The cat is out of the bag.'

"A Melbourne man's afternoon ended in the exact opposite way he hoped when an extravagant proposal to his girlfriend was turned down. Michael, who wished to be identified only by his first name, forked out thousands of dollars to have the worlds 'Maree Marry Me' with a love heart to next to it splashed across the bright blue midday sky on Thursday. But unfortunately Maree did not take him up on his offer. Michael proposed to Maree on Thursday in Melbourne with a message in the sky . The man's plight was originally aired when he called into Melbourne radio station 3AW, after a number of Melbournians took to social media posting photos of the heartfelt sky writing. Michael told Daily Mail Australia he and Maree had been in a relationship for eight years before they split nine months ago. 'We talked about it a few weeks earlier and I thought there's got to be something else I can do to show I care about her,' he said. 'I thought it would be a nice idea to see her name up in the sky and let her know how much she means,' Michael continued. A love heart accompanied the 'Maree Marry Me' message, but unfortunately Michael was turned down . He also revealed he had been planning the grand gesture since January, and had chosen the public declaration of love to try and win Maree back. 'The idea of it was I wanted to show her that, I didn't want a standard proposal,' Michael said. The timing had to be perfect in order to ensure that Maree was outside and able to see the message in the sky, but much to his dismay Michael's offer was turned down. 'She said no, and said she's moved on.' Despite being turned down, Michael is trying to remain positive: 'At least I know I've tried my best' Despite it costing him thousands of dollars, Michael was adamant the monetary value was irrelevant to him. 'For what the intention was for me it wasn't expensive, I would have paid anything', he said. And although he was turned down and the relationship between he and Maree is well and truly over, Michael remains positive.

"ISIS militants have executed six people, including two Muslim clerics, for condemning the horrific execution of the Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Al-Kasasbeh, a fighter pilot captured in Syria in December when his plane went down during a bombing mission, was burned alive and footage of his execution was released online. Two Imams where shot and four civilians were beheaded in Mosul, Iraq, the largest city controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria, local media reports. Horror: Two Imams and four civilians have been executed by ISIS militants in Mosul, Iraq, after critizising the brutal immolation of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh (pictured) 'ISIS executed the Imam of Nabi Yunis mosque, Sheikh Abdullah Fahad and the Imam of Kabir Mosque, Sheikh Ayub Abdul Wahab in Mosul,' a security source told Rudaw. The two Imams were executed by firing squad and the civilians were beheaded in public, the website reported. The crime they had committed were joining in the world-wide condemnation of the brutal immolation of the 26-year-old Jordanian on Tuesday. Yesterday, the head of Sunni Islam's top university called for the crucifixion of Islamic State militants as punishment for the murder/ . Ahmed al-Tayib, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar university in Cairo, said those responsible must face 'killing, crucifixion and chopping of the limbs.' Looking for revenge: King Abdullah of Jordan said, quoting Clint Eastwood, 'I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down' Gruesome: Moaz al-Kasasbeh stands inside the cage where he was burned to death, in a frame taken from the video circulated by Islamic State militants yesterday showing the killing of the Jordanian fighter pilot . Condemnation: Responding to Kasasbeh's murder, the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar university, pictured, in Cairo, Ahmed al-Tayib, said those responsible must face 'killing, crucifixion and chopping of the limbs' His judgement came as a Twitter account linked to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni branch of the terror group, denounced the killing as 'conclusive proof of Isis' deviance'. Muslim clerics widely condemned Kasasbeh's burning, saying such a form of killing was considered despicable by Islam, no matter the context . The 1,000-year-old Al-Azhar university, which is revered by Sunni Muslims around the world, issued a statement expressing 'deep anger over the lowly terrorist act' by what it called a 'Satanic' group. Grand Sheikh Tayib said the act 'requires the punishment mentioned in the Koran for these corrupt oppressors who fight against God and his prophet: killing, crucifixion or chopping of the limbs.' In Qatar, the International Association of Muslim Scholars, headed by prominent cleric Youssef al-Qaradawi and linked to the Muslim Brotherhood that has influence across the region, called the burning of Kasasbeh a criminal act. 'The Association asserts that this extremist organisation does not represent Islam in any way and its actions always harm Islam,' it said. Saudi cleric Salman al-Odah wrote on his Twitter account: 'Burning is an abominable crime rejected by Islamic law regardless of its causes.' 'It is rejected whether it falls on an individual or a group or a people. Only God tortures by fire,' he added. Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands . Clean cut: Jordanian officials have told the devastated family of the 26-year-old (pictured) that they believed the footage to be genuine and that the man branded a 'hero' in his homeland was dead . In reply, Islamic State posted its own religious edict on Twitter, which ruled that it is permissible in Islam to burn an infidel to death. However, senior clerics across the Islamic world argued that inflicting death by fire was always banned under Islam. 'The Prophet, peace be upon him, advised against burning people with fire,' Sheikh Hussein bin Shu'ayb, head of the religious affairs department in southern Yemen, told Reuters in Aden. Born as an offshoot of Al-Qaeda, Islamic State was cast out of the international terror network last year in response to its brutality. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's chief, last February issued a statement dissociating his group from Islamic State, which it accused of 'forbidden bloodshed' directed at fellow fighters. He said: 'We weren't informed about its creation, nor counselled. Nor are we satisfied with it: rather we ordered it to stop... Nor is al–Qaeda responsible for its actions and behaviour.' Islamic State is the successor of the al-Qaeda affiliate set up in Iraq in 2004 by Abu Musab Zarqawi to attack US occupation forces and Shia targets. Zarqawi was, in fact, reprimanded for his sectarian violence by Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri, who feared Muslim opinion would be alienated from al-Qaeda - advice that Zarqawi ignored. After Zarqawi was killed in 2006, his successor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, set up the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and continued his mentor's legacy of violence. It reemerged in 2011 as a jihadi fighting force in the civil war in Syria, now re-named as ISIS, and earned a reputation for its rampant and gruesome violence, including beheadings and amputations. Since then it has overrun vast swathes of both Iraq and Syria, massacring those it deems 'infidels' and controlling local Sunni populations with its brutal interpretation of Sharia law. And even Muslim leaders sympathetic to the jihadist cause said the act of burning a man alive and filming the killing would damage Islamic State, which controls swathes of Syria and Iraq. Abu Sayaf, a Jordanian Salafist cleric who spent almost ten years in Jordanian prisons for militant activity, including a plot to attack U.S. troops, said: 'This weakens the popularity of Islamic State because we look at Islam as a religion of mercy and tolerance. Even in the heat of battle, a prisoner of war is given good treatment.' 'Even if the Islamic State says Moaz had bombed and burned and killed us, and we punished him in the way he did to us, we say, OK but why film the video in this shocking way?' Sayaf said . 'This method has turned society against them.' SITE, a U.S.-based monitoring service, quoted Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Muhaysini, whom it described as a Saudi jihadi, as saying on Twitter it would have been better if Kasasbeh's captors had swapped him for 'Muslim captives'. The killing would make ordinary people sympathetic to Kasasbeh, he said. Of course, admirers of Islamic State cheered the killing. In a Twitter message, a user called Suhaib said: 'To any pilot participating in the crusader coalition against the holy warriors - know that your plane might fall in the next mission. Sleep well!' Many ordinary people across the Middle East expressed disgust. 'This a criminal, barbaric act which has no place in Islam or humanity. Islam bears no responsibility for them and their claim to be an Islamic State is ridiculous,' said Nawaf al-Dweik, 43, an engineer from Ramallah in the West Bank. 'There should be a joint Arab force to go in and destroy these killers and be rid of them once and for all,' he added. 'I have never heard of any group that claims to be Muslim and commits such atrocities,' said Shadi Abdel-Wahhab, a 22-year-old university student in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. The video circulated yesterday, titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows Kasasbeh in an orange jumpsuit doused in fuel, before militants set light to a trail of petrol leading up to the cage where he is held. Flames quickly engulf the helpless pilot - images that are far too distressing to publish. Extremists then pour debris, including broken masonry, over the cage, before it is flattened by a bulldozer.","Two Imams shot and four civilians beheaded in ISIS-controlled Mosul .

"Beth Kenneh always dreamed of being a writer so when her friend suggested reviewing sex toys for a website she jumped at the chance. The 32-year-old part-time carer, from Berkshire, got hooked on testing the products and started her own blog, where she now posts reviews for up to three toys a week. She even gets her friends asking her for sex and relationship advice, from what to wear on a naughty weekend to how to spice up their sex life. Scroll down for video . 32-year-old Beth Kenneh has been testing sex toys for just over two years and says her friends always come to her for advice on their sex lives . Beth said: 'Most of my friends think what I do is interesting. They ask how it works, if I get paid, if I get free toys. 'People then come to me for advice about their sex life. I get asked by my friends, as well as by strangers on Twitter. 'I don't feel uncomfortable about giving advice. If they've come to me with a question I'll do my best to answer it.' Beth started her blog, Naughty Corner, in 2012 and she now gets 6,000 hits a week. She gets the toys for free in return for a detailed and honest review on her site. Describing herself as 'like a kid at Christmas' when a new toy arrives, Beth usually opens and uses her delivery straight away. She said: 'At first I was going to people to get products to send to me to, but now companies come to me with products too. 'From sponsorship and advertising I get around three grand a year from the site.' Beth keeps all of her toys under her bed, she says she wouldn't tell a partner about her blog, Naughty Corner, straight away . Beth continued: 'I review two or three toys a week. Sometimes I get asked to write sponsored blog for a company. I would say I put up three blogs a week on average - one sponsored and two personal. 'The process between receiving the toy and the review going live is between three and seven days. 'If it's something that I get and I like it straight off it's two days to test, then another day to write the review. I write notes as I test the product.' And Beth says if she doesn't like a toy at first she will give it another go: 'If I get something that's a bit funky then it'll take me a bit longer. 'I have to think that even though I don't like it first time, I might notice something else after a few uses, or there might be something that appeals to other people.' Beth, a part time carer, does not have a boyfriend at the moment but revealed that one of her previous partners was happy to try out the toys with her . Beth will review any products, from sexy lingerie to dildos, but without a boyfriend she is mainly unable to test couple's toys. She does have a willing participant if needs be however, known on her blog as Mr Monkey. She said: 'I am single at the moment, but I have had a boyfriend since doing the blog. He used to love trying the toys out with me. 'We broke up because he moved away, but we stay in touch and he asks after the blog and reads it. It kept our sex life exciting. 'I am limited now as I can't test toys for couples, but I wouldn't rush into telling someone new about my blog. It's hardly something you can just drop into conversation. 'If I liked him and it was going somewhere then I would tell him I'm a sex blogger and see how he takes it. 'I currently masturbate about five nights a week which is probably more orgasms a week than I would experience with a boyfriend.' Beth has revealed that far more people are into the sex toys now thanks to the popularity of books like 50 Shades Of Grey . Beth also praises the likes of 50 Shades Of Grey for making her job much easier. She said: 'The likes of sex toys, fetish and BDSM is a lot more recognised now and seen as a lot more 'normal' thanks to the likes of 50 Shades. People are more forthcoming with their fetish likes. 'It's made my job a lot easier though. People are looking to try new things in their relationships. 'To be honest though, I didn't really like the books, I had to force myself through them. Christian Grey, the lead character, comes across as narcissistic. He was verging on being a stalker and I found it a bit uncomfortable. 'Unfortunately 50 shades Of Grey mis-portrayed the BDSM lifestyle. BDSM is all about communication, mutual respect and pushing boundaries with consent.' Beth stores her sex toys in a unit under the bed and in a chest. She said: 'If I have chance I will go back to my old favourites, but I get so many news toys I don't often get chance. My favourite is the Rock Soft Bullet.' Beth gets sent her sex toys for free but says that if she has time she still likes to go back to her old favourites .","Beth Kenneth started testing toys in 2012 and now runs a popular blog .

"A consumer watchdog has called for AirAsia to be placed under investigation after the airline cancelled direct flights from Melbourne to Bali with as little as 24 hours' notice. The Malaysian-based airline had promoted their new route for months, promising to fly passengers directly from Melbourne to Bali after a December 26 launch. But furious Aussie travellers had their holiday plans ruined when they were sent what they say was the 'the worst text' on Christmas Day - cancelling their flights with just a day's notice. CHOICE has written to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to examine AirAsia's conduct, saying the airline sold tickets on a route it did not have permission to fly. Scroll down for video . AirAsia X cancelled their planned Melbourne to Bali flights in December after 'unforseen' administration and approval issues . 'On Christmas Day the airline notified travellers that direct flights from Melbourne to Bali would be cancelled and offered them a 13-hour journey flying via Malaysia instead of the six-hour direct flight advertised by the airline,' CHOICE head of media Tom Godfrey said. 'The fact is consumers purchased direct flights to Bali but they ended up being flown around the houses coming in via Malaysia. AirAsia sold one thing and delivered something different - and in the process it misled consumers.' Under consumer law, Mr Godfrey says passengers should be compensated by the airline for their out-of-pocket expenses. 'It is also highly likely that AirAsia's decision to cancel the direct flight resulted in consumers' holiday plans being thrown into disarray with many incurring cancellation costs,' he said. 'If the route alteration had a major impact on holiday plans, where a holiday was the reason the flights were purchased, it constitutes a major failure under Australian Consumer Law. 'If the airline misled consumers or acted in a way that constitutes a ""major failure"" under consumer law, consumers should be able to seek compensation from the airline for any unexpected expenses they have had as a result of the cancellation.' Julie Chumbley (left) was devastated that her daughter's Bali wedding has been 'wrecked' because her immediate family has been stranded by the flight change . Julie Chumbley took to Facebook to express her anger and disappointment at the change and the way the airline conducted themselves . Passengers were sent out frantic texts on Christmas Day, informing them that flights from Boxing Day onwards were not only cancelled, but their expected travel time on their new flights was now doubled from five-and-a-half hours to a lengthy 13 hours. Weddings and travel plans went out the window when the commuters were informed they would have to stop over at Kuala Lumpur, meaning many travellers would arrive a day later than they had planned. 'Thank you for wrecking our family Christmas and my daughters wedding!! My daughter is due to be married on the 28th dec 2014 in bali and my daughter in law is a bridsemade(sic) and my son is walking her down the isle (sic). 'This was until you changed my daughter in laws and sons direct flight from the 27th dec 2014 to leave on the 28th dec with a stop over in kuala lumpur in which they will miss the whole wedding!!' wrote Julie Chumbley. It all occurred due to an 'administration issue' according to Air Asia. Rumours are flying, unlike the airline, that AirAsia is not authorised by air controllers to fly from Melbourne to Denpasar. An AirAsia X spokesman confirmed that 'an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation,' was the reason for the delay. 'Indonesia AirAsia X is working closely with all relevant authorities including the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and CASA (Civil Aviation Safety Authority) to ensure that the administration process can be completed as soon as possible,' an AirAsia X spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Indonesia AirAsia X will commence the direct return flight from Denpasar to Melbourne as scheduled as soon as this process has been completed. Passengers were put on new flights and had to change over at Kuala Lumpur airport (pictured) Nick Brown (left) and Angela Menz (right) were furious that their flights had been cancelled and that they received 'appalling customer service' by writing messages on Facebook . Travellers were enraged that the airline has been selling tickets for the flights since October, pledging to carry 377 passengers five times a week. The AirAsia Facebook page was flooded with angry messages from jilted customers, complaining about the major gaffe. 'You shouldn't have advertised/sold flights under the guise of them being available when they weren't. If you weren't allowed to fly direct from Melbourne – Bali then why advertise that you can?' wrote Dean Schultz. 'I am keen to investigate under ACCC as this surely is false advertising,' added Ann Thorpe. 'This morning (Christmas morning) we got a phonecall from Airasia saying that our flight to Bali which was scheduled to leave at 10:40 am on the 26th of Dec (tomorrow) has been delayed to 05:00 pm and will fly thru KL instead of being a direct flight. We were supposed to reach Bali at 01:00 pm but now we will reach 14 hours later at 03:00 am,' explained Nisha Tahiliani. Ms Menz was furious that her 'transfers and accommodation' was going to waste and was concerned that she did not know what will happen with her return flight, which had promised to fly her straight from Bali to Melbourne with AirAsia . Nick Brown was concerned that he had not been contacted about whether or not his December 28 flight would be affected, despite the news that flights were indefinitely grounded . Ms Chumbley was devastated about the impact this decision has had on her daughter's wedding, which was further exacerbated by the 'poor service' they received from AirAsia. She explained in her Facebook page that that they were 'hung up on fifteen times' while trying to change their flights, and then transferred to a call centre where they encountered a serious language barrier. 'This service is beyond unacceptable and due to this my two kids will miss this very special day and they cannot afford another $1700 each to change their flights!' 'The biggest issue is that it's such short notice that all the other direct flights are more than $1000 direct,' affected traveller Ognjen Zec told Daily Mail Australia. Other customers were livid that AirAsia will not compensate the travellers for the prepaid accommodation, transfers and other activities which will be missed due to the last-minute change in their flights. An AirAsia X spokesman confirmed that 'an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation,' was the reason for the delay . Traveller Ann Thorpe wrote a bitter message on Facebook, sarcastically posting 'thanks for the Merry Xmas text' On their Facebook page, AirAsia sent messages to furious customers to apologise for the fiasco. 'The re-route via KL (Kuala Lumpur) is a temporary solution as we work with authorities in the coming days to overcome the issue,' wrote AirAsia on Facebook, not explaining to customers what exactly the 'issue' is which has caused all flights to be cancelled. Customers were not satisfied by AirAsia's response when they demanded to know how they would be compensated for the lost funds. 'For any extra costs, we recommend you contact your travel insurance provider. This is a temporary issue, and we're working with government agencies to be able to commence our direct services as soon as possible in the near future.' Nick Brown was pro-active, asking AirAsia on Facebook if they could give him slightly more notice if his December 28 flight was set to be re-routed. 'Any idea if the direct flight from Melbourne to Bali on the 28th departing at 10:40 will be re-routed as well? Thought I'd be proactive and ask here first rather than wait for the news to be delivered by carrier pigeon 7 days after my flight.' Michelle Sharp also missed a friend's wedding and  was angry that the airline doesn't seem to care because they already had her 'hard earned money' Some travellers will arrive at Denpasar Airport more than 24 hours than they had originally planned .","CHOICE has written to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate Malaysian airline AirAsia .

"It took 56 hours to complete, was made from 4,640 chocolate sticks and 10kg of Belgian chocolate, measures 120cm by 120cm and contains a whopping 143,840 calories - but this edible labyrinth will only take a few hours to eat. The maze is the brainchild of YouTube vlogger Doug Armstrong, from London, and food artist Prudence Staite, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who created their chocolate warren in homage to the Maze Runner film. Mr Armstrong, 23, a self-confessed Maze Runner super-fan approached Midlands artist Ms Staite to create the epic construction early this year. Scroll down for video . Food artist Prudence Staite (left) and YouTube vlogger Doug Armstrong with their chocolate creation . Ms Staite constructed the maze over a week's period with 4,640 chocolate sticks and 10kg of Belgian chocolate. “Making the replica maze has taken a whole week of hard graft at my studio in Gloucestershire. Doug’s been a great help with all the intricate details and matching the maze up to mimic the one in the film,’ she said to FEMAIL. ‘It’s been tricky - and somewhat sticky - work but I’m thrilled with how the chocolate maze has turned out,' said Mr Armstrong. 'After I had the idea I started to figure out if I could do it myself then realised it would be impossible,' he continued. He then got in touch with experienced food artist Ms Staite to realise his chocolate vision. 'I was involved in the creation; Prudence taught me some of her techniques,' he said. 'I wanted to make sure I was a big part of it and helped out by sticking the chocolate fingers together. Mr Armstrong, 23, is a self-confessed fan of The Maze Runner film and books . Choco-mazeia: The labyrinth was made with 4,620 chocolate sticks and 10 kg of melted Belgian chocolate . 'I’m a massive fan of The Maze Runner, and of all things food, so it’s been a great experience,' he continued. The London-based YouTube sensation has over 130,000 subscribers on his account where his videos include cheesecake and brownie recipes, food challenges and parodies of popular culture. As unusual as the chocolate maze is, it isn't Ms Staite's first quirky commission. 'I have made all sorts of creations, including life-size chocolate rooms with solid chocolate fireplaces, lickable wall paper, and chocolate skirting boards, a walk-in wardrobe made entirely from chocolate in Australia, a life size sofa, and even replicas of people made in chocolate,' she explained. 'I want art to be interactive and edible. I have worked with food as an art form for over 10 years and use all types of food too, such as cheese, pizza, bread, sugar, fruits and vegetables,' she continued. Ms Staite has used pizza dough to make a sculptures of Pope Benedict XVI and Rome’s Colosseum and has recreated classic artworks by Banksy, Andy Warhol and Seurat using Smarties. She made a pizza portrait of Wayne Rooney and built a likeness of Anne Robinson using biscuits. Her savoury constructions include famous landscapes including Loch Ness, Big Ben, the Angel of the North and Stonehenge created from chips and mushy peas. The pair’s collaboration came about to celebrate the 9 February release of The Maze Runner film on Digital HD, and on Blu-ray and DVD. The edible maze directly mimics the dimensions of the maze model used in the film. The Maze Runner starts stars Dylan O’Brien and Kaye Scodelario who play teenagers in a gang trying to navigate their way out of an obstacle-filled ever-changing maze they find themselves dumped in.","Food artist Prudence Staite created maze with vlogger Doug Armstrong .

"Police made a gruesome discovery in King, North Carolina on Wednesday, finding a family of four shot to death in what now appears to be a murder-suicide. The victims of the shooting have been identified as married couple Coleton and Amanda Tarpley, 35 and 34, and their two sons Charlie, 6, and Coleton, 9. It is not yet known which family member carried out that sad act at the home - or for what reason. Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall would release no further details on the investigation. Scroll down for video .

Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall refused to provide any more information about motive or who is suspected as the shooter. Above, the scene outside the family's home on Wednesday . Police found the family dead after receiving a call to conduct a welfare check around 11:50am on Wednesday . Police were originally called to the house on Ralph Boyles Road at 11:50am on Wednesday by the children's grandparents who noticed suspicious activity at the house. The grandparents said they wanted to pick the kids up from the bus stop, but when they went over to the house, they found the parents' cars unusually parked in the driveway in the middle of the day. When they couldn't get through the door, they called police and the officers found the four bodies inside, all with gunshot wounds to the head. The children's grandparents wanted to pick them up from the bus stop and called police when the parents' cars were unusually still in the driveway in the middle of the day . Both of the Tarpley children attended Poplar Springs Elementary School, where Charlie (in orange sweatshirt) was enrolled in the special needs program . Both of the Tarpley boys were students at Poplar Springs Elementary School, with younger son Charlie in the special needs program, a spokesman for the school district confirmed. Neighbors who spoke with WXII said they didn't recall hearing gunshots. Another neighbor who lives across the street told the local Fox affiliate that she never sensed any marital problems and that the couple seemed dedicated to their special-needs son. 'Coleton revamped the whole inside of the house just to accommodate Charlie, you know; if there was something Charlie needed he would build it for him,' neighbor Amy Parsons said. According to Mrs Tarpley's Facebook, she worked as a stay-at-home mom. Despite Charlie's handicap, which appears to have left him wheelchair bound, photos posted to Facebook show the family living an active life - visiting amusement parks, ice skating and socializing at BBQs and other family events. The Stokes County Sheriff's Office and State Bureau of Investigation are currently investigating.","Couple Coleton and Amanda Tarpley and their sons Charlie, 6, and Coleton, 9, were found shot to death in their mobile home on Wednesday .

"Twitter on Thursday reported its revenue nearly doubled in the final three months of last year, but user growth fell short of analyst expectations. 'We closed out the year with our business advancing at a great pace,' said Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo. Revenue hit $479 million in the fourth quarter, up 97 percent from $242.6 million in the same period a year ago. Twitter on Thursday reported its revenue nearly doubled to $479 million in the final three months of last year, as its quarterly loss shrank to $125 million ©Leon Neal (AFP/File) The number of active monthly users of the San Francisco-based one-to-many messaging service monthly grew to 288 million -- just four million more than in the previous quarter. That figure fell short of expectations -- analysts had predicted the figure would climb to 292 million. About 80 percent of the people using Twitter monthly connected with the service using mobile devices. Its quarterly loss shrank to $125 million, as compared with a $511 million loss a year ago.

That figure fell short of expectations -- analysts had predicted the figure would climb to 292 million. About 80 percent of the people using Twitter monthly connected with the service using mobile devices. Twitter has also struck a deal with Google to make its 140-character updates more searchable online. In the first half of this year, tweets will start to be visible in Google’s search results as soon as they are posted, thanks to a deal giving the Web company access to Twitter’s 'firehose', the stream of data generated by the microblogging service’s 284 million users. Twitter shares spiked nearly 10 percent aftermarket, as the messaging service shrank losses and nearly doubled quarterly revenue by drawing more users and expanding its advertising offerings. Shares jumped over 9 percent in aftermarket trading. Twitter's user growth continued to lag other popular social networks. The company had 288 million monthly users at the end of the quarter, up 20 percent from a year earlier. But the pace of growth slowed in the fourth quarter, something Twitter attributed to changes in the way third-party apps integrate Twitter. CEO Dick Costolo said Twitter expects to add a similar number of net users in the first quarter as it did in the first three quarters of 2014. Earlier today Twitter’s chief executive took personal responsibility for the social media website’s problems in dealing with abuse reported by users. Dick Costolo admitted that Twitter ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’ in an internal memo seen by The Verge. In it, he said that he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. The company had 288 million monthly users at the end of the quarter, up 20 percent from a year earlier. By comparison, LinkedIn Corp. on Thursday reported 347 million users through the end of December. The Facebook-owned photo sharing app Instagram, meanwhile, recently surpassed 300 million users. None come close to Facebook, however, with its 1.39 billion members. The San Francisco-based company was still privately held for part of the year-ago quarter - it went public in November 2013. For the final three months of 2014 it had losses of $125.4 million, or 20 cents per share, down sharply from a loss of $511.5 million, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Twitter earned $79.3 million, or 12 cents per share - double the 6 cents expected by analysts, according to FactSet.","Just four million users have joined in last quarter, results reveal .

"A group of Florida teenagers killed a pelican by blowing cigarette smoke into its beak and then closing it shut so the bird couldn't breathe. Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission say the savage January 16 attack was caught on a surveillance camera at an upscale Fort Lauderdale condominium complex. According to FWCC spokeswoman Liz Barraco, a security guard at the apartment complex told officials about the attack on the bird, described as a brown pelican. Sadistic crime: A group of Florida teenagers killed a pelican (not pictured) by blowing cigarette smoke into its beak and then closing it shut . Upscale residence: The attack on the helpless bird took place at the Venetian condominium tower in Fort Lauderdale . Barraco told the South Florida Sun Sentinel one suspect held the bird down and blew fumes from an electronic cigarette into its beak and eyes. He then held the pelican's beak closed so it could not draw a breath, repeating the action multiple times until it died. Pelicans have no nostrils, so they cannot breathe unless their beak is open. The main suspect is charged with a violation of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Barraco says he'll likely be placed in a juvenile diversion program. The names of the teenagers have not been released because they are minors. Sickening: Wildlife officials say the bird's tormentors repeatably blew e-cigarette smoke into the pelican's beak and eyes . Noble creature: Pelicans have no nostrils, so they cannot breathe unless their beak is open. According to wildlife officials, the pelican was captured by a group of teens at around 1am January 16 and brought to the Venetian condominium tower, where one of the suspects lives with his family. After questioning the boy, who is believed to be 16 or 17 years old, sheriff's officials identified him as the ringleader in the sadistic slaying of the bird. In the 1970s, the brown pelican was an endangered species, but the ban on the pesticide DDT has helped the birds make a strong comeback. Large populations of brown pelicans can be found in estuaries along both the east and west coasts.","The brown pelican was caught in Fort Lauderdale in January and brought to upscale condominium complex to be tortured .

Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo has accepted the blame for the social media site's failure to tackle online abuse. He said: 'We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we’ve sucked at it for years' Mr Costolo said: ‘We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we’ve sucked at it for years. ‘It’s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day. ‘I’m frankly ashamed of how poorly we’ve dealt with this issue during my tenure as CEO. It’s absurd. There’s no excuse for it. ‘I take full responsibility for not being more aggressive on this front. It’s nobody else’s fault but mine, and it’s embarrassing.’ Mr Costolo’s comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse in the wake of writer Lindy West speaking to the Guardian about her experiences. In recent years Twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls. Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s death. She made an appeal to her 166,000 followers to report two users on Twitter (shown above) She received comments and abuse on a daily basis. Internet trolls even created a Twitter account in the name of her deceased father in order to send insults to her. Mr Costolo said: ‘We’re going to start kicking these people off right and left and making sure that when they issue their ridiculous attacks, nobody hears them. Everybody on the leadership team knows this is vital.’ Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez (pictured) received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note . Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father’s suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. Many people believe that Twitter is still not doing enough to tackle trolls. In December, the social platform made the task of reporting abuse easier. Its update saw the process streamlined so there are fewer steps required in order to report abuse. It used to require filling in a nine-part questionnaire but trolls can now be reported in a few steps. Twitter has said that more tools are on the way to further improve the service. Mr Costolo said: ‘Let me be very, very clear about my response here - I take personal responsibility for our failure to deal with this as a company. ‘I thought I did that in my note, so let me reiterate what I said, which is that I take personal responsibility for this. I specifically said “It’s nobody’s fault but mine”. ‘We have to be able to tell each other the truth, and the truth that everybody in the world knows is that we have not effectively dealt with this problem even remotely to the degree we should have by now, and that’s on me and nobody else. ‘So now we’re going to fix it, and I’m going to take full responsibility for making sure that the people working night and day on this have the resources they need to address the issue, that there are clear lines of responsibility and accountability, and that we don’t equivocate in our decisions and choices.’ Ms Criado-Perez took to Twitter this morning to agree with Mr Costolo that Twitter ‘sucks’ at dealing with abuse, before adding that it was ‘good to see an acknowledgement tho (sic)’. ‘And to be fair to Twitter, I know they’ve been working hard on finding solutions to the problem’, she added. Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003.","Dick Costolo made the admission in an internal memo to employees .

"The mother of three young children found abandoned and locked inside a Washington home has admitted to using meth and told the court she is pregnant with a fifth child. Amanda Foley and Mark Dorson, both 33, were arrested this week after their children were found on Saturday alone locked in a filthy run-down Lake Stevens house, starving and shivering in 40-degree temperatures. The children, aged seven, three, and 11 months, were living 'among animal feces and human excrement', according to court documents. Scroll down for video . Deplorable: A 7-year-old girl, 3-year-old boy, and 11-month-old boy were found abandoned by their parents in this unheated and filthy home in Lake Stevens, Washington on Saturday . Amanda Foley broke down in court on Wednesday when a judge told her she would have no contact with her kids, who were transferred to foster care . Arrested: On Wednesday, parents Mark Dorson (left) and Foley (right), both 33, appeared in Snohomish County Court where they were ordered held on $100,000 bond on child abandonment charges . Police said that when they entered the home, they were overwhelmed by a strong smell of ammonia, according to King 5. The infant had had a temperature of 94.1 degrees and was found to be suffering from hypothermia and dehydration, court documents said. He was 'in the 2 per cent for his body weight'. Foley broke down in court on Wednesday when a judge told her she would have no contact with her kids. The parents appeared in Snohomish County, Washington Court where a judge ordered them held on a $100,000 bond for charges of felony criminal mistreatment and abandoning a child. Becky Hensley, the stepmother of Foley's oldest daughter, who didn't live in the home, told King 5 that the mother 'should be crying'. Hensley, a mother of five, said Foley would call her eldest daughter once every three months. The couples' children were saved from the deplorable conditions after a woman stopped by the family's house in Lake Stevens to collect a debt from Dorson. Run down: Above, a view of the family's now-condemned home in Lake Stevens where the children were found on Saturday . When she found the couple's seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old son unattended in the downstairs portion of the house, she called police. Officers who arrived on the scene found the sister and brother huddled together under a blanket on a couch to keep warm in the unheated home, surrounded by garbage, according to a police affidavit. 'The condition of the home looked like it was being torn down, with drywall missing, insulation missing, water coming through the ceiling,' Lake Stevens Commander Dennis Taylor told KOMO. 'There was only an empty snack-size potato chip bag and an empty Pringles can. There was no sign of any food; no empty wrappers, no empty cans, certainly no food in the home,' Cmdr Taylor added. Police were eventually able to coax the girl to open the door, and she insisted that her parents were upstairs sleeping. While police didn't find the parents upstairs, they did discover the couple's 11-month-old son in a bedroom - which was locked and unreachable by the two older siblings. While all three children appeared to be malnourished and struggling to keep warm in the unheated house, it was the infant who was in the worst condition according to police reports. Resecued: The children were discovered Saturday by a woman who stopped by the house to collect a debt from Dorson. Above, investigators wearing respirators and covered shoes look over the filthy home . Cold: The 7-year-old girl and 3-year-old boy were found huddled under a blanket on the couch to keep warm in the unheated home. Animal feces and other trash were found littering the home . The baby barely reacted to touch when officers arrived on the scene, and after being rushed to the hospital, doctors pronounced that the boy was suffering from hypothermia and dehydration. Thankfully, the boy reacted well to treatment 'and is doing much better now' according to Cmdr Taylor. The two other children were also treated at the hospital, and the siblings have now been placed in foster care. 'If it weren't for the person who was owed money; if it weren't for their insight to call us, we'd be dealing with a much more tragic situation,' Cmdr Taylor said. 'It's 40 degrees inside the home because there's no heat; no insulation. It's very possible the one child could have perished from hypothermia.' It’s still unclear how long the three children were left alone at the home, or if their parents had returned to the home since going missing. However, the couple never attempted to contact authorities and it took until Tuesday for police to track them down and arrest them at a business in nearby Monroe, Washington - about 30 minutes south. Locked away: The youngest child, an 11-month-old boy, was found locked in an upstairs bedroom, unreachable by his two older siblings . New home: The infant was treated for dehydration and hypothermia and is recovering. All three children have been transferred into foster care . Authorities say the parents have been investigated by Child Protective Services on several occasions in the past, when their eldest daughter continually showed up unkempt and hungry to school. Her school had also informed CPS when she failed to show up for school for a week straight. There were concerns about the girl's 'health and well-being, her attendance, her hygiene,' Jayme Taylor, director of communications for the Lake Stevens School District told King 5. She added that the school noticed she smelled so badly that she was offered a change of clothes by staff. Shellie Cooper, the mother of a friend of Dorson, called CPS 18 months ago after her son saw the conditions of the house. Cooper said the kids 'weren't being fed' and were 'locked in their rooms'. However, neighbors were completely unaware that the children were being left alone or the state that the house was in. They did, however, confront Dorson about the condition of the exterior of the home when it started to stick out in the community. Criminal history: Dorson and Foley both have extensive criminal records. Dorson was sentenced to prison in 2002 for shooting and wounding a man while Foley was convicted of stealing an SUV . 'He pretty much threw attitude, and said he was doing the best he could. And we said ""OK, well, it needs to be taken care of,""' Neighbor Matt Eberharter told KIRO. The stench in the house was so bad that investigators had to don respirators and plastic boots to look over the home a few days later, and a building inspector has now condemned the house as uninhabitable. While there was running water in the home, inspectors also found mold and water damage, in addition to dangerously disabled smoke alarms, exposed wires and uncovered light fixtures. According to court records, both parents have had several run-ins with the law. Dorson was sentenced to prison in 2002 for shooting and wounding a man, while Foley graduated from drug court in 2009 and was later convicted of stealing an SUV. The woman who discovered the children living in the filthy conditions on Saturday says she paid Dorson for car repairs that he never followed through with. Dorson's Facebook shows him working to upgrade several cars, many of them parked outside the home where he allegedly abandoned his children.

"A woman who stole more than £100,000 from her employers has been ordered to repay just £1 after blowing it all on a lavish lifestyle. Accounts assistant Lauren Cherry treated herself to expensive holidays, designer clothes and jewellery on the looted cash over a period of six months. As a result of her crime, the small firm where she worked was forced to close and four people lost their jobs. Cherry, 32, said she was suffering from depression and low self-esteem and went on the spending sprees to give herself ‘a lift’. Accounts assistant Lauren Cherry, who stole more than £100,000 from her firm in just six months, has been ordered to pay back just £1 after she blew the lot on holidays, designer clothes and jewellery . She admitted stealing £104,320 and was jailed for 25 months by a judge who condemned her ‘concerted, calculated and consistent’ conduct. But because she has no assets, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC made a nominal confiscation order for £1, to be paid within 28 days. Maidstone Crown Court heard how Cherry joined F P Mailing (Premier) in Dartford, Kent, in April 2012 and started stealing within two months. Prosecutor John Turner said she earned about £1,400 gross a month and had access to the online banking system and made transfers to six personal accounts. She disguised it by saying they were transfers within the company, which supplied franking machines. By August there were concerns about her bookkeeping and absence because of illness. When challenged about the transfers, she claimed they were made by mistake, but she was sacked. ‘It is fair to describe her lifestyle as extravagant,’ Mr Turner said. ‘There were designer clothes and jewellery. There were a number of holidays.’ She even bought presents for her work colleagues, he said. Cherry started taking the money just two months after she started work at franking machine suppliers FP Mailing (Premier) in Dartford, Kent . Simon Wickens, for Cherry, of Gravesend, Kent, said she had suffered from depression and low self-worth over the years. Her world ‘fell apart’ when her long-term partner cheated on her and left her. He said: ‘She was left with debts. She was in a property she couldn’t afford. Most significantly, she was emotionally destroyed. This offence appears to be borne out of that. ‘Things spiralled. The missing money went unnoticed. She bought things to make her feel better. Her family thought she was doing amazingly well. She was treating others to build up an image of a happy life.’ Cherry, of Gravesend, admitted stealing £104,320 and was jailed for 25 months by Judge David Griffith-Jones QC, at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) who condemned her 'concerted, calculated and consistent' conduct . The court heard that the company had to be wound up because of Cherry’s crime and 15 people lost their jobs, although 11 were re-employed by a new franchise of the firm. The judge told Cherry: ‘It is very troubling to see someone like you standing in the dock awaiting sentence for what is in any view a serious offence. You were motivated by greed. It is fair to say you took a long time to accept your responsibility in the face of compelling evidence.’ After the case, a director of the company, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She would take people out, buying everyone Christmas presents. ‘But it was our money she was doing it with.’","Accounts assistant Lauren Cherry, 32, stole from franking machine firm .

"A Texas inmate set to be executed next week for fatally shooting four men at an airplane hangar more than 30 years ago won a reprieve Thursday from the U.S. Supreme Court. Lester Bower Jr., 67, among the longest-serving Texas death row inmates, had been scheduled for lethal injection Tuesday. The justices gave no reason for the reprieve, saying only that it would be lifted automatically if they deny an appeal or act on it. Bower was convicted in the October 1983 deaths at a Grayson County ranch about 60 miles north of Dallas. Authorities found parts from a small ultralight airplane at the hangar at his home in Arlington, a Dallas suburb. Prosecutors also tied unusual Italian-made .22-caliber bullets used in the slayings to similar ammunition purchased by Bower, a federally licensed gun dealer. Temporary reprieve: Lester Bower, 67, speaks on a phone in an interview cage at the visiting area of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas. Bower, set to be executed next week for fatally shooting four men at an airplane hangar more than 30 years ago, won a reprieve Thursday from the U.S. Supreme Court . He asked for a delay so the Supreme Court could consider his appeal, which is pending at the court. The next time the nine justices are scheduled to meet to discuss new cases to take up is February 20. In their appeal to the high court, Bower's lawyers said jurors who decided on his death sentence had faulty instructions that didn't allow them to consider mitigating circumstances that he had no criminal record, was a married father of two, college educated and employed as a chemical salesman. Since his 1984 trial, court rulings have refined instructions to Texas capital murder trial juries to account for mitigating circumstances. Several condemned inmates from that era — but not Bower — have received new court-ordered punishment trials. Bower's attorneys also contended that prosecutors misstated the rarity of the fatal bullets, and that his long time on death row and numerous rescheduled execution dates amount to unconstitutional suffering. State attorneys argued that courts have rejected appeals about the jury instructions, that information about the bullets was available at the time of his trial and that Bower's lawyers' persistent appeals account for the lengthy case. Among the legal questions that Bower has raised is whether the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment has been violated by his more than 30-year stay on death row. 'Any delay is purely of his own making,' Stephen Hoffman, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the justices in a filing this week. Ominous evidence: Trial evidence that was used in case against Lester Leroy Bower Jr., is shown in the Grayson County District Clerk's office Wednesday in Sherman, Texas. Three months after four bodies were found shot execution-style in an airplane hangar on the B&B Ranch north of Dallas, Bower, a chemical salesman, was charged with capital murder . A jury deliberated just two hours before convicting Lester Bower, then deliberated only two hours more the following day before deciding he should die for the crime. No fingerprints put him at the scene. No witnesses saw him there. The murder weapon never was found. Bower never confessed. DNA testing wasn't available then. Bower made them suspicious. He had lied to his wife and to authorities about his efforts to buy an ultralight plane; she didn't want him flying such a flimsy craft. He sold firearms on the side, including the kind that fired the ammunition used to kill the men. Convicted in 1984: Seen here in his younger days, Bower has now been on death row longer than nearly any other Texas inmate . 'I was quite capable of purchasing whatever I need without killing four people,' Bower said in 2008 after a state judge stopped stopped his execution scheduled that summer. 'Virtually no one, except for the prosecution, thinks this sounds like anything I would do.' Bower says he had a good job and was a family man, father of two daughters, with a stable marriage. 'An absolutely stellar record,' Bower said. 'Then one day, as the prosecutor says, I snapped, killed four people and snapped back. Those are his words, not mine. 'I'm not minimizing that people don't snap ... Does this really sound like something I would do?' Yes, prosecutors insist. Sievert and Grayson County prosecutors built a circumstantial case surrounding Bower's purchase of the ultralight airplane from sheriff's Deputy Philip Good, 29. The aircraft was stored at a hangar owned by building contractor Bob Tate, 51. Tate; Good; Jerry Brown, 52, a Sherman interior designer; and Ronald Mayes, 39, a former Sherman police officer, were all killed at the hangar. Bower acknowledges he lied to the FBI about his involvement in the purchase of the plane. He said Brown was with Good that Saturday afternoon when he was negotiating the down payment of $3,000, or 75 percent, on the airplane. They all waited about 15 minutes for Tate to show up with a key to the hangar. Bower said he never saw Mayes. Evidence at trial centered on Bower's two purchases in 1982, when he lived in Colorado Springs, Colo., of Italian-made Fiocchi-brand .22-caliber ammunition, the kind used in the killings. There also was evidence he had owned a .22-caliber Ruger pistol, which prosecutors said was fitted with a silencer he made. Bower had a federal firearms dealer license. Prosecutors showed jurors his books about guns and gun parts, a Ruger target pistol manual and a book about silencers. Among evidence and trial exhibits still stored in cardboard boxes at the courthouse are four plastic foam heads, the kind used to display wigs. These four, however, have long blue knitting needles stuck in them, representing the paths bullets took to kill each person. Was it enough? Among the evidence used by the prosecution was the type of bullets used in 1983 killings, an Italian-made .22 caliber that Bower's defenders now say prosecutors unfairly characterized as rare after offering evidence he'd purchased such bullets the year before . LESTER LEROY BOWER, JR. v. STATE OF TEXAS . Prosecutors said Bower was obsessed with the aircraft and stole it. Bower has said he was at the hangar to purchase the aircraft and the men were alive when he left. Those killed were building contractor Bob Tate, 51; Grayson County Sheriff's Deputy Philip Good, 29; Jerry Brown, 52, an interior designer; and Ronald Mayes, 39, a former Sherman police officer. Good's wife, Marlene Bushard, said the delay was 'very frustrating since we were so close.' 'I am hoping once this is done he will be out of options, we can get another death warrant and end this,' she said in an email. Police looking through her slain husband's phone records spotted several calls from Bower, and he lied to investigators when they contacted him. 'Not cooperating with authorities was the biggest mistake,' Bower told The Associated Press last month. 'And I paid for it with my life. A lot of us have done some crazy things.' He insisted the presence of the disassembled aircraft at his house should not be incriminating. 'They can't prove it was stolen and I can't prove I bought it,' he said. 'They have four dead men. It's too good a story, so they say I stole it.' Second chance sentencing? Since his 1984 trial, court rulings have refined instructions to Texas capital murder trial juries to account for mitigating circumstances. Several condemned inmates from that era — but not Bower — have received new court-ordered punishment trials .","Lester Bower Jr. has been on death row longer than almost anyone in Texas history after a conviction based on circumstantial evidence .

"Questioned: Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, has been interviewed under caution by Operation Yewtree detectives in Stafford, Staffordshire . Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, has been interviewed under caution by Operation Yewtree detectives in connection with allegations of sexual offences, it has been reported. The Australian presenter was questioned this week at a police station in Stafford, Staffordshire, by officers investigating historic sex offences in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986. His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed. A spokesman from the Metropolitan Police did not name Harris, but said an 84-year-old man had been questioned on Tuesday and Wednesday, the BBC reported. He added that the man arrested has already been questioned under Operation Yewtree. Their inquiries continue. Harris was reportedly transferred to Stafford prison in October from HMP Bullingdon, in Oxfordshire, after being repeatedly targeted by other inmates. Operation Yewtree is the police probe set up in the wake of disclosures that former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile was a prolific paedophile. The investigation has three strands of inquiry. One relates to Savile's crimes and the second relates to allegations against Savile and others. The third strand, under which Mr Harris was questioned, concentrates on accusations unconnected to the Savile investigations but which emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding the late DJ. So far more than a dozen people have been arrested as part of the investigation. Five celebrities have been convicted for sex crimes under Operation Yewtree. Jailed: Harris pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court in June with daughter Bindi (right), wife Alwen (second left) and niece Jenny (left) Former glam rock singer Gary Glitter was today found guilty of carrying out a string of sex attacks on young girls while at the height of his fame. He was found guilty of of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13. Former PR guru Max Clifford, artist Rolf Harris, and former BBC radio presenter Chris Denning have all been jailed following trials brought under Operation Yewtree. Former BBC Radio One host Dave Lee Travis was given a suspended sentence after being convicted for indecent assault.

"A daughter who fled with her mother a decade ago during a custody dispute must appear in court if she is to testify in her mother's defence - but she is in hiding and it's not clear if she will come forward. A lawyer acting for Genevieve Kelly had requested that her daughter Mary Nunes, now 18, be allowed to give a videotaped testimony in her mother's trial on custodial interference charges. But the judge in the case yesterday rejected the request, ruling that Miss Nunes needs to be questioned by prosecutors first, because the state has no idea what she is planning to testify. Genevieve Kelley (left, before she fled in 2004) returned to New Hampshire late last year (right) and is facing custodial interference charges for taking her daughter Mary Nunes . The whereabouts of Mary Nunes (left in childhood) are still unknown, though authorities have issued age-progressed photos (right) to try and find the now 18-year-old . Miss Nunes was eight when she fled with her mother from Lancaster, New Hampshire. Kelley turned herself in to authorities in November on custodial interference charges. She said she wants a trial, and her lawyer said Ms Nunes plans to testify for her mother. But Alan Rosenfeld, for Kelly, had asked that Miss Nunes's testimony be videotaped, saying she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2004 and would suffer mental or emotional strain if she has to testify in court. Prosecutor John McCormick responded that while the state is sensitive to the well-being of Ms Nunes, if she is going to be a witness, she should appear at trial, not as part of a 'packaged videotaped presentation.' Judge Peter Bornstein, ruling that Ms Nunes should not be allowed to give video-taped testimony, said he had no evidence that the diagnosis from 2004 would affect her today, and that even if there were evidence, 'it's so remote in time.' When asked how he would find Ms Nunes, Mr McCormick said, 'That's a good question.' He said he hoped the defence would help arrange the meeting. Since their disappearance ten years ago, U.S. Marshals have searched in the US, Canada and Central America for the daughter, mother and her new husband Scott Kelley. The mother said she violated a family court decision to protect her daughter from her ex-husband, Dr Mark Nunes, whom she alleges sexually abused the child. The father was investigated, but not charged. Authorities felt the man was unfairly accused. Scott Kelley, 50,  is also wanted in the case of Mary Nunes's non-custodial kidnapping . Law enforcement concluded that Mrs Kelley mistreated the child. Kelley and Dr Nunes divorced in 1998 and the mother moved to back to the northern town New Hampshire town where her parents lived. The couple communicated through a notebook that Mary would shuttle back and forth, before a visit to her father's house was cancelled in 2003. Kelley said she fled during the custody battle over Mary to avoid a greater harm to her child, but prosecutor John McCormick said that defense doesn't apply under state law. The prosecutor says the protection defense only applies if Mrs Kelley had stayed in New Hampshire with the girl. Mr Rosenfeld said the law is meant to prevent that defense from being available to parents who take children out of state as part of an alleged crime. The protection defense is one of many motions Justice Peter Bornstein is likely to hear today. Ms Kelley's lawyers, who specialize in cases involving mothers kidnapping their children amid abuse allegations, have also asked that the judge not decide whether to allow her defenses until after evidence is heard, according to the Union Leader. Mr Rosenfeld said it would be up to prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs Kelley left after no longer having a legal right to do so. The defendant was not present for the hearing that gave Dr Nunes custody of Mary. The lawyer said Ms Kelley plans to offer testimony that at a point where her daughter's court-appointed guardian and social service agencies 'had chosen not to believe' what the girl said, the legal system was unable to protect her. 'Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,' he wrote. Mr McCormick said the investigation into whether Mary was abused was 'greatly compromised' by Mrs Kelley's actions. He said because Ms Kelley intentionally refused to follow the court's order for Mary to be evaluated in 2004, 'she all but sabotaged the prospect of ever bringing Mary's alleged abuser to justice'. US Marshals say that Mrs Kelley and her daughter originally fled on their own passports and made a stop in Honduras or Guatemala. The Friends of Genevieve Kelley group helped post the mother's $250,000 bail after she returned to New Hampshire to face trial . The girl is no longer subject to family court after reaching the age of majority, and Mrs Kelley made contact with authorities last spring. Mrs Kelley said that she returned because her nine-year-old son needs medical treatment for cystic fibrosis, according to the Boston Globe . The defense lawyer says that the daughter is anxious to return to living with her Mrs Kelley after the trial is resolved. Dr Nunes, who is remarried and lives in Ohio, issued a statement saying that his daughter 'has been told falsehoods and misstatements on the events of her youth'. Mrs Kelley, a family practice doctor, is thought to have stopped in Honduras or Guatemala after fleeing New Hampshire . Ms Kelley was released from jail on January 7 after supporters posted $250,000 cash bail, and is living with her son. The defendant is not allowed to have contact with her daughter or with her husband, 50-year-old Scott Kelley, who also is missing and is charged with custodial interference. He remains as one of New Hampshire's most wanted. The prosecutor has asked for access to Ms Kelley's passport in hopes of locating her daughter. Mr Rosenfeld objected, saying she would be producing evidence against herself, in violation of her constitutional rights against self-incrimination. The mother was released from custody after posting bail and is now living in New Hampshire with her nine-year-old son .","Genevieve Kelley, now 50, left New Hampshire with daughter Mary in 2004 .

"Kevin Sherman, 51, has been driving a garbage truck in the streets of Los Angeles, and not even his son's multimillion-dollar contract could change that.

On the job: Kevin Sherman, 51, says he won't stop driving the garbage collection truck in Compton until he's retired . His son has the cash to spare - in spite of losing the Super Bowl last Sunday - having signed a four-year $56million contract with Seattle in the off-season last year. But he told the Los Angeles Times back in 2014 he wanted to keep working towards retirement and his pension. 'People say, ""Let your son take care of you,""' the elder Sherman, who lost an eye in a go-karting accident when he was 14, told the paper. 'Yeah, but I've got a few years left until I retire. Why would I mess up my own retirement? 'I have a medical plan that will cover me. Why should my son have to pay my medical bills? It doesn't make sense to me.' SI reports that Sherman is now only 18 months from retiring after 26 years on the job driving the streets of Compton. 'It's something to keep busy, and it's easy now,' he said.

"Residents of Kansas City, Missouri are looking in to loud booms that have mysteriously appeared with the cold weather that has swept across the United States. Many are being startled with the large booms, as they are causing people to think their homes are being broken into or gun shots are being fired. Temperatures in Kansas City reached well below freezing almost every day in January, and with the cold weather came the booms. Frost quakes are caused when rain and ice seep down into the soil and freeze when the temperature drops. The deep freeze causes the ground to crack, creating a large boom . Some people believed the noises were sounds from test runs at a nearby Air Force Base, according to KSHB. But when that proved to be false, frost quakes seemed to be the city's answer. Frost quakes, or cryoseism, are more commonly found on a glacier in the polar regions, but with freezing temperatures reaching further south this year, they've been experienced across Canada and the United States. As weather got colder, people were being startled with large booms - causing them to think their homes were being broken into or gunshots were being fired - when in reality they were hearing frost quakes (file photo) The phenomenon is caused when rain and ice seep down into the soil and freeze when the temperature drops. Most frost quakes occur when there is a large amount of moisture on the ground. Accuweather explains a frost quake as 'a natural phenomenon caused from a sudden deep freezing of the ground'. This deep freeze causes the ground to crack, creating the large boom. Unlike earthquakes, frost quakes aren't created out of seismic activity, according toAOL. They are most common between midnight and dawn, which is the coldest part of the night. Though frost quakes are unusual in Missouri, they're experienced regularly in northern Canada.","People in Kansas City have heard loud booms throughout the winter .

"This is the moment an armed robber was caught on CCTV flicking a cigarette butt into a garden seconds before carrying out a violent raid - providing police with a perfect DNA match. Mark O'Brien dropped the roll-up in a garden before launching a violent shop raid, hitting a staff member on the head with a fake handgun and ripping a £1,000 gold chain from his neck. The 26-year-old escaped but left the key piece of evidence  - which helped convict him of robbery and has seen him jailed for four years and eight months. Mark O'Brien was caught after CCTV showed him flick a cigarette butt seconds before  a violent shop raid, where he hit  a staff member on the head with a fake handgun and ripped a £1,000 gold chain from his neck . Caught: Armed robber Mark O'Brien (pictured left) was spotted on CCTV flicking this cigarette into a garden. It was this roll-up (right) lying perfectly preserved in a neighbour's garden which led him to be caught . O'Brien pointed a fake handgun at the shopkeeper during the raid in December at the Ganners Convenience Store in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Leeds Crown Court heard. He took £500 from the till and hit the shopkeeper over the head with his weapon before ripping the chain from the victim's neck. An accomplice, who has not yet been caught, was armed with a knife and made threats at the shopkeeper before the pair left. When police investigated, however, they found CCTV which showed O'Brien crossing the street and disposing of something in a garden - which turned out to be his incriminating cigarette butt. They ran a check on the Police National Computer and it brought up a match for O'Brien, who has previous convictions for robbery and violent offences. O'Brien was arrested and pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm. Judge Guy Kearl QC told him: 'You are an experienced criminal and you have an extensive record of convictions. O'Brien is pictured flicking the cigarette into a garden - he has now been jailed for almost five years . 'This was a planned attack. It was persistent. Weapons were available and weapons were used to the extent of using part of the gun to cause injury.' Detective Inspector Mark Swift, of Leeds District CID, said: 'O'Brien left the crucial piece of evidence that linked him to the crime when he discarded a cigarette butt near to the scene. 'CCTV was recovered that showed the two masked suspects loitering outside the shop before the robbery. 'The one we now know to be O'Brien is seen crossing the street and flicking the cigarette butt into the garden of a nearby house, presumably so as not to leave it at the scene. 'This caught the attention of investigating officers who then recovered the cigarette butt from the garden for forensic analysis which found O'Brien's DNA on it. 'This was an excellent piece of detective work that has seen a prolific offender taken off the streets after he put the victim through a frightening ordeal. 'We hope the victim and his family are able to take some comfort from seeing him brought to justice.'","Mark O'Brien pointed fake gun at victim during £500 cash raid in Leeds .

'Sooooo what you guys do it brighten the photo to a point that Kerry looks WHITE!?? Never buying your magazine again. I'm DISGUSTED! #BLACKISBEAUTIFUL!' she wrote. Someone else added: 'They removed everything that makes her Kerry. Why the lighter skin, why the thinner lips? Lord forgive them.' False representation: One woman called out the magazine on Instagram, calling the InStyle cover 'an egregious mistake' Angry customer: Another critic said she would never buy InStyle again because the magazine made Kerry 'look white' An unhappy man: This Twitter user also accused the magazine of 'whitewashing' the actress . Critics also took to Twitter to share their disgust. 'Some woman pretending to be Kerry Washington is on the cover of InStyle magazine. #Scandal,' someone wrote. Another man added: 'What did InStyle Magazine do to my Kerry Washington?! The picture doesn't even look like her #whitewashing #Instylemagazinecovers .' This isn't the first time fans have been left outraged by one of Kerry's cover photos, nor is InStyle the first magazine called out for supposedly lightening someone's skin. Many people felt that Kerry’s December 2013/January 2014 cover of Lucky had been edited beyond all recognition, with many voicing similar concerns about the apparent lightening of her skin color. Meanwhile, Lupita Nyong'o's 2014 spread in Vanity Fair saw similar criticisms. And in 2010, Elle was accused of lightening Gabourey Sidibe's skin for its 25th anniversary issue, but the magazine maintained that the cover appearance was the result of studio lighting.

'She makes bold choices. She continued: 'When I was pregnant, I showed up at the SAG awards in a bare-midriff gown by Prada. I knew some people were going to hate it, but I thought it was super cute and really fun.' While she had no problem flaunting her baby bump, the new mom said she relied on pilates, Tracy Anderson pregnancy DVDs, hiking, the elliptical machine and yoga get her figure back after giving birth to her daughter Isabelle in May. She also talked about her experience as a working mom with a young child. 'Women use this ""guilt"" word a lot, but I’m not sure how I feel about it,' she explained. 'I know why it’s the word that keeps coming up, but I can’t co-sign on it yet... You can’t be all things to all people all the time. 'You have to experience your humanity, you have to know you are a limited vessel, and you can only do so much.'","Kerry proudly revealed the cover on Instagram on Wednesday .

"The driver of a bin lorry which killed six Christmas shoppers after he had a cardiac arrest  at the wheel said today he thinks about each victim 'every minute of every day'. Harry Clarke was unconscious when his refuse vehicle mounted a packed pavement in the centre of Glasgow on December 22, killing six people and injuring up to a dozen more. Speaking for the first time today Mr Clarke, who was in hospital for two weeks afterwards, said he never knew he had heart problems until he woke up afterwards. The 58-year-old also cannot 'remember anything at all' about the crash. Tragedy: Harry Clarke, the driver of the bin lorry that killed six people after he fell unconscious at the wheel has spoken for the first time about his grief for the victims on December 22 in Glasgow . 'I was never aware of anything being wrong with my heart until that day,' he told the Daily Record. 'I understand a lot of people want to know what happened that day. I wish I could tell you but I can't. I just want all of the families of the injured and deceased to know I can't remember anything, . 'Nothing will ever be normal for the families or me ever again. I think of everyone every minute of every day. I grieve for everyone involved in the accident. Every day is a struggle.' He said that he has not spoken out because of his fragile health but did not want to be silent in case it offended the families of those killed. He said:  'I've felt awful not speaking out.  I am not saying that to get sympathy. I don't want that but I don't want the families to think I have been hiding'. Victims: Grandfather John 'Jack' Sweeney (left), 68, and primary school teacher Stephenie Tait (right), 29, were among the six victims of the fatal crash . Mr Sweeney's wife Lorraine (left), 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade (right)  also died . Tax worker Jacqueline Morton (left), 51, and Gillian Ewing (right), 52, from Edinburgh were killed in the crash . Paying tribute: Hundreds of people attend a vigil near the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow on December 28 . Eyewitnesses said Mr Clarke appeared to fall ill at the wheel of the vehicle before losing control and hitting Christmas shoppers on Queen Street. The truck eventually came to a halt when it crashed into the Millennium Hotel but it had already left many dead. John 'Jack' Sweeney, 68, his wife Lorraine, 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade were all shopping when struck and killed by the truck. Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh were also killed in the crash. Thousands of people have attended their funerals over the past month. Investigators for Police Scotland are expected to submit their final report on the tragedy to the Crown Office in the coming weeks. A probe of eyewitness accounts and technical data has been pieced together. The families of those killed in the crash have been constantly updated on how the investigation has been progressing.","Harry Clarke fell unconscious before refuse lorry hit shoppers in December .

"Toenails, hair and fecal matter are finding their way into Americans' pork under new, faster slaughterhouse regulations. Whistleblowers from inside the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have spoken out against a recent pilot program, saying they let harmful materials be passed on to consumers. They claim that fewer inspectors and higher speeds mean that abscesses, lesions, cystic kidneys and bladder stems are also being put into meat by companies such as Hormel. Whistleblower USDA meat inspectors have said that new regulations mean toenails, hair and fecal matter can make their way into the pork that people eat (file photo, Vermont, 2014) 'It's not whether or not people are going to eat sh** — they are. It's just how much,' one meat inspector said about the new HIMP regulations, according to documents released by the Government Accountability Project. The HIMP program, which stands for Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points Inspection Models Project, replaces government inspectors with slaughterhouse employees who check meat for contamination with oversight from USDA officials. It has been run as a pilot program in five slaughterhouses since the late 1990s and cut the number of government inspectors by about half in each plant. The changes are thought to increase the line speed of the meat factories from 1,100 to 1,300 hogs killed per hour, making it near impossible to check each pig carcass. Three of the five plants have numerous violations for health and safety issues, according to the Washington Post. Government inspectors, four of whom filed affidavits with the Government Accountability Project, said that there recommendations about safety were ignored by plant officials as well as their USDA higher-ups, who sided with the meat companies. The USDA whisteblowers say that it is impossible to properly check for contamination when 1,300 hogs are being processed an hour (file photo, Iowa) One affidavit from a current USDA inspector said that more than 20 per cent of the pigs going through the killing process are contaminated (file photo) 'It seems like the USDA is doing all it can to make sure the HIMP program succeeds in this plant, even if it means betraying consumers by hiding the truth about their food,' an inspector said. Government inspectors are protected by federal whistleblower laws. Joe Ferguson, a recently retired inspector who worked checking meat for 23 years, points out that Hormel owns three of the five plants currently running the new system and former Undersecretary for Food Safety Elsa Murano is on its board. He said that food safety bureaucrats 'are in bed with' the industry. One affidavit says that more than 20 per cent of the pigs going through the killing process are contaminated with some sort of undesirable material. Another says that plant employees now tasked with checking for contamination are afraid to shut down production for fear of losing their jobs. 'Personally, I will not eat any products that bear the name of the company for which this meat is produced. I don’t think that it is wholesome or safe to consume,' Mr Ferguson said. Critics of the new HIMP pork inspection system warn that unwanted materials on the pig carcasses can lead to contamination in consumers' meat, which has been known to lead to bacterial infections . The inspection changes mirror the new rules for poultry production, which were approved despite similar outcry and whistleblowing over food safety issues. Under the poultry system, one inspector was responsible for checking 10,000 birds per hour. USDA officials released an evaluation of the pork HIMP plan in November and said that the five factories in the program are performing just as well as those that have not adopted it. The Food Safety and Inspection Service says that the new process is more efficient, though a spokesman said that the agency is not sure if it will expand the program. Contaminated pork is commonly associated with food poisoning bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella, as well as the trichinosis parasite.","USDA inspectors say new pork inspection program is unsafe .

"Britain's top prosecutor has been forced to deny the country's first female genital mutilation case was a 'show trial' amid complaints that the charges came just four days before she gave evidence to MPs. A jury cleared Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of FGM in just 25 minutes after hearing he gave a previously-circumcised mother a 1.5cm stitch after she gave birth. Now the Home Affairs Select Committee will put fresh questions to Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who defended the decision to bring the case to trial in a heated interview today. Grilling: Top prosecutor Alison Saunders (left) will face more questions from Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz (right), who said 'hasty' FGM charges were brought days before a previous meeting . She appeared before the committee in a highly-publicised hearing about FGM on March 25 last year - just four days after charges were brought against Dr Dharmasena. Today committee chairman Keith Vaz said the charges appeared to have been brought too soon. 'This prosecution appears to have been borne in haste, 72 hours [sic] before the DPP appeared before the committee,' he told The Independent. 'We shall seek an explanation from Alison Saunders as to what she thinks went wrong and what she is doing to ensure successful prosecutions and convictions in the future.' Ms Saunders defended bringing the case to court today after being told it was 'ludicrous and insulting to survivors of FGM'. She refused to go into detail about the alleged offence itself - but said prosecutors had little choice but to pursue a respected doctor because back-street 'cutters' are almost impossible to find. 'We prosecute the cases that are referred to us,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'We can't go out and target an individual. We know FGM is an incredibly difficult crime for female victims to come forward and make a complaint. 'Normally there are family and friends involved. The chances of a young girl coming into a police station to make a complaint about that are remote. That classic case is going to be a very difficult one to find.' A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson added: 'We make our decisions entirely independently and the timing is based purely on operational reasons - police refer cases to us and we consider the evidence as swiftly as we are able.' Cleared: A jury took just 25 minutes to clear Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of performing FGM after hearing  the 32-year-old was faced with a 'nightmarish scenario' when a patient cut at the age of six went into labour . A court heard Dr Dharmasena, 32, was faced with a 'nightmarish scenario' when he discovered the woman had been mutilated as she went into emergency labour at London's Whittington Hospital. Originally from Somalia, she had been circumcised in a ritual ceremony at the age of six. Then a junior registrar who had no training on FGM, he performed a simple 'figure-of-eight' stitch after the child was born to stop her bleeding - which prosecutors saw as a repeat of the original act. Bosses at the hospital said after operation in November 2012 that Dr Dharmasena should have sutured the area on either side, a different surgical procedure. Lawyer Ali Hussain, who represented Dr Dharmasena's co-accused Hasan Mohamed, 41, branded the case a 'show trial' which provoked 'months of stress and humiliation'. 'He should not have been prosecuted and the jury's verdict confirms what he has always said - that he did nothing wrong,' he said. 'My client strongly believes this case was nothing more than a show trial - an effort by the CPS to regain some confidence after failing to bring a prosecution despite FGM laws being in place since 1985.' Dr Dharmasena's defence barrister Zoe Johnson QC told the jury at Southwark Crown Court he had been 'hung out to dry and made a scapegoat' for hospital failings. Case: A sketch of the respected doctor at Southwark Crown Court. He said FGM was an 'abhorrent practice' The doctor, of Ilford, Essex, was cleared of performing female genital mutilation. Mr Mohamed was cleared of abetting him. Both men said they had always believed FGM was a disgusting act. Dr Dharmasena said: 'I have always maintained that FGM is an abhorrent practice that has no medical justification. 'I would like to thank my family, friends, legal team and all those who supported me through this difficult time and I look forward to putting this matter behind me.' And Mr Mohamed's lawyer told the Today programme: 'He's made absolutely clear what his views are on FGM. It is a horrible practice.' The landmark case faced criticism from the start. When the charges were announced last March Dr Katrina Erskine, an experienced gynaecologist, warned it risked putting politics before women's lives. 'Doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate, at the very least, before intervening,' she wrote in the Daily Mail. 'In certain situations, that potentially could cost a new mother her life. Blame game: Zoe Johnson, defending, told the court her client 'has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital (pictured) and their failings'. The doctor had no training on FGM . The tradition of female genital mutilation (FGM) originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 African countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and spread across the world as groups emigrated. The circumcision or 'cutting' is carried out for cultural reasons, including to demonstrate a girl's virginity on her wedding night. In cultures where the tradition is common, 'uncut' girls can be thought more likely to be promiscuous, unhygienic, and prone to diseases such as HIV/Aids, despite an absence of medical evidence. The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman with no medical training and without any anaesthetic or antiseptics, risking infection. Their basic tools include knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. Iodine or a mixture of herbs is placed on the wound to stop the bleeding. FGM is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman's outer sexual organs. It can also involve sewing up the vagina. It has been illegal in Britain since 1985, but this was the first prosecution to be brought. Campaigners believe as many as 66,000 women now living in the UK may have suffered FGM, with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk. 'Where pregnant women arrive in British hospitals having already had FGM, surely it's obvious that the only person guilty of that quite properly criminal act is whoever carried out the original mutilation. 'It's certainly not the doctor or midwife, who is simply trying to stop any bleeding and mend any tears after the trauma of childbirth.' 'My concern is that following the DPP's decision to prosecute a British hospital doctor, doctors and midwives will think twice about doing what they know to be medically right. 'Stitching up a woman who has had FGM after she has given birth is not the same as carrying out the mutilation itself, and it's outrageous that the two things could possibly be confused.' But Ms Saunders insisted today: 'The legislation is designed to make FGM a crime no matter who commits it and it's not just about an original cutting of a young girl, normally when they're very young. 'This case was reviewed very thoroughly by the Crown Prosecution Service and we decided there was enough evidence to put it before the court. 'The spirit of the legislation is that FGM whoever it's committed by is an offence. It is a crime. There are exceptions if it's necessary for a woman's mental of physical health. 'The jury had considered all the evidence and seen it tested and heard it tested. They apply a very different test to us. 'If we stopped every case that went before a jury in an acquittal we would look at things very differently. This is the way our system works. The jury hears the evidence, it's tested, and the jury came to a very different conclusion to the one we did.' She added: 'I would encourage any survivors of FGM to come forward and talk about it because that's the important thing.'","Jury took 25 minutes to clear Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena in first FGM trial .

"The burning alive of a Muslim man by the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has jolted the president of the United States into acknowledging publicly that the world's chief terror threat comes from people who 'profess to stand up for Islam but instead betray it.' But that stark conclusion, long missing in the White House, was followed by a litany of other wrongs done in the name of religion. 'Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place,' Obama told the National Prayer breakfast on Thursday morning, 'remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.' 'In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.' But 'no God condones terror,' he insisted. Scroll down for videos . President Barack Obama delivered remarks during the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, taking a more aggressive tone against ISIS and saying they 'profess to stand up for Islam but instead betray it' Obama (on screen) addressed the event in Washington, DC, hammering the ISIS Islamist radicals while the Dalai Lama (2nd right) listened . PRAYER: Obama has spoken at the annual event every year since his presidency began . Early in his speech Obama hinted at the ISIS terror army by noting that 'professions of faith' have been 'used both as an instrument of great good, but also twisted and misused in the name of evil.' Faith, he said, is often 'twisted and distorted, used as a wedge, or worse, sometimes used as a weapon.' Then he got specific. 'From a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by people who profess to stand up for faith – their faith – (who) profess to stand up for Islam but in fact are betraying it,' Obama said. 'You see ISIL,' he continued, referring to ISIS by his preferred alternate acronym, 'a brutal, vicious death cult that in the name of religion carried out unspeakable acts of barbarism, terrorizing religious minorities like the Yezidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.' JUST AS BAD? Obama compared the ISIS terror army to the 15th Century Spanich Inquisition, carried out by Catholics against Jews and other religious groups . SLAVERY: Obama said America's early human bondage was often justified in the name of Jesus Christ . Obama also condemned Syria's intra-Islam sectarian conflicts, Nigeria's runaway tide of murders hitting both Muslims and Christians, a religious war in the Central African Republic and 'antisemitism and hate crimes' in Europe as evidence that bad actors 'seek to hijack religions for their own murderous ends.' His clear linkage of ISIS with Islam stands in sharp contrast to his January 16 joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. While Cameron came out swinging against 'a very serious Islamist extremist terrorist threat in Europe, in America, (and) across the world,' Obama declined to frame ISIS as a radical Muslim sect, calling them 'terrorists' and 'fanatics' instead. Keeping with his administration's policy to label foreign fighters as 'terrorists,' Obama would not refer to the religion of ISIS militants during the White House news conference but at one point called them 'fanatics.' The White House has scheduled a 'combating violent extremism' summit for later in February, and Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest has taken great pains to avoid giving the impression that it might be particularly critical of a narrow group of Muslims. But the gruesome videotaped murder of Jordanian Air Force pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh may have shaken the White House into a more aggressive posture since its online release on Tuesday. ISIS militants are seen in the footage burning the 26-year-old man alive as he struggles in a giant animal cage, and then burying his charred body, twisted cage and all, under a cascade of broken concrete. Jordanian intelligence officials believe the grisly execution was carried out as early as January 3, meaning Al-Kaseasbeh was dead long before the Obama-Cameron press conference. WHAT A DIFFERENCE THREE WEEKS CAN MAKE: Obama shied away from hitting ISIS as a Muslim group during a press conference with UK Prime Minister David Cameron on January 16, while Cameron leapt at the chance to castigate the group in religious terms . 'DEATH CULT': Obama slammed ISIS by name two days after the group released a video showing a Jordanian pilot who had run a bombing mission against them being burned alive . Jordan's King Abdullah II was scheduled to read a passage of Qur'anic scripture at the prayer breakfast but did not appear: He was back in his home country dealing with the fallout from al-Kaseasbeh's death and the wrath of a country bent on revenge. Abdullah ordered the execution of two al-Qaeda prisoners in retaliation. The prayer breakfast, an annual event that Obama has attended every year since becoming president, attracted 3,600 people from all 50 states and 130 countries. Its most conspicuous guest on Thursday was the Dalai Lama, a revered Tibetan monk embroiled in a long political dispute with China over Tibet's independence. He has never before attended a public event with an American president, as American administrations have been cautious about antagonizing Beijing. But Obama said Thursday that he had welcomed him to the White House on several occasions and considered the Lama 'a good friend.' The holy man was seated at the front-most round table in a cavernous ballroom along with presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett and other dignitaries, directly in front of the speakers' podium. He is 'a powerful example of what it means to practice and act,' Obama said. 'He inspires speak up for freedom and dignity of all human beings.'","President appeared at annual prayer event attended by 3,600 people from all 50 states and 130 countries .

"Bobby Brown's wife is expecting their second child together - as his daughter Bobbi Kristina continues to fight for her life. The R&B star's wife Alicia Etheredge is four months pregnant, according to TMZ, and they have been telling relatives in recent days. But the happy news comes as Brown's 21-year-old daughter with Whitney Houston remains in a medically-induced coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. On Wednesday, Brown, 46, and Etheredge, 41, were joined by his daughter LaPrincia as they headed to Bobbi Kristina Brown's bedside, four days after she was found face down in a bathtub. Scroll down for video . Emotional turmoil: Bobby Brown and his reportedly wife Alicia Etheredge head towards Emory University Hospital on Wednesday morning to visit his daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown . 'Pregnant': Etheredge is said to be four months pregnant but she hid any sign of a bump beneath her scarf . The couple, who married in June 2012, stayed largely silent as they walked to the hospital. They already have one son together, five-year-old Cassius, and Brown has four other children from previous relationships: Landon, 28; LaPrincia, 24; Bobby Jr., 22' and Bobbi Kristina. Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in her bathtub at her Roswell, Georgia on Saturday by her purported husband, Nick Gordon - nearly three years after her mother, Whitney Houston, died after being found in eerily similar circumstances. According to reports, Brown has been told that there is little hope his daughter will pull through. 'It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,' a source told FOX411. 'They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.' During tests for brain activity, she briefly opened her eyes and doctors have found 'minimal' improvement in her brain function, TMZ reported earlier this week. Her father is reported to be remaining hopeful and is refusing to acknowledge the worst-case scenario. Fears: Doctors have told Brown there is little they can do for his daughter, Bobbi Kristina, left . Vigil: Nick Gordon, Bobbi Kristina's partner, was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where she was first taken, on Sunday. He and a friend discovered her face-down in a bathtub at their home on Saturday . On Wednesday, it emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found on Saturday morning. Police said Gordon attempted to revive her while a friend called 911, and that she was alive when taken to hospital. Gordon's friend, Max Lomas, has since claimed he was the one who rushed to her aid. Now Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported. Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Bobby Brown has had his own share of drug troubles, including how he admitted to using 'an awful lot' of cocaine after marrying Whitney Houston in 1992. Among his multiple arrests, he was nabbed in 2012 for DUI and completed a stint in rehab in August of that year for alcohol addiction - before being arrested for another DUI just three months later. In 2013, he served just nine hours behind bars after pleading no contest to suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Together: Bobbi Kristina is pictured in her younger years with her mother Whitney Houston and father Bobby . Growing family: Bobby Brown and his wife are pictured center with his other children, from left, Landon, 28, LaPrincia, 24, five-year-old Cassius and Bobby Jr., 22 . On Tuesday, Brown spoke out again through his lawyer to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Following Houston's death three years ago, Bobbi entered into a relationship with Gordon - a sort-of surrogate brother after her mother welcomed him into their home when he was 12. Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.","Bobby Brown's wife Alicia Etheredge, 41, is four months pregnant with their second child, according to reports .

"Alissa Afonina, pictured here as a child, was a talented student who aspired to be a filmmaker . A formerly bright student who suffered brain injuries in a car crash has been awarded $1.5 million in damages after a judge ruled that her injuries led to her working as a dominatrix. Canadian Alissa Afonina. 23, aspired to be a filmmaker or actress and was in the top two per cent of her class before the August 2008 car crash, just before her final year of high school. Witnesses say the Toyota Tacoma she was travelling in was speeding when it ran off a wet road into a ditch, ending up on its side near Salmon Arm, British Colombia. The car was being driven by her mother's boyfriend at the time, Peter Jannson. Afonina's brother, Alexei, and mother, Alla, were also passengers. Both Afonina and her mother were injured. When she returned to school Afonina showed no impulse control, had frequent outbursts, made sexually inappropriate comments, and found following through on tasks difficult. She became isolated and dropped out of high school to finish 12th Grade at home. After briefly attending college, she began working as a dominatrix named Sasha Mizaree. In court in January, Justice Joel Grove concluded that Jannson was driving too fast in the wet road conditions and was therefore negligent. However, the case against Jannson centered not on whether Afonina’s brain injury was a result of the crash, but on whether it caused such a change in personality that she ended up working as a dominatrix, unable to hold down other employment. Her lawyers argued that her decision to go into sex work showed a lack of ‘correct thinking’ and that her cognitive function had been impaired leading her to undertake unnecessary risks. After the crash Afonina, 23,  showed no impulse control, would make sexually inappropriate comments and suffered from outbursts. She became isolated and eventually began working as a dominatrix . As a dominatrix Afonina is known as Sasha Mizaree and has a heavy presence on social media. A judge ruled that her injuries in the crash had directly led to her inability to pursue her original academic and career goals . Jannson’s lawyer argued that her work as a dominatrix proved she was able to organize herself and was able to maintain a modest level of income and employment. Grove concluded that there was some truth in both arguments concerning the link between the accident and Afonina’s sex work. He noted that as a dominatrix she was able to keep appointments, collect money, support herself and meet deadlines, all of which showed an ability to hold down a job. However, he also noted that she had not minimized the risks associated with her work and had not implemented an alarm system or other safety measures, which is evidence of diminished judgment supporting a theory of frontal lobe damage. Grove concluded that after the crash Afonina struggled to cope in a normal way, and the brain injury stopped her from succeeding at her academic and employment goals. She is now only qualified and able to deal with entry level jobs for a few hours a day. Without the injury, she could have completed college or university and been qualified for a better job. Afonina was awarded $1.5 million in damages after a judge ruled that without her injuries she would not have struggled as she has and would have been able to complete college and get a job . Afonina was therefore awarded $825,000 for ‘future capacity loss’, $376,000 for the cost of future care, $300,000 for pain and suffering, and $23,000 for special damages, totaling $1.5 million. A further claim for an inability to form relationships due to her isolation and sexual and general impulsivity – that she is ‘damaged goods’ – was dismissed due a lack of evidence. Her mother, Alla, was also awarded $943,000 in damages for a mild traumatic brain injury sustained in the accident. The former employee of British Columbia Housing will get $400,000 for future capacity loss, $195,000 for pain and suffering, $158,000 for past wage loss, $131,000 for cost of future care and $59,000 for special damages.","High school student Alissa Afonina and her mother suffered brain injuries in an August 2008 car crash in British Columbia .

"A new study has revealed there are a total of just 93 women mentioned in the Bible - and they speak only 1.1 per cent of the time. Reverend Lindsay Hardin Freeman led a three-year search of the Bible's New Revised Standard Version to count every single word spoken by females. Along with her dedicated team of three volunteer helpers, they discovered that of the 93 women, only 49 were named - and together they spoke a grand total of 14,056 words. Mary: Pope Benedict XVI is seen here with an image of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. The study found that women speak a total of 14,056 words in the Bible - representing a total of 1.1 per cent of all words . Rev. Freeman said: 'We were stunned nobody had done this before. I wanted to know what women in the Bible really said. 'We found that all these books looked at what women did, but not what the women said. We wanted to hold up their words, and bring them to life.' The women met and studied the book in the Trinity Episcopal Church in Excelsior, Minnesota, where Freeman was serving as rector when the research started. Their painstaking study revealed that Mary, the mother of Jesus, speaks just 191 words, while Mary Magdalene says only 61 words and Sarah, the wife of Abraham, is attributed with 141 words. Meanwhile, Eve - perhaps the Bible's best-known woman - speaks only 74 words, and Judith, from the Book of Judith, has the most words spoken with a grand total of 2,689 . An unnamed Samaritan woman, who has the longest recorded conversation with Jesus in the Bible, speaks a total of just 151 words. It is estimated that the Bible contains around 1.1 million words in total. Silent: Eve - perhaps the Bible's best-known woman - speaks only 74 words in the Bible. The study was carried out by Reverend Lindsay Hardin Freeman who said: 'We wanted to hold up their words, and bring them to life' Rev. Freeman said many of the females endured 'tremendous trauma' in the book and said: 'We are just finally finding out their stories.' She told the Huffington Post: 'We have for whatever reason overlooked the witness of women in the Bible for all these thousands of years and all the contributions they've made to the faith and to world history. 'We have cried over these stories, we have laughed over these stories. Our faith has been increased.' Holy book: The women studied the 1.1million words Bible's New Revised Standard Version to count every single word spoken by women . The Bible does contain references to when women should be allowed to speak, and one interpretation of 1 Corinthians, suggests Paul wrote that women ""should remain silent"" while in church. Rev. Freeman is an expert on the subject of female roles in the Holy Book and is also the author of 'The Scarlet Cord: Conversations With God's Chosen Women' which studied the stories of 12 women in the Bible. Their findings have been published in a book called 'Bible Women: All Their Words and Why They Matter'.","Painstaking search finds total of 14,056 words spoken by women .

"A Princeton graduate accused of killing his multimillionaire father over an argument about a cut in his allowance has pleaded not guilty  to murder today. Tommy Gilbert Jr, 30, is accused of shooting Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, in the head at his luxury Manhattan home last month. The 6'3' former aspiring model appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court on Thursday handcuffed and dressed in his Department of Corrections orange jumpsuit with prison-issue sneakers. His blonde surfer locks were cropped short and his once-groomed facial hair was now long and unkempt. Scroll down for video . Tommy Gilbert Jr, 30, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the second-degree murder of his father during a hearing at Manhattan Criminal Court . Gilbert Jr, 30, appeared in court today with his hands cuffed behind his back. He has been charged with shooting Thomas Gilbert Sr in the head at his luxury Manhattan home in a row over his allowance last month . Gilbert Jr, who attended the prestigious Deerfield Academy prior to Princeton and was seen at some of Manhattan's most exclusive society events, was charged with second-degree murder and related crimes. Seated with his defense attorney, Alex Spiro, Gilbert responded in a deep, level voice: 'Not guilty.' The defendant remained seated at a table with hands cuffed behind his back during the brief appearance, nervously tapping his feet on the floor. A court officer stood behind his chair and another officer to the side. Defense attorney Alex Spiro objected to the presence of press photographers in court to Judge Jackson. His request was denied. Mr Spiro said outside court that his objection  was because the murder case is circumstantial without eyewitnesses. 'Because of the garb that they had him wearing, I think it's prejudicial to have his photo published,' the lawyer said. He didn't comment further. Spiro is a Harvard-educated criminal lawyer from one of the city's top firms. It's not clear who is paying the attorney's fee. Gilbert's next court date has been set for April 30. He is being held without bail at Rikers Island. Gilbert remained seated during the brief hearing at the court where he was kept company by courts officers . Gilbert's defense attorney Alex Spiro (left) is a Harvard-educated lawyer. It is unclear who is paying his fees . A grand jury voted to indict Gilbert last month over the death of his 70-year-old father, boss of $200million Wainscott Capital Partners. The New York Medical Examiner's office confirmed to Daily Mail Online last month that Gilbert Sr. died of a gunshot wound. An autopsy ruled his cause of death as a homicide. Thomas Gilbert Sr was found dead by his wife Shelley in the bedroom of his luxury midtown apartment on January 4, shot once in the head. Gilbert Jr. had allegedly tried to stage the body to make it look like a suicide - placing the .40-caliber Glock pistol on his chest. He allegedly murdered his father after he cut the 30-year-old's allowance from $600 a week to $400 and threatened to stop paying the rent on his $2,400-a-month Chelsea apartment, according to authorities. Police found a case for the weapon, as well as extra magazines and ammunition at Gilbert Jr.'s apartment when they broke down the door and found him hiding out there hours after the murder. Gilbert Jr answered not guilty to charges of second-degree murder and related crimes in court in New York on Thursday . Gilbert Jr confers with his defense attorney in the Manhattan courtroom. The defendant is due back in court on April 30 . Gilbert Jr was arrested on murder charges the following day. Investigators also discovered a skimming device - used for stealing credit card numbers - and 21 blank credit cards inside the ground-floor home. The death of Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70,  was ruled a homicide last month after he suffered a gunshot wound to the head . Gilbert Jr. is also the main suspect in a September blaze that destroyed a historic Hamptons mansion that belonged to the family of a former friend-turned love rival, according to multiple reports. The New York Post reported that Gilbert Jr. burned down the home belonging to the family of Peter Smith Jr. because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend. Three days after the blaze - which razed the 19th-century mansion - Gilbert Jr. was arrested by Southampton police for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr. He was later released on bail, though that trial remains ongoing. He has not been charged with any crime related to the fire. Gilbert Jr., was a fixture at New York society events - often seen with a different women on his arm at charity galas and parties. But he was jobless, and didn't seem to have any interest in finding serious employment - despite graduating from Princeton with a degree in economics. Instead, friends said, he was a yoga enthusiast and gym rat who spent most of his time at his family's $10million Hamptons home, where he enjoyed surfing. Gilbert Sr. was a longtime Wall Street fixture, who ran the $200million hedge fund Wainscott Capital. His son's ex girlfriend, twice-divorced Manhattan socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, said Tommy was obsessed with his father. He frequently complained about how controlling he was with money and said that his father was hard on him. Gilbert Jr. said he was upset because 'nothing he ever did was good enough' for his dad, Ms Rothschild said. Friends and family said that Gilbert Jr. suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had become more severe in recent years and made his behavior increasingly erratic. When he went to his parents' apartment on January 4 to confront his father, he sent his 70-year-old mother out and get him a sandwich and a soda. When she was gone, he is believed to have killed his father, investigators say. His mother, Shelley, returned 15 minutes later because she had a 'bad feeling' and found her husband had been executed.

"A box of ammunition that dropped out of a helicopter during military exercises overnight was found Thursday in the Miami-Dade area. The training practices were taking place throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties, and are a joint effort between the local law enforcement and the military.

No further information will be released at this time,' the US Army said in a statement released Thursday. Officials were asking anyone who may have come in contact with the missing box to call 911 immediately. People were urged not to handle or move the ammo box, and wait for law enforcement officials to safely secure it. ‘As in all training exercises, the safety of service members and the local community is top priority, and every precaution will be taken to mitigate risks for the safety of all,’ Miami-Dade police said in a statement.

"Paddington has become the highest-ever grossing non-Hollywood family film after banking $200million at the box office. The independently-made film, which follows the adventures of the marmalade-loving bear, has proved to be a huge hit around the world. But global takings for the family movie, based on Michael Bond’s book series, still fall well short of the $1.3billion made by Disney’s animated blockbuster Frozen. Scroll down for video . Paddington has become the highest-ever grossing non-Hollywood family film after banking $200million at the box office . Paddington, which was released in November last year and stars Ben Whishaw as the voice of the Peruvian bear, cost $55million to make compared to Frozen’s $150million, the Guardian reports. The film made by David Heyman, the producer of Harry Potter and Gravity, sees the duffle coat-wearing bear dispatched from his native jungle by his aunt Lucy following an earthquake. Earlier this week, it was revealed that it had taken just over £34million in Britain last year helping home-grown independent films to capture their highest market share of the UK box office at 16 per cent. The independently-made film, starring Hugh Bonneville (pictured), has proved to be a huge hit around the world . Before its release, the British Board of Film Classification gave Paddington’ a parental guidance rating, saying it contained ‘dangerous behavior, mild threat, mild sex references and mild bad language.’ The development left the bear’s creator Michael Bond ‘totally amazed’. The rating means the film is suitable for general viewing but some scenes may be unsuitable for children under 8 years old. The board said the film's scenes of dangerous behavior included Paddington hiding inside a refrigerator.","Paddington has taken $200milllion at box offices, it has been revealed .

"A woman died after swallowing 20 paracetamol tablets in 20 hours to treat chronic earache. Rebecca Jeffs, 31, was admitted to hospital after taking more than twice the recommended dosage of the painkiller. She was kept in for five days as doctors tried to reverse the effects of the drug and treat her earache. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Jeffs died after she took an accidental overdose of painkillers to treat a severe ear infection . However, two days after she was discharged she was found dead at her partner’s home having suffered fatal damage to her lungs as a result of the overdose. An inquest in Bolton was told the former care worker had previously suffered from abdominal pains and had a history of insomnia for which she was prescribed the sleeping tablet zopliclone. Her mother Elizabeth Carter said her daughter began self medicating and at one point had been taking between 30 and 50 zopliclone tablets a day after they were ordered off the internet. This was later brought under control. Miss Jeffs had also previously taken accidental overdoses of paracetamol and ibuprofen. Miss Jeffs was admitted to Royal Bolton Hospital after the overdose but discharged and died two days later . In July last year she was admitted to hospital as a result of taking too much paracetamol because of the abdominal pain. Then last October Miss Jeffs developed an ear infection and had taken two paracetamol pills every two hours over a 20-hour period. Dr Salil Singh, consultant physician at the Royal Bolton Hospital, said she had also taken double the dose of ibuprofen and zopliclone. She was administered with a drug to reverse the effect of the paracetamol overdose which he said had appeared to have worked. She was also prescribed oxycodone to treat the ear pain and given antibiotics. Dr Arun Ramachandran from the hospital’s ear, nose and throat unit told the inquest she found the pain so severe she begged to be given morphine. He said: ‘She had a long standing history of right ear infection. I saw some evidence of infection and started her on antibiotics. 'She was complaining of severe pain and was very clear that paracetamol was not going to work, ibuprofen was not going to work. She wanted morphine, she was very clear.’ Bolton Coroners' Court heard Miss Jeffs had taken accidental overdoses in the past and had self medicated . The former carer had previously gone to hospital after suffering severe abdominal pain and then an earache . He said a decision was made to discharge Miss Jeffs on October 7 as the infection had more or less cleared. Two days later, however, she was found dead at her home in Westhoughton, near Bolton. Pathologist Dr Patrick Waugh said tests showed Miss Jeffs’ lungs were damaged and that she had a slightly congested liver. Recording a verdict of misadventure coroner Simon Jones said: ‘I’m satisfied she had an ear infection, had taken an overdose of paracetamol and taken to hospital, they had to treat that and stop the damage and deal with the ear infection…Problems have developed after discharge.’ He said she had developed lung damage as a result of the overdose. In January 2011 fitness instructor Donna Bishop, 25, died from liver failure after overdosing on Lemsip and paracetamol to treat a cold.

"Jack Wilshere is at the centre of another smoking controversy after a picture emerged of the Arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub. The England star, 23, is recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by Manchester United in November and is expected to make a first-team return by the end of the month. This picture of Wilshere posing with friends and holding the pipe, reportedly taken at a London nightclub last week, was uploaded to Instagram on Tuesday before being removed, but then subsequently reposted on Twitter, leading to criticism from fans on the social media network.

He was pictured holding a cigarette outside a London nightclub in 2013 and again at a pool party in Las Vegas last summer after the World Cup finals in Brazil.

"A group of disillusioned British jihadists who wanted to return home after fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have been taken prisoner by their militant commanders. The men were stripped of their weapons and marched to a punishment centre in the militant-held city of Raqqa in Syria, according to reports. The five Britons were accompanied by three Frenchmen, two Germans and two Belgians. They had complained that they were spending their time fighting other rebel forces instead of the government of Bashar al-Assad and were concerned that they were killing fellow Muslims. Scroll down for video . Five British jihadists who wanted to return home after fighting for Islamic State have been taken prisoners . The men were rounded up after apparently delaying returning to Britain for fear that they would be arrested on arrival. But security sources say the new development shows that defectors cannot afford to try to bargain with British authorities and should just ‘drop their weapons and leave’. Until now, IS is thought to have operated an open door policy which has allowed around 250 Britons to return but the start of US air attacks has made militant commanders paranoid that spies could direct attacks. It means that the formerly welcoming atmosphere for Western militants has now changed to suspicion as the terrorist group begins to turn on its own fighters, according to one security source. The map shows the control that the extremist Islamic group has gained in Syria and Iraq . The source said the round-up of Westerners is a new development and it is ‘impossible to predict the outcome’. Haras Rafiq, of the counter-extremism think-tank Quilliam, whose members include former fighters, said: ‘It is very dangerous to expose your identity if you want to come back in case IS find out who you are. Anyone who wants to leave, should just leave.’ He said the authorities should still arrest those who have committed crimes abroad, but there also needed to be an option to help reintegrate any who are able to demonstrate that they have ‘genuinely changed’. It comes after a group of four Britons nick-named ‘the Beatles’ are thought to have become so integrated with IS that one appeared in videos beheading US hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff. IS has spent much of its time carving out a caliphate straddling the border of Syria and Iraq, rather than fighting Assad’s forces. More than 500 Britons have travelled over to join the guerrilla group and around half are thought to have returned, 40 of whom were arrested. About 20 Britons are believed to have been killed in the civil war in Syria. James Foley, an experienced US freelance reporter, was killed by IS thugs after he was kidnapped in Syria . The grieving mother of a US journalist beheaded by IS thugs has condemned the Obama administration for its lukewarm efforts to save her son. Diane Foley said she was ‘embarrassed and appalled’ by the American authorities’ handling of her son James’s kidnapping. ‘I really feel our country let Jim down,’ she added. In an interview with CNN on the anniversary of 9/11, she said her family were even threatened with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom to free Mr Foley, 40. ‘Jim was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritisation,’ she added.","The men had their weapons taken and went to the area in Raqqa, Syria .
The five Britons were with three Frenchmen, two Germans and two Belgians .
They had complained of fighting other rebel forces, not the government .
They were also concerned that they were killing fellow Muslims ."
"A New York man who was arrested for shoplifting appears to have modeled his mouth on the Joker character Heath Ledger played in 2008's The Dark Knight. Anthony MacDowell, 20, of Utica was charged with petit larceny after he allegedly was seen taking $620.07 worth of merchandise from a Walmart. The misdemeanor charge is punishable by up to one year in jail. Scroll down for video . Anthony MacDowell, 20, of Utica (left) was arrested for shoplifting. After his mugshot was posted online, people noticed that his mouth looked similar to the one on Heath Ledger's Joker (right) Store security workers told the Utica Police Department that when they tried to stop MacDowell from taking the merchandise, he fled. A police officer found the young man in a nearby Bass Pro Shop and arrested him. The UPD posted MacDowell's mugshot on Facebook and people began to realize his resemblance to the iconic Batman characteR. The 28-year-old actor was posthumously given an Academy Award for his performance. The first person to comment on the department's post quoted a line from the film: 'Why so serious?' Many more people followed that remark with jokes about MacDowell's appearance. The distinctive facial cuts are known as a Glasgow Smile.

"A Battle Creek man who was granted a new trial after his conviction in the 1995 fire-related deaths of two young brothers in southern Michigan has been freed following a plea deal in the case. Andrew Babick, 48, who had been serving a life sentence for felony murder, left the Calhoun County courthouse Wednesday, the Battle Creek Enquirer reported. Babick was granted a new trial in November after the Michigan Innocence Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School argued he was convicted because of faulty science pointing to arson. 'I want to thank you guys with all of my heart,' Babick said as he embraced family in the courthouse parking lot. 'I am so happy that it is finally over. I am sad for the family but happy that it is over.' Relief: Andrew Babick embraces family members after leaving the Calhoun County courthouse in Battle Creek, Michigan on Wednesday after serving 18 years in prison for killing two boys in a house fire . Rather than going to trial, Babick pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in an agreement with the state attorney general's office. Babick had already served 18 years in prison, more than the 15-year maximum penalty for the new charge, so Judge Sarah Lincoln ordered his release. He was accused of starting a house fire in September 1995 because he was mad at the quality of crack cocaine he had bought from a man at the house earlier that day. Babick denied that. Two adults escaped, but three-year-old Le'Daryus Fields and two-year-old Le'Tonio Briggs died. Babick was convicted and then sentenced December 20, 1996. In his guilty plea, Babick said he fell asleep on a couch on the porch of the house while smoking a cigarette. Imran Syed, an attorney for the Innocence Clinic, said Babick, who entered prison with a drug addition, is a changed man and has a nearly flawless prison record. He has written childrens’ books with Biblical messages, completed a two-year correspondence course and worked three years to train for adoption of retired Greyhound racing dogs, he said. Convicted: Babick was accused of setting a house on fire - and killing the boys - after he became angry at a drug dealer who sold him poor quality crack cocaine. But he said he fell asleep with a cigarette on the couch . Scene: The boys, aged two and three, died in a fire on the corner of this road in Battle Creek in 1995 . 'He has reformed himself,' Syed said. Before he was released, the mother and sister of the dead boys spoke to the court and told the Enquirer that she struggled to understand how Babick was walking free. 'The last time I was in a courtroom was when this man was sentenced for murdering my two sons,' Jacqueline Caldwell said. 'How do I end up with two deaths and he can come out and hug his family? I was told he would get two life sentences. I told him I would forgive him but I would never forget.' LeKiya Fields, 24, said she was only five when her brothers were killed. 'I forgive this man, but after taking two lives he can make up for the time that was lost, but I can't,' she said. 'I am reminded of my brothers in an obituary.'","Andrew Babick, 48, was convicted of felony murder after three-year-old Le'Daryus Fields and two-year-old Le'Tonio Briggs died in a house fire .

"Dozens of men were yesterday charged with a wide range of sex crimes against vulnerable girls after two separate police investigations. Following a ‘milestone’ operation by Northumbria Police, 20 suspects appeared in court to face charges including rape, sexual assault and sex trafficking. The alleged offences involved 12 victims, including one girl who was aged just 13, with officers vowing to continue their investigation into the abuse of vulnerable children. Scroll down for video . Dozens of men were yesterday charged with a wide range of sex crimes against vulnerable girls after two separate police investigations . In a separate case, 25 men from Halifax, West Yorkshire, were charged with a number of historic and child-related sex offences. Almost all of the men in both cases are from Asian backgrounds, prompting police leading one of the cases to warn that far-Right groups may use the issue to stir up racial tension. Northumbria Police launched Operation Sanctuary when two women walked into a police station 13 months ago and made a number of allegations. A total of 31 suspects have already been charged as part of the operation. The victims associated with the latest charges are aged between 13 and 25. The accused men appeared at Bedlington magistrates’ court yesterday to be charged with a long list of offences including arranging child prostitution, false imprisonment and supplying Class A drugs. Deputy Chief Constable Steve Ashman, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Today marks a milestone in this operation. Since the first allegations were made over a year ago we have painstakingly left no stone unturned. To date, this part of the investigation has involved speaking to over 100 potential complainants. Pledge: Justice Goddard . The troubled inquiry into historical child sex abuse will not report back until at least 2018, the judge appointed to run it has said. Lowell Goddard, who sits in New Zealand’s high court, insisted that she would not let the investigation into claims that Establishment paedophiles preyed on youngsters stretch out indefinitely. She spoke out amid anger that there is still no publication date for the Iraq Inquiry six years after chairman Sir John Chilcot began taking evidence on the build-up and consequences of the war. Justice Goddard, who was appointed by Home Secretary Theresa May, said she would ensure the inquiry did not risk running out of control by setting ‘achievable goals’ from the outset. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘An inquiry that drags on and does not have achievable goals, that cannot deliver is not an effective inquiry and I’m interested in conducting a very effective inquiry.’ The inquiry will investigate whether public bodies, including governments, political parties, charities, the Church, the BBC, public and private schools and the Armed Forces, failed to protect children. Justice Goddard, 66, was appointed after two previous chairmen were forced to resign over family links or friendships with people whose past actions were criticised. The inquiry was set up in July amid claims a child sex gang operated in Westminster in the 1980s. Asked if she felt equipped to take on the Establishment, Justice Goddard said: ‘I’m a judge so that’s not a new thing for me.’ ‘Operation Sanctuary will not end. It is a wide-ranging investigation into many different crimes of a sexual nature against vulnerable women and girls. Today’s charges are just one element of this.’ He continued: ‘Some people or groups may try to use Operation Sanctuary to build resentment. Anyone experiencing hate crime should report it to police and be reassured we will investigate thoroughly.’ The alleged offences in Halifax are said to have taken place between 2006 and 2011 and involved two victims – but predominantly one girl who was under 16 at the time. The charges include rape, people trafficking for sexual exploitation, sexual activity with a child under 16, voyeurism and sexual assault. All 25 of the accused men, aged between 23 and 42, were charged at Halifax Police Station on Wednesday and have been released on bail. They will appear before Calderdale magistrates’ court on February 12. The 20 men charged in connection with Operation Sanctuary were either bailed or remanded in custody before appearing at Newcastle Crown Court on February 16 and 17.

"A heavily-pregnant teenager on trial for the murder of her socialite mother claims she has no-one to defend her as her trial gets underway on the resort island of Bali. Heather Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and then stuffing her body inside a suitcase. If convicted the pair could be killed by firing squad. The 19-year-old reportedly made a desperate phone call to a US judge  because she had no Indonesian attorney to represent her. In addition her US lawyer withdrew from the case over a 'breakdown in communication,' according to the Chicago Tribune. Scroll down for video . Showing the strain: Pregnant Heather Mack, 19, reportedly made a desperate call to a US judge claiming she has no one to defend her . Co-defendent: Her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer is jointly charged with the murder of Sheila von Wiese-Mack . The pair have pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder and their cases are being tried separately in the Denpasar District Court in Bali. As Mack's trial got underway, the strain was visible on her face as she followed proceedings through an Indonesian interpreter. When the silver-coloured suitcase in which the folded body of Sheila Von-Wiese Mack is alleged to have been placed was shown to the three judges, it was revealed that her Indonesian lawyer had received only a part-payment from the trust fund. Within hours, Mack's US civil attorney Anthony Scifo, filed a motion to voluntarily withdraw from her case, citing a 'substantial breakdown in communication,' the Tribune reported. The court was shown the suitcase that Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was allegedly found stuffed inside, along with a set of blood stained sheets . Heather Mack, second right, listens intently to an Indonesian translator as the case against her begins at Denpasar District Court, Bali . The paper said that in three phone calls, a woman claiming to be Mack, told a law clerk in the office of Cook County judge Neil Cohen she needed help. The judge had previously said she could use some of the money her murdered mother has left in a trust fund for her. Mack reportedly said she had fired her attorneys and explained that she currently has no attorneys and doesn't know how to speak to the judge, the law clerk said in a written statement read to the Cook County court. 'She asked how she could get another attorney to represent her or to speak to the (Cook County) judge,' the Tribune reported the clerk as telling the court. Heather Mack, 19, appeared emotional as she cradled her growing baby bump ahead of the start of her trial . 'I told her that I could not give her legal advice and the conversation ended.' But in a third call, the woman claiming to be Mack 'mentioned that she was in Indonesia and has no money, no-one to call and no attorneys and doesn't know what to do.' Bali lawyer Ary Soenardi said that he was still acting for her and was continuing to work on her defence. A court spokesman in Bali said no notification had been given that he had removed himself from the case, which has been adjourned until next week. It is then that the first of the prosecution witnesses will be called. Among the witness will be staff from the St Regis Hotel - where the murder occurred - police and forensic experts. Ahead of the start of the trial against her Mack revealed that she misses her socialite mother  'everyday' and loved her 'with all my heart.' She said she was petrified ahead of her trial, but that her fears were ‘more for my daughter than me,’ according to the Chicago Tribune. If the young lovers are found guilty they will face a firing squad. 'I loved my mom with all my heart and miss her every day,’ the newspaper reported Mack as saying. She reportedly added that ‘If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I’m in a complete state of depression. ‘The smile (seen in photos of her arriving at court) is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.’ But she said she was receiving help from ‘good Samaritans who helped to get her food and vitamins and her baby, Stella, named after Schaefer’s great-grandmother, was healthy. Referring to the baby, she told the paper: ‘She’s healthy and it is completely safe here and (a) completely fair country.’ Mack also revealed that she believed her lawyer would prove her innocence and asked ‘that the public reserve judgment on my case until the judges passes his verdict.’ Earlier this week three judges rejected a last-ditch attempt by the Chicago couple's defence teams to have the case thrown out. They had  claimed that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar. The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials. They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua. Heavily pregnant Heather Mack, pictured with Tommy Schaefer, arriving at court ahead of her trial. They were charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty. Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship and that Mack had once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000. Heather Mack, left, and co-accused Tommy Schaefer, right, boarding the  prison van to take them to court . They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle. Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, according to the indictment. They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it was alleged. The pair are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured, and stuffing her body in a suitcase .

"Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault. However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students. They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted. Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations, but will not be charged for sexual assault. However they were each charged on one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times. The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The teachers from South Hills High School could possibly face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations (the school pictured above) 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Source: San Gabriel Valley Tribune . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.","Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, from South Hills High School in California were arrested on allegations of having sex with male students .

"Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has called for Labour to introduce a 'death tax' A 'death tax' should be introduced on old people's homes to raise more cash from children who 'win the lottery' with their inheritance, Labour grandee David Blunkett has claimed. The former Home Secretary said it was unfair for people in London and the South East to inherit a fortune from their parents simply because of the soaring property market in and around the capital. Mr Blunkett said the previous Labour government's proposed 'death tax' to pay for care in old age had 'a lot of merit' and should be revisited. Labour was forced to abandon plans for a 10 per cent levy on estates to pay for social care before the 2010 general election after the Tories walked away from cross party talks on the issue. But speaking at a Policy Exchange event in London, the former Labour frontbencher said he still backed the policy. He said: 'I'm also interested in a much more refined, properly monitored equity release scheme because I think those who have got considerable capital assets – and certainly in London and south east because of property prices they have – [should do more].' 'Let me be really controversial: Why should their sons and daughters or nephews and nieces win the lottery when they die? 'Because that's what it amounts to compared with people in the rented sector and particularly in low terraced housing, even if they own it, in the North and Midlands.' Asked if he meant the 'death tax' – as the Tories dubbed the proposed levy before the 2010 election – Mr Blunkett said 'yes', according to the Telegraph. He said: 'I think that it's got a lot of merit – properly organised, properly regulated so it's not fraudulent – where people could release some of the equity to pay for their care and still allow their offspring or their nieces and nephews to inherit a pretty good bung. 'At the moment, the capital divide in this country is growing and it's going to have social consequences in the long run.' Labour was forced to abandon plans for a 10 per cent levy on estates to pay for social care before the 2010 general election. The Tories have instead introduce a cap on social care . Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, last year said he wanted to 'embrace' a system where social care is funded by imposing a tax on estates when people die . The Coalition has rejected proposals to impose a charge on people's estates to pay for old-age care – promising instead to set a legal limit on the sums that residents can be charged for care. Ministers claims the cap will stop people having sell their homes in old age and help create an insurance market where people can cover themselves for the future cost of round-the-clock care. The Government has set a cap on care costs, meaning no-one will have to pay more than £72,000 before the Government steps in. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, last year said he wants Labour to 'embrace' a system where social care is funded by imposing a tax on estates when people die. Mr Blunkett praised Mr Burnham for being 'brave' in 'coming back' to the policy.","David Blunkett said it was unfair children  made a fortune with inheritance .

Malcolm Butler (right) didn't win the Super Bowl MVP award, but he did get the truck that came with the honor . The three-time Super Bowl MVP gave the truck to teammate Malcolm Butler to show his appreciation for the play the defensive back made at the end of the game to help seal the win for New England. That gift will not go unpunished as the truck is considered a taxable prize under the Internal Revenue Code, section 74., according to Forbes. Not only will Brady, 37, have to pay $13,500 in income tax for winning the truck, he will also have to pay a $8,000 gift tax on it. His combined federal tax hit for winning the truck and giving it to Butler will be $21,500. Butler won't owe the IRS anything for the truck as the recipients of gifts are never taxed. Brady could end up paying $21,500 in taxes for winning the 2015 Chevy Colorado and giving it to Butler . Brady and Butler celebrated their Super Bowl win with a rolling rally on the streets of Boston yesterday . Butler's interception in the final seconds of the Super Bowl helped secure the Patriots fourth world title . The fun doesn't stop there for the four-time Super Bowl winner. Brady's game check after winning the Super Bowl is somewhere in the range of $97,000. He will be taxed at the top rate of 39.6 per cent on his check and will also have to pay Medicare tax. The former sixth-round draft pick will end up paying about $42,000 in federal taxes on the game. The $63,500 Brady may have to fork over seems a small price to pay for becoming the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time) in the eyes of many football fans. It also just a small fraction of the $19million salary he collected in 2014. He is due to make an almost $30million over the next three seasons in salary alone, according to Spotrac.","Quarterback owes tax on Chevy Colorado truck and $97,000 game check .

"Half of Britain's richest hedge-fund millionaires have given cash to the Conservative Party, new figures have revealed. Of the 59 wealthiest City managers, 27 have ploughed £19million into the Tories' election war-chest - with £10million flowing into the party's coffers since 2010 alone. The revelations come after  Ed Miliband yesterday repeatedly challenged the Prime Minister over the Conservative Party's links to the City. Tory donors and hedge fund managers (from left to right) Michael Farmer, Michael Hintze and Stanley Fink . The Labour leader accused Mr Cameron of failing to close tax loopholes because he was 'bankrolled by hedge funds'. He drew attention to the government's decision in 2013 to abolish a little known tax on investment funds, which Labour has described as a £145m 'hedge fund tax cut'. The Labour leader claimed: 'This is a Prime Minister who won't tackle tax avoidance for the simple reason that too many of his friends would get caught in the net. 'They are the party of Mayfair hedge funds and Monaco tax avoiders and under him you will always know it's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everyone else.' The wealthiest hedge fund manager last year, according to The Sunday Times, was Alan Howard, 50, of the Brevan Howard fund, with an estimated personal net worth of £1.6billion. Mr Howard has contributed £116,000 to the Tory party. But the two biggest hedge funds donors were Michael Farmer of RK Capital Management, a metals trader, who has donated £6.5million to the Tories and Sir Michael Hintze of Europe's biggest hedge fund, CQS, who has given £3.2m. Other significant hedge fund donors were Lord Fink, the party's former co-treasurer, who has donated £3.2million to the Tory party and the secretive Chris Rokos, also of Brevan Howard, who has donated £1.3million. At Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance . Michael Farmer, RK Capital Management . Worth: £150m . Donated: £6,556,092 .

Andrew Law, Caxton Associates . Worth: £350m . Donated: £1,226,411 . Lucy Powell, vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign, accused the Prime Minister of 'debasing political debate' by refusing to answer questions over his hedge fund backers. She told the Independent: 'The Tories are standing up for those at the top rather than hardworking families, and David Cameron doesn't want to admit it.' The Conservatives later claimed that closing the stamp duty loophole would hurt pension funds, rather than penalise hedge funds. Mr Cameron accused the Labour Party of failing to act on tax avoidance during its 13 years in office. He told Mr Miliband: 'When we came to office foreigners didn't pay stamp duty on the properties they bought. Foreigners didn't pay capital gains tax on the properties they bought. 'And because of your tax rates City hedge fund managers were paying lower tax rates than the people who cleaned their offices. That's what we had to sort out.' The row over accepting money from wealthy donors comes after the Archbishop of Canterbury hit out at tax dodging companies looking to increase profits by not paying their fair share. The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money, but part of the problem was an 'unbelievably complex' tax system. The remarks will be seen as a highly political intervention after Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance. Dr Welby, a former oil executive, said business was important and should be supported but there was a temptation to misuse the power that came through wealth. He told the BBC: 'There has always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money. If you earn money in a particular country, the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned.' Highlighting the complexities of the international tax system, he said: 'Someone said the other day that the tax system was of biblical proportions. Well, the Bible's only a thousand pages - how many tax systems are only a thousand pages? They are several hundred times that. 'There needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place.' He added that there was a 'very basic principle' that 'as a Christian we see that Jesus Christ spoke of, about the importance of people paying what is due'. 'The Bible speaks of it endlessly,' he said. The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money . It is the Archbishop's latest intervention on economic matters, having spoken out about inequality in recent weeks. He stressed that 'business is important', adding: 'We need to affirm the significance of those who generate and create wealth, but we also need to be realistic about the fact ... that with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power. 'There's a reality of the human condition, of what Christians call sin, what the Bible calls sin, which says don't misuse the power you have got through wealth.' Asked whether some people were doing that he said: 'There's always elements where that happens, because people are people.' But the response to that was not to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that business is bad' - instead, 'solidarity' and an improved regulatory framework were required.","Of the 59 wealthiest City managers, 27 have given cash into the Tories .

"A heart-warming photo that captured the moment a group of students helped carry their disabled classmate into the Aegean Sea in Greece has been viewed more than one million times on social media. University of Montana senior Gabrielle Broere was diagnosed with cerebral palsy - a neurological disorder that causes physical disability - when she was just one year old. Never one to let her disability get in the way of doing things, she went to study in Greece with 16 other students for 17 days last year. This heart-warming photo of four students helped carrying their disabled classmate Gabrielle Broere into the Aegean Sea in Greece has been viewed more than one million times on social media . 'I wasn't really sure how people were going to react to me and how helpful they would be and if I was going to get left behind,' she told Montana Kaimin. Most of the time Gabrielle uses a wheelchair to get around although can also use crutches to walk short distances. Several times during her Greek trip she found herself stuck and requiring her friends help. 'There was one time when we were on the ferry and the lift broke so they had four guys carry me down the stairs in my wheelchair,' said Gabrielle. When the class visited the Aegean Sea they soon discovered that they could no longer push Gabrielle's wheelchair, and without her crutches, she had no way of making it to the water. Then four of her friends hoisted Gabrielle by her arms and legs, and carried her into the water so she could stand in the sea and feel the water in between her toes. 'It was surreal,' she said. 'I was in complete awe of where I was and what was happening.' University of Montana senior Gabrielle Broere was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that causes physical disability, when she was just one year old . The Greek expedition wasn't her first trip. In 2011, Gabrielle had taken a 10-day trip to Peru where she first encountered how difficult it can be to access historical sites as a disabled person. Despite her disability, Broere doesn't plan to stop traveling hopes to see even more of Europe. 'It sucks getting around and it's hard, but I can do it. I've been through a lot now, and I'll continue going through that the rest of my life,' Broere said. 'I can't let anything hold me back. I would love to go to France and Italy next.' Broere is graduating in the fall with a degree in History, and plans to go to law school.","University of Montana senior Gabrielle Broere was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was just one year old .

"One of al-Qaeda's most senior militants has been killed in a U.S. drone strike over Yemen, the group claims. Harith al-Nadhari - who threatened more attacks on France after the Charlie Hebdo killings - died on January 31 along with three other militants in a car in Shabwa province, southern Yemen, al-Qaeda said on Twitter. The group named the other slain militants as Said Bafaraj, Abdelsamie al-Haddaa and Azzam al-Hadrami. Killed? Al-Qaeda claims a U.S. drone strike over Yemen on January 31 has killed senior militant Harith al-Nadhari, who threatened more attacks on France after the Charlie Hebdo killings . Al-Nadhari, who claimed to be the group's spiritual leader, said in a video on January 10: 'It is better for you to stop your aggression against the Muslims, so perhaps you will live safely. If you refuse but to wage war, then wait for the glad tiding.' The strike, first reported by Yemeni tribal and security officials, was the second such strike in five days as Washington pledges to continue fighting the militants despite Yemen's political paralysis. Last year, al-Nadhari provoked a clash between al-Qaeda and its splinter group the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (commonly known as ISIS). He publicly condemned the extremist faction - which has been disowned by al-Qaeda - for 'driving a wedge' among jihadi groups. Strike: These are unconfirmed pictures tweeted by Arabic-language accounts apparently of the strike . He referred to the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's recent call for followers to 'explode volcanos of jihad everywhere.' Al-Nadhari said ISIS 'forced the nation, all the nation, to pledge allegiance' in absence of 'consultation' with other Jihadi leaders. His message was posted on one of Yemeni Al-Qaida's official Twitter pages. He said: 'They revoked the legitimacy of all the Islamic groups across the Islamic world .... and drove a wedge among Mujahedeen ranks by collecting allegiances from within the Jihadi groups. 'They announced the expansion of their caliphate in a number of countries in which they have no mandate.'","Harith al-Nadhari killed after threatening France with more attacks .

"They may only have a brain the size of a thimble, but it appears pigeons can categorise and name objects in the same way a human children learn new words. A new study from the University of Iowa has shown that the birds are capable of learning to categorise 128 different photographs into 16 basic categories. Scientists taught three pigeons to attribute different breeds of dog or types of shoe, for example to a particular symbol in exchange for a reward. Pigeons, like the one above, can learn to categorise objects in a similar way to young children learn words . When they were shown black and white pictures of previously unseen dogs or shoes, the birds were able to correctly attribute these to the corresponding symbols. The scientists behind the project say this is a similar approach taken by young children when they are first learning words for objects. Crows are widely thought to be among the most intelligent of birds, but a recent study found they are even smarter than first thought, capable of solving complex tasks previously thought possible only by humans, apes and monkeys. Most impressively, they performed the tasks spontaneously - without any prior training. Two hooded crows were placed into a wire mesh cage into which a plastic tray containing three small cups was occasionally inserted. The sample cup in the middle was covered with a small card that had a colour, shape or number of items pictured on it. The other two cups were also covered with cards - one that matched the sample, and one that didn't. The cup under the matching card contained mealworms, which the crows were rewarded with if they chose the correct match. The crows were then required to conduct a similar task but with images on cards that did not precisely match. Researchers were surprised that the not only could the crows correctly perform these relational matches, with a success rate of 78 per cent - 50 per cent being regarded as chance - but that they did so spontaneously, without explicit training. However, the researchers said it took their birds around 40 days to perfect the task of learning just 16 categories. Professor Edward Wasserman, a psychologist at the University of Iowa who led the work, said: 'Our birds’ rate of learning appears to have been quite slow. Human adults regularly learn 16 categories in the space of an hour, yet, pigeons took 45,000 trials to reach their associative limits. 'Would children learn faster than pigeons? Almost certainly. However, our pigeons came to the experiment with literally no background knowledge. 'They did not understand the nature of the “task"", they had not encountered these categories before, and they had empty lexicons. 'Children, on the other hand, bring all of these things to bear on the problem of learning words. 'Thus, the more relevant comparison group may be newborn infants, who indeed take 6–9 months to learn their first words.' On each training day, the researchers presented each of the pigeons with 128 randomly ordered images. Each image fitted into one of 16 categories - baby, bottle, cake, car, cracker, dog, duck, fish, flower, hat, key, pen, phone, plan, shoe, tree. The birds then had to peck on one of two different colour symbols presented to them on a touchscreen computer - one that was associated with the correct category and the other the wrong category. If the birds selected the correct symbol they were rewarded with a pellet of food. Incorrect choices plunged the birds into darkness foir a new seconds. After the training, the birds were then presented with images from the categories they had not seen before to see if they could correctly attribute them. The pigeons had to select coloured symbols as in the above example were taught to associate with objects . The pigeons had to select the symbols that correctly corresponded to images they were shown on a screen . Pigeons are known for their ability to find their way home, but the new study suggests they are even smarter . One of the birds reached an accuracy of 80 per cent, a second achieved 70 per cent accuracy and the third was 65 per cent accurate. Writing in the journal Cognition, the researchers said their experiment was a very simple mirror of the way children are taught words - by their parents pointing to pictures and asking them to name the object. They said: 'Our paradigm is not a direct analog of human word learning. 'Nevertheless, it does offer a unique biological model of a critical property of word learning - namely, the fact that a learner must map many exemplars to many categories.' Professor Wasserman added: 'Unlike prior attempts to teach words to primates, dogs, and parrots, we used neither elaborate shaping methods nor social cues. 'Our pigeons were trained on all 16 categories simultaneously, a much closer analog of how children learn words and categories. 'Differences between humans and animals must indeed exist - many are already known - but, they may be outnumbered by similarities. 'Our research on categorization in pigeons suggests that those similarities may even extend to how children learn words.' The scientists taught the pigeons to group images of real objects into the 16 distinct categories shown above . Pigeons are known to be smarter than many birds and their homing instinct allows them to memorise their location and find their way home from hundreds of miles away. Professor Bob McMurray, another psychologist who took part in the study, said the results showed that human learning is not as unique as was previously believed. He said: 'Children are confronted with an immense task of learning thousands of words without a lot of background knowledge to go on. 'For a long time, people thought that such learning is special to humans. 'What this research shows is that the mechanisms by which children solve this huge problem may be mechanisms that are shared with many species.' Researchers studying New Caledonian crows recently discovered the clever corvids display a preference for holding a stick tool on a certain side of their beaks - and this could be to make the most of their wide field of vision. The researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads, so they can see clearly in order to use tools in the most dexterous way. Lead scientist Dr Alejandro Kacelnik, from Oxford University, said: ‘If you were holding a brush in your mouth and one of your eyes was better than the other at brush length, you would hold the brush so that its tip fell in view of the better eye. This is what the crows do.’ New Caledonian crows surprised experts with their ability to use sticks to extract larvae from burrows and, in captivity, retrieve food placed out of reach. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, also suggests that the birds' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye.","University of Iowa scientists taught pigeons to use touchscreen computers .

"A man has agreed to tear down a backyard shooting range he made with pallets and piles of dirt after a hospital bought him a year-long pass to a local gun range. Using cinder blocks, pallets and mounds of dirt, 21-year-old Joseph Carannante built a 4ft-high bullet-stopper in his back yard which he planned to practice shooting at with a 9mm pistol. He claimed he was unable to reach the local firing range during opening times because he worked up to 16 hours a day. Joseph Carannante (pictured) said he built the target in his backyard because he worked long hours and was unable to reach the local shooting ranges during opening hours . The target which he planned to shoot at (pictured) was built from dirt, cinder blocks and pallets . But furious opposition from neighbours prompted both a hospital and radio host to independently buy him passes to two gun clubs. Mr Carannante, who lives in St Petersburg, Florida, told Fox News: 'My intentions were never to instill fear in my neighbors. It’s a poorly written law, and I do believe it should be changed.' Due to Florida laws restricting local communities from forming their own gun laws, his plan was entirely legal. But he has now agreed to remove the target - which he said he never ended up at shooting at. His immediate neighbours were shocked when they heard of his plans and voiced  concerns that it was extremely dangerous. Resident Patrick Leary told WFLA he was furious at Mr Carannante's plans for a backyard shooting range. He said: 'You heard him say, I'll tell the neighbors when I'm getting ready to fire.

"Four children from the same family have been killed in a house fire in Texas despite their father's desperate attempts to smash through a window and save them from the flames. Firefighters received a callout to a home in Spurger, east Texas, about 2.30am on Wednesday, to discover four children were stuck inside the burning home. The four children - all aged between four and eight - died in the fire, while their parents Amanda and Jimmy Loftin and two other children survived. Pictured is the Loftin family from Spurger, east Texas. Four of the couple's six children were killed in a house blaze from which the couple and their remaining two children managed to escape . Mr Loftin refused treatment at the scene, while his partner and the two surviving children were taken to hospital to be treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation. The children's great aunt Kathy Marshall told Abc13: 'Jimmy frantically tried to do what he could to get to the children. 'He busted a window out. And when he busted the window out the fire came through severely burning his face has hands and his back.' When firefighters arrived at the scene, the four had already died and their bodies were found inside. They were eight-year-old Koltyn, 6-year-olds Kyi'leigh and Haven, and Dycin, aged 4. Mrs Marshall said the whole family was asleep when the fire started in a room of the mobile home, but they woke up because it was becoming unbearably hot. Investigators are looking into how the fire at the mobile home (pictured) in Spurger, Texas started, but they do not suspect foul play . When firefighters arrived at the blaze, it was too late - the bodies of four children were found inside the home .

The two children to survive the blaze were Kayann, 2, and 5-month-old Thomas. They were both sleeping in the same room as their parents. The Texas State Fire Marshals office is working to establish how the fire started, while counselors have been made available at a nearby school that was attended by the children.

"Swatch is set to launch its own smartwatch in April to take on the Apple Watch. The move will see the two firms go head to head in a battle for the lucrative market. Swatch boasts its watch won't need recharging - while Apple says its will have to be recharged every night. Scroll down for video . Swatch hit out at apple and Google's plans, saying 'Technology alone doesn't sell, not in watches.' The rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula. Andrew Sheehy, chief analyst at Generator Research, sees the retail value of wearable Internet-connected devices at $93.1 billion by 2018, versus $4.1 billion in 2014, with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market's value in 2018. However, Swatch has not yet revealed the full capabilities of its watch. It says it sees the sees the advent of the $93billion smartwatches as an opportunity rather than a threat - and warned the tech giants they may face problems. The Swatch device will communicate via a form of technology known as NFC, according to Bloomberg,  and won’t have to be charged, Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview. The Swatch smartwatch will also let consumers make mobile payments and work with Windows and Android software, he said. The market for such timepieces, which enable phone or data communication, will probably reach about $10 billion in 2018, Citigroup Inc. analysts forecast last year, with half of the market coming from traditional watch wearers switching to the devices. Apple's Tim Cook also confirmed the firm's plan for Apple Watch were on track. 'Development for Apple watch is right on Schedule, and we intend to begin shipping in April,' he said. 'We can't wait for customers to experience it. My expectations are very high, I use it every day, love it and can't live without it.' Apple's watch goes on sale in April, Tim Cook recently confirmed. Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek said these new watches might allow the wearer to count the number of steps they take and calories they burn. And there will be a few other cool 'Swatchy' things on offer via latest Bluetooth technology, he said in an interview at the company's headquarters in Biel. 'All the big technology firms want to work with us and I don't rule out that we are or could be collaborating in some areas. But we can also do many things on our own.' Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek said these new watches might allow the wearer to count the number of steps they take and calories they burn. Wearable gadgets, such as smartwatches that allow users to connect to their phone to check emails, make calls or monitor their health, are expected to be the next big thing in the tech world and a potential threat to traditional wristwatch sales. 'For Swatch, this could mean a 2 percent hit to revenue and earnings before interest and tax for each 10 percent share that the iWatch was able to gain in its addressable market,' Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli said in a study in July. Other tech companies are working on smartwatches. Google's Motorola is set to launch a Moto360 smartwatch next week in the United States. But the spotlight is on Apple after the company poached executives from the fashion, luxury and medtech (medical)industries and registered the trademark 'iWatch' in Japan. For many analysts, Swatch and Apple would be the dream team for a smartwatch project, but Swatch has always played down its interest in such a relationship. The argument is that Swatch's business is selling watches not technology. 'Our first message for customers is the watch. 'If they like it, they might also be interested in the extra functions,' Hayek said. 'It is a problem if you only define a product by its technology. 'Technology alone doesn't sell, not in watches.' His comments highlight the importance of fashion and branding for the development of the smartwatch business. '(Technology firms) that want to strike partnerships with us also want access to brands. 'They want (their products) to be more than a commodity,' the CEO said.","Firm will launch the Swatch Touch in April .

"THE DIARY OF LENA MUKHINA . Translated by Amanda Love Darrough . (Macmillan £16.99) This is a story within a story — and it has been waiting an awfully long time to be told. The larger story is the Siege of Leningrad in 1941 and 1942, one of the grimmer and more brutal narratives of World War II. In September 1941, the invading German army, with the help of Finnish forces, had the Russian city completely surrounded. But Hitler decided that finishing the job and razing it to the ground would be a waste of military resources. Far easier just to let the inhabitants starve to death. Lena Mukhina, 16 (pictured), experience the Siege of Leningrad first hand and recorded it all in her diary . As the German Naval Command’s directive of September 29 put it: ‘We have no interest in saving any part of the civilian population of this large city.’ The story within this story is that of Lena Mukhina, a 16-year-old girl who lived there. Between May 1941 and May 1942, she kept a diary — a day-to-day record of encroaching catastrophe. Unlike Anne Frank, she survived. In June 1942, Lena was evacuated and the diary was left behind. Somehow it, too, survived and turned up in a sheaf of documents at the State Archive of Historical-Political Documents in Leningrad 20 years later. But it has taken another 50 years to come into print, guided and nurtured by a trio of Russian researchers. In late summer 1941, life in Leningrad was going on much as normal. The city’s 2.5 million inhabitants did not immediately grasp the severity of their situation. True, they could almost see the Germans to the south of the city. Daily air raids and artillery bombardment were driving people into bomb shelters several times a day, for hours at a time. But the Finnish troops to the north were no threat, surely? They were 20 miles away and had no big guns. In November, however, food supplies were running perilously short and the authorities had to admit the truth. The siege lasted 872 days. Bread rations were eventually reduced to 125g, 4½ oz, per person per day. (Double that for manual workers.) People would start queueing outside shops early in the morning, but there was never enough to go round. New dishes were invented, such as khryapa, made from the green outer leaves of a head of cabbage. People ate crows, pigeons, cats and dogs. Lena’s family cat, she records, kept them going for ten days (‘I never thought cat meat would be so tender and so tasty’). Under siege: Citizens of wartime Leningrad died of starvation in the streets, and some turned to cannibalism . Eventually, hunger drove some of the most desperate to cannibalism. Our Russian editors, possibly precise to a fault, distinguish between two kinds: trupoedstvo, eating the flesh of those who have died of natural causes; and lyudoedstvo, killing others for the purpose. More than 2,000 arrests were made during the siege for such crimes. And yet, as Lena’s writing here shows, most of the city’s inhabitants kept a firm grasp on their humanity. Their stoicism and determination were almost heartbreaking, for the death toll was horrendous. In one week in December 1941, 841 people dropped dead of starvation on the street. Between January and April 1942, between 110 and 160 people were dying every hour. No one knows exactly how many died in all, but 800,000 is the historians’ best guess. When Lena’s diary begins, war has yet to be declared. There are exams to revise for, and she worries incessantly whether Vova, the boy she likes, has feelings for her. I have a daughter of the same age and similar preoccupations and, in some ways, I found these the hardest pages of the book to read — the innocence set against the reader’s terrible sense of impending doom. Then, Germany invades. Hitler may have been happy to wait for the inhabitants to die of starvation, but he wanted to break their spirits first. More than 13,000 artillery missiles, 3,500 high-explosive bombs and nearly 56,000 incendiary bombs landed on the city in the first three months of the siege. Then came the worst blow of all: Lena’s mother dies. ‘I still can’t believe it. It hasn’t fully sunk in. But already, I feel the emptiness of loneliness descending upon me. The love we felt for one another cannot be put into words. Such love can only exist between a mother and daughter . . . ‘I’m in so much pain. I’m trembling all over. This is it, the first blow. I’m still only 16, and I’ve already been dealt the first blow. What else does fate have in store for me? I don’t know. ‘Thousands of people are dying on the frontline and some of them are 16-year-old boys, the same age as me.’ That very much captures her tone — sweet, ingenuous, incredibly young in every way, but with the soul of a writer, and one or two of the skills, too. As the food supplies dwindle and malnutrition threatens, she begins to lose hope. ‘It is starting to seem as though it’s no longer our destiny to see brighter days. It’s no longer our destiny to live until the bright, joyous month of May.’ She and her aunt fantasise about the glorious meals they will eat when it’s all over. When the old woman who shares their flat dies, all they can think about is whether they will be able to keep her ration card until it expires later in the month. But they can’t. When the body goes, the ration card has to go, too. Generations of eminent historians have told and retold the story of Leningrad, but you can’t beat the raw immediacy of first- person testimony. I’ll admit that, when I first started the book, I did wonder, is this for real? But you can’t fake this sort of thing. Her suffering is real and terrible. As we read on, we can feel something important sapping out of her. Call it spirit, if you like, or the optimism of youth. But adversity does not strengthen her; it corrodes her. She gets away, but the best of her, we suspect, she has left behind. Thanks to our assiduous Russians, we now know that Lena spent the rest of the war in Gorky, returned to Leningrad in 1945 to study mosaics at the School of Arts and Crafts, had a long and varied career in design and died in Moscow in 1991. But, as far they could ascertain, she never wrote another word. Indeed, when they contacted her niece, ‘the initial response at the other end of the line was confusion: “Yes, we know Elena Vladimirova Mukhina. What diary? She wrote it during the siege? She never mentioned it.”’ For some reason that I can’t put my finger on, this almost seems the saddest thing of all.","Lena Mukhina gives her first hand account of the Siege of Leningrad .

"Some bottles of brandy have labels saying ‘specially matured for 40 years’. They should slap one on Sir John Chilcot’s backside. This mumbling, most untheatrical of men has been creeping down Whitehall’s penumbral corridors since 1963. The Civil Service recruiters chose well. He is opacity and caution made flesh, a right tiptoeing Terry. Sir John, 75, appeared before the Foreign Affairs select committee to discuss the delays to his Iraq inquiry. Clear explanation came there none. Scroll down for video . Sir John Chilcot told MPs it was 'really not possible to say' when he will publish his long-awaited report . Come, come, you weren’t expecting anything blunt or startlingly open, were you? The man’s a former Permanent Secretary. But at least he turned up on time. He might easily have wandered in four years late. He was halting in a Sir Humphreyesque way, inserting delay-coughs and creaky erms and aahs into his answers. He made little jokes about how he did not want to use ‘mandarin language’ (not that this stopped him). He was treated by the committee with such care, they could have been carrying brimful bowls of soup across a tightrope. Was this really the sort of dynamo who should have been entrusted with a £10million investigation into how we were hauled to war by the Blair regime? He looked more like a grandad about to audition for a Werther’s Original advert. With a good-old-boy judder of the jowls, he amiably took his seat and started to read an opening statement. It was so windy that even the committee’s Establishment-chummy chairman, Sir Richard Ottaway (Con, Croydon S), lost patience. There was, however, sad news to start: Sir John disclosed that one of his inquiry panel members, historian Sir Martin Gilbert, had died on Tuesday night. That took the oompf out of proceedings for a while. But let us remember what is at hand here. Hundreds of our soldiers died in Iraq. Thousands of Iraqi civilians were killed. The war may have been one of the worst scandals in British politics for a century. Is the delay to this inquiry not scandalous? Sir John said mildly that he ‘recognised parliamentary and public interest in our progress’. Well, that was big of him. He told us a tiny bit about the ‘Maxwellisation’ process, the name Whitehall gives to the practice of letting anyone criticised by an inquiry have advance sight of the relevant passages (this creates jobs for lawyers). But, oh, the coyness, the secrecy, the reluctance to give frank answers. The former top civil servant was hauled before Parliament to explain why his report will not be published before the general election . He referred to the ‘Maxwell-ees’ but would not say how many of them there were. Why the hell not? It completely eludes me – baffles me, makes me boil like hot jam – why such a statistic should not be public information. In the United States they would be flabbergasted by such official secrecy. Sir John’s lips formed a little moue. He toyed with the committee, going all playful and cryptic. And the committee accepted his stonewalling. The flaccid Ottaway, with admiration, observed his failure to give a straight answer and said: ‘I’m sure you’re thoroughly enjoying yourself.’ Sir John: ‘I’m grateful.’ He was asked if Cabinet Secretary and ex-Blair groupie Sir Jeremy Heywood had kept his snout out of the inquiry. ‘I’ve no reason to think otherwise,’ he said quietly. Interesting formulation of words. A cynic might say that that was Whitehall-speak for ‘of course he didn’t’. Negotiations with Sir Jeremy’s officials had been ‘a very long, difficult and challenging discussion on both sides’. Translation: screaming rows? Have you noticed how everyone in this sketch has a knighthood? Tory ancient Sir John Stanley ambled into proceedings and put some questions to Chilcot. They called each other ‘Sir John’ like a couple of stalemated chess players. Throughout his answers, Chilcot gave as little as possible. He was as spare and watery as supermarket ham, fastidious about rules, genuflecting to precedent. Public opinion? Public outrage? Please. Don’t let’s be vulgar. As he left the parliamentary estate in a smoke-glassed car, he was saluted by a policeman. How tolerant, how tame we are.","Sir John Chilcot, 75, appeared before the Foreign Affairs select committee .

"The agony, guilt and sense of abandonment experienced by the hostages of the Sydney siege have been revealed as they recounted their memories of the horrific 17-hour ordeal and the split-second opportunities they had to escape. While some believed they risked dying if they stayed at the Lindt Café, others admitted to Channel Nine's 60 Minutes that they felt a responsibility to remain, convinced by the gunman's threats that he would shoot one hostage for each one that fled. Paolo Vassallo, a father-of-two who was one of the first to escape the scene at Martin Place on December 15, recalled the moment he offered 19-year-old café co-worker Fiona Ma the opportunity to run out with him. 'I said ""look, we're going now. You're coming with me"". She's like: ""I can't, I can't"" and I was like ""why, Fiona?"". I ran, I didn't turn around,' Mr Vassallo, who was the third hostage to escape, told 60 Minutes. Scroll down for video . Paolo Vassallo (right), a father-of-two who was one of the first to escape, recalled the moment he offered café co-worker Fiona Ma (left) the opportunity to escape the Lindt Cafe, where Man Monis was holding them hostage . Reenactment: The19-year-old refused, telling him: 'I can't leave people behind because I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt' Mr Vassallo, pictured fleeing the cafe, spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson. 'I said sorry to him. I said ""sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you"",' Mr Vassallo said . He also spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson, who was shot dead by Man Haron Monis just before the siege's end. 'I said sorry to him. I said ""sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you"",' Mr Vassallo said. Ms Ma, who was the first hostage to find out about fellow captive Harriette Denny's secret pregnancy – which she called 'a good moment in a bad day' - revealed she was simply unable to leave the others behind. 'I can't leave people behind because I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt,' she recalled telling Mr Vassallo. She was one of the last to leave the cafe before police made the decision to storm it. Others, like 30-year-old Ms Denny, revealed the split-second opportunities they had to escape earlier in the day and recalled grasping the moment without a thought.

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman refused to budge until the very end, just before police stormed the cafe . Reenacment: He recalled Monis telling the hostages: 'If someone else leaves, someone dies' Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised hostages had escaped earlier in the siege.

Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny said. As more and more people escaped, the remaining hostages recalled their fear, convinced that the gunman would turn on them in revenge as promised. 'If someone else leaves, someone dies,' café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman recalled Monis saying. 'They had left us.' Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old refused to budge until the very end. 'I saw April was standing up and she was pulling the deadbolt up on the side door. Everyone's looking at me because they know that the side door is open.' Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life. Neither woman had the option to escape due to restricted mobility - Louisa suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 72-year-old mother doubted she could run at great speed. 'I looked up and opened my eyes and they were all gone. [I thought] ""Well this is it"" but at the same time ""I'm ready"",' Ms Hope told 60 Minutes. Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, said she had prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life .

Elly Chen, 22, told the Seven Network's 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story', that 'she (Marcia) saved my life' after helping her and cafe colleague Jieun escape from the building in the afternoon. 'I volunteered to leave my safe little spot because where I was standing was quite safe,' said Ms Mikhael. The Westpac banking executive's decision to move, closer to barrister Katrina Dawson, put space between  Monis and the two young cafe workers, enabling them to make their move at 5pm, without detection. 'That was really brave of her, I was shocked that she even moved closer to him,' said Jieun. 'I had to help her and I am so glad that she got out of there okay,' Ms Mikhael added. Elly Chen makes her run to freedom late on the Monday afternoon . 'That was really brave of her,' Jieun Bae said of Marcia Mikhael. 'I was shocked that she even moved closer to him' She would be wounded in the gunfight between heavily armed police and Monis, hit by shrapnel in both feet, and look around to see the fatal injury suffered by mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, which a coronial inquiry reported was struck by fragments of bullets fired by police. 'They say that everything happens for a reason and if that's the reason that I was there - to help one person, to help one person cope and to help one person get out alive - then I am very happy with myself,' Ms Mikhael said. The mother-of-three from Glenwood in Sydney's western suburbs was alongside Ms Dawson, a fellow mother-of-three, and barrister Julie Taylor, for much of the 17-hour ordeal.

"A man and woman had a lucky escape after a 60ft landslide saw the clifftop they were sitting on fall away beneath them. Aimee Jones, 25, and a fellow walker known only as Matt, were sitting on a clifftop bench overlooking Great Western beach in Newquay, Cornwall, when the cliff gave way and 50 tonnes of earth crashed onto the road below. Miss Jones said she now owes her life to Matt's collie dog Hazel, who she believes alerted them to the crumbling cliff by suddenly bolting from the scene. Aimee Jones, 25 (right), and a man known only as Matt (pictured left with his dog Hazel), were sitting on a clifftop bench overlooking Great Western beach in Newquay, Cornwall, when part of the 60ft cliff collapsed . Up to 50 tonnes of earth was displaced in the landslide, which occurred at the beauty spot this afternoon . She said: 'We were just sat there chatting when Hazel started sniffing a little crack at the top of the cliff. 'Suddenly she bolted away and both Matt and I got up to see what was happening and that's when the cliff went. 'There was a rumble and a snapping sound and it just fell away. 'It was just a leg's length away from us. 'We both ran as fast as we could – I even twisted my ankle running away from it. 'But it's as if Hazel had a sixth sense. If we'd had stayed where we had been we would have been dragged down. 'I thank my guardian angel - and Hazel.' Officials said about 50 tonnes of earth was displaced in the landslide, which occurred at the popular beauty spot this afternoon. The debris fell onto the road and pathway below, causing the road and access to the beach to be completely blocked. Members of the public are now being warned to take extra care around the area, with police advising people not to go near the site due to the cliff erosion. The pair were sitting and chatting on the clifftop bench when the cliff suddenly crumbled and gave way . Tourists and local residents have been visiting the site this afternoon to see the damage caused by the slide . Inspector Dave Meredith, of Devon and Cornwall Police, confirmed no one was injured in the incident. He wrote on Twitter: 'Landslide behind Great Western Hotel in Newquay today. Fortunately no one was hurt . 'No access to Great Western Beach Newquay due to landslide (sic). He later tweeted a photograph of Matt, who managed to escape getting caught up in the landslide. Mr Meredith wrote: 'Here's Matt & dog Hazel who were sat on a bench above today's landslide in Newquay. 'Slightly shaken but OK!' It is not yet known what caused the landslide, but Miss Jones believes it could have been triggered as a result of last year's severe storms which hit the South West. She said an official who arrived to inspect the landslide today told her it that had possibly been caused by water getting into small cracks in the cliff face caused by severe weather. She said: 'I was told water had got into cracks and expanded when it froze in the recent cold weather. 'The cracks have weakened the cliff until eventually it gave way today.' Severe storms hit the Westcountry last winter, causing extensive damage across the region including the collapse of the railway line in Dawlish and the evacuation of homes across the South West due to widespread flooding. Barbara May, manager of the Great Western Hotel in Newquay, said a 'huge chunk' of the hillside had slipped away in today's landslide. She said: 'There was a wall underneath some benches, I believe some people were sitting on the seats at the time, and the whole area underneath has just slid down onto the lower part of the road. Police are urging people to stay away from the site, with debris blocking the road and access to the beach . The Environment Agency and Highways Agency are both expected to attend the scene shortly to carry out investigations into what caused the collapse. It is believed to have been caused by erosion following storms . 'It's not used by vehicles particularly, unless they've taken a wrong turning and are headed towards the beach. 'It is used by the emergency services, but it's the main footpath down to the beach, so a lot of tourists and local people who are walking dogs use that road regularly.' The Environment Agency and Highways Agency are both expected to attend the scene shortly to carry out investigations. One worker at the hotel said there were two police cars at the scene this afternoon, as well as two 'special trucks outside to keep it from sliding any further'. 'The hotel is packed now with people coming for a cup of coffee to have a look at what's happened,' he added. 'At first we thought there must be something in the ocean, so the bar supervisor rushed out and then he came running back in saying ""there's been a landslide"". Ian Rabey, bar supervisor at the hotel, added: 'It's messy, but it could have been much worse if it had happened in the summer. 'It's right at the top where the benches are.' Devon and Cornwall Police said no one was injured in the incident and no properties were damaged as a result. Great Western beach is a popular destination for tourists, attracting thousands of people from all over the country each year. It is situated just a two minute walk from Newquay town centre and is backed by high cliffs. Being on the Atlantic coast, it is also a popular surfing spot, with moderate to large swells attracting keen surfers.

"Two daredevil climbers who've dedicated their lives to scaling some of the world's tallest and most iconic buildings without safety harnesses have revealed their latest exploits and shared what drives them and their biggest fears to MailOnline. Vitaliy Raskalov, 22, and Vadim Makhorov, 25, climbed to death-defying and dizzying heights to take these vertigo-inducing pictures from the tips of skyscrapers looking down on Hong Kong and nearby Shenzhen last month. Having eluded an official ban from China following their last trip when they filmed themselves scaling the 2,132ft (650 metre)-high, under-construction Shanghai Tower, the world-famous pair returned lured back by the dramatic skylines. Raskalov told MailOnline: 'I'd rather die falling from a great height than fall from a building four stories high and end up alive and crippled. That's the biggest fear'. Scroll down for video . Don't look down! Vitaliy Raskalov, 22, and Vadim Makhorov, 25, have shown off their latest free climbing exploits with pictures from a return trip to China following an attempted travel ban by the authorities. Seen here on the Ibis Hotel, Hong Kong . Rush: The team have climbed some of the world's tallest and most iconic buildings, documenting their conquests as they go. Seen here at the summit of one of two spirals at the top of the 1,259ft (384-metre)-tall Shun Hing Square in Shenzhen . Subterfuge: The pair often elude security to gain access to the roofs of buildings which they climb without harnesses to take their stomach-churning pictures like this shot from a spiral on the Shun Hing Square in Shenzhen . The adrenalin-junkies from Ukraine and Russia, who both use pseudonyms, met in St Petersburg when they bumped into each other while climbing a suspension bridge. The duo have since taken to the rooftops of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, Cologne's Cathedral, and the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in Paris. They have also conquered Giza's pyramids and some of Dubai's newest skyscrapers. Last February the pair made headlines by scaling the 2,132ft (650 metre)-high, under-construction Shanghai Tower in China, filming a jaw-dropping video of the climb. And when the video went live, the Chinese authorities said the climbers would be banned from ever returning to the country. But their pseudonyms allowed them to slip through the net and for this latest China trip the pair went to the Southeastern city of Shenzhen last month and climbed the 2,165ft (660-metre)-high, 110-story Ping An Finance Centre, which is still under construction. 'We went upstairs disguised as local workers,' Mr Raskalov told MailOnline. 'We got 610 metres [2,001ft] high then security guards stopped us. At first they were very angry and only spoke in Chinese so we couldn't really talk. But they recognised us and managed to say, ""You've been on Shanghai Tower!"" They must have seen our previous video.' Exploits: The duo, who use pseudonyms to avoid identification and travel bans, can now add the iconic Bank of China building in Hong Kong as one of their many conquests around the world . Gulp: They often dress in suits and ties disguised as workers to gain access to the top floors before scaling the outsides of tower blocks . Dizzying: Photos taken from the top of skyscrapers looking down on the streets below are posted on Instagram to more than 150,000 followers . Breathtaking: These dazzling pictures were taken from Mong Kok in Hong Kong. The area holds the world record for the highest population density, with 340,000 people per square mile . Mr Raskalov added: 'Soon after that we started laughing with them and managed strike up a chat about girls and other stuff and they must have thought, ""These are some cool guys"". Eventually they let us leave and didn't even try to check our passports.' The pair also got stunning pictures from the 1,259ft (384-metre)-high Shun Hing Square building, Shenzhen's second tallest skyscraper. They then headed to Hong Kong - Mr Raskalov's favourite climbing destination. 'We got into the Bank of China Tower but we were unsuccessful in getting on the roof,' he said. Standing 1,204ft (367 metres) tall and boasting 72 floors, the tower is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in Hong Kong. On top of the world: Vitaliy surveys the view in Mong Kok in Hong Kong on his 22nd birthday. The Russian former officer worker has been travelling the world scaling buildings with Vadim, 25, since 2013 . Teetering: A woman dangles her legs dangerously over the streets of Hong Kong while the traffic bustles below . Bright lights: A woman is silhouetted against a backdrop of Hong Kong at night as she perches on the corner of a tower block . 'We went there dressed in suits and ties and asked for a pass for the 56th floor from reception,' said Mr Raskalov. 'They saw we were well-dressed and just gave us the passes. But there were security guards on the roof so we couldn't make it all the way up.' On their first trip to China last year they slept 2,132ft (650 metres) up on Shanghai Tower for 12 hours waiting for pollution to clear but had no problems with security. 'When I woke up on the tower I felt like I was in an aeroplane, behind the clouds,' Mr Raskalov said. 'And we didn't have one problem with security. It was the Chinese New Year holiday so there was almost nobody there.' After the Shanghai Tower video went live the Chinese government slapped a ban on the climbers which they evaded easily. 'They said they tried to report us to the Russian government but I think it was just something to tell the newspapers,' Mr Raskalov said. 'I don't think they really did it. When we came in again through customs the other week we had no problems at all. We weren't even nervous.' Look, one hand! Vitaliy and Vadim's conquests have seen them climb to almost 2, 300ft (701 metres) on top of some of the world's highest buildings . Scale: The 1,259ft (384-metre)-tall Shun Hing Square skyscraper, left, and the Ping An International Finance Centre, right, which is still under construction, have both been scaled by the fearless climbers . Mr Raskalov claims that he has never been close to falling or feared for his life during a climb and has no qualms about continuing to travel the world in search of new skyscraper thrills. In fact, he says that the higher up he climbs, the less fear he feels. 'I'd rather die falling from a great height than fall from a building four stories high and end up alive and crippled. That's the biggest fear,' he said. 'Every day in Moscow, maybe six times a day, I feel like I'm going to die when I'm driving around on my motorcycle. People are crazy there. Driving in Moscow is far more dangerous than climbing a skyscraper.' Mr Raskalov is now taking a break from skyscraper climbing in Thailand, before heading to Germany to prepare for an exhibition of On The Roofs photography at Munich's Colab Gallery. This summer the pair hope to travel to South America for more high-octane climbs and to compile a documentary about themselves and other urban explorers around the world. Oh la la! Mr Raskalov gets a view of the Eiffel Tower that few tourists in Paris get from a nearby rooftop. The pair try to capture every thrill-seeking moment on camera . Cool, calm and collected: Mr Raskalov chats on his mobile phone while sitting on a ledge of a skyscraper  in the Spanish town of Benidorm . In their time climbing buildings around the world they have got into numerous scrapes with local authorities and private security. Mr Raskalov said: 'The worst one I had was in Chicago. Police caught us and wanted to put us in jail for six months for trespassing. We didn’t go on the roof top, we just went on the highest stairs. 'The police caught us and after that told us the car was coming to take us to jail, where we’d be for maybe three  or six months. And they said ""You will pay a very big penalty"". But security helped us – they said we were nice people and maybe we could make a deal. Then the police just gave us a penalty of $25.' He added: 'Maybe we’re very lucky. I know a lot of cases where people climb on bridges or roof tops and end up in jail - especially people who climb on construction buildings in New York. Even if security or police don't catch them on a construction building or bridge, after they post in Instagram or Facebook they track them down. They come round your house in a few months and put you in jail. New York is the most strict place in the world for any exploration. That’s why we haven't done it yet.'","Travelling climbers Vitaliy Raskalov and Vadim Makhorov reveal latest pictures to MailOnline .

"Clueless actress turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at UVA that many saw as unabashed victim blaming. The controversy started after an appearance on Fox's Outnumbered, when the outspoken conservative said the school's recent ban on sorority members attending frat events was unfair to 'good girls' when it's the 'bad girls -- bad women -- or the ones who like to be naughty, [who] might go out and play and get hurt.' 'But the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks. It's the same thing with guns. Guns don't kill people; people kill people,' she continued. Apologized: Clueless actress turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at UVA that many saw as unabashed victim blaming . Critics quickly pounced and said the 48-year-old's comments excused sexual assaults on 'bad girls' who choose to drink alcohol. And on Monday, Dash responded by clarifying what she meant via a Facebook post in which she called her 'naughty girl' comments 'a failed attempt at humor.' Dash continued: . 'LET ME BE CLEAR: I am a victim of physical and sexual abuse. My point was that there IS NO EXCUSE for a man taking advantage of women under any circumstances.

"The former deputy leader of the shamed Labour council that failed to protect generations of children from sexual abuse last night flatly refused to apologise to the victims. There was growing outrage over the failures by Rotherham council, which turned a blind eye while Pakistani grooming gangs sexually preyed on an estimated 2,000 girls. As it emerged that a string of those responsible have gone on to lucrative jobs at other councils – some in charge of safeguarding children – the Labour former deputy council leader Jahangir Akhtar was asked if he wanted to apologise to the victims of sexual abuse. Allies: Former Labour councillor Jahangir Akhtar - leader of the shamed Labour council that failed to protect generations of children from sexual abuse - with Ed Miliband . In response, he shouted: ‘Absolutely not – go away.’ He refused to open the front door of his £150,000 detached home near the centre of Rotherham. Mr Akhtar, 54, who has previously been pictured standing shoulder to shoulder with Labour leader Ed Miliband, was forced to ‘step aside’ from his role as deputy leader following allegations that he had been involved in a deal to help a relative accused of grooming an underage girl. He then lost his seat to Ukip at last year’s local elections. Meanwhile, Shaun Wright – head of children’s services at Rotherham council from 2005 to 2010 who was forced to quit as South Yorkshire police commissioner after fierce criticism of his role – yelled abuse when questioned about the report by a reporter. At his luxury five-bedroom house on an exclusive executive estate outside Rotherham, Mr Wright, 46, told the reporter: ‘I’m not in the public domain any more – you have no right. Just get off my property. I’m not talking!’ The council’s former leader, Roger Stone, who like Mr Wright refused to co-operate with an inspection into the affair which this week branded the authority ‘in denial’, was not at his home and failed to respond to telephone messages. Rotherham councillors are facing criminal charges after a shocking report laid bare how they tried to cover up one of Britain’s biggest child abuse scandals. Up to 2,000 girls were sexually exploited by Pakistani gangs in Rotherham while they ignored – and in some cases covered up – the abuse over a 16-year period due to an obsession with political correctness. Shaun Wright - head of children’s services at Rotherham council from 2005 to 2010 who was forced to quit as South Yorkshire police commissioner - yelled abuse when questioned about the report . After the entire council cabinet was forced to resign, the Prime Minister said yesterday that the same phenomenon was occuring across the country. On a trip to Leeds, David Cameron promised that extra resources would be provided to Rotherham council if needed. But he added: ‘Let’s not pretend this is a problem of money. It was mismanagement, political correctness, sexism. This is not a failure of resources, it was a failure of leadership. We need to tackle this across other parts of the country too.’ Mr Akhtar has been connected to numerous aspects of the scandal that led to the council failing to identify and act on the abuse of girls . Incredibly, despite the scandal, many of those responsible for the shocking failures at the Labour-run council have walked into highly paid roles elsewhere. The council’s former chief executive Ged Fitzgerald – accused of allowing one report warning of child sex grooming to be suppressed and another ignored – is now earning £199,500 a year as chief executive of Liverpool City Council. Jackie Wilson – who was responsible for safeguarding children in Rotherham during the years when widespread sex grooming crimes were going unpunished – now earns £90,000-a-year as assistant director for children and families in the neighbouring town of Doncaster. Former deputy council leader Mr Akhtar – described in the report as a ‘powerful figure’ in the town with ‘influence that extended to the police’ – is a former taxi driver with a criminal conviction for his role in a violent brawl. He came in for sustained criticism in this week’s scathing report by government adviser Louise Casey, which recorded how ‘members, officers and others spoke about him with a level of fear’. ‘Some were concerned when speaking to inspectors that what they said would get back to him,’ it said, even though he was no longer on the council. He has been connected to numerous aspects of the scandal that led to the council failing to identify and act on the abuse of girls. His cousin, Arshad Hussain, was named as a ‘boyfriend’ by up to 18 girls who spoke to social workers as part of the Risky Business outreach group, aimed at youngsters who were at risk of being lured into prostitution. The married father-of-five was accused in a report in The Times last year of helping to arrange a deal where Hussain returned one of his young alleged victims who had gone missing from home to police. Joyce Thacker: Mrs Thacker earned £115,000 a year as strategic director of children and young people’s services at Rotherham. She was deputy director from 2006, taking over the top post in 2008 and holding it until last year. In that time hundreds of children are now known to have been targeted by Pakistani grooming gangs. But the scandals on her watch did not prevent her from being handed a £40,000 pay-off when she resigned last year. Dr Sonia Sharp: Dr Sharp was Mrs Thacker’s immediate predecessor as strategic director of children and young people’s services from 2005 to 2008, when shocking sexual abuse was rampant and the ethnic dimension of the abuse covered up. Since leaving, she has advised officials in Malaysia responsible for child protection on ‘best practice’. She now works in Australia in education. Ged Fitzgerald: He was the chief executive from 2001 to 2003 and was accused of allowing one report warning of child sex grooming to be suppressed and another ignored. The 53-year-old is now the £199,500 a year chief executive of Liverpool City Council. Jackie Wilson: She was a senior manager with responsibility for safeguarding children in Rotherham during the years when widespread sex grooming crimes were going unpunished. But today as the £90,000-a-year assistant director for children and families at the council in nearby Donaster, Mrs Wilson is again entrusted with the safety of young people. Martin Kimber: The £160,000-a-year chief executive from 2009 to 2014 refused to sack a single senior officer at Rotherham, despite damning evidence of failure and incompetence. Last September he was handed a £26,000 pay-off to go two months early. Police are investigating claims that a report detailing the child sex abuse in Rotherham was stolen as part of a council cover-up. The theft is alleged to have been part of a conspiracy orchestrated by council insiders desperate to conceal the scale of the problem of sexual grooming gangs in the town. The stolen file was reported by a Home Office researcher working with Rotherham Council’s youth service in 2002. She claimed senior managers at the authority were ‘indifferent’ when she told them she believed as many as 270 girls were being groomed for sex. But after sending a draft version of her report detailing the abuse to the council and Home Office on a Friday, she returned to her office the following Monday to find all the files had gone and computer records wiped. Significantly, there were no signs of a break-in, and the door had been locked and key-coded – meaning only a limited number of council workers would have had access. Professor Alexis Jay revealed details of a possible break-in in her report last year . The extraordinary raid from within the council’s offices is likely to form part of a criminal probe into an alleged attempt to cover up the scale of child sexual abuse by members of the town’s Pakistani community, which could see councillors and council officers facing the threat of jail. The Home Office worker behind the report was allegedly later suspended for supposedly including confidential data in her report, then ordered to water it down after being reinstated. She refused to change a word. Incredibly, the report was never published, and it would be more than a decade later before the truth was finally acknowledged. It is thought that if it had been published it could have potentially prevented the abuse of hundreds of girls over the years that followed. Details of the break-in were first raised following last August’s report by Professor Alexis Jay, which stated that the researcher’s draft report contained ‘severe criticisms of the agencies in Rotherham involved with child sexual exploitation’ but that she had been subjected to ‘personalised hostility at the hands of officials’. She concluded: ‘Had this report been treated with the seriousness it merited at the time, by both the police and the council, the children involved then and later would have been better protected and abusers brought to justice. These events have led to suspicions of collusion and cover-up.’ The unnamed researcher subsequently gave evidence to a private session of the Home Affairs Select Committee. In their report of the meeting, MPs revealed the researcher had handed police the names of five people who had access to the room where her missing files had been kept, but they failed to act on the information. When asked why not, David Crompton, current chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, told MPs his officers ‘could not find’ any police reports about the documents being removed. At the time, committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up.’ The researcher had been based within Risky Business, the council’s specialist youth service, which is praised in both the Jay report and this week’s damning inspection by Louise Casey for being the only part of the authority to help vulnerable teenage girls, only to be effectively closed down for flagging up ‘uncomfortable truths’. Yesterday the council said it had set up an external review to ‘establish the facts of the matter’. Home Secretary Theresa May has said the Home Office was ‘looking at the files to ascertain exactly what happened’.","Growing outrage over failures to protect 2,000 girls by Rotherham Council .

"Pope Francis has said it is fine for parents to smack their children as punishment for misbehaving. The Pope said parents should punish their children, 'do the right thing, and then move on,' as he acted out the movement of smacking a child on the bottom. The pontiff made the remarks in front of a large crowd during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday. Naughty or nice: Pope Francis kisses a baby as he leaves at the end of his weekly general audience, where he told the crowd that it is fine for parents to smack their children as punishment for misbehaving . Addressing the crowd, Pope Francis recalled a conversation he had had with a father who had admitted to him that he would sometimes hit his children as punishment. 'One time, I heard a father say, ""At times I have to hit my children a bit, but never in the face so as not to humiliate them"".,' the Pope said according to the Telegraph. 'That's great. He had a sense of dignity. He should punish, do the right thing, and then move on.' Pope Francis's remarks on corporal punishment for misbehaving children came as the leaders of the Catholic clergy  received a letter from him, reminding them to cooperate with the new sex abuse  inquiry – even if it means uncovering more scandals. 'Families need to know that the Church is making every effort to protect their children,' he said. Papa Francesco: Pope Francis is presented with a football jersey reading his name from FC Barcelona soccer club president Josep Maria Bartomeu on Thursday .

Popular guy: Hundreds gather in St Peter's Square every week for Pope Francis' general audience . Pope Francis has sent Catholic clergy a powerful reminder of their duty to stamp out sexual abuse of children by priests, warning that they must never let a fear of scandal lead to cover-ups. In a strongly-worded letter to the heads of national bishops' conferences and religious orders, the pope demanded 'close and complete' cooperation with a new child protection watchdog he has established at the Vatican. 'Families need to know that the Church is making every effort to protect their children,' he said. 'Consequently, priority must not be given to any other kind of concern, whatever its nature, such as the desire to avoid scandal, since there is absolutely no place in ministry for those who abuse minors.' The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors has been given a brief to drive reform on an issue that has severely damaged the Church's authority and reputation around the world. On Tuesday, the Pope had to apologise for offending large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits'. The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'. Speaking during a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines, he said that 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.' Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu apologised on Pope Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'. Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.'","Pope Francis told crowd it's fine to smack a naughty child .

"Apple's healthcare technology is spreading quickly among major U.S. hospitals, showing early promise as a way for  doctors to . monitor patients remotely and lower costs. Fourteen of 23 top hospitals contacted by Reuters said they . have rolled out a pilot program of Apple's HealthKit service - . which acts as a repository for patient-generated health . information like blood pressure, weight or heart rate - or are . in talks to do so. The pilots aim to help physicians monitor patients with such . chronic conditions as diabetes and hypertension. Scroll down for video . The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard (pictured) showing all the user's health and ﬁtness data. However, the firm was today forced to delay apps using the service from being distributed. Apple's HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools, food and exercise-tracking apps and Wi-fi connected scales. HealthKit is not an app but a back-end framework that allows third-party apps to sync with Apple's new and proprietary health tracking app, Health. This lets users chart metrics like weight, sleep and calorie intake. Apple rivals . Google and Samsung Electronics, which . have released similar services, are only just starting to reach . out to hospitals and other medical partners. Such systems hold the promise of allowing doctors to watch . for early signs of trouble and intervene before a medical . problem becomes acute. That could help hospitals avoid repeat . admissions, for which they are penalized under new U.S. government guidelines, all at a relatively low cost. The U.S. healthcare market is $3 trillion, and researcher . IDC Health Insights predicts that 70 percent of healthcare . organizations worldwide will invest by 2018 in technology . including apps, wearables, remote monitoring and virtual care. Those trying out Apple's service included at least eight of . the 17 hospitals on one list ranking the best hospitals, the . U.S. News & World Report's Honor Roll.

Apple's HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such . as glucose measurement tools, food and exercise-tracking apps . and Wi-fi connected scales. The company's Apple Watch, due for . release in April, promises to add to the range of possible data, . which with patients' consent can be sent to an electronic . medical record for doctors to view. Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans has been working with . Apple and Epic Systems, Ochsner's medical records vendor, to . roll out a pilot program for high-risk patients. The team is . already tracking several hundred patients who are struggling to . control their blood pressure. The devices measure blood pressure . and other statistics and send it to Apple phones and tablets. 'If we had more data, like daily weights, we could give the . patient a call before they need to be hospitalized,' said Chief . Clinical Transformation Officer Dr. Richard Milani. Sumit Rana, chief technology officer at Epic Systems, said . the timing was right for mobile health tech to take off. 'We didn't have smartphones ten years ago; or an explosion . of new sensors and devices,' Rana said. Apple has said that over 600 developers are integrating . HealthKit into their health and fitness apps. The new Health App will use a special dashboard to show user's exactly how their health is - and can alert doctors if something is wrong . Many of the hospitals told Reuters they were eager to try . pilots of the Google Fit service, since Google's Android . software powers most smartphones. Google said it has several . developer partners on board for Fit, which connects to apps and . devices, but did not comment on its outreach to hospitals. Samsung said it is working with Boston's Massachusetts . General Hospital to develop mobile health technology. The firm . also has a relationship with the University of California's San .

The aim is to . move away from the 'fee for service' model, which has tended to . reward doctors for pricey procedures rather than for outcomes. Still, hospitals must decide whether the difficulty of . sorting through a deluge of patient-generated data of varying . quality is worth the investment. 'This is a whole new data source that we don't understand . the integrity of yet,' said William Hanson, chief medical . information officer at the University of Pennsylvania Health . System. Apple has recruited informal industry advisors, including . Rana and John Halamka, chief information officer of Beth Israel .

"A new cap on pension charges will save average earners £100,000 over their lifetimes, ministers said last night. The plans, aimed at stamping out high and unclear charges, are designed to boost the value of pension pots when people retire. It is expected the new rules will transfer some £200million from the pensions industry to savers over the next ten years. A new cap on pension charges will save average earners £100,000 over their lifetimes, ministers said last night (file picture) From April, people who are placed into a workplace pension as part of automatic enrolment will see their charges capped at 0.75 per cent. The average earner currently pays into a fund charging 1.5 per cent. The plans were laid before Parliament in draft regulations yesterday. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the changes would ensure people would not see their money ‘disappear in opaque charging structures’. He said: ‘There is an understandable buzz around what April will bring for those retiring now, with the unprecedented pension freedoms coming in. But these reforms show we are also determined to help the pensioners of tomorrow.’ Ministers said the new cap could save around £100,000 for an average earner who was currently paying into a fund charging 1.5 per cent, over the course of their working life. Mr Webb told The Daily Telegraph: ‘With pension charges the devil is in the compounduing, because the numbers look very small and innocent but quickly mount up. ‘People saving into a pension today can have the confidence they will get good value for money throughout their working lives.’ Pensions Minister Steve Webb (pictured) said the changes would ensure people would not see their money ‘disappear in opaque charging structures’ The charge cap applies to the default pension options that people are placed into as a result of auto-enrolment into workplace pensions, to protect them against unwittingly having large chunks of their pots eaten up by high costs. Savers can still choose to be in a pension with more expensive costs if they want to, because the saver will be making an active decision to shop around after weighing up the costs against the benefits. The updated draft regulations will mainly come into force on April 6. This is just as the Government’s retirement revolution is put into action, meaning that people aged over 55 will have much greater freedom over how they take their pension pot and they will no longer be herded towards buying a retirement annuity. More than five million people have been automatically enrolled into workplace pensions so far as part of the drive to encourage stronger savings habits as the population lives for longer. By 2018, as many as nine million will be newly saving into a pension or saving more. Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority also set out new rules that will require firms to set up independent governance committees for workplace personal pension schemes. These committees will act in savers’ interests by assessing the value of pension schemes and challenging providers to make changes where necessary. The rules will also come into force on April 6. The move follows recommendations by the FCA’s predecessor body the Office of Fair Trading, which highlighted problems in 2013, when it said that the buyer side of the market was ‘one of the weakest’ it had analysed in recent years. The OFT found that neither employers nor employees could be expected to drive effective competition between firms. Around £30billion of savers’ money in older defined contribution workplace pension schemes was considered by the OFT to be at risk of delivering poor value, by modern standards, because of potentially high charges.","The cap on pension charges could save earners £100,000 in their lifetime .

"A mystic, flat-topped mountain on the Venezuela-Brazil border that perplexed 19th-century explorers and inspired 'The Lost World' novel is attracting ever more modern-day adventurers. Once impenetrable to all but the Pemon indigenous people, several thousand hikers a year now make the three-day trek across savannah, through rivers, under a waterfall and along a narrow path scaling the cliffs of Mount Roraima. While those throngs are a boon to Venezuela's tottering tourism industry, they also scatter a prehistoric landscape with unwanted litter and strain a delicate ecosystem. Scroll down for video . The mysterious table-topped mountain on the Venezuela-Brazil border that perplexed 19th century explorers is attracting ever more modern-day adventurers . Standing at more than 9,200 feet high, Roraima is sacred ground for the Pemons and a spiritual symbol for many other Venezuelans . Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World novel was turned into a hit film in the 1920s, directed by Harry O. Hoyt . Standing at more than  9,200 feet high, Roraima is sacred ground for the Pemons and a spiritual symbol for many other Venezuelans. 'It used to be more solitary and inhospitable,' recalled Felix Medina, a 59-year-old guide who has been taking people up the mountain for more than a decade. 'I still love it, but there are too many people,' said Medina, his calves aching after he led two groups up and down Roraima with the local Akanan tour agency. 'It's chaotic sometimes.' Between 3,000 and 4,000 people are climbing each year, up from hundreds a few years ago. That creates queues during peak times over Christmas and Easter, and sometimes leaves the few sheltered coves at the top crammed with tents. Helicopters bring wealthy foreign tourists, especially from Japan, to the summit. 'It's an exotic, faraway destination so it's both very costly and very attractive,' said retired Japanese diplomat Edo Muneo, 68, who like other compatriots, had to pass a physical test before leaving Japan for Roraima. In Pemon language, the flat-topped mountains across southeastern Venezuela are known as 'tepuis,' which means 'houses of the gods.' Standing majestically next to Roraima is Kukenan, another tepui, infamous among the Pemons for ancestors who jumped off and committed suicide there. Out of season, both mountains have the peaceful aura appropriate to one of the Earth's most ancient formations. Japanese tourists take shelter from the rain next to a rock formation on top of Roraima Mount, near Venezuela's border with Brazil - the Mountain formed the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World . Tourists walk on Roraima Mount; now several thousand trekkers a year make the six-day hike across Venezuela's savannah . Helicopters bring wealthy foreign tourists, especially from Japan, to the summit to marvel at the outstanding rock formations . On Roraima's vast plateau, strange and gnarled rocks, formed when the African and American continents scraped apart, play with the mind, humorous in the sun, ghostly in the mist. In British author Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 classic 'The Lost World,' dinosaurs attack a group of explorers amid the rocks and swamps of that fantasy landscape. The novel was made into a film in 1960 produced by Irwin Allen starring Claude Rains, David Hedison, Fernando Lamas, Jill St. John, and Michael Rennie among others. And it was adapted again in 2001 starring Bob Hoskins, James Fox, Matthew Rhys, Tom Ward, Elaine Cassidy and Peter Falk. Today's travelers can see black frogs, dragonflies and tarantulas that are unique to Roraima, plus a range of endemic plants clinging to cracks and crevasses. Not surprisingly, it is also an ornithologist's paradise. Thousands of tourists travel to the the cliffs of Mount Roraima to picture themselves next to the enchanting structures that shaped The Lost World film . Some Roraima lovers want the government, tour operators and local Pemon leaders to convene and make rules to limit the numbers of tourists . The mountain is becoming more and more popular, which in turn brings its own host of problems, such as littering . The 1960 version of the classic tale of a lost world starred David Hedison, Michael Rennie and Claude Rains Lowo . Some Roraima lovers want the government, tour operators and local Pemon leaders to convene and make rules to limit the numbers who can roam the top each day to, say, a few dozen. They would also like to see a stricter application of rules to ensure visitors, or the porters who most people employ, carry every last shred of waste down with them. Cristina Sitja, 42, a Venezuelan and children's book illustrator who has been living away from her homeland most of her adult life, said she had been hearing about Roraima since her teenage years and finally climbed it this year. 'It was a nice experience, but sad too,' she said. 'I expected it to be quieter.'","Thousands of tourists make the three-day trek  along a narrow path scaling the cliffs of Mount Roraima .

"The world's super rich now own more than $3 trillion worth of owner-occupied residential property according to a new report released by private wealth consultancy Wealth-X and Sotheby's International Realty. The figure is significantly more than the GDP of either France or the UK, and double that of India, and relates to homes that were bought for their personal use, rather than property purchased as a pure investment. The total value of these homes grew 8% in 2014. There are 211,275 ultra-high net worth individuals, those with $30 million or more in assets — around the world. Luxury residential real estate was considered as property worth more than $1 million. Developments such as 432 Park Avenue under construction in New York City (pictured) are aimed specifically at ultra high net worth individuals. New York already has the highest number of homes owned by the super rich . Fueling this boom is the 'ongoing shift in the wealth creation cycle' from the West to the East, the growing importance of 'intergenerational wealth transfers' the report stated. Those individuals with inherited wealth hold 17% of their net worth in residential real estate, while those that created their wealth hold a little under 9% in the asset class. There has also been an increase in the number of new developments specifically targeting the super rich across the world as developers have realized that many of these ultra-high net worth individuals are looking for homes outside of their country of origin. Adding to demand for luxury real estate is the recent collapse in oil prices, fears of punitive taxes, worries about the confiscation of assets, and new sanctions against countries such as Russia. Real estate in world cities is still considered a safe investment. The main hubs for luxury residential real estate are New York City, London and Hong Kong, but niche locations – such as Lugano, the Hamptons, and other rural areas around the world – are gaining in popularity according to the report. The report also found that 79% of the world’s super rich own two or more properties and just over half of them own three or more residences. London continues to attract buyers from all over the world, the largest number come from India. One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge is home to London's most expensive apartment .

"A cleaner has been reunited with his wallet after dropping it in to a marina 100 feet deep more than two years ago. Daniel Dymond's leather wallet slipped out of his pocket into the water while he was working in November 2012. The 23-year-old thought he'd lost it forever until a diver found it while carrying out maintenance work on some pontoons. Cleaner Daniel Dymond was reunited with his wallet, including his driving licence and a Lloyds bank card, two years after he dropped it in to the Mayflower Marina in Plymouth, Devon . Mr Dymond, who works for Cleancoast Services, said he 'couldn't believe' the wallet had been discovered near Mayflower Marina, in Plymouth, Devon. Remarkably it still contained his driving licence as well as a Lloyds bank card and Iceland and Game store cards. He told the Plymouth Herald: 'It's amazing because I thought I'd never see it again. 'I remember reaching down to pick up a log from the water and then I heard something drop into the water. I looked over and just saw a few bubbles and then realised what had happened. 'When I was told it had been found I couldn't believe it. The water there is so deep I thought it was gone forever. I'm well chuffed.' Charles Bush, managing director of Mayflower Marina, described it as 'remarkable' saying the chances of finding the wallet 'were pretty much nil.' 'It's an astonishing story especially when you consider the depth of the water and the tides', he said. 'When he lost it, Dan was working in the deepest part of the marina which has a depth of about 30 metres. 'If divers are operating on the seabed, at that depth, they would have about 20 minutes of bottom time. 'The chances of them stumbling across a wallet would be pretty much nil. It was a chance find and that's what makes it even more remarkable. 'When you imagine the storms we had last year, and the amount of movement in the water it is simply remarkable that they've found it.' The wallet was discovered by diver Chris Church, carrying out maintenance work on some pontoons near Mayflower Marina (pictured) - he then handed it in to the marina's reception who identified Mr Dymond . Mr Dymond, who lives in Plymouth, was reunited with the wallet after the diver, Chris Church, handed it in to the marina's reception who identified the cleaner. Rikkie Carette, 51, owner of Cleancoast Services, picked up the wallet and phoned him to pass on the news. He told the Plymouth Herald: 'I honestly just can't believe it. 'When I heard that they had found it my immediate response was ""I remember him losing it - but that was over two years ago"". 'It's more than 100ft deep in places where he lost it and there's a strong tidal pull. When you think about it it could have drifted a long way away but it didn't. It's unbelievable that it hasn't been washed away.' He said he wasn't surprised when Mr Dymond lost the wallet. 'He is a bit accident prone', he revealed.","Daniel Dymond lost his leather weather while working in November 2012 .

"A former Walmart manager has hit out at the retailer, claiming he was unfairly fired for stepping 10ft out of the store and pinning a shoplifter to the ground. Don Watson from Prattville, Alabama, told AL.com he was working a  night shift when he caught the thief outside in the car park. He was punched in the face during the debacle. But instead of being rewarded for recovering more than $1,000 worth of stolen goods, he says he was fired for not following company protocols on handling shoplifting situations. Out of work: Don Watson from Prattville, Alabama, has hit out at Walmart, claiming he was unfairly fired for pinning a shoplifter to the ground . Indeed, Watson said he had been trained not to pursue a thief more than 10ft outside the store, but it's a rule he had broken before and that many others break - especially when trouble ensues. 'It was just kind of strange,' Watson said of his firing last month. 'It was strange that they came to this conclusion after 27 days. I thought I was protecting the company.' Walmart spokesperson Aaron Mullins, defended the company's action, stating that there are set policies regarding how associates should deal with certain situations. 'It is a tough situation anytime we have an associate that does something that unfortunately puts himself in danger,' he said. 'We don’t think there is any amount of stolen merchandise that is worth anyone’s life. Associates are trained to follow certain security measures.' Recalling the incident, Watson said he heard an alarm from an emergency exit during his shift on January 4, and decided to check out what was happening. He saw 46-year-old Roderick Gray, who was known to be a shoplifter, outside with a buggy full of unpaid-for items. Heroic act: Watson was working a night shift at this store when he caught the thief outside in the car park . When he caught up with him, Gray allegedly grabbed Watson, struck him in the face and dragged him to the ground. After managing to get free, Watson pinned Gray down. Security personnel from a housing complex across the street then came to help until police arrived. According to court records Gray had $1,118 worth of merchandise on him when we was apprehended and was later charged with first degree robbery. Before Watson caught him, Gray had allegedly already been caught on CCTV stealing approximately $3,500 of merchandise over the previous nine days. Despite catching the culprit, Watson was penalized for his actions and fired 27 days later on the grounds of 'gross misconduct'. The offense means he cannot be hired at another WalMart of Sam's Club and he believes it could affect his chances of seeking future employment. Watson is now attempting to appeal his firing to Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. When asked if he would take his old job back, Watson said: 'I would have to. I went from making a decent living, making almost $50,000 a year, to nothing.'","Don Watson from Prattville, Alabama, was working a night shift when he caught the thief outside in the car park .

"The picture of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe falling down a set of steps after holding a speech has been turned into an internet meme. Using the hashtag 'Mugabe Falls', images showing the 90-year-old president in a series of funny situations began spreading  online. The memes features a cut-out image of Mugabe in various imagined circumstances, such as part of Beyonce's Single Ladies choreography, surfing or running from security forces. Scroll down for video .

Breaking the internet: The ageing president is seen with his hand on the famous buttocks of Kim Kardashian . Others show the ageing leader as an Olympic runner and with his hand on the infamous bottom of Kim Kardashian. Today, Zimbabwe's government tried to deny that the President had tripped at all, saying said Mugabe, 90, did not fall down the steps, but 'managed to break the fall.' Information Minister Jonathan Moyo  cited examples of leaders who have stumbled, from Jesus to George W. Bush, adding that, despite photos spreading around the globe, there was also no evidence that Mugabe had actually fallen. 'What happened is that the president tripped over a hump on the carpet on one of the steps of the dais as he was stepping down from the platform but he remarkably managed to break the fall on his own,' Information Minister Jonathan Moyo told the state-owned Herald newspaper. 'I repeat that the president managed to break the fall.' Oh the irony: Mugabe can be seen running from what is believed to be Zimbabwean security forces .

Some Mugabe Falls memes also made fun of his staff, who allegedly asked photographers to delete images of the president when he took a tumble . Mugabe took a tumble as he walked down some steps from a podium where he had been addressing the crowd at Harare International Airport. His supporters had gathered to welcome Mugabe back from a trip to Ethiopia - where he had been elected chairman of the 54-state African Nation. He claimed 'no African country' had opposed Zimbabwe's elevation to lead the organisation. It is understood the President - who has overseen his once-prosperous nation's steep decline since starting to seize white-owned farms in 2000 - was helped up quickly by aides, before being whisked away in his waiting limousine. Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe, 91, tripped as he came down some podium stairs at the airport . Despite clear evidence that the president did indeed fall over, the Zimbabwian government has today claimed Mugabe did not tumble . He had been addressing his adoring supporters on his return from an African Union meeting in Ethiopia, where he became the 54-nation organisation's chairman . He had been welcomed to the airport by cheering supporters, who held placards aloft - one of which said 'Your greatness resonates across Africa and beyond'. But this is a far from widespread sentiment. Mugabe, who celebrates his 91st birthday on February 21, has been accused of using widespread violence to win several disputed elections, according to human rights groups. The country suffered hyperinflation until it abandoned its currency for the US dollar in 2009, . However, Mugabe - who, along with his wife Grace, is on the EU blacklist - still has time to take annual vacations every January to Asia, including Singapore where he has visited specialists for check-ups on his eyes, according to Zimbabwean officials.","Zimbabwe's president tripped as he walked down steps at the airport .

"A 911 dispatcher broke the rules to talk a toddler's grandmother through how to give the youngster CPR - and ultimately save his life. Seventeen-month-old Aidan Walker had been feeling unwell when he went down for a nap in Galax, Virginia in December as his grandmother, Cheri Grable, watched him. Suddenly the boy suffered a seizure and stopped breathing. His mother, Melissa Grable, immediately called 911 and desperately begged for help. 'Oh my God, my baby, my baby!' she can be heard saying on the 911 call, first shared by WSLS. 'He's not breathing! Oh my God, oh my God!' Scroll down for video . Saved: Seventeen-month-old Aidan Walker, pictured, stopped breathing after suffering a seizure in December but a 911 dispatcher promptly told his grandmother how to perform CPR - saving his life . Rule breaker: Dispatcher Tim Webb decided to give Aidan's grandmother instructions even though the police department does not have emergency medical dispatch certification . The dispatcher at the Galax Police Department, Tim Webb, can be heard patiently trying to calm the women down as he confirms the boy's age, whether he had been eating  and if they knew CPR. 'No! No! What do we do?' Cheri Grable can be heard asking. Webb had a choice: even though he knows CPR, the police department does not have emergency medical dispatch certification, so he is not allowed to give out CPR instructions over the phone. 'Without some sort of life-saving measures, the child would expire,' Webb told WSLS. 'I wasn't gonna let that happen, even if it meant being reprimanded.' He said his chief, Rick Clark, was also in the room during the call and heard the situation. As soon as they locked eyes, Webb said he knew that Clark supported him taking action. So he got to work. Relief: His grandmother Cheri Grable, left, and mother Melissa Grable, right, were able to get him breathing . Fighter: Aidan is now well again - and his family said that they will be life-long friends with Webb . 'I'm not gonna let you lose him,' he said on the call. 'Put him on your kitchen table ok?' He told them to use two fingers to make sure the boy's head was tilted back slightly. 'All right, barely pinch his nose off and put your mouth over top of his mouth, and I need you to blow in it just a second and see ok?' Webb instructed. The women then report that the boy's chest is moving again and that the color is returning to his face. Webb instructs them to turn him on his side in case the boy vomits. 'It was the scariest day of my life,' Aidan's Mother Melissa Grable said. 'All I could do was say a prayer, over and over and over, ""please God don't take my son from me"".' The family has since visited the police department to meet Webb in person and thank him - and said they will be returning throughout the years as Aiden grows. 'You're a lifelong friend,' Melissa told him. See below for video .","Seventeen-month-old Aidan Walker stopped breathing at his Virginia home after suffering a seizure when he was sick .

"A woman treated for a recurring superbug infection with a stool transplant from an overweight donor rapidly gained weight afterwards, it has emerged. The female patient then became obese, according to experts who reviewed her case. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a promising  treatment for relapsing C. difficile infections. The bacterial infection affects the digestive system, and often those who have been treated with antibiotics. In severe cases, the infection can cause life-threatening complications. A woman who underwent a faecal transplant to help cure her recurring C-difficile infections gained more than three stone in the months after the procedure, where stools from an overweight donor were transferred into her gut, in a bid to restore 'good' bacteria (picture is posed by models) The aim of a faecal transplant is to replace 'good' bacteria in the gut that has been killed or suppressed. This balances out the 'bad'bacteria, specifically C-difficile, that are overpopulating the colon. However the new report suggests clinicians should avoid selecting stool donors who are overweight. And doctors say it raises questions about the role of gut bacteria in metabolism and health. At the time of the patient's faecal transplant in 2011, her weight was stable at nine-and-a-half stone, and her body mass index (BMI) was a borderline 26 (a healthy BMI is classed as a up to 25). Then 32 years old, the woman had always been of 'normal weight', according to the case report. The transplant used donor stools from the woman's overweight but otherwise healthy teenage daughter. It was administered via a colonoscopy to restore a healthy balance of bacteria in the woman's gut, curing her C-diff infection. But 16 months after the procedure, the woman's weight rose to 12 stone and her BMI increased to 33 - meeting the medical criteria for obesity. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a procedure where faecal matter, or stools, is collected from a donor. It is then mixed with saline before being transplanted into a patient by colonoscopy, endoscopy or enema. The aim is to replace 'good' bacteria in the gut that has been killed or suppressed, usually by the use of antibiotics, leaving 'bad'bacteria, specifically C-difficile, to overpopulate the colon. The infection can cause complications often resulting in debilitating diarrhoea, which in some cases proves fatal. The woman's weight gain continued, despite doctors placing her on a medically supervised liquid protein diet and exercise regime. Sustained efforts to diet and exercise regularly failed to achieve any weight loss. Three years after her transplant the woman weighed 12-and-a-half stone, and her BMI reached 34.5. Specialists examining her case said she remains clinically obese today. Colleen Kelly, from the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University said: 'We're questioning whether there was something in the faecal transplant, whether some of those ""good"" bacteria we transferred may have had an impact on her metabolism in a negative way.' The link is supported by past animal studies looking at bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and weight. After transferring gut bacteria from obese mice into animals of a normal weight, scientists noted a marked increase in fat. In light of the woman's case, the authors of the report recommend selecting stool donors who are not overweight. But they noted the transplant was not the only possible cause of the patient's weight gain. The woman weighed a stable nine-and-a-half stone before the procedure and had a BMI of 26. But within 176 months her weight rose to 12 stone and BMI to 33 - making her medically obese. Two years after the operation the woman weighed 12-and-a-half stone and her BMI was 34.5 (file picture) They said in addition to treatment for C-diff, the woman had also been treated with several antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori infection. Other possible contributing factors in the woman's weight gain include the resolution of her C-diff infection, genetic factors, ageing, and stress related to illness. However, as noted, the patient had never been overweight before. Ana Weil and Elizabeth Hohmann, of Massachusetts General Hospital, said the case raises many questions about donor selection and highlights the importance of studying long-term outcomes of faecal transplants. In a related editorial, they said: 'Careful study of FMT will advance knowledge about safe manipulation of the gut microbiota. 'Ultimately, of course, it is hoped that FMT studies will lead to identification of defined mixtures of beneficial bacteria that can be cultured, manufactured, and administered to improve human health.' The report was published in the new journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases.","32-year-old woman had the faecal transplant in 2011 after suffering recurring C. difficile infections - which affect the digestive system .

"Two Philadelphia police officers were charged Thursday with aggravated assault for beating up a man riding a scooter in an unprovoked attack that was caught on a surveillance camera. A grand jury brought the police brutality charges against officers Sean McKnight and Kevin Robinson, finding they allegedly knocked Najee Rivera off his motorized scooter and pummeled him with fists and baton in May 2013, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said during a press conference announcing the charges. Surveillance footage from a business recorded at least some of the beating, said the district attorney's office in Philadelphia. Scroll down for video . 'Not above the law': Philadelphia police officers Sean McKnight (left) and Kevin Robinson (right) have been charged with aggravated assault and a slew of other counts in the May 2013 attack on Najee Rivera . Beaten to a pulp: Rivera, 23, suffered a fractured orbital bone and numerous head lacerations . Prosecutors said the officers later lied about the attack, accusing the victim of assaulting Robinson. Rivera, 23, suffered a fractured orbital bone and numerous head lacerations. Prosecutors said there was so much blood on the ground around Rivera that another officer who arrived on the scene thought he had been shot, according to NBC Philadelphia. Robinson, 26, a six-year veteran, and 30-year-old McKnight, who has been on the force for seven years, are now facing charges of aggravated assault; simple assault; criminal conspiracy; reckless endangerment; tampering with public records; false reports of law enforcement authorities; obstruction and official oppression. At 10pm on May 29, 2013, Najee Rivera was riding his scooter near North 7th and Somerset streets when he was pulled over by police. According to investigators, the 23-year-old driver became fearful and took off. In the officers' version of events originally offered to their superiors, what happened next was that Rivera fell from his scooter and hurt his face. Surveillance video from a nearby business captured the veteran cops beating the man . After being pummeled with fists and a baton, Rivera was handcuffed and left bleeding on the ground for several minutes . Robinson and McKnight’s report also stated that the 23-year-old violently resisted arrest by assaulting the six-year police veteran. But surveillance footage from a nearby business, which has been obtained by Rivera's girlfriend and later aired by 6ABC, tells a markedly different story. Prosecutors say the grainy video, which the woman tracked down by canvassing area businesses, shows one of the cops reaching out of the squad car window and clubbing Rivera in the head. The police car then bumps the scooter, sending Rivera tumbling to the ground. Robinson and McKnight emerge from the car and proceed to repeatedly strike the man with their fists and a baton, the prosecutors said. 'He never resisted. he never struck them. he never fought back. they just started hitting him,' Williams said. Furious: Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, left, said Thursday what his officers did was inappropriate and in violation of every policy . Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, at podium, vowed to prosecute Robinson and McKnight to the fullest extent of the law . Following the assault, Rivera was placed in handcuffs and kept on the ground for several minutes while bleeding profusely. He was then booked on charges of resisting arrest and aggravated assault. But the case against Rivera fell apart when his girlfriend turned the damning surveillance footage over to police. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters Thursday that Robinson and McKnight have been suspended for 30 days with intent to dismiss from the force. The two cops have been off the streets for the past two years. 'What they did was totally inappropriate, totally in violation of policy, training, anything, period,"" Ramsey said. District Attorney Williams has vowed to prosecute Robinson and McKnight to the fullest extent of the law, declaring that police officers are 'not above the law,' and that even if Rivera 'had been the devil himself,' they were not justified in treating him they way they did . Rivera filed a federal lawsuit and won a $200,000 settlement from the City of Philadelphia.","Philadelphia police officers Sean McKnight and Kevin Robinson charged with aggravated assault and a slew of other counts in May 2013 attack .

"A doctor was killed and a television news station knocked off air when the  plane he was flying crashed into a television transmitter on its way in to land. Dr Kenneth Rice was flying towards Preston Smith International Airport in Lubbock, Texas, when his light aircraft struck KCBD NewsChannel 11's transmitter, knocking it to the ground. The single-engine Piper PA-46 hit the ground north of the broadcaster's studios, KCBD reported. Smash: The remains of the single-engine aircraft piloted by Dr Kenneth Rice which crashed into a television station transmitter tower as it approached the Preston Smith International Airport in Lubbock, Texas . According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Dr Rice's plane crashed shortly after dropping off radar screens at about 7.30pm local time. 'The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed a crash site inside the city limits of Lubbock,' the FAA said. 'FAA investigators are on their way to the site. 'The National Transportation Safety Board has been notified.' Dr Rice, a diabetes expert who worked at University Medical Center in Lubbock, is  a co-owner of Daedalus Air, the company which owned the plane . Alex DeLeon was in the KCBD parking lot when the tower went down. He told the broadcaster: 'The antenna or tower just collapsed into two... I saw it falling this direction, so I got under this awning here, and I just felt like it was over me.' Firefighters told workers at KCBD to leave the building, warning them the remaining transmitter tower was also at risk of collapsing. Steve Holland of the Lubbock Fire Department told the Daily Toreador that the tail section of Dr Rice's aircraft was almost totally destroyed in the crash. 'The wings are — and I haven’t spent a lot of time over there looking — but I believe one of the wings for sure was detached from the airplane,' Mr Holland added. Dr Rice, a diabetes expert who worked out of University Medical Center in Lubbock, is listed as a co-owner of Daedalus Air, the company which owned the plane. According to the FAA the flight originated from Carlsbad, New Mexico. The crash left lights knocked out across south-east Lubbock after the aircraft struck an electricity transmission line as it went down. About 2,500 homes were left without power while emergency crews from the Lubbock Power & Light company tried to restore the connection, according to a statement by the firm published on everythinglubbock.com. Power was restored by about midnight.","Dr Kenneth Rice was flying the aircraft when it hit the tower and crashed .

Tlust.com, which calls itself a  social club for transsexuals, transvestites and crossdressers, advertises parties that are 'held in a discrete [sic] midtown loft with private and group play areas.' It also promises coat check, lockers, complimentary soft drinks, snacks, condoms and lube, and invites guests to bring their own liquor. Software engineer and byteLair owner Vanessa Vance said she and many of her clients are transgendered and she plans to file a discrimination suit against Gluck (pictured) The suit, filed by Gluck's Hole in One Associates LP, claims the company transformed the office area by using sheets and room dividers to create smaller spaces. Gluck said other tenants in the 12 E. 32 St. building initially complained of 'excessive noise' coming from the sixth floor before reporting people were wandering around the building searching for 'the party'. The landlord also claims that his representatives heard individuals 'engaging in sexual activity' when they visited the office to investigate further, according to the New York Post. His lawsuit, which claims that tenants 'are now fearful for their safety when entering and exiting the building', asks that the tenant be evicted. But Vanessa Vance, who identified herself as byteLair's owner, is fighting the allegations. Vance, a software engineer, said she and many of her client and friends are transgendered. She said she also runs a transgendered support group out of her office and is 'shocked someone could be so misinformed'. Vance said she will file a discrimination suit against the company for hurting her business and has no plans to leave the building. 'They're not going to push me out,' she said.","Laurence Gluck's lawsuit claims byteLair Inc. advertised parties at Midtown building on transgender, transsexual, and cross-dressing website .

"He's got the best moves in Hollywood,  laid back charm that is fast becoming box office gold and chiselled abs that have got us all talking, now with the release of a teaser trailer for Magic Mike XXL, it's clear Channing Tatum is becoming the world's favourite hunk. The film clip of the stripper drama sequel is  only a minute and a half long but has been viewed more than two million times and women have taken to the web in their thousands to share their admiration for the 34-year-old. Now, to celebrate the return of our favourite Florida dancer we've taken a look back at Channing's finest moments from posing on the red carpet, playing a tough guy on screen, cuddling his wife Jenna Dewan and appearing in THAT Oscar selfie... to quote the end of the Magic Mike XXL trailer, 'You're welcome.' Scroll down for video . He's back: The trailer for  Magic Mike XXL, starring Channing Tatum (second right) and Joe Manganiello (third left) is here . Flashdance: In Magic Mike XXL Channing plays  the stripper who makes bespoke furniture, and in the trailer he's shown in the workshop . In the opening moments of the trailer for the stripper sequel, Channing is shown using power tools in a workshop wearing just a tank top, which offers him a chance to show off his sculpted arms. The music kicks in and Channing, who plays Mike Lane, starts to gyrate his hips, strip off his welding mask, wipe away the sweat and begin to pop and lock before leaping around the workroom and break dancing on a wooden table. With such athletic moves, it's hard to believe that the actor - who made his film breakthrough as surly street dancer Tyler Gage in 2006's Step Up - turns 35 in April. Yet the films are loosely based on his own experiences of being an 18-year-old stripper in Tampa, Florida, which explains his expert performance - and X-rated execution of pelvic-thrusting move 'The Worm'. Beach bod: Channing shows off a tanned torso on the beach in 2010 romantic film Dear John about a soldier who falls for a college student . Cute: In Dear John, Channing as John Tyree, a soldier who exchanges letters with Amanda Seyfried's Savannah Curtis when he's deployed . Focus: CHanning pictured mid-action in the film White House Down, during a fight scene set in a burning wreck . Fans have long been anticipating the sequel to the popular 2012 film, Magic Mike, and they have been promised even more 'raunchy latex and leather' by the movie's costume designer. On Tuesday, Channing released a picture of the first poster for the movie; a very risqué photo showing the dancer revealing his impressive six pack abs, as he points to his crotch. In the June issue of GQ, Channing, who has a one-year-old daughter Everly, revealed that the plot would centre around the guys - played by muscled hunks including Joe Manganiello - going away to a stripper convention. He added that back when he worked as a stripper, he went to these conventions himself. First look: Channing Tatum took to his social media accounts on Tuesday to share the first poster for Magic Mike XXL . Those were the days: When the music starts Channing is taken back to his dancing days and starts to pop, lock and gyrate his hips . 'The women would come from miles and miles around,' he said. 'Then you lock the doors and you say all bets are off. It gets zany and crazy, and it's a wild ride.' She said that the ladies will be sweating more than the men despite their energetic dance moves and they sheer range of thongs and posing pouches worn by the actors will not disappoint. Action man: Channing as John Cale, a policeman who comes to the President's rescue in 2013 film White House Down . He knows it: Showing off some serious tone in a revealing top, and looking suave in a suit . Manly and rugged: Channing shows off sculpted arms in an oiled and muddied white tank top, with Jamie Foxx by his side . Ready for the stage: A still from the first Magic Mike film from 2012 in which a stripper troupe play firemen, policemen and other hyper-masculine characters to perform nearly nude for the dozens of women in Club Xquisite . Cheer for the boys: Featuring Kevin Nash as Tarzan,  Matt Bomer as Ken, Joe Manganiello as Big Dick Richie and Adam Rodriguez as Tit . Back in the day: Rare snaps from 2007 with Garrett Hedlund (l) and with Jenna (r) at the Cove Atlantis Beach Club, Bahamas . Alabama-born Channing is also the star of the hit movie remakes of 21 Jump Street and its sequel 22 Jump Street about cops undercover in high school and then college with Jonah Hill. He also appeared with Jamie Foxx in action drama White House Down in 2013 and in GI Joe: Retaliation but it's his roles in weepie rom coms such as The Vow with Rachel McAdam, that have earned him his army of female fans. Channing kicked off his career in 2000 as a dancer in Ricky Martin's She Bangs music video, earning just $400 for the job before becoming a model for Armani and Abercrombie & Fitch. Today the actor may be the hottest property in Hollywood, and a heartthrob to thousands, but for him there's only one woman - his partner of nine years, Jenna, who he calls 'a very sexy individual' and the couple make it a priority to be together as much as possible. He really is a model husband, father and actor. Magic Mike XXL comes to UK cinemas July 31 2015 .

"A Texas father whose son died after climbing into his hot car while unsupervised has been found not guilty of negligence. Joshua Cartee, 33, was arrested in September 2013 after his 2-year-old son, Jorden, snuck out of the family’s home in Anna and got into his father’s car on a hot day while the man was taking a nap at home. Neighbors eventually discovered the toddler inside the overheated sedan, but it was too late; Jorden Cartee died in the hospital four days later, on September 19, 2013. Cleared: Joshua Cartee, 33 (left), has been acquitted of manslaughter and criminal negligence in the hot-car death of his 2-year-old son, Jorden (right) Too late: The toddler was discovered unresponsive on the floor of his father's car in September 2013 . Heartbreaking: Little Jorden passed away in the hospital four days later . On Thursday, it took a 12-person jury more than six hours of deliberations to acquit Joshua Cartee of a manslaughter charge and one count of negligent homicide. The presiding judge declared a mistrial on a second count of negligent homicide when the jurors could not reach a verdict. The father was unanimously found not guilty of recklessly causing his son's death by failing to lock the front door to prevent him from leaving; he was also cleared of not calling police to help him look for Jorden. It is now up to the prosecution to try Cartee again, or to dismiss the third charge against him. Cartree's wife of nearly 10 years and the mother of his two sons told Dallas Morning News she felt overjoyed when the verdict was announced. 'We're walking out of here like winners,' Jennifer Kindle told the paper. Most of the 12 men and women on the jury panel agreed, however, that Jorden Cartee's death was a preventable accident. According to prosecutors, on September 13, 2013, little Jorden walked out the unlocked front door of his family home and climbed into Cartee's car. About an hour and a half later, the Cartees' neighbors found the toddler alive but unresponsive on the floor behind the driver's seat. Temperatures were in the 90s that day. The 2-year-old was taken to Children’s Medical Center in Dallas, where he was placed in a medically induced coma to try and reduce the swelling in his brain. Despite the doctors' efforts, Jorden passed away four days later. The medical examiner ruled the child's death an accident, but his father was arrested because the child was in his care. Still together: Jennifer Kindle (pictured left), Jorden's mother and Joshua Cartee's wife, said after the verdict she was happy her husband of 10 years (right) was acquitted . Not out of the woods yet: A judge declared a mistrial on a second count of negligent homicide against Cartee (pictured), leaving the door open for the prosecution to put him on trial again . During the trial, prosecutors told the jury Jorden’s parents knew he was prone to sneaking out. Less than two months before the tragedy, the toddler was found in his diaper playing on the side of a busy highway, which prompted an investigation by Child Protective Services . Mr Cartee had installed additional locks on the front and back doors, and a CPS official created a 60-day safety plan for the family requiring the parents to keep an eye on their son at all times and make sure the exits were bolted. Police and CPS caseworkers testified that on the morning of September 13, Joshua Cartee did not lock the doors after his wife left to drop their older son at school. He settled in for a nap with Jorden, but when he awakened at around 12.30pm, his wife still was not home and his son was nowhere to be found. Cartee told investigators he scoured his home and surrounding area for an hour before he went to his neighbors for help. About 15 minutes later, Jorden was finally located. Joshua Cartee said that while searching his property, he notice did notice that the trunk of his car was open, but he did not see his son inside.","Joshua Cartee, 33, was arrested in September 2013 after his son Jorden snuck out of the house and got into his father's car .

"Being Prime Minister does not mean David Cameron can avoid the trials and tribulations of being a parent. In an interview with MailOnline, he revealed details of a dash to A&E when his son Elwen was stung on the foot 60 times after standing on a wasps' nest. And he explained how, like millions of other parents, he is forced to listen to Disney hit 'Let It Go' again and again. David Cameron revealed how he rushed his son Elwen to hospital after he stood on a wasps' nest while out with his mother Samantha . Running the country comes with enormous pressures, though David Cameron does at least get to live above the shop, in his Downing Street flat. But being Prime Minister does not mean that normal family life does not go on, including moments of crisis. The NHS is set to dominate the election campaign whether the Tories like it or not. Labour has made clear the health service will be a key weapon in its attacks on the government. But there is always the danger that as Prime Minister he only gets to see the best hospitals, smartened up for a VIP visit. MailOnline reader, Demonica from Yorkshire, asked: ’When was the last time you accessed NHS care without prior warning, so that managers had no time to bring in more staff, paint the walls, hide patients and sycophantically pretend that the NHS is thriving under your watch?’ The Prime Minister also told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that he had been forced to listen to Disney hit 'Let It Go' repeatedly . Mr Cameron revealed the moment one Sunday afternoon last year when Elwen and Samantha were badly stung on the feet. In keeping with the government’s official advice, he called the 111 helping - blamed for sending too many people to A&E - and was, unsurprisingly, told to go to A&E. Mr Cameron said: ’My son stood on a wasps' nest in Oxfordshire and I rang 111 as you should, gave all the details. They advised me to go to A&E in case he got anaphylactic shock. The family went to the John Radcliffe hospital which serves his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire, where their care was 'very good'. But he admits 'it wasn't a particularly busy time of day being a Sunday afternoon’, in contrast to the long waits thousands of patients have experienced this winter. NHS staff gave 'brilliant advice' because young Elwen was 'in a lot of pain, poor thing'. Mr Cameron added: 'He had been stung 60 times. Samantha stepped on it too, so she had been stung too. 'But he was very brave but they were very good, very reassuring. There's been quite a lot of changes at the Radcliffe actually. The A&E is in good shape.' Even being Prime Minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from Disney film, Frozen, he revealed today . In 2013, the Camerons' daughter Florence was rushed to hospital after getting a sticker stuck up her nose. A year earlier, the Prime Minister was mocked after leaving his older daughter Nancy in a pub in Buckinghamshire. Away from medical emergencies, Mr Cameron has to balance parenting with running the country. But even being Prime Minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from Disney film, Frozen. Asked if he is a Frozen fan, he replies wearily: 'I have no choice.' His youngest daughter Florence, aged four, 'of course is Elsa', he says. His security detail also have to put up with the songs on loop when travelling with the family. 'Florence has got an Elsa dress with all the trimmings and regularly launches into song.' But he pre-empts the looming challenge to prove his knowledge of Elsa, Anna and Olaf: 'I don't know all the words but I have listened to it being sung more times than I care to remember. 'But I won't either give you Do You Want To Build A Snowman or Let It Go.' From Gogglebox and Game of Thrones to Boris Johnson’s hair, these are the really important questions MailOnline readers wanted answered. And after five years in coalition with the Lib Dems, is Nick Clegg still his favourite political joke? David Cameron revealed he is a fan of both House of Cards (left) and Game of Thrones (right) House of Cards or Game of Thrones? 'Both. Thrones more than Cards. I’m a big Thrones man.' If you were any character from Game of Thrones, which would you like to be? 'I think you don't want to answer the question is the right answer. I think Michael Gove said he is Tyrion Lannister and I think I'll let him play that part.' Downton Abbey or Wolf Hall? 'More Wolf Hall. I'm loving it, I think it's very very good.’ What do you think of Boris Johnson’s hair? 'It's a work of art and should be preserved for the nation.’ WH Smith or Smythson (where wife Samantha works)? 'That's an impossible question and one that could lead to all sorts of... It depends what I'm buying.' The Prime Minister revealed he would be 'delighted' to join Gogglebox's Steph and Dom Parker for an evening of drinking after admitting to being a fan of the show . Despatch Box or Gogglebox? 'I do think Gogglebox is extraordinarily insightful and I think if politicians want to understand how we are viewed at home it's quite recommended viewing.’ Would you have a night on the booze with Dom and Steph Parker, as Nigel Farage did? 'I would be delighted. They look like a really charming couple.' 'Someone said to me, you must watch it because it's very interesting when they watch the news. 'So I watched five minutes and I was hooked, it's completely brilliant. What - or who - is now your favourite political joke? Presumably you can't say Nick Clegg any more... Or maybe you can? 'Who or what is my favourite political joke? I think today it is my good friend Ed Balls.’ The shadow chancellor floundered on Newsnight this week when he forgot the name of a Labour supporting businessman named ’Bill’. Mr Cameron joked in the Commons yesterday: ’Bill Somebody is not a person, Bill somebody is Labour’s policy. The PM said today: ’I think Bill Somebody, which I didn't think of, I will credit the hardworking researcher Rupert Harrison with the authorship of this joke, but I thought it was a cracker.’","EXCLUSIVE: David Cameron recalls family’s emergency visit to A&E .

"Six-year-old Tianna Measuria bravely called 999 after finding her mother unconscious and bleeding . This is the touching moment a six-year-old girl called 999 after finding her mother unconscious with blood coming out her mouth in the middle of the night and saved her life. Tianna Measuria bravely dialled for an ambulance and told the call handler 'mummy's a bit ill' after 24-year-old Jazmin Carter was unresponsive in her bed at their home in Falmouth, Cornwall. The audio of the harrowing call has been released by South Western Ambulance Service, which praised the schoolgirl for her quick thinking and clear and concise manner. She began by saying: 'My mummy's a bit ill and please can you help?' before explaining she had heard her make a lot of noise before noticing the blood coming out her mouth. Call handler, Vicki Fallding, asks her to check if her mother is still breathing and can be heard saying: 'Don't worry mummy, don't worry, it's fine,' she says. 'Mummy, are you alright?'. She was also asked to see if she could roll Miss Carter onto her side and tells the operator she will try but after a few seconds replies 'she's too heavy'. Throughout the call she maturely followed every instruction given to her and continued to check on her state of consciousness. Shortly after the call a policeman arrived - quickly followed by the ambulance crew - and little Tianna let them in and led them to her mother. Speaking after the event Tianna said: 'There was a lot of blood on the pillow and her mouth. 'It was little bit scary. She was just staring at me so I had to phone the ambulance.' Listen to the audio below . Her mother Jazmin, 24, said Tianna's stepfather works away but taught her what to do in an emergency. She said: 'I am so proud of her. She has done amazingly and has blow us away really. 'We taught her how to do it not thinking she would ever need to. We have impressed upon her the importance of knowing what to do. 'I am very proud and also very lucky that she was with me and knew exactly what to do.' Brave: Ambulance crews from South Western Ambulance Service have praised Tianna for her quick thinking . All the staff from South West Ambulance Service Trust who had contact with Tianna said they were ""extremely impressed"" with her actions, which they said made all the difference to her mum. Ms Fallding, emergency medical advisor working in the Trust’s clinical hub in Exeter, said: 'I was surprised at how mature and calm she was. It was like speaking to a much older child. 'I've spoken to adults who, in similar circumstances, are very distressed and not always able to answer questions. 'Not only was she able to answer the questions I posed but did so in such a clear and concise manner.' She added she would encourage other parents to teach their children how to get help. Graham Jenkin, one of the paramedics who attended, said: 'Tianna was not only able to get her mum help and provide us with information but was also able to signpost us to other family members and we are so impressed at the way she remained calm and helpful throughout. 'Finding her mum unconscious and bleeding could not have been easy for her, but she really did take it all in her stride.' Miss Carter has made a full recovery since the incident last month and Tianna has now been presented with a certificate from the ambulance trust in recognition of her actions. Speaker: Ambulance. Is the patient conscious and breathing? Tianna: Hi, my mummy's a bit ill and please can you help? S: OK, what's happened? T: Um, in the morning she made lots of noise and like blood was out of her mouth and it's all over her pillow. S: OK. How old is your mummy do you know? T: Um . S: How old does she look? How old are you? T: Six . S: Six, OK. Alright. Can you wake up mummy do you know? T: I tried but she's not. S: OK so she's not waking up. Can you see mummy's chest going up and down? T: Erm I can't see because it's in the dark. Shall I put the light on? S: Yeah, yes please . T: She's not snoring very well . S: She's not snoring very well? T: No . S: OK, can you put the phone by mummy's mouth? T: Phone? S: Yeah, could you put the phone by mummy's mouth? T: Blood's coming out . S: Blood's coming out of her mouth? OK . T: She's like asleep. [To mum] Don't worry mummy, don't worry, it's fine. S: OK, well done, can you wake her up? Try and wake her up again. T: I'll try. S: Well done. T: [To mum] Mummy, are you alright? [To speaker] No I can't. S: OK. But mummy's lying down isn't she? T: Yeah . S: Have you got anyone else there? T: No, nobody else. S: OK, alright. Is it possible, do you think you can roll mummy onto her side? T: Pardon? S: Do you think you could roll mummy on to her side? T: Yeah I'll try . S: Well done . T: She's too heavy.

"Households could see their phone and internet bills rise after BT announced a mammoth £12.5billion deal to buy mobile giant EE, it was claimed yesterday. The deal will create the largest provider of home internet, mobile phones and landlines in the UK. BT, a former state-owned monopoly, will use the combination to sell mobile phones to its existing base of 10million households. It is already the largest provider of landlines and home internet in the UK. The £12.5billion deal will create the largest provider of home internet, mobile phones and landlines in the UK . EE is currently the country's largest mobile provider, with just over 27million customers, and also has the largest number of customers using the superfast 4G mobile network – some 7.7million. Competitors last night warned the resulting company would be too dominant. Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao said: 'There are four Davids and one Goliath. It will be more than double the size of the nearest competitor.' The deal will be scrutinised by the UK Competition and Markets Authority in a process that is expected to take until the end of the year. Until then both BT and EE will continue to operate as separate companies. There are worries that the move will lead to higher prices for the majority of households. Customers who choose to take all four services – broadband, landlines, TV and mobile, a package known as quadplay – from the enlarged BT are likely to pay lower charges overall. The sector is currently moving towards ‘quad play’, where the four major services – mobile, broadband, landline and TV – are sold in one package (stock image) But there are fears that families who only pay for two or three services will see bills rise. Analyst Dan Ridsdale at Edison Investment Research said: 'The bundling of services makes it much more difficult to compare pricing.' Ernest Doku, of price comparison site uSwitch, said: 'Consumers who want to take out the resulting quad-play services may see savings, and the simplicity of one bill for all telecoms services will make it a very appealing option for consumers. 'But with so many different bundles available for different products, it can be trickier to know if you are getting a good deal.' Another mega-merger is also underway, with mobile group O2 being bid for by rival Three. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Fewer players in any essential market is rarely good for consumers. The competition authorities must now look at both the proposed mergers and the market in the round to make sure that consumers are protected from unfair price increases or poorer service.'","BT has announced a mammoth £12.5billion deal to buy mobile giant EE .

"On Wednesday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, she bravely waded through vats of blood and guts, telling squeamish contestant Laura Dundovic 'I think you could have done it if you had given childbirth'. But giving birth is unlikely to be the most difficult thing Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia on iconic seventies show The Brady Bunch, has ever been through. The now 58-year-old revealed her dark past, including an addiction to cocaine, trading sex for drugs, eating disorders, abortions and learning her grandmother died of syphilis, in a 2008 tell-all memoir, Here's the Story: Surviving Marcia Brady and Finding My True Voice. Scroll down for video . Taking the plunge: Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia on The Brady Bunch, bravely waded into a pool of blood and guts on Wednesday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . Wild times: Pictured at an event in Los Angeles at 21-years-old, during the years when Maureen admitted 'If there was coke, I had to stay up and do every last flake' In the book, the one-time golden girl of American television admitted that behind-the-scenes of the hit show she was nothing like her clean-cut character Marcia Brady, and she spiraled into cocaine addiction from the age of about 18. 'I sought refuge in seemingly glamorous cocaine dens above Hollywood. I thought I would find answers there, while in reality I was simply running farther from myself. From there, I spiraled downward on a path of self-destruction that cost me my career and very nearly my life,' she wrote. What Maureen was 'running' from was a disturbing secret in her family's past, discovering her grandmother had died of syphilis in a mental institution and that her own mother contracted the disease in utero. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! The now 58-year-old was once the golden girl of American television, although she revealed in her 2008 autobiography that it was a very different story behind-the-scenes . Cocaine hell: The promising young actress fell into Hollywood's drug scene, and says she was hooked on cocaine for at least five years from the age of 18 - her final year filming The Brady Bunch . Co-star: With her Brady Bunch 'brother' Barry Williams, who Maureen revealed she dated at one time when the show was being filmed . Despite her mother being treated for the condition to prevent passing it on to her own children, the information troubled the young actress and only added to the anxiety and depression she was experiencing as a teenager growing up on screen. Even with her long blonde hair and slim physique, Maureen felt the pressure of Hollywood take a toll on her body image, and she soon developed bulimia in an effort to attain what she saw as perfection. Falling deeper into the Hollywood drug scene, the young actress' addiction became so bad she admits she had sex with a cocaine dealer in exchange for drugs. More troubles: The starlet also struggled with depression and bulimia, the pressures of Hollywood and living up to the 'perfect' character she portrayed taking its toll . Party girl: Maureen (far left) with friends at a film premiere in Los Angeles, at the age of 23 . 'If there was coke, I had to stay up and do every last flake even if it meant going without sleep for days,' she wrote. 'Nothing else mattered'. The promising young starlet's career was squandered by her addiction, and she reveals how she threw away acting opportunities by turning up to meetings with Hollywood producers high on drugs and having not slept for days. She recalls how Steven Spielberg simply gave her an orange when she went to meet him to discuss a part in Raiders Of The Lost Ark despite being completely 'messed up'. Team player: Maureen has been popular with the public as a contestant on the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . Transformation: The American star has put her dark past behind her and now lives with husband Michael Cummings and daughter Natalie, 25, in Los Angeles . Her out of control behaviour also led to several unwanted pregnancies. 'I was 18, 19 and 20 when I had each abortion,' she recalled. 'It shows how careless I was. It shows what drugs did to me and how far I went.' Yet another secret revealed in the tell-all was that she enjoyed a brief romance with her on-screen brother, Barry Williams. Long-time love: Maureen married Michael Cummings in 1985 and she credits him with helping her turn her life around . Family: Maureen with her daughter Natalie, 25, and older brother Denny . Mother and daughter: Maureen with a young Natalie in 1998 . She confessed the pair's fling began with a passionate kiss when they filmed scenes in Hawaii. Maureen eventually went to rehab and credits meeting husband Michael Cummings, who she married in 1985, with turning her life around. The couple have one daughter Natalie, 25.

"Montana legislators on Wednesday considered whether to join every other state in the nation in putting anti-bullying policy into law. A bill introduced by Rep. Kimberly Dudik, a Missoula Democrat, in the Montana House Education Committee would define bullying, prohibit it in public schools and require public school districts to adopt their own policies addressing the issue. Pilar Petroski, a seventh-grader from Helena, and her father, Andrew, spoke in favor of the bill, with the 12-year-old saying she's frustrated with school officials who turn the other way when she tells them about death threats she's received along with harassment in person and online. 'The school needs to know exactly what bullying is because clearly to them I'm just a student who's being teased,' Pilar told the committee. 'I just want other people to realize how big of a deal this is.' Victim: 12-year-old Pilar Petroski spoke in front of the Montana state legislature on Wednesday in support of an anti-bullying bill. Pictured above in a September 2014 TV interview . In a previous interview this past September, Petroski and her mother recounted how the bullying got so bad that she had to be pulled out of CR Anderson Middle School in Helena. 'I was kind of quiet about it because I was like ""Oh, this isn't a big deal, it's going to stop"" so i didn't really mention it at the time. But then it kind of progressed into a more serious thing,' she told KPAX. Her mother says they took out an order of protection after her life was threatened. On Wednesday, there was no testimony against the proposal, but skeptical lawmakers asked whether it was necessary since a recently adopted state regulation provides similar protections. The measure would explicitly define bullying as any repeated harassment, hazing or threatening online or in person. It carries the force of law, meaning parents and local authorities could go after schools and education officials who don't comply, Dudik said. Hold out: If the bill basses, Montana will be the final state to enact anti-bullying legislation . If schools violate the state administrative rule approved in 2013, it would count only against their accreditation rating. Forty-six of the 49 states that have established bullying laws did so by 2010. Hawaii, Michigan and South Dakota were the last to make changes, leaving Montana as the only state that hasn't addressed the issue with legislation. Julie Hertzog, director of PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center, said most state laws enforcing bullying definitions and procedures were enacted in the mid-2000s, with updates like cyberbullying provisions being added every year. She said the laws build better environments for kids to learn and mature in. 'Law really drives the policies and practices of schools,' Hertzog said. She added later, 'And the law sets standards so there are some consistencies between schools.' With the exception of the 2009 term, anti-bully bills have been brought before the Montana Legislature, which meets every other year, each session since 2003. Last session, in 2013, Rep. Jean Price introduced a bill similar to Dudik's, but killed it before the measure could be considered in committee. Price, a Great Falls Democrat, said her bill could have had repercussions for the success of the anti-bullying rule that Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction Denise Juneau was in the process of enacting. 'Juneau and her staff told me not to make a fuss about it right then,' Price said. Republican lawmakers citing local control have been the primary opposition to anti-bullying provisions in Montana. Most bills died in committee along party lines. 'The floor discussion was 'We can take care of our own local communities and our own schools, and we don't need any more code to tell us what to do,' ' Price said. That argument was repeated Wednesday by Steve Meloy of the Montana School Boards Association. Meloy had intended to testify against the bill but changed his mind, he said, after hearing proponents speak. He acted instead as an informational witness and told the committee that anti-bullying legislation superseding the existing rule was unnecessary and may inhibit schools boards from making their own decisions. Rep. Jeff Essmann, a Billings Republican, questioned whether the Montana legislature can force a cultural change on schools. Dudik said she believes the legislature can and should spawn change to deter bullying in Montana schools by sending a message with her bill. The committee did not take action on the measure, which faces several legislative hurdles before it could become law. Dudik said she's not sure whether it has enough support to pass.","The Montana legislature is currently considering an anti-bullying bill .
If passed, Montana will be the final state to enact anti-bullying legislation .
Some lawmakers in the state have opposed such legislation on the basis that local communities should have the power to address the issue .

"This is the moment a prisoner calmly walked out of his jail cell and past security guards in a prison lobby after impersonating his brother in a cunning daylight escape. When the prison guard notices something is amiss, convict William Hewett sheds his coat and sprints off towards the trees in the distance, with the portly guard left trailing in his wake. Hewett, who was being held at the Brunswick County Detention Centre in North Carolina when he escaped, spent four days on the run before eventually being recaptured. Scroll down for video . William Hewett wanders past a prison guard in the Brunswick County Detention Centre lobby . But as Hewett walks out, the guard notices something is amiss and gets up from his seat . Outside, the prisoner glances over his shoulder as a bystander - realising Hewett is being pursued - tries to grab him . However the man's attempt to stop him fails when Hewett throws off his coat and starts running . The prison guard then attempts to give chase but is easily outrun by the cunning jail bird . Sheriff John Ingram said Hewett escaped last Thursday about 4pm after he and his brother Curtis switched armbands while being held in the same cell. Hewett impersonated his brother - who was being held on an assault charge - when Curtis was bonded out of jail, according to WECT. His brother now faces charges for his role in the plan, while a jailer at the detention centre was reportedly sacked. Mr Ingram said security procedures at the detention centre were not followed correctly, which aided Hewett's escape. He told WECT: 'Obviously they did not follow protocol, we can only put but just so many steps in place, . 'If you simply followed protocol and you look at the photos attached to every single thing to include their property when they are checked in, you would know that is not the right person you are letting out.' However, Hewett's time as a free man remained brief when he was recaptured four days later, alongside a host of family members alleged to have helped hide him from the authorities during his time as a fugitive. He was later pictured in court in full body restraints to prevent spitting. Brothers William (left) and Curtis (right) Hewett swapped armbands so William could walk out of prison when he brother was bonded out of jail . William Hewett pictured at a court hearing after he was recaptured and required to wear a face mask to prevent spitting . In a statement, the Brunswick County Sheriff's office said he was found in a camper shell on the property of his family's Trails End compound and taken into custody without incident. In addition to his previous charges, he was also charged with escaping from a county or municipal facility, burning personal property, and injury to personal property, both stemming from an incident on December 18 last year. He was taken back to Brunswick County Detention Facility and held under a $3,000,000 bond. Other people charged include his mother Katherine Hewett Carter, 43; cousin Robert Wayne Hewett, 20; step-father Earl Antonia Carter, 39; girlfriend Caitlin Olivia Moyer, 23; aunt Tanna Lynn Hewett, 36; and family friend Audrey Muncey Thompson, 36. All were facing counts of felony harboring an escapee, among other charges.","William Hewett walked out of detention centre wearing his brother's clothes .

"Sickening footage appears to show Islamic State militants parading around 250 captured soldiers through the desert in their underwear before they are killed and their bodies piled on the bare earth. An Islamic State fighter claimed the men were from the Syrian government's Tabqa air base which extremists seized on Sunday, potentially handing them warplanes, tanks, artillery and ammunition. The video, which has not been independently verified, is too graphic to be published in full. It begins by showing dozens of men being marched through the desert wearing only their underwear. It then fades to black, resuming with a pile of bloodied bodies stacked on top of one another. Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . 'Another ISIS war crime': Footage and photographs have emerged of Islamic State fighters marching more than 200 soldiers across the desert to their deaths in only their underwear after capturing Syria's Tabqa air base . Horror: The video, too graphic to be published in full, fades to black before revealing a chain of men's bodies . Slaughter: A separate image showed masked gunmen preparing to shoot seven men from the same air base. The chilling photograph was released by the Raqqa Media Center yesterday and tallies with other reporting . As the horrific footage progresses it pans slowly across a vast line of men who appear to be dead, and whose bodies have been laid out one by one. The line forms a slow crescent across the desert, seemingly stretching to the horizon as militants stand beside it. Eventually, after more than a minute, the cameraman reaches the end of the line. The precise death toll is uncertain and other sources put it at lower than 250, but at least 150 bodies are visible in the shaky video. Its description on Youtube said it showed the execution of Army officers and Nusayri people, a significant minority of Shia Muslims in Syria. A caption to another version of the video said: 'The 250 shabeeha taken captive by the Islamic State from Tabqa in Raqqa have been executed.' Shabeeha is the Islamist name for soldiers loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. An Islamic State fighter in Raqqa told Reuters: 'Yes we have executed them all'. Marched: Earlier stills from the video showed men being paraded in their underwear and ordered to chant . Before they were killed, the men's captors chanted 'Islamic State' - to which they replied: 'It will remain'. Islamic State won a week-long battle on Sunday to capture the Tabqa base, which is 25 miles from their Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. Syria's authorities insisted at the time that their soldiers had 'successfully regrouped' - suggesting they were later hunted down by the militants and executed. The captured men were escorted closely by Islamic State militants dressed in black and waving flags . Despite heavy losses on the Islamic State side, the base's capture prompted fresh fears that the fighters have got hold of advanced military technology which will allow them to cement their self-declared regime. Video footage has already suggested Islamic State fighters have drones which were used to shoot reconnaissance footage of an army base. Today's reported mass killing also underscores how the group uses  images of violence as much as violence itself to terrorise its opponents, as it sweeps further into Syria and Iraq. Nadim Houry, deputy director of Human Rights Watch for the Middle East, described the video as 'another ISIS war crime'. And yesterday a UN commission accused the extremist group of committing crimes against humanity in Syria, similar to those it has already committed in Iraq. Yet the extremists are also in touch with modern ideas of PR, releasing glossy magazines in English which feature mutilated bodies to promote their cause in the West. The Home Secretary has sounded fresh warnings over the radicalisation of young Brits, with authorities fearing around 500 have joined an array of jihadi groups in Iraq and Syria. Extremists have declared a self-styled caliphate, a Sunni regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme interpretation of Sharia law. It has opened up three fronts in the fighting in Syria, which is already home to a bloody and long-running civil war between President Assad's forces and anti-government rebels. Captured: A resident of Tabqa waves the Islamic State flag on Sunday after militants seized the nearby air base . Death march: Another video appearing to show the same march through the desert was put on social media . There were chants of 'Islamic State', to which the men replied 'It will remain', their hands behind their backs . Tormented: At one point the men appeared to be taunted by their captors as some turned towards the camera . Today CNN claimed the militants in Iraq have also been burning oil wells near the town of Zummar, which is crucial because it is near a road which links Mosul to the Syrian border. The network suggested fighters are attempting to 'cover their tracks' as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters draw closer. The Islamic State extremists now control roughly a third of Syria, mostly areas in the north and east of the country, as the U.S. threatens air strikes similar to those already used in Iraq. But the situation is complicated as Washington has claimed the Syrian government - embroiled in a bloody civil war - is part of the problem despite offering itself as a force against extremism. French President Francois Hollande added today that President Assad, whose forces used brutal force to crush what began as a peaceful uprising three years ago, was no ally in the fight against Islamic State. Sprawling: An image of what is believed to be the air base, just south of the city of Tabqa, shows its long fence . Arsenal: Campaigners say the base contained weapons and jets which may now be used by the militants . Some 43 UN peacekeepers have been detained by gunmen in the Golan Heights, near Syria's border with Israel, where fighting has raged between rebels and government forces. The identity of the armed group is not known. Several rebel groups operate in the Golan, but the Islamic State group has no known presence there. The UN said another 81 peacekeepers are 'currently being restricted to their positions' as the Syrian government denounced the 'kidnapping'. In a statement issued by the Syrian Foreign Ministry, the government said it holds 'the terrorist groups and those who support them fully responsible for the safety of the UN peacekeepers, and calls for their immediate release.' The troops are part of UNDOF, the mission that has been monitoring a 1974 disengagement accord between Syria and Israel after their 1973 war. As of July, UNDOF had 1,223 troops. Today Syrian warplanes hit Islamic State targets in the eastern stronghold of Deir al-Zor and killed some of the group's commanders, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Observatory, run by a Syrian emigrant from his terraced house in Coventry, said the planes struck a building used as an Islamic State headquarters during a meeting of its commanders. Syrian state TV reported that the army 'eliminated more than 10 terrorists' in an attack east of Deir al-Zor military airport, including two Islamic State leaders, and destroyed 14 armoured vehicles. Another video posted online today appeared to show at least one Syrian soldier being interrogated before a group of other captured men in their underwear. The soldier identifies himself as a Shia Muslim officer from the same sect as many high-ranking military officers and President Assad. Islamic State members are Sunni Muslims. 'How many have you killed? How many have you raped?' the interrogator shouts. The soldier replies: 'None. I've been stationed here in the airport.' The interrogator asks why the soldier had been fighting on behalf of Assad and did not defect, adding: 'We're going to send you right back to hell by slaughter'.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Judging by Stephan Brusche's creative approach to fruit he probably didn't have very good table manners as a child, as clearly he was never told off for playing with his food. The 37-year-old graphic designer turns humble bananas into iconic characters such as Marilyn Monroe and Homer Simpson as well as animals and famous artworks. His fruity Instagram posts  have seen him gather a loyal following almost 15,000 strong. Scroll down for video . Dutch graphic designer Stephan Brusche creates clever fruit art using bananas and ballpoint pens. Pictured: Stephan recreates the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe in that white dress . The Dutch artist hadn't expected his clever designs to be so moreish but the positive response has lead him to release his very first book, Fruitdoodles, which documents his initial 50 creations. He also has his own Fruitdoodle calendar with a different creation for each month of the year. Although Stephan has now found his edible art to be rather lucrative the designer says that his famous fruit had very humble beginnings. He had been in the office and had wanted to post something on Instagram. With a lack of stimulus he turned to his bright yellow snack for inspiration and drew a face on the fruit. He told Bored Panda 'I took a ballpoint pen and just started drawing. I was pretty amazed how pleasant a banana peel is to draw on.' Once he had mastered the using a banana skin as a canvas Stephan began to experiment with more ambitious projects. Stephan began posting images of his art on his Instagram account when he was looking for something inventive to post. A giraffe winds it neck around the fruit (left) and (right) the banana is an elephant tusk . Stephan now has an Instagram following almost 15,000 strong. In this image, the artist remodels a banana into a fish carcass after having been eaten at dinner . Stephan's favourite images inspired from the Bible, such as his version of Michelangelo's  Creation of Adam . He continued: 'After that I tried to come up with new ideas for drawings while using the shape of the banana in all kinds of clever ways. 'Trying to keep pushing myself I eventually started to carve in the banana peel as well . 'They show the things I care about or like the most. Not a real agenda behind it. Mostly fun and whatever idea pops into my head when I look at a banana. 'Though I like to make more Bible Bananas just to show how fascinating that book is.' Stephan has now transformed his first 50 banana designs into a book called Fruitdoodles. Here he uses two halves of a banana to form a  fine pair of horns for a Viking helmet .
