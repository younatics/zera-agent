"An airstrike hits an open air market. An explosion rocks a school-turned-shelter. A booby-trapped tunnel explodes. These were among the scenes in Gaza in a more-than-three-week-old conflict that has left more than 1,300 people dead and even more wounded. The violence between Israel's military and Palestinian militants played out Wednesday against a backdrop of another failed humanitarian cease-fire attempt, with militants firing rockets from Gaza into Israel and Israelis responding with airstrikes. With more than 100 people, mostly civilians, reportedly killed Wednesday in the fighting, the United Nations and the United States demanded more be done to protect civilians. A large part of the criticism has been leveled at Israel and its airstrikes, which have bombarded Gaza. Israel in turn has accused Hamas of hiding weapons, including rockets, in schools and launching attacks from near shelters. More than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began on July 8, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said. The number of militants killed is unclear, but the United Nations estimates that 70% to 80% of the dead are civilians. Three more Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday, bringing the total to 56 dead. Three civilians also have been killed in Israel. While saying Israel has a right to defend itself, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said, ""We've also been very clear that Israel needs to do more to live up to its own standards to limit civilian casualties."" It was a sentiment echoed by U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, who also said Israel is being put in a tough situation because ""Hamas is hiding rockets in places to prevent the Israelis from going after them."" ""So look, Hamas is taking steps here that put civilians at risk. But we do believe the Israelis need to do more,"" Harf told reporters during a briefing. While there were calls on Israel to do more to protect civilians, the United States also agreed to Israel's request to resupply it with several types of ammunition, a U.S. defense official told CNN on condition of anonymity. It's not an emergency sale, the official said. Among the items being bought are 120mm mortar rounds and 40mm ammunition for grenade launchers, the official said. Those will come from a stockpile the United States keeps in Israel, which is worth more than $1 billion. U.N. facility struck . Sanaa Abugerad was among some 3,000 Palestinians at a school-turned-shelter when it was hit by artillery early Wednesday. ""We saw the shells when they hit, and shrapnel was falling like rain,"" she told CNN. ""I was so scared and the school filled with smoke. We poured water in our eyes just to see."" The United Nations blamed Israel for the attack, with U.N. spokesman Chris Gunness saying his group's initial assessment indicates Israeli artillery hit the school. The number of deaths was not immediately clear, Gunness said. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 20 were killed. But Israel said a group of militants fired at Israeli soldiers from the vicinity, and the soldiers ""responded by firing at the origin of the fire,"" a military spokesman said. ""If our forces were involved in a firefight, it's because Hamas has decided that it's open season on the U.N.,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN Wednesday. At the same time, Hamas TV reported people were killed in shelling near a street market in northern Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry reported 17 people died. Israel has said errant Hamas rocket fire is responsible for some of the attacks in Gaza. ""More than 200 rockets fired from Gaza have hit Gaza since July 8. Palestinian terrorists fire from civilian areas and hit their own people,"" the IDF said on Twitter, along with videos that the military said show Hamas fighters launching attacks from inside homes, mosques, hospitals and schools. 'Humanitarian window' ends early . The firing of rockets into Israel brought an early end to a four-hour ""humanitarian window"" Wednesday in Gaza. In making the offer earlier in the day for the humanitarian cease-fire, Israel said the window would not apply to areas in which Israeli soldiers were already operating, and Israel would ""respond to any attempt to exploit this window to harm"" civilians or troops. It also told residents to stay away from areas they've been asked to evacuate. Fighting raged in many areas of Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces reporting three of its soldiers killed. The three died while uncovering a tunnel shaft in a home in southern Gaza. ""The house and the tunnel were booby trapped with two explosive devices that were detonated,"" the IDF said. Hamas said its fighters ""lured a special Zionist unit which consisted of between 15 to 20 soldiers to a booby-trapped house with 12 IED canisters."" Twenty-seven Israeli soldiers were wounded in several incidents Wednesday in Gaza, the IDF said. Israel delivers some fuel . More than 200,000 Palestinians are packing into 85 shelters across Gaza, Gunness said Wednesday, calling the situation a ""human displacement crisis."" The Israeli Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, announced on Twitter that Israel has sent into Gaza more than 4 million liters of diesel for the power station, 3 million liters of fuel and 800,000 liters of benzene for transportation, and 1.6 tons of gas for domestic use during the conflict. Forty-three trucks ""carrying over 750 tons of food, medicine & supplies"" entered Gaza Wednesday from Israel, the ministry said. It provided information on how people can donate humanitarian supplies, and a contact at the Palestinian Customs Agency. Inside a Hamas tunnel . What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza?

"(CNN)Should police officers wear cameras to document their activities while on duty? The notion has been around for a while. But since August's fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri -- for which witness accounts varied widely -- it's gained traction to become part of the national conversation about police conduct. The idea is that a video camera mounted on an officer's vest or uniform would provide an accurate, objective account of every encounter with a civilian. Ideally, the camera would discourage police misconduct while protecting officers against unfounded civil complaints of brutality or corruption. Some police associations support the idea, and even the Obama administration is backing it. Since August, more than 150,000 people have signed a petition on the White House's website urging that all state, county and local police be required to wear a camera. In response, Deputy Assistant to the President Roy L. Austin Jr. expressed support for the proposal while saying the Department of Justice is researching the best way to implement video technology into daily policing. As Austin noted, a 2013 report by the Department of Justice found that ""both officers and civilians acted in a more positive manner when they were aware that a camera was present."" Of course, body cameras create some thorny privacy issues, such as whether police need consent to videotape activities on private property. Some officers also view the cameras as unwanted scrutiny and a sign that their supervisors don't trust them. And the fact that a witness used a phone camera to record New York police arresting Eric Garner in July didn't prevent the injuries that led to Garner's death a short time later, nor did the footage lead to indictments for the officers involved. Still, among the police departments that have experimented with officer-worn cameras, early results have been encouraging. A 2013 study found that public complaints against police officers in Rialto, California, plunged after the city's 54 frontline officers began wearing video cameras. Use of force by Rialto officers also declined in the months after the cameras were introduced. Other police departments across the U.S. are also now testing body cameras. Amid protests following the lack of indictments in the Garner case, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in December that his police department was accelerating efforts to equip all its officers with body cameras as well. ""When something happens, to have a video record of it from the police officer's perspective, it's going to help in many, many ways,"" de Blasio said. ""It's going to improve the work of law enforcement. And God forbid, when something goes wrong, we're going to have a clear understanding of what happened and whatever approaches we need to take as a result.""","Some believe police should wear video cameras to document interactions with suspects .

"Approximately 7.7 million American adults age 18 and older have post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. While the disorder is often associated with war veterans who have been exposed to extended violence, PTSD and its treatments involve more than you might think. Here are five things about post-traumatic stress disorder that might surprise you: . 1. You can get PTSD from your ZIP code . Post-traumatic stress disorder isn't just limited to troops and victims of violence. Constant violence outside your front door, including hearing gunshots or knowing a murder victim, can keep you on high alert. Research completed by Emory University professor of psychiatry Dr. Kerry Ressler and his colleagues provides evidence of higher rates of PTSD in some urban populations than in war veterans. Cities such as Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles in particular have seen an increase in cases, they say. 2. Ecstasy might help . We're not just talking about finding moments of joy or spiritual awareness. The illegal drug MDMA, also know as Ecstasy or Molly, has been shown to help some individuals suffering from PTSD. Combined with therapy, it can assist in processing traumatic memories and change thought patterns surrounding traumatic events. Rachel Hope was part of one MDMA study. She estimates that 80% of her symptoms disappeared after her first MDMA-assisted therapy session. 3. Heart attack and stroke survivors are at risk . Surviving a traumatizing medical event can also trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. Donald Edmondson, an assistant professor of behavioral medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center, and his colleagues analyzed heart attack and stroke patients in two different studies. They found that one in four stroke patients had PTSD within a year of having a stroke. And about one in eight heart attack survivors developed post-traumatic stress disorder -- plus, those that did were twice as likely to have another heart attack or die within three years after the first attack. 4. It reduces gray matter in your brain . According to the National Instituties of Health, gray matter is made up of neurons and other cells that send signals throughout your brain. Post-traumatic stress disorder can cause interference. A study published by the Society of Biological Psychiatry found that PTSD specifically affected the gray matter networks related to emotion processing, fear extinction and emotion regulation, which can lead to distorted emotional memories and the inability to regulate fear responses. There's some good news, however. A 2013 study found that structural damage to gray matter caused by post-traumatic stress disorder does improve over time, but the brain might not return to pre-trauma functioning. 5. How you respond immediately after a traumatic event matters . Dr. Charles Raison, CNN Health's mental health expert, explains that people who have strong emotional reactions and feelings of terror immediately following a traumatic event are more likely to develop PTSD. Disassociation and ""spacing out"" can also put people more at risk for the disorder. Individuals who are more calm and collected after trauma, on the other hand, tend to do better in the long run. The NIH lists treatments such as talk therapy, exposure therapy and medications for PTSD. Contacting friends and family for support following an event is also an important step in the healing process.","7.7 million American adults have post-traumatic stress disorder .

"(CNN) -- Rush Limbaugh brought a cheering crowd to its feet several times Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington as he called on fellow conservatives to take back the country. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh energizes crowd of supporters in CPAC keynote speech. ""We conservatives have not done a good enough job of just laying out basically who we are, because we make the mistake of assuming that people know. What they know is largely incorrect, based on the way we're portrayed in pop culture, in the drive-by media, by the Democrat party,"" the conservative talk show host told a mostly young crowd of energized supporters. ""We want every American to be the best he or she chooses to be. We recognize that we are all individuals. We love and revere our founding documents, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. We believe that the preamble of the Constitution contains an inarguable truth, that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, freedom -- and the pursuit of happiness,"" he said, pausing several times for enthusiastic applause. Looking ahead to the 2012 election, Limbaugh said conservatives will have to choose the right candidate to take the country back. Limbaugh's impassioned keynote speech, punctuated by chest-thumping, fist-pumping and chants of ""USA"" from the crowd, capped off three days of talk at CPAC focusing on rebuilding the Republican Party. ""He played to his crowd here,"" CNN political editor Mark Preston said. ""And this crowd is now energized, something we haven't seen from Republicans, certainly not conservatives, since the November election."" Limbaugh used his self-described ""first national address,"" which ran more than an hour longer than his allotted 20 minutes, to accuse President Obama of inspiring fear in Americans in order to push a liberal agenda of ""big government."" ""He wants people in fear, angst and crisis, fearing the worst each and every day, because that clears the decks for President Obama and his pals to come in with the answers, which are abject failures, historically shown and demonstrated. Doesn't matter. They'll have control of it when it's all over. And that's what they want,"" Limbaugh said. ""They see these inequalities, these inequities that capitalism produces. How do they try to fix it? Do they try to elevate those at the bottom? No, they try to tear down the people at the top."" Limbaugh praised Obama as one of the most gifted politicians he has seen, but said, ""It just breaks my heart that he does not use these extraordinary talents and gifts to motivate and inspire the American people to be the best they can be. He's doing just the opposite."" Limbaugh also dismissed the notion of bipartisanship as a ""false premise"" given the diverging views of the Democratic and Republican Parties on a variety of issues, including the recent $787 stimulus package signed by Obama. ""Bipartisanship occurs only after one other result. And that is victory,"" he said.  Watch Limbaugh discuss bipartisanship » . ""What [Democrats] mean is we check our core principles at the door, come in, let them run the show, and then agree with them,"" he said. Limbaugh's rollicking speech came the day after Obama supporters put out a political ad implying that the conservative radio host has become the de facto head of the Republican Party in the absence of a clear GOP leader. The ad argues that the Republican leadership in Congress is following Limbaugh's lead in opposing the Obama administration's stimulus package. ""So who are Republican leaders listening to?"" the announcer asks, before the 30-second ad cuts abruptly to footage of Limbaugh saying, ""I want him [Obama] to fail."" It was paid for by Americans United for Change and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, two groups that supported Obama during the election and are advocating for his agenda. Limbaugh doesn't speak for all Republicans or conservatives. Copies of the American Conservative magazine with the headline ""How radio wrecks the right"" were distributed to CPAC attendees, Preston said. ""There is some criticism of Rush Limbaugh. Some people think he is a reactionary,"" Preston said. Limbaugh defended his remark about wanting Obama to fail, comparing it to his desire to see the Arizona Cardinals ""fail"" in this year's Super Bowl game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Watch Limbaugh explain failure remark » . ""This notion that I want the president to fail, folks, this shows you a sign of the problem we've got,"" he said. ""What is so strange about being honest and saying, I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed?"" he said, bringing the crowd once again to its feet. ""Did the Democrats want the war in Iraq to fail? Well, they certainly did. And they not only wanted the war in Iraq to fail, they proclaimed it a failure.""","""We want every American to be the best he or she chooses to be,"" he says .

"Most Americans believe the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 should continue, but roughly half the country thinks the arduous search is being conducted in the wrong place, according to a new national poll. The CNN/ORC International poll comes nearly two months after the March 8 disappearance of the plane carrying 239 people. The Beijing-bound flight took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Nearly eight in 10 respondents, or 79%, think there are no survivors. After failing to find any wreckage or debris on the ocean surface, authorities last week announced the suspension of aerial searches to focus efforts instead on 60,000 square kilometers of the ocean floor, a process that could take six to eight months. For eight weeks, an international coalition has been searching for the plane, focusing its effort in the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have gone down. Slightly more than half of all Americans -- or 52% -- believe that the general public will eventually find out what occurred, but 46% say that the fate of the missing airliner will always remain a mystery. Hope transcends frustration in quest to bring families closure . As to the possible causes of the plane's disappearance, Americans have a open mind, with some sort of action on the part of the plane's pilots or crew the most likely possibility. Some two-thirds of respondents say it is very likely (26%) or somewhat likely (40%) that the disappearance was due to actions taken by the pilots or crew members. Terrorists were likely involved in the disappearance, according to 57% of the respondents. Separately, when asked whether mechanical failure or an accident was behind the disappearance, 52% said that was likely versus 46% who answered not likely. Fewer Americans -- about 42% -- think hijackers may have been involved, while 9% believe that space aliens or beings from another dimension were involved. Nearly seven in 10, or 69%, say that the search should continue -- the only question is where. About half of respondents, or 51%, say the plane (or its wreckage) is located in the Indian Ocean in the general area where the search is taking place, but 46% say the plane is somewhere else, far from the search site. Only 26% of Americans say that the Malaysian government has done a good job managing the search and providing information to the general public. The survey, which is based on interviews with 1,008 adult Americans conducted by telephone from May 2 through May 4, has an overall sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","Nearly 80% of respondents think there are no survivors in Flight 370 disappearance .

"(CNN) -- Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom, shutting the door behind them. The room was pitch-black inside. Jackie blindly turned toward Drew, uttering his name. At that same moment, she says, she detected movement in the room -- and felt someone bump into her. Jackie began to scream. -- ""A Rape on Campus,"" Rolling Stone . The above scene is just the beginning. In the paragraphs that follow, writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely gives excruciatingly painful details of what allegedly happened to Jackie, a freshman at the University of Virginia, over the course of the next three hours as she was allegedly gang-raped by members of Drew's fraternity. ""Grab its motherf***ing leg,"" one guy in the crowd said. ""Its."" Jackie was dehumanized in every sense imaginable. According to Rolling Stone, after a classmate penetrated Jackie with a beer bottle, she passed out. She woke up at 3 a.m., alone, her face beaten, her dress torn and spattered with blood. Going barefoot down the stairs, past the frat party still in full swing, Jackie left the building and called her friends. And this, if you can imagine it, is where the story gets worse. Opinion: Punish rapists, not fraternities . The article continues: Jackie's friends, two guys and one woman, ultimately decided she shouldn't be taken to the hospital or report the rape because if she did, ""her reputation will be shot for the next four years."" Jackie's female friend insisted, ""She's gonna be the girl who cried 'rape,' and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again."" This reaction is fairly unique to rape as compared with other crimes. After all, if someone is mugged or murdered, such crimes are generally reported to the police. For instance, the federal government estimates that 65% of rape or sexual assault cases are unreported, while 17% of car thefts are unreported. On the day the Rolling Stone article about Jackie's alleged rape was published, Caitlin Kelly, a Web producer at The New Yorker, wrote a string of tweets imagining what it would look like if people responded to her wallet being stolen the way they respond to rape. ""'I think that guy I know stole my wallet,'"" Kelly tweeted, followed by the hypothetical responses: . ""Well, do you have proof? Were you drinking that night? What were you wearing when this happened?"" ""Are you sure that you didn't just GIVE him your wallet, and now you're embarrassed about it? Maybe there was just some miscommunication."" ""Have you lost wallets before? Just curious, just trying to get a better sense of what's going on here. He has such a bright future."" ""Nobody is going to want to hang out with the girl who cried stolen wallet. You should really think hard about what you're saying here."" ""All guys want wallets, it's just in their nature. Maybe you shouldn't have had a wallet in the first place."" Kelly told The Huffington Post that her motivation for the tweets was ""seeing so many people doubt victims, almost as a reflex, in ways that people who are victims (of) other crimes rarely seem to face."" The shaming of rape victims is especially stark in contrast to the attitude of nonchalance or even boastfulness used by rapists. In the Rolling Stone article, Jackie describes how she ran into Drew (not his real name) during her lifeguard shift at a UVA pool, just two weeks after her alleged rape. "" 'I wanted to thank you for the other night,' Drew said. 'I had a great time.' "" Could you imagine Drew parading around like nothing had happened if he'd just committed a murder? Jackie reported her rape, plus two other similar gang rapes she learned about at the same Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, to Dean Nicole Eramo, head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board. Eramo told Jackie she could file a report with the police and that the university would support her if she did so, though the university did not exactly encourage her to report the crime. Jackie still has not filed a criminal or civil suit. It was not until Rolling Stone started poking around and asking questions about the rape allegations that the university began to investigate the matter. Opinion: UVA's answer to rape allegations a farce . Meanwhile Jackie, once a promising student engaged in all sorts of extracurricular activities of campus life, was abandoned by her friends, became depressed, and at one point, suicidal, the article said. She slept for days on end and fell behind in her studies. On the other hand, Drew, as of the writing of the Rolling Stone article, was set to graduate, entirely untarnished -- as were the other men involved in the alleged rape. ""Rapists make us less uncomfortable than rape victims,"" Roxanne Gay recently wrote in The Guardian. ""Predators demand so much less than victims; they aren't as inconvenient. They don't bleed or hurt or reveal their gaping wounds. If we don't doubt them, we do not have to doubt ourselves."" Murder and robbery, after all, are obviously aberrant and therefore easy to call out. But rape? Rape is so horribly common that talking about it, exploring why it happens, investigating the culture and context of it, would seem to indict every aspect of a school like the University of Virginia that apparently has not done enough to address the problem. When will we come to terms with our naive illusions about what goes on in places like UVA and at frat parties in every corner of America? If we don't grapple with that reality, more young women will be destroyed. Will Drew and UVA get off easily while Jackie's life -- and other college women like her -- is shattered? If UVA has any sense of moral rightness and wishes to remain a great university, it should conduct a thorough investigation into these and similar allegations and mete out appropriate punishment for the perpetuators. Universities everywhere should take serious steps to address sexual assault on campuses rather than trying to cover them up.","Rolling Stone says a freshman, Jackie, was allegedly gang-raped by members of a fraternity .

"The Columbus Day holiday is usually observed with a smattering of parades in a few cities and discount sales from retailers. But this year, people in New York will observe the man who discovered America, up close and personal. The art installation ""Discovering Columbus"" takes the form of a modern New York living room surrounding the 13-foot marble statue of Christopher Columbus. The statue, which has stood on a granite podium high above the middle of a Manhattan traffic circle for the past 120 years, has until now only been able to be viewed from afar, unless you were a pigeon. The exhibit, conceived by the Japanese artist Tatzu Nishi and backed by the Public Art Fund, is an 800-square-foot replica of a contemporary living room that is suspended 70 feet in the air supported by scaffolding. ""The project is really about transforming an object that already exists, a monument that's been here in New York City for 120 years,"" said Nicholas Baume, director and curator of the Public Art Fund, ""and giving people a chance to experience it in a completely new way to have in this case, a much more intimate experience."" The statue, which was crafted by Gaetano Russo in 1892, seemingly stands on a coffee table and is surrounded by several comfy chairs, sofas, a bookcase and flat screen television. Unlike a usual ""no touch"" policy at an art exhibit, visitors are free to lounge on the furniture for a good look at  the monument. The wallpaper covering the walls was designed by the artist and features iconic American pop culture figures, such as Mickey Mouse, Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe. Nishi has done several such exhibits around the world by taking a usually inaccessible object and creating a living space around it for visitors. ""I didn't choose Columbus as a figure. I chose this sculpture as a visual object and Columbus Circle as a place,"" the artist said. And what a place it is for those lucky enough to secure a spot and willing to climb six flights of stairs. From the windows of the living room, one can see million dollar views of Central Park as well as Broadway and downtown Manhattan. ""The view you get here is extraordinary. You actually sense the fact that Columbus Circle is the center of this nexus of New York City,"" Nicholas Baume said. But not everyone thinks the exhibit is such a wonderful endeavor. Rosario Iaconis, chairman of the Italic Institute of America, commented on the project before it opened. ""Columbus was a man of the Renaissance, an exemplar of that civilization. This, is foolishness. This is not art. If it's his particular vision, it's a skewed vision, so I, again with due respect to Mr. Nishi, I think he stumbled on his project."" One famous New Yorker disagrees. ""I've been living in this city since 1966. Columbus Circle has always been there, but you don't look up. You can't see it, it's so high,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters. ""For you and I, this is the first and only chance you're probably going to have in your whole life."" The artist was asked by the Public Art Fund two years ago to do a project in the city, and he walked all around visiting different sites until he settled on Columbus Circle statue. ""It's not my intention to say something about Columbus; rather, I want to change the sculpture from public sculpture into a completely different thing,"" Nishi said. The exhibit opened on September 20 and will run through November 18. Visitors can obtain free passes by signing up at the Public Art Fund's website. Each pass grants access to the exhibition for  up to 30 minutes. Once the exhibition is over, the monument will go through a restoration. The pigeons will have to wait a little bit longer to see their old buddy Chris.

"Laredo, Texas (CNN) -- The bookstore was Zhuara Rivera's magical ""Neverland."" It offered a fairy tale world for 14-year-old Rivera to get lost in stories and words. But the books are gone. On January 16, Barnes & Noble, which owns B. Dalton, closed the store inside Laredo's Mall del Norte. That leaves Laredo, Texas, population of 250,000, one of the largest cities in the United States without a bookstore. The closest bookstore is now 150 miles away, in San Antonio, Texas. ""I was very shocked and I think it's very sad,"" Zhuara said. ""I love reading. I adore reading."" Zhuara and dozens of volunteers launched a grass-roots organization called ""Laredo Reads."" They've started a petition drive collecting signatures to show corporate book dealers that Laredo can support a bookstore. The death of the store has energized Zhuara. She leaves school and heads straight to the Laredo mall. She races around asking strangers to sign petition forms. She's collected nearly 1,000 signatures across the city. ""I seriously don't understand why people don't just like reading that much,"" she said as she walked briskly past the old store. ""If you don't know how to read, you're not going to get very far in life."" Her mother says Zhuara has cried several times over the bookstore's demise. For years, Zhuara saved her money and asked her mom to take her to the store. She would walk up and down the small aisles searching for the next book to buy. Barnes & Noble says it closed the Laredo store as part of an overall strategy to shut down the chain of mall-based bookstores. Even though the Laredo store was profitable, the overall chain was losing money, according to company officials. Some in Laredo fear the lack of a book store will make the city look like an ignorant outpost on the Texas border. ""Assuming that we don't read because we're Mexican or we're immigrant or we're poor, that is not the case,"" said Xochitl Mora, the city's spokeswoman who spearheads the ""Laredo Reads"" initiative. ""Our challenge is to convince a corporate America bookstore and others they will find a literate, articulate, eloquent citizenry."" The publishing industry is in the midst of a revolution. Threats from Internet sites, like Amazon.com, and electronic book devices, like the Kindle, have cut into profits of retail book giants. In addition, bookstores are facing increasing competition from mass merchandisers like Target and Wal-Mart. About 50 to 60 small Barnes & Noble-owned bookstores have closed every year over the last 5 to 6 years, the company said. Rival Borders has also struggled financially amid the tough marketplace. Acclaimed novelist Oscar Casares understands first-hand the changing publishing landscape. He grew up in south Texas along the Mexican border, where bookstores have always been hard to find. When his two books, ""Brownsville"" and ""Amigoland,"" were published, he pushed to sell the books in a popular grocery store chain called H.E.B. Right now the H.E.B. grocery store is what passes for a bookstore in Laredo. Casares spoke with CNN inside the grocery. As he talked, a woman bought a copy of his latest book and set it on top of a bag of flour tortillas and a sack of potatoes. ""We had to adapt. We had to realize this was the border,"" Casares said. ""The first thing I realized was there weren't going to be any places to sell the book. I felt we needed another point of distribution."" Casares admits it took a little while to get used to book signings and readings in the midst of a chaotic grocery store. He worries about what losing the only bookstore will do to Laredo's spirit. ""I think it creates a void. It's a void that isn't instantly recognizable but it's one, that over time, is deflating,"" Casares said. Laredo does have two public libraries with a catalog of more than 200,00 books. But library officials say they can't keep up with the demand for the most popular titles. Maria Soliz, manager of the Laredo Public Library, says she hopes to expand the library's collection and expects to see an increase in library card applications. ""We do have a lot of the same customers, but there are different customers,"" Soliz told CNN. ""They might come to the library, read the book and decide they want to buy it."" Soliz and others fear the loss of the city's bookstore will slow down efforts to improve Laredo's literacy rate. A 2003 study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 48 percent of the residents of Webb County, Texas -- home to Laredo -- lacked basic literacy skills. Many say losing the bookstore threatens efforts to improve the city's literacy rate. ""A bookstore and what that means for kids to learn the value of literacy and to learn the value of loving books, that's just something you can't really put a value on,"" said Mora.","Laredo, Texas, becomes one of the largest cities in U.S. without bookstore .
Nearest bookstore is now 150 miles away in San Antonio .
Barnes & Noble says closing was part of strategy to shutter mall bookstores .
Some fear Laredo will be dubbed an outpost for the illiterate without store ."
"(CNN) -- DC Comics' Wonder Woman has gotten a makeover. For the character's big-screen debut in Zack Snyder's ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the familiar red, blue and gold costume has been traded in for a bronzed ensemble with matching thigh-high boots. The new look was unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday, with director Snyder sharing the first photo of actress Gal Gadot as the Amazon princess. Some fans have been thrilled, saying Wonder Woman's costume was due for an update. ""Not the classic costume, but interesting,"" one observer noted on Facebook. ""That looks like Wonder Woman to me!"" tweeted another. ""Gal looks phenomenal."" Other fans have been vocally disappointed, dismissing the costume as too ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and the actress as too petite to portray the fierce fighter Diana Prince. ""Not impressed,"" said one commenter on DC Comics' Facebook page. ""Colors are too muted. Nothing about this says Wonder Woman."" ""Where is the powerful, strong Wonder Woman we all love?"" asked another fan on Facebook. ""She looks way too small."" Lynda Carter, who played Wonder Woman on TV in the '70s, hasn't voiced her opinion on the new costume -- but she did ask her fans to weigh in. (The verdict? ""She's no Lynda!"") Gadot hasn't been the only ""Batman v Superman"" star to suffer critics. Her co-star Ben Affleck had the lion's share when he was brought on to play Batman. That criticism didn't stem the excitement at Comic-Con on Saturday when Affleck arrived at the ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" panel along with Gadot and Henry Cavill, who plays Superman. Although ""Batman v Superman"" is still in production, those present did get a taste of what's to come. Also starring Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Jeremy Irons as Alfred, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" will open May 6, 2016.","Wonder Woman's new look was seen at Comic-Con on Saturday .

"""The Hunger Games"" heroine Katniss Everdeen inspired more than just a renewed interest in braided hairstyles. Suddenly, in the immediate aftermath of the film's $400 million-plus box office success (in the United States alone), archery landed in the bull's-eye of pop culture. Sure, we've had the occasional ""Robin Hood"" movies, which have achieved varying levels of success, and you could catch a glimpse of flying arrows in TV series like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Walking Dead,"" but archers have now taken center stage. (Even the MTV Movie Awards had to spoof the phenomenon.) ""Brave,"" the Disney/Pixar hit, is about a young woman who could wield a bow and arrow with the best of them. Considering how long it takes to make an animated movie like ""Brave,"" that's just a case of extraordinary timing. It wasn't enough that the biggest blockbuster of 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" starred Iron Man, the Hulk and friends. It also threw in an archer, Hawkeye. Plus, if not for Michonne and her sword (maybe 2013 is fencing's year), this season of ""The Walking Dead"" might belong to Daryl, whose favorite zombie-slaying method is the crossbow. The top new series on TV? That would be ""Revolution,"" which includes -- you guessed it -- a heroine with a crossbow. Post-apocalyptic TV is everywhere . There's more to come: Lara Croft's return in the ""Tomb Raider"" video game will focus on archery, instead of a gun in each hand; and the next two ""Hobbit"" films have the promise of archers Bard the Bowman and Legolas. Jeremy Gutsche, the chief trend hunter at Trendhunter.com, notes that ""Google search volume for archery has remained relatively constant"" for archery over the years, but that's not to say it hasn't made a splash: He saw archery-infused fashion shoots crop up this year. However, he thinks a lot of it can be traced back to Jennifer Lawrence and the character of Katniss. ""There is an extra appeal that happens when you have one of the hottest pop cultural stars taking up any new sport, and in this case it happened to be archery."" ""Hunger Games"" bucks hunter stereotypes . It also doesn't hurt that she got high marks from her trainer on the film. ""She was very motivated and technically very good. I do think it looked good in the film. You can absolutely shoot apples from 80 to 100 yards out (like Lawrence's character did),""  Olympic archer Khatuna Lorig told Fitness magazine. So, how has pop culture affected archery as a sport? CNN turned to one of the experts, Teresa Iaconi, spokeswoman for USA  Archery (including the Olympics team) and a level four archery coach. CNN: What level of interest have you seen in the sport this year? Iaconi: We have had massive gains this past year. Our membership has increased over 25% this year. We typically don't see gains like that. A lot of our membership transactions this year were new memberships. We're seeing new people joining the sport. At our national championships this year, we had our largest number of competitors since 2001. In 2001, we had roughly 370 adults and 150-200 kids. This year that number was completely reversed. Our instructors have said they can't keep up with the demand. We think that's fantastic. As archery films continue to come out, assuming we continue to see that popularity increase, we can provide opportunities to grow. CNN: Is the portrayal of archery accurate? Iaconi: I don't think kids necessarily built a strong relationship with Kevin Costner's character in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."" When you have a heroine like Katniss Everdeen, it's another story. The young people who heard the buzz about it connected with her. I saw it with women on a bow hunt: You had 60-year-old women getting excited about that movie. ""Brave"" got the archery so technically correct. They got the flux of the arrow right. Even a young archer will pick up on that. They made it look so beautiful. ... Disney-Pixar worked with us. We were able to arrange a screening with Olympic hopefuls, Olympians and their coaches screaming and cheering with this movie. They loved the fact that they got it right. CNN: Do you think this level of interest can hold into the future? Iaconi: Looking in 2013, we don't have the Olympics for two more years. What we have is this massive amount of interest from kids into the sport. Friends will say, ""Hey this is really cool, come to archery with me."" We'll continue seeing as the next three ""Hunger Games"" installments (come out) over the next three years.","Starting with the success of ""The Hunger Games,"" archery was big in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- It's really hard to take anything in sports seriously when you know the bottom line is always about maximizing the top line revenue. And the NFL's ""new"" Player Conduct Policy is a case in point. The guidelines could have created a monumental moment in NFL lawmaking. The league had the opportunity to show the world it is serious about the ""No More"" domestic violence campaign. Instead, NFL owners unanimously agreed to a policy that's clearly about saving face, keeping players on the field, profits in their pockets and the power in Commissioner Roger Goodell's hands. The most glaring problem with the ""new"" policy -- laid out in a handy flow chart -- is that it is almost identical to the old policy in that it is ambiguous, optional, case-by-case, complicated and at the discretion of the NFL. Consider a very predictable pattern -- a 911 call is received, police arrive at an NFL player's home on a domestic violence report and arrest the NFL player. Do we know for certain what the NFL do would do under this new policy? No we don't. What if the player's pregnant fiancee is begging to drop the charges the next morning? We don't know what would happen then, either. The fact is, if the new policy was clear, you would be able to answer simple questions like these with a ""yes"" or ""no"": . 1. Will a player be suspended immediately following an arrest? (No idea). 2. Will a player be suspended if he is charged with a crime, following an arrest? (Maybe). 3. Will players who are arrested and investigated (Ray McDonald) be treated differently than those that plead no contest to a less offense (Adrian Peterson) or for pretrial programs (Ray Rice)? (Probably). 4. Will counseling be mandated for players who are arrested for violent offenses, or only ""provided""? (Who knows). 5. What does ""assist"" families actually mean? (Unclear). The limits of the new guidance is demonstrated by the Ray Rice case, which, if the flow chart is followed logically, would end up having much the same result with the new approach as it did with the old one: . The moment the league is notified of Ray Rice's arrest at a casino, the Special Counsel for Investigations and Conduct starts investigating in parallel with the criminal courts. The investigation, not arrests or charges being filed, determine whether or not Ray Rice is put on paid leave. When the investigation is complete, Special Counsel determines discipline. If there is a criminal conviction, the baseline for violent crimes is a six game suspension, unpaid. According to the flowchart, Rice's fiancee would have access to ""Club Level"" Critical Response Teams that include medical and counseling services. If Ray Rice appeals, three outside experts would advise. But guess who gets final say over what ultimately happens to Ray Rice? Roger Goodell or his designee. Unlike the new substance abuse policy finalized in September, there are no concrete answers as to what will be done, only what may be done. And the truth is, no corporation knows how to handle domestic violence. According to the Society of Human Resource Management, only 20% of employers surveyed have training on domestic violence issues. But there should be no such thing as an NFL investigation, unless it is substance abuse or conduct that impacts the on field performance of a player. The NFL simply cannot handle criminal cases involving domestic violence, child abuse or sexual assault. What it can do is set conduct policies that are clear and provide counseling serves to players and families who need them. I keep hearing people say that domestic violence is a ""complex"" situation. That may be true, but great leaders make the complex simple. They use clarity in their convictions to define operating standards and conduct policies for their organizations. In this case, that would mean being crystal clear about what the NFL will tolerate and what it will not tolerate. The league should also make the arrest the trigger point. If you are arrested for any crime against your intimate partner, children or animals, or any violent crime, you should automatically be suspended for six games, with pay. If you are formally charged with a crime, you lose pay for those six games. It is at the individual team's discretion to punish you further. If you are arrested a second time, you should be banished. A clear policy puts the onus on the players to conduct themselves in a way that does everything possible to minimize their chances of arrest. Clear leadership sends a message to the owners, employees, players and the world about what the NFL stands for. When a leader is clear, people know how to act because they know what to expect. Goodell is paid healthily to set protocol and take responsibility for everything that happens at the NFL. And yet still we have no idea what punishment you can expect to receive when you punch your wife or use a switch to spank your child. ""We've taken a black eye on this,"" Giant's co-owner John Mara said. Yes, he actually said that. Unfortunately, those PR black eyes seem to be the only ones the NFL cares about. Roger that.","NFL has released new player conduct guidelines .

"The wheels are coming off the wagon. The fat lady is about to sing. The proverbial is about to hit the fan. It doesn't matter which saying you use, the facts are inescapable. Greece's membership of the eurozone is untenable under the current conditions and everyone knows it. Some like Hungary's finance minister say openly Greece will leave the euro. The only question is what catalyst will force it out and when. The nearest deadline to hand is the country's June 17th elections, when the Greek voters will decide whether to support parties who will adhere to the bailout agreements or those who want to tear them up. Private economists have gone into overdrive trying to work out what will happen. A week ago, Bank of America Merrill Lynch published ""what if Greece Exits the Euro"" describing the risk as ""rising."" Citigroup uses the word ""probable"" for an exit in certain circumstances while Barclays published ""dealing with a potential Greek exit"" and says ""over the longer horizon the likelihood increases."" For the more circumspect euro politicians who have to manage this crisis, there are now well trodden formulae trotted out whenever Greece's euro-future is mentioned. It goes something like this: 1. We want Greece to stay in the euro. 2. Greece must abide by the terms of its agreements with lenders. 3. It is up to the Greek people how they will vote and if they remain in the euro. Think of it as the euro-dance....two steps forward one step back. With the debt crisis unfolding: What does it mean to be Greek? Some Europe officials have become truly expert at performing this dance. Olli Rehn, the European Union economics chief, has reiterated it to me.  And yet, I reason they must be contemplating what happens when the music stops and the euro-dance comes to an end. They read the same economics as the rest of us. They know that the Greek economy is deeply uncompetitive. The reforms need not only to continue, but speed up if Greece is not to remain on euro-life support forever. The only question is whether the Greek people are prepared to put up with the pain. Each day there comes a new twist into the euro-dance. There was the rumor that Mrs. Merkel had asked Greece to hold a simultaneous referendum with the election on euro-membership. The report came from Athens: Berlin denied it. Clearly one side or the other is playing high stakes hoping to force the issue. The argument goes like this: Since every poll shows a significant majority of Greek people want to stay in the euro, make the June vote a referendum on this issue and voters will come to their senses and be herded back to safely voting for those parties committed to the euro-dance formula. While I've no idea how these next Greek elections are going to turn out, my gut feeling is that the other eurozone countries are likely to stay with the stick, and keep any carrots to offer if and when the voters return to their sanity (as seen from Brussels). But opinion polls show Greece's left-leaning Syriza party, which does not support the austerity plans, has maintained momentum on the back of the Greek people's discontent. If this continues, prepare for Greece to crash out of the euro sooner rather than later. Because if they do not follow the austerity plans, the Greek government will not receive more bailout loans to pay its debts. And if that happens, it's not going to be pretty.  The Greek banks will collapse -- they are already on fraying central bank lifelines -- unemployment will soar and I wouldn't rule out civil unrest. Who knows what it will look like. Despite everyone talking about other countries that have defaulted then recovered strongly (Argentina, Russia) the reality is nothing this complicated has ever been tried before, certainly not in such a global interconnected world. Let me say it clearly and loudly. The fear is that Lehman Brothers in 2008 will look like a tea party if they get this one wrong. What is worrying is that if Greece (only 3% of EU economy) goes is who will be next? Hungarian finance minister Gyorgy Matolcsy, who I also spoke to recently, thinks Greece won't be the only country to exit. Obviously now everyone has Spain in their sights. And there is where the real problem lies. Spain is too big to fully bail out a la Greece and definitely too big too fail. If Spain gets into too much trouble ""Project Euro"" is likely over.  From all my private talks with European officials it has become clear -- Spain is the line in the sand.  Greece may be too far gone and be allowed to fall, but Spain will be defended till the bitter end. So I fully expect European leaders to give Spain something to take the boot off the throat of austerity in the coming weeks. Probably the same for Portugal. European officials have made mistakes in their dealings with Greece. The austerity measures were too harsh. They shouldn't have been nearly so brutal, and that lesson has been learned. Now with the election of Francois Hollande as France's new president everyone can change course slightly and pretend they meant to do it all along (they didn't). Expect a growth pact to be agreed between Germany and France to sit alongside the main Fiscal Compact, which Germany will not allow to be re-opened. I could speculate for hours about which solution will be found, what formula they will adopt to keep the whole thing moving -- and frankly, it would be useless. This crisis is now moving too fast and has taken on a life of its own. The firewall is starting to smolder. The austerity plans are starting to fray. The European Central Bank is cutting loose several Greek banks it does not consider solvent. The eurozone is all but back in recession. There are some uncontrollable aspects (the Greek voters for instance) which make forecasting the future direction just about impossible. I still believe that the single currency will survive in some shape and form. I just cannot see the eurozone surviving in its present form -- not without the most drastic reorganization towards fiscal union, a federation of states with a central bank and treasury. Please, eurozone, don't tell me that is not the European way. I am telling you....it's the only way. Your way has failed and Europe's 300 million people are now relegated to slow, second class growth as a result for the foreseeable future.","CNN's Richard Quest believes Greece's membership of the eurozone is untenable under the current conditions .

"Wren Thomas grew up in the middle of the cornfields of central Illinois, longing, he says, to do something important in his life ""to make his family proud.""  So when a cousin beckoned him to come work on boats off Louisiana, he jumped at the chance. His goal: to be a ship captain, ""the best that I could be."" ""It meant strength, accomplishment,' he said when he finally was made a captain in 1991 and traveled the world for various shipping firms. With a wife, eventually three children and boat to lead, Capt. Wren Thomas had achieved his piece of the American dream. ""I wanted to be in charge of my own destiny,'' he recalled during an interview in his attorney's Houston office. All of that came crashing down on October 23, 2013 when Thomas was piloting his supply boat, the C-Retriever off the coast of Nigeria towards a Chevron-owned oil field. Over the next six hours, he would huddle with his crew in an incredibly hot, water-sealed tank room as a half-dozen pirates stormed his boat and began their siege looking for their prize: the American captain and his American-born engineer. Thomas reluctantly gave up when the pirates started firing guns through a hole in the room door. He told his engineer they had no choice if the rest of the 13-member crew, still in hiding, was to be spared. ""I told him, 'Look I think it's time we give up. If we don't give up we are either going to die or somebody is going to get killed from ricocheting bullets.'"" Thomas and his engineer were the only ones to be kidnapped by the pirates, driven away in a speed boat and held in Nigerian swamps and jungles for 18 days. The experience was so horrific that even today Thomas is unable to bring himself to reveal all details of his captivity. ""We weren't being punched or kicked or anything like that but just I've told people that I would have rather been punched then went through what I went through,"" Thomas said. ""The mental abuse of it with the guns pointing at you. And knowing how unstable these guys are."" Thomas said there were about 18 Nigerian kidnappers, some chain-smoked marijuana or crack incessantly, constantly waving their weapons and making threats. Food consisted of instant noodles -- on days the negotiations were going well -- and maybe a bottle of water. And his captors blared their music constantly, fixated on, of all things, country singer Dolly Parton's song, ""Coat of Many Colors,"" and the music of hip hop artist 50 Cent. ""I knew I was going to die. We knew it every day, every night,"" he said. Despite the chaos in the jungle, Thomas said the leaders were organized, using satellite phones to negotiate, first demanding a $2 million ransom.  Thomas believes the payoff  was eventually whittled down to several hundred thousand dollars, though CNN cannot confirm who paid the ransom or who received it. Thomas said one evening he and his engineer were told to get in a small boat with six pirates. They motored for about two hours to reach a village. There, four of the pirates got out and met some other men who handed them backpacks, Thomas told CNN. They returned to the boat and counted the cash stuffed into the bags. After a dispute, Thomas says he and the engineer were taken to the other men and told to lie on the ground until the pirates left. Then they were put in a car and driven off. Later they were transferred to a second car, where a representative from the shipping company was waiting for them. At that point they were finally free, 18 days after being seized at gunpoint. After a debriefing by his ship managers, then a similar one by the FBI in Lagos, Nigeria, Thomas returned to the United States last November, days after his release. He has been seeing mental health advisers and other medical professionals since. But his hostage-taking and the negotiations that freed him have raised alarm bells in counterterrorism circles and elsewhere for numerous reasons; not the least is Thomas' claim that the FBI told him the money paid for his freedom may eventually have wound up in the hands of the notorious terror group Boko Haram. On the hunt for Boko Haram . That is the same group that in April kidnapped nearly 300 Nigerian girls. They're also blamed for laying waste to multiple villages in the northern part of the country, burning them down and killing many people in bomb attacks. Thomas said during his debriefing in Lagos the FBI indicated that the money paid for his freedom may have been funneled through other groups before making its way to Boko Haram. The FBI would not comment. CNN cannot independently confirm whether Boko Haram received any money from the kidnapping. Yan St-Pierre, CEO of Modern Security Consulting Group, said his contacts believe Boko Haram, once confined strictly to the northern parts of Nigeria, is benefiting from the increase in piracy along the west coast of Africa. But the group is perhaps not directly carrying out the kidnappings itself. ""So when people are asking, is there a link between Boko Haram and piracy in Nigeria, it's not the one they usually expect it to be,'' said St-Pierre, whose firm was not involved in the Thomas case. ""It's one that is not necessarily logistical and operational. It's one that is more subtle. Essentially they will probably provide personnel every now and then, but it's not a fixed structure. So we are talking more (about) providing means to wash the money, to clean it. To make sure the smuggling routes, personnel, sex slaves, drugs, weapons above all else, these pirates need weapons. ""So if Boko Haram provided the weapons in advance for example and said, 'Well we will get a cut of the ransom,' which is standard policy within these groups within the region in general, this would make absolute sense to say, well the ransom money that was paid for the captain ended up at the very least partially into Boko Haram's hands, quite probably as a payment for services delivered."" Major oil companies have an official policy of not paying ransom for personnel or the thefts of fuel and ships on the high seas. And subsidiary companies, like Capt. Thomas' employer Edison Chouest, aren't talking, so it is unclear if they, too, have the same policy. It is against U.S. law to deal with terrorists but that issue becomes murky when dealing with ransoms for captives because so many middle men are involved, counterterrorism sources said; it is hard to say who is a terrorist and who is just a common criminal. Piracy off the coast of Nigeria is on the rise, according to one study published by Oceans Beyond Piracy, a project of the One Earth Foundation. By contrast, piracy off Somalia -- on the other side of the African continent -- dropped dramatically in 2013 to only 23 vessels attacked from 237 ships attacked in 2011, the same group reported.  In West Africa, the group estimates there were at least 100 total piracy attacks and characterized them as more violent and frequent. Thomas, in a series of emails, says he warned his company, Edison Chouset, that security was deteriorating and he feared some of his own Nigerian crew members. His attorney shared two of the emails with CNN. In one email to his operations coordinator, Thomas, summing up his fear of the security situation, wrote ""I am also asking to not to return to Nigeria."" Thomas said company officials told him things would improve but never did. On the day he set out on his fateful trip, Thomas said dock workers announced over two-way radio where the ship was going and what supplies it was carrying. He said those communications left them doomed before they ever got to their destination. ""The pirates (later) told me they knew where we was going ... they knew my cargo, they knew my position, they knew the track I was taking."" CNN made multiple attempts to contact Edison Chouest for comment but the company refused to return multiple calls or an email. Thomas said two representatives from the company stayed near his wife in their hometown during his ordeal and the FBI was also in contact. But once he was freed, the communications virtually ended.  It wasn't until January that someone from the company offered to assist in his medical care and other financial needs, he said. Thomas is now consulting with a Houston attorney on his next move as he says he is medically unable to return to his overseas duties as a ship captain. ""Life is hell for me now,"" Thomas said. ""Life will never be the same again. The man that my wife married is not the same anymore....I walk around all day paranoid. I'm sad. I can't sleep. My family is hurt."" Earlier this year, Thomas finally broke his silence, giving an in-depth interview to a shipping newsletter gCaptain.  He is talking now, he says, so others don't face the same fate. His attorney, Brian Beckcom, represented members of the Maersk Alabama crew that served with Capt. Richard Philips, whose capture by Somali pirates was made into a movie starring Tom Hanks. He said he believes these companies owe crew members, like Thomas, the same level of protection now provided to crews off the Somalian coast. ""Now all the ships in East Africa have armed guards, or most do, and piracy has plummeted in East Africa. West Africa is now the hotspot and there is no question that these companies are making hundreds of millions in (oil) profits should do something more than they're doing to protect the men that work over there,"" Beckcom said.

"Edward Snowden will likely prove to be the most costly leaker of American secrets in the history of the Republic. I know that we have had our share of spies. Benedict Arnold was bent on betraying the garrison at West Point to the British during the Revolution. Klaus Fuchs and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ferreted out nuclear secrets for the Russians. Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen identified American penetrations for ultimate execution by the Soviets. We have also had our share of leakers. Daniel Ellsberg copied thousands of pages of documents related to the Vietnam War. Bradley Manning is accused of indiscriminately scoured the Defense Department's SIPRNET (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) for all manner of military reports and diplomatic cables. But Snowden is in a class by himself. The secrets that Arnold wanted to betray fit into the heel of the boot of his British case officer.  The ""atom bomb"" spies reported out using secret ink.  Ellsberg was limited to the number of documents he could physically Xerox.  Manning, although fully empowered by digital media, had access only to a secret level network housing largely tactical information. Snowden fled to China with several computers' worth of data from NSANET, one of the most highly classified and sensitive networks in American intelligence.  The damage is potentially so great that NSA has taken one of its most respected senior operations officers off mission tasks to lead the damage assessment effort. In general terms, it's already clear Snowden's betrayal hurts in at least three important ways. First, there is the undeniable operational effect of informing adversaries of American intelligence's tactics, techniques and procedures.  Snowden's disclosures go beyond the ""what"" of a particular secret or source.  He is busily revealing the ""how"" of American collection. The Guardian newspaper's Glenn Greenwald, far more deserving of the Justice Department's characterization of a co-conspirator than Fox's James Rosen ever was, claims that Snowden has documents that comprise ""basically the instruction manual for how the NSA is built. ... [To prove] what he was saying was true, he had to take ... very sensitive, detailed blueprints of how the NSA does what they do."" Greenwald has disputed the notion that he aided Snowden, telling David Gregory on NBC's ""Meet the Press"": ""The assumption in your question, David, is completely without evidence, the idea I've aided and abetted him in any way."" And Michael Clemente, Fox News' executive vice president of news, has said, ""we are outraged to learn ... that James Rosen was named a criminal co-conspirator for simply doing his job as a reporter."" Greenwald: Snowden is 'the classically responsible whistle-blower' Absent ""rogue"" U.S. action to silence him, Snowden has promised not to reveal this data, but there are already reports of counterterrorism targets changing their communications patterns.  And I would lose all respect for China's Ministry of State Security and Russia's FSB if they have not already fully harvested Snowden's digital data trove. As former director of CIA, I would claim that the top 20% of American intelligence -- that exquisite insight into an enemy's intentions -- is generally provided by human sources.  But as a former director of NSA, I would also suggest that the base 50% to 60% of American intelligence day in and day out is provided by signals intelligence, the kinds of intercepted communications that Snowden has so blithely put at risk. But there is other damage, such as the undeniable economic punishment that will be inflicted on American businesses for simply complying with American law. Others, most notably in Europe, will rend their garments in faux shock and outrage that these firms have done this, all the while ignoring that these very same companies, along with their European counterparts, behave the same way when confronted with the lawful demands of European states. The real purpose of those complaints is competitive economic advantage, putting added burdens on or even disqualifying American firms competing in Europe for the big data and cloud services that are at the cutting edge of the global IT industry.  Or, in the case of France, to slow negotiations on a trans- Atlantic trade agreement that threatens the privileged position of French agriculture, outrage more based on protecting the production of cheese than preventing any alleged violation of privacy. The third great harm of Snowden's efforts to date is the erosion of confidence in the ability of the United States to do anything discreetly or keep anything secret. Manning's torrent of disclosures certainly caused great harm, but there was at least the plausible defense that this was a one-off phenomenon, a regrettable error we're aggressively correcting. Snowden shows that we have fallen short and that the issue may be more systemic rather than isolated.  At least that's what I would fear if I were a foreign intelligence chief approached by the Americans to do anything of import. Snowden seems undeterred by any of these consequences.  After all, he believes he is acting for a higher good -- an almost romantic attachment to the merits of absolute transparency -- and he seems indifferent to the legitimacy of any claims of national security. The appropriate balance between liberty and security has bedeviled free peoples, including Americans, for centuries. But it takes a special kind of arrogance for this young man to believe that his moral judgment on the dilemma suddenly trumps that of two (incredibly different) presidents, both houses of the U.S. Congress, both political parties, the U.S. court system and more than 30,000 of his co-workers. Arrogant or not, Snowden has thrust into public view sensitive and controversial espionage activities. So what of his facts, fictions and fears and of the national debate that he claims he intended to stimulate? More on this in following columns.

"Sanford, Florida, Police Chief Bill Lee, who drew criticism for his department's actions in the Trayvon Martin case, was fired Wednesday. ""After much thoughtful discussion and deep consideration for the issues facing the city of Sanford, I have determined the police chief needs to have the trust and respect of the elected officials and the confidence of the entire community,"" City Manager Norton Bonaparte said in a news release. ""We need to move forward with a police chief that all the citizens of Sanford can support. I have come to this decision in light of the escalating divisiveness that has taken hold of the city."" Lee will receive a three-month severance and a week's salary in addition to any earned time off. As a search for Lee's replacement is carried out, interim Chief Richard W. Myers will remain on the job. Late Wednesday night, representatives of the Martin family said they ""respected"" the city manager's decision. ""It's important that we really believe that, as all of this has unfolded, we've continued to move closer to justice,"" said family attorney Daryl Parks. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . Lee had submitted a resignation letter in April that said he was stepping down, but city commissioners voted not to accept it. In March, he had said he was stepping down temporarily in the wake of the public furor over the failure of the police to arrest George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who has said his shooting of Martin on February 26 was an act of self-defense. Also Wednesday, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office released 911 tapes of calls placed the morning after the shooting, when police had still not identified the 17-year--old victim. He was unarmed and carrying no identification when he was shot while walking to his father's girlfriend's house after picking up some snacks at a nearby store. In the first call, Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy Martin, calls police at 8:39 a.m. asking to file a missing persons report, which typically would not be accepted until 24 hours after a person has been discovered missing. ""It hasn't really been 24 hours,"" he tells the police dispatcher. ""But I'm from Miami and my son's up here with me ... he don't know anybody up here."" Documents shed light of Trayvon Martin killing . In the return call, placed nine minutes later, the dispatcher tells the victim's father that an officer is en route to where he was staying. Lee had said Zimmerman was not charged in the shooting because there were no grounds to disprove his account of the events -- that Martin had attacked him. Since then, Zimmerman has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The incident sparked a national debate as to whether the shooting was an act of racial profiling by Zimmerman and about the state's ""stand-your-ground"" law. Jailhouse calls show Zimmerman, wife talking in code . During an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in New Orleans, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said the family has been heartened by the response from the community. ""It's just nice to see so many people that support us, so many people that walk up to us just to give us a hug. Just to tell us that they support us,"" she said. ""It does the heart good. Yes, we still are hurting. We just had to go through a Mother's Day and a Father's Day and it hurts. It just hurts.""","Martin family lawyer: ""We've continued to move closer to justice""

"(CNN) -- Every member of Congress swore an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. So did President Barack Obama. But too often over the past five years, the President has circumvented the American people and their elected representatives through executive action, changing and creating his own laws, and excusing himself from enforcing statutes he is sworn to uphold -- at times even boasting about his willingness to do it, as if daring the American people to stop him. That's why, later this month, we will bring legislation to the House floor that would authorize the House of Representatives to file suit in an effort to compel President Obama to follow his oath of office and faithfully execute the laws of our country. The President's response: ""So sue me."" What's disappointing is the President's flippant dismissal of the Constitution we are both sworn to defend. It is utterly beneath the dignity of the office. I know the President is frustrated. I'm frustrated. The American people are frustrated, too. Obama: Boehner's lawsuit is 'a stunt' After years of slow economic growth and high unemployment under President Obama, they are still asking, 'where are the jobs?' The House has passed more than 40 jobs bills that would help. But Washington Democrats, led by the President, just ignore them. Even worse, the President's habit of ignoring the law as written hurts our economy and jobs even more. Washington taxes and regulations always make it harder for private sector employers to meet payrolls, invest in new initiatives and create jobs -- but how can those employers plan, invest and grow when the laws are changing on the President's whim at any moment? I don't take the House legal action against the President lightly. We've passed legislation to address this problem (twice), but Senate Democrats, characteristically, have ignored it. In the end, the Constitution makes it clear that the President's job is to faithfully execute the laws. And, in my view, the President has not faithfully executed the laws when it comes to a range of issues, including his health care law, energy regulations, foreign policy and education. Boehner plans lawsuit against Obama over executive orders . There must be accountability. We have a system of government outlined in our Constitution with the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. Congress has its job to do, and so does the President. When there are conflicts like this -- between the legislative branch and the executive branch -- it is my view that it is our responsibility to stand up for this institution in which we serve, and for the Constitution. If you look back over American history, there has always been a tension between the inherent powers of the executive branch versus the inherent powers of the legislative branch. This issue is as old as Marbury vs. Madison and as fresh as the unanimous Supreme Court ruling last week that the President overstepped his authority on recess appointments. Over the last five years, starting -- not coincidentally -- when his political party lost the majority in the House of Representatives, the President has consistently overstepped his authority under the Constitution, and in so doing eroded the power of the legislative branch. The legislative branch has an obligation to defend the rights and responsibilities of the American people, and America's constitutional balance of powers -- before it is too late.

"(CNN) -- While studiously avoiding the word ""torture,"" CIA Director John Brennan told reporters on Thursday that the aggressive interrogation program yielded information that helped the agency find Osama bin Laden. He also called the Senate Intelligence Committee's damning report on CIA abuses ""flawed"" by partisanship, as well as ""exaggerations and misrepresentations."" Brennan's comments are certain to pour oil on the already raging debate over what constitutes torture, how effective it is and who authorized what in the chaotic days and months after the 9/11 attacks. They also put the Obama administration squarely in the crossfire between Democrats defending the committee's handiwork and Republicans and former CIA chiefs trashing it. The culmination of a six-year investigation, the committee Democrats' report was intended to provide a moment of moral reckoning for America. Instead, it has underscored Washington's inability to rise above partisan truths and forge a common view on how to defend the country from terrorist attacks. As an exercise in political accountability, a comprehensive report on the CIA's detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects after 9/11 is overdue. In its otherwise commendable zeal to avert further terrorist attacks, the agency sometimes overstepped the bounds of decency. ""Abhorrent"" is how Brennan described the behavior of what he insisted was a handful of rogue CIA officials who acted without authorization, and understanding how that happened is necessary to prevent it from happening again. Yet rather than move us toward consensus on that point, the report has revealed a shockingly deep partisan divide over the morality and efficacy of torture. This largely reflects the Republican Party's unwillingness to confront America's faults and misdeeds. ""I think we were fundamentally justified and I would do it again in a minute,"" declared former Vice President Dick Cheney, who continues to insist that the CIA did not engage in torture. But Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats, who wrote the study, also bear some responsibility for polarizing the debate. It is, literally, a partisan report -- none of the committee Republicans endorsed it, and instead produced a point-by-point rebuttal. What's more, the majority report's relentlessly adversarial tone hardly seems calculated to produce the catharsis its authors say the country needs. Still, the committee gets the biggest thing right. Based on a huge review of 6 million CIA documents, it concludes the agency tortured 39 suspects at ""black"" sites around the world. The squalid details of the violence inflicted on captives can't be hidden behind bureaucratic euphemisms like ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" This was torture, plain and simple. It violated America's professed commitment to individual dignity. And, by handing our enemies a propaganda windfall, it damaged our national security. In today's press conference, Brennan also clung to the fictitious distinction between ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" which he said were authorized by the Bush administration, and torture, which was not. Although President Obama prohibited the use of torture in a 2009 executive order (as did President Bush in an executive order he issued in 2007), Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, chairwoman of the Senate committee, wants Congress to pass fresh legislation to outlaw torture. She's right, even if there's zero chance of that happening. The United States, after all, is still in the midst of a long, murky war with Islamist terrorism, with no end in sight. The people and agencies we've charged to wage that war deserve what they didn't get at the outset: clear legal and moral guidance to keep their conduct aligned with America's values. The report begins by stating categorically that torture doesn't work. But while some intelligence experts echo this conclusion -- as does Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, whose views on the matter command respect -- many top CIA officials insist brutal methods did yield vital intelligence that led to the capture of major terrorist leaders and foiled several pending attacks. I have no way of telling who is right. Certainly, it's convenient to believe that torture never produces valuable information; if true it's purely a matter of sadism and there's no earthly reason to condone it. But absolutist claims on either side strike me as implausible, and the committee might have been better off conceding that torture may have yielded important tidbits, but that they weren't worth the moral cost of betraying our own ideals and giving our enemies the idea that it's alright to torture captured Americans, because we do it, too. The committee also did itself no favors by declining to interview former CIA leaders, whom Brennan said could have provided important context that memos and papers lack. This puzzling omission has made it easier for Republicans to dismiss the committee's work as a partisan vendetta against the agency, rather than a dispassionate effort to set the historical record straight. That said, the report builds a persuasive case that the CIA routinely exaggerated the value of whatever it gleaned from physically, mentally and emotionally abusing captives. Indeed, the most troubling thing about the study is its portrait of the CIA as a rogue agency running amok. The agency, after all, is an arm of the U.S. government and is answerable to Congress and the White House. As Brennan noted, its detention and interrogation program operated under guidance for the U.S. Justice Department. Yet the report alleges the CIA systematically lied to all its political overseers to shield its interrogation program from scrutiny and keep it going. According to the report, the agency didn't even brief the Bush administration on the program until 2006 (by which time the program was winding down). False, says former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who took over the CIA in 2006. President George W. Bush ""approved the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah [in 2002]. It's in his book!"" Hayden told reporter Michael Hirsh. Zubaydah was the first suspect subjected to torture. Ultimately, scapegoating the CIA is a little too convenient. It lets the Bush administration, which ordered an unprepared CIA to set up the program, off the hook. And in belaboring the alleged mendacity of the CIA, the report obscures the larger truth about the whole shameful episode: After the shock of 9/11, the CIA did exactly what most Americans and political leaders wanted and expected it to do -- go after our enemies tong and hammer to prevent further attacks. They (and we) wanted results, and weren't too particular about how the clandestine service got them. In the heat of battle, the agency went too far. But the CIA is not the KGB. If it erred, our political leaders (including the intelligence committees) erred, too, in not monitoring closely the methods it employed to keep us safe. Now, looking back on that intense period of anger, fear and retaliatory fervor, we feel badly about what was done in our name. That's the right reaction, as long we acknowledge our collective culpability, instead of pinning all the blame on the patriotic men and women we hire to do our dirty work.","Will Marshall: CIA Director John Brennan's speech will fuel debate on torture .

"Kiki Sarakinou doesn't think the Greeks owe their European peers anything. ""Whoever lent us money, we don't owe them anything,"" she says. ""They owe us."" Because, she says, Greece gave Europe culture, thinkers like Aristotle, Socrates, ""all the philosophers and mathematicians."" Despite that, Sarakinou will vote for New Democracy, the pro-austerity party in this weekend's elections. ""Because there is no option,"" she says. She is afraid of a return to the drachma -- the currency Greece had before it entered the euro -- the specter of which looms large over the vote. ""It would be chaos if we went back to the drachma."" Sarakinou is sitting outside Cafe Peros, a resplendent figure enjoying the country's cafe culture in Kolonaki, one of Athens' most affluent areas. What do Greek elections mean? Sarakinou could be seen as one of the lucky ones. Her husband, a lawyer, has passed away but she is able to support herself independently. Yet ""every day is disappointing,"" she says. ""[The country] has just collapsed."" She calls the situation ""very sad, [and] bad."" The country must take an ""honest fight"" to corruption to bring itself out of the crisis, she says. Kolonaki is populated by the city's elite. It is a place where businessmen, politicians and actors gather to chew over the country's political and economic crisis with cigars, espressos and cold beer. Its wealthy clientele has ensured it is slightly shielded from the crisis, and the square remains buzzing with families, businessmen and the elderly, relaxing into the hot Athens evening. Yet the area is far from immune. Restaurant manager Dimitris Konstantopoulos says business has dropped by half since last year, and numbers of staff have been cut from 60 to 29.

Here, restaurant worker Mario Makris simply drops his thumb down when asked how business is. ""Business has dropped by over 60%,"" he says.

On Sunday, Papageorgiou says, he will vote for extreme right wing party Golden Dawn, one of several fringe parties to benefit from voters' dissatisfaction with traditional political groups in the last election. Greek citizens -- and the rest of the world -- will have to wait and see if those same extremist parties will play a key role in the country's political future, be it inside or outside the euro.","Greece is voting in its second election in six weeks .

"(CNN) -- Harvard Business School associate professor Ben Edelman was in the running this week for ""Most Disliked Guy on the Internet"" -- and all because of $4. After accusing a restaurant of overcharging him, Edelman began an epic back and forth with the management that went viral. Now, the professor is apologizing for letting the dispute spiral so out of control. According to Boston.com, the saga began last week when Edelman placed an order at a family-operated Boston-area Chinese restaurant named Sichuan Garden. He was hungry for sauteed prawns with roasted chili and peanut, stir-fried chicken with spicy capsicum, braised fish filets and napa cabbage with roasted chili, and shredded chicken with spicy garlic sauce. When he placed his order, Edelman thought his meal would run him $53.35. But when he checked his receipt, he noticed he'd been charged an additional $4 -- or, as he noted in the first of several emails he sent to Sichuan Garden, an apparent ""increase of $1 on each and every item."" Celebrated bartender Ran Duan, who manages the bar inside his parents' Sichuan Garden location, was the one to respond to Edelman's complaint. In doing so, he kicked off an epic three-day email exchange that ended with Edelman, who is also a lawyer and fashions himself as a ""Web sheriff,"" considering legal action against the restaurant. It turns out that the menu Edelman viewed on Sichuan Garden's website was out of date, which Duan apologized for and said he would fix. This was Edelman's response: . ""Under Massachusetts law, it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price. I urge you to cease this practice immediately,"" he wrote. ""In the interim, I suggest that Sichuan Garden refund me three times the amount of the overcharge. The tripling reflects the approach provided under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL 93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations."" Whether Edelman offered a correct interpretation of the law in that instance has been up for debate. But Edelman's email exchange with Duan didn't end there. After Duan offered to pay Edelman $3 as restitution, the professor replied that giving only him a refund would be ""an exceptionally light sanction for the violation that has occurred."" As a result, Edelman told Duan that he'd reported the issue to local authorities and hoped that would cause the restaurant to ""identify all consumers affected and to provide refunds to all of them."" After more back-and-forth, Duan eventually had to ask: ""Is this really worth your time?"" For Edelman, the answer was ""yes."" He told Business Insider in a statement that ""the restaurant at issue knew the website prices had been 'out of date for quite some time.' At what point should they do something about it? I'm pleased to have at least gotten the problem fixed for the benefit of others."" The professor seemed to have a change of heart on Wednesday, posting an apology to his website. ""Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it's clear that I was very much out of line,"" Edelman wrote. ""I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future. I have reached out to Ran and will apologize to him personally as well."" On Twitter, Edelman had been raked over the coals, with some accusing him of living up to the worst stereotypes about lawyers and Harvard minds. His interaction has even put some students at Harvard Business School on the defense. There's now a fundraising campaign to give to those in need with the hope that it'll help counteract the ""negative stereotypes of Harvard and HBS (that) were reinforced"" with Edelman's dispute. The online campaign is asking ""all Harvard students to flip the script by donating $4 to provide food for those in need."" And for Sichuan Garden, this feud has turned into some good publicity. The restaurant's Yelp page has received a steady stream of positive comments over the past few days, even from folks who have yet to taste the food. ""I live in NYC, so I haven't eaten here,"" said one Yelp user named John C. ""But read the boston.com story about the Harvard B School prof/troll slamming them over a $4 dispute, and just wanted to show my support and respect for how the owners handled themselves and the troll.

"A suicide bomber detonated explosives Thursday inside a French-funded school in Kabul during a play that condemns suicide attacks, leading to deaths and numerous injuries, the French foreign minister said. The attack happened at Istiqlal High School, a school that includes a French cultural center, in the Afghan capital. The Taliban -- the Islamist extremist group fighting against Afghanistan's ruling government and firmly opposed by various Western powers -- claimed responsibility, according to spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Around 5 p.m., the theater at the school in central Kabul was packed for a performance of a play titled ""Heartbeats: Silence after the Explosion."" It abruptly ended about 30 minutes later with a very loud bang, a bright light, smoke and dust, according to witness Zahir Sangar. ""When I tried to escape, I saw tens of people covered in blood, some of them were screaming and some of them were quiet,"" the student said. Acting Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said that one person was killed and 15 others injured in the bombing. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said a short time later that several people had died. It was not clear exactly how many or whether the suicide bomber was among the fatalities, though Fabius did say that no French citizens were among the casualties. ""All light must be shed on this barbaric act,"" Fabius said. ""And its perpetrators (must be) identified and brought to justice."" The dead include a German national, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said. French President Francois Hollande also issued a statement condemning what he called a ""heinous attack.""

"(CNN) -- Growing up in the United States, my summers were filled with trips to Little Havana in Miami, where my family and I would watch anti-communist plays featuring popular Latino actors. Those trips would include hours-long pig roasts, where family members would animatedly discuss the big policy issues of the day, like the impact of the fall of the Soviet Union on Cuba's government. My parents were among the men and women who fled the country in the 1960s, and from them, I learned about human rights abuses, lack of political and press freedoms and other forms of repression, something that helped mold my opinions about U.S. policy towards Cuba. In fact, having grown up in this kind of environment, it should come as little surprise that I've been a hardliner on U.S.-Cuba policy issues. But after the better part of three decades, I'm starting to change my mind. Indeed, I've begun to question the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba, and have grown less and less sure that its continuation is really helping the Cuban people. Why? Like many U.S.-born children of Cuban exiles, I have a complicated identity. But while I will never support Cuba's current repressive political system, I have started to see how the United States' embargo against the communist island could bolster government officials there, who can simply blame the embargo for any shortcomings. Five decades ago, my father boarded a plane from Havana to New York and vowed never to return to the island. My mother last saw her beloved Cuba when she left by boat for Asturias, Spain, in 1961. She says she saw her family and friends lose their homes and possessions, and told me how other exiles were excoriated as ""gusanos,"" or worms, for leaving. So my recent decision to visit the country for the first time troubled my parents. For example, I'm outspoken about human rights issues, and my mother was worried that I'd be punished for speaking my mind. And remember, this is a country known for its media censorship, a place where just-released American, Alan Gross, sat in jail for five years ""for facilitating uncensored Internet contact between a small, religious community on the island and the rest of the world."" In fact, Gross's plight was a topic of discussion among the group of about a dozen of us who went on a tour of Cuba last November that was organized by the Denver-based nonprofit organization Chamber of the Americas, whose mission is ""to facilitate commerce and understanding between the businesses and governments of the Western Hemisphere."" During my politically active teen years and into my 20s, when I protested the U.S. decision to send Elian Gonzalez home and had anti-communism banners and Ronald Reagan quotes adorning my dorm room, I vowed not to visit the island until the current dictatorship was part of Cuba's distant past. Yet here I was, in my early 30s, hearing directly from Cuban officials, economists, professors, students, musicians and others. We also visited the U.S. chief of mission while we were in Havana. And I was pleasantly surprised that some of our guest speakers openly criticized government policies, talking about everything from the need for more private business to their dismay that the government had shut down beloved 3-D theaters, arguing they'd never been authorized. This isn't to say that I wasn't exposed to things that troubled me, even during this short trip: I saw billboards filled with socialist propaganda, there was clearly a lack of press freedom, and there is the fact that even though they're highly educated, Cubans still don't earn a decent wage: the average Cuban earns 20 Cuban dollars a month -- about $20 USD. But this last fact highlighted to me one of the strongest arguments against the embargo -- that it harms average Cubans, rather than the government. And I know I'm far from the only one hoping for an end to the embargo. As noted by CNN, millennials of Latino descent are generally in favor of ending the embargo, with one poll noting that more than half of Cuban-Americans surveyed in Miami wanted an end to the embargo, while a solid majority of them also favored restoring diplomatic relations with Havana. Across the water, many of the college age students I spoke to said they'd like to see government reform, and they told me that they yearn for more access to information on the island. Part of their desire comes from meeting young Cuban-Americans and other visitors from the United States who discuss some of the freedoms many of us take for granted, including the right to protest and express ourselves without repercussions from state officials. All this said, I can never personally forgive the decades-long human rights abuses in my parents' homeland. But ultimately, opening dialogue between Cubans on the island and overseas would be a good start on the path of trying to repair a long and painful rift. If we can embark on this journey, then we might be able to help those young Cubans with whom I spoke to secure some of the freedoms that so many of us here take for granted.

"We're only two days into this government shutdown, but it already seems like we've been here before. And in a way, we have. The Republicans and Democrats got in each other's faces over the U.S. debt ceiling in 2011.  The GOP demanded significant budget cuts before agreeing to give Uncle Sam more borrowing power.  That amounted to $2 trillion in cuts over 10 years. But Congress never could agree on where to make the cuts, so they were implemented across-the-board. The package averted a shutdown then, but didn't soothe the hard feelings created by the standoff. Plus, add this to the mix:  The tea party can't stand Obamacare.  They don't like it, never will. With that history in mind, here's what we know and what we don't know about the shutdown. 1995 and 2013: Three differences between two shutdowns . DIVIDED CONGRESS . What we know: . Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided and barely on speaking terms these days.  Feelings are hurt and fingers are pointing.  Right now the wounds are too fresh and no one is in the mood to give anyone a break. The Republican-led House tried to pass a piecemeal funding plan on Tuesday night to pay for the District of Columbia, veterans affairs and national parks.  It failed to win the required two-thirds vote, but has no future in any case.  The Democratic-led Senate wasn't about to agree to it and the White House promised a veto. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called the strategy as ""just another wacky idea by tea party Republicans.""  President Barack Obama chimed in Tuesday, calling the Republicans ""reckless"" and saying they're holding the nation hostage to defund Obamacare. Republicans in the House say they'll try again Wednesday. Obama, meanwhile, canceled a trip to the Philippines and Malaysia. Secretary of State John Kerry will go in his place. Shutdown 'extremely damaging' to U.S. intelligence operations . What we don't know: . Who will blink first?  Right now, both sides are sporting steely eyed stares. The White House appears determined to stand its ground. On Capitol Hill, the House and Senate have both refused to budge from their visions for the budget and, beyond that, health care reform. But behind the tough facades, are cracks forming?  A small crack now could bring down a party's strong stance later. Sen. John McCain points out that any attempt to repeal Obamacare will fail because the president will veto it and the GOP doesn't have the votes to override.  And Rep. Peter King of New York says tea party conservatives only care about ""their own agenda."" Meet the man behind the government shutdown . DIVIDED GOP . What we know: . The GOP is almost two parties these days -- call them standard Republicans and tea party Republicans. While not polar opposites, the factions have different approaches to changing government. Both want to cut federal spending, but for the tea party, defunding the president's signature health care law and slashing deficit spending are causes worth staking a political career on.  That's what their constituents elected them to do, they say. Republican divisions force delay in Boehner's debt strategy . What we don't know: . How united will Republicans stay as the government shutdown lingers, as government workers go without paychecks and as the spotlight focuses on a Congress that can't govern or members that can't even agree to talk to one another. Tea Party's Amy Kremer : ""Harry Reid wants a shutdown because he believes it's a political victory for the Democrats"" HOW LONG? What we know: . The last government shutdown took place almost 18 years ago during the Clinton administration and lasted 21 days. What we don't know: . How the major players on Capitol Hill will get over the bad feelings to end this latest political stalemate.  Right now things don't look very promising. There's plenty of sniping to go around. In an op-ed published online Tuesday in USA Today, House Speaker John Boehner lays the shutdown at the feet of Democrats, especially President Obama. ""Obama owns this shutdown now,"" screams the headline.  Later, the article accuses the president of a ""scorched-Earth policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law, current government funding, or the debt limit."" Of course, the feeling is mutual. On Tuesday, the president said it was ""strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda."" ""Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act,"" he said. Should the rhetoric soften, it could signal the beginning of the end of the shutdown. 10 ways the shutdown would affect you . PAYCHECKS . What we know: . The president, members of Congress, their staffs and the military get paid.  Non-essential government employees don't. What we don't know: . How long government workers will have to wait until they see another paycheck. Some 800,000 federal workers are being furloughed.  Piecemeal funding for their jobs could eventually be approved.  The pressure of that many jobs hanging over both parties could become too much to bear. The shutdown could cost the still-struggling U.S. economy about $1 billion a week in pay. And that's only the tip of the iceberg, experts say. The total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers, said Brian Kessler, economist with Moody's Analytics. His firm estimates that a three- to four-week shutdown would cost the economy about $55 billion. PUBLIC REACTION . What we know: . The American public is not amused. According to a CNN/ORC poll, 68% of Americans think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea, while 27% think it's a good idea. The survey taken before the shutdown said most Americans would blame congressional Republicans: Sixty-nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party's elected officials were acting like ""spoiled children."" But Democrats aren't off the hook.  Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they, too, were acting like spoiled kids. Another poll showed public support for Congress at record low levels -- at 10%. What we don't know: . Will this high-stakes game of  political chicken hurt the approval ratings of individual members?

"(CNN) -- Early next year, bidders are expected to shell out millions for cars that stood around in Roger Baillon's yard for decades. The French truck manufacturing mogul had big dreams for them. He wanted to found a museum and build a miniature railroad loop for visitors to ride around and view them, a Paris auction house said. But the plans evaporated when his business went bust in the 1970s. He sold off nearly half of his collection, but 60 of his classic European luxury and sports cars -- many built in the first half of the 20th century -- remained and collected rust, dust and weeds for about 50 years. Until car experts from auction house Artcurial recently came upon them in a small town in western France, not far from La Rochelle. $14.9 million . Now, buyers will probably write checks for hundreds of thousands for just one of the sagging exquisite carriages. Artcurial will put them under the hammer in February and expects the crown jewel in the collection, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spyder, to fetch 9.5 million to 12 million euros ($11 million to $14.9 million). The convertible was one of only 37 of its kind made, and it is in comparatively great condition, as it slumbered behind the doors of a snug garage, Artcurial said. It was piled high with copies of a vintage magazine, La Vie de l'Auto -- Car Life -- when Artcurial's car expert Pierre Novikoff found it. The Ferrari's roommate in the garage was a 1956 Maserati A6G Gran Sport Frua that auctioneers think will go for 800,000 to 1.2 million euros (about $990,000 to nearly $1.5 million). Scrapyard . Most of the rest of the other sleeping beauties lay comatose under roofs of corrugated steel held up by posts; with no walls to protect them, they were exposed to the elements. Novikoff heard about the car yard over the phone and went to check it out. At first glance, the cars looked like the rest of the junk in the yard -- old washing machines, metal scrap, barrels. But gems gradually sparkled through. ""Nature had taken a hold over the years. Ivy had invaded a car and entirely covered its (steering) wheel, while weeds had taken root in a passenger compartment as easily as in a greenhouse,"" Novikoff said. ""In places, the sheets of corrugated iron were resting directly on the cars."" Baillon died about 10 years ago, said Artcurial spokeswoman Rebecca Ruff. Baillon's son inherited the estate, but when he recently died, his heirs contacted the auction house to sell the unique collection, she added. Legends . Most of the cars will require a deep kiss of restoration to reawaken the former glory of their exclusive brands, some of which are no longer manufactured. Bugattis, Maseratis, Ferraris, Delahayes, Delages, Hispano-Suizas, Talbot-Lagos and Panhard-Levassors stood motionless in the estate that Baillon bought to store them. The largest contingency of the collected cars hit the streets between 1955 and 1965, Artcurial said in a statement. Some have stories to go along with them. The 1961 Ferrari was once owned by French silver screen demigod Alain Delon, Artcurial said, and he was photographed sitting in it next to Jane Fonda in 1964, and with Shirley MacLaine. Legend also slumbers in the peach-colored rust covering a pre-World War II Talbot-Lago, a French classic brand that died out some 50 years ago. Artcurial says this one was driven by former Egyptian King Farouk. .","60 luxury cars sat on the grounds of a French mogul's estate for decades .

"(CNN) -- Might there be a Tyra Banks/Naomi Campbell situation this awards season? With the announcement of nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards and Golden Globes, Viola Davis' fans had plenty to cheer about. She received nods for her performance in the new ABC drama ""How to Get Away With Murder."" But ""Scandal"" actress Kerry Washington, one of the darlings of awards seasons past, was nowhere to be found. Is it a case of there being room for only one African-American woman to be celebrated? It's not a new concept. In 2005, Banks invited fellow supermodel Campbell onto her talk show for a conversation about the tension between them. The fashion industry was partially to blame, Banks said. ""Back then, there were 10 top models ... but there was an unwritten rule that only one of them could be black,"" Banks said. ""And Naomi was that one black girl."" Campbell added in 2013, ""It does irk me that two women of color have to be pitted against each other. ... I'm very proud of Tyra and what she's done with 'America's Next Top Model.' I'm proud of her; I'm proud to know her."" Likewise, model Iman told Time in 2003 that when she arrived in New York in 1975 to model, she ""learned that magazines would only use one black girl at a time, and they were trying to create a competition between us."" Davis has received plenty of acclaim for her work in films and began drawing even more awards buzz from almost the moment she debuted as tough-as-nails law professor Annalise Keating on ""How to Get Away With Murder."" Washington, meanwhile, has reigned as a fan favorite during the four seasons of her hit show ""Scandal."" In 2013, she was saluted for being the first black woman to lead a weekly TV series since Diahann Carroll starred in ""Julia,"" which premiered in 1968. Washington's absence from this year's nominations was very quickly noted. Debra Birnbaum, executive editor for TV for Variety, tweeted, ""Another early morning, another awards snub for @kerrywashington. I'm getting tired of complaining about it. #scandal."" Another fan tweeted, ""And again how is @kerrywashington not nominated for @ScandalABC?! It's baffling to me. Congrats on the nom Viola Davis. #GlodenGlobes."" Writing for The Wrap, Jethro Nededog noted Wednesday that the SAG nomination for Davis but not Washington may have illuminated the lingering diversity problem in Hollywood. He said it was not that Washington wasn't deserving this time around, because ""At the top of the game for TV's dramatic actresses, she should have been a shoo-in for a SAG nomination again this year."" ""Of course, Washington's nomination history for a SAG award isn't as deep as the one she has for the Emmys, which she received nominations for in 2013 and 2014. And the Golden Globes also saw fit to nominate her only once before, in 2014, just like the SAGs,"" Nededog wrote. ""But if it's true that there's only room for one black leading actress in the run for awards, then Hollywood isn't as progressive-minded as we believe ourselves to be."" Both shows are tied to Shonda Rhimes, who holds the distinction of being the most powerful woman of color in Hollywood. Rhimes rules Thursday nights on ABC, with ""Scandal"" (which she created) and ""How to Get Away With Murder"" (which she executive produced) airing back to back. Known for building in diversity, both of color and of sexuality, into her projects, Rhimes told the New York Times in September that she saw nothing unique in the lineup. ""I'm not sitting around going, 'Wow, it's historic to have two black women on television,' "" Rhimes said. ""I don't think it's odd to see two black women standing in the same place because, well, that's my house. Like, it's not a thing. To me, it just feels like Tuesday.""","Viola Davis was nominated for awards this season, but Kerry Washington was not .

"(CNN)It started with a sore throat on Thanksgiving and an antibiotic from a friend who wanted to help. Now 19-year-old Yaasmeen Castanada is fighting for her life inside a California hospital's burn unit, suffering from an allergic reaction that's so severe she has large open wounds all over her body. ""It is heartbreaking, every day is a different look. Every day, she's like, shedding away. ... Overnight, it's a whole different person that you're looking at,"" Martha Hughes, Castanada's aunt, told CNN affiliate KABC. Doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a rare disease that can be triggered by antibiotics or other medications. ""When she took the medication, she started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk. So she rushed her to the ER, and that's when they diagnosed her with the disease. And from there it has just spiraled to a nightmare,"" Hughes said. Now Castanada, the mother of a 4-month-old, is in critical condition at the University of California, Irvine, burn center. Her prognosis is good, even though the disease has a high mortality rate, according to Dr. Victor Joe, the center's director. But the situation, Castanada's family says, has been devastating. ""Just unreal, just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally, burn in front of you,"" her mother, Laura Corona, told KABC. ""Every day, a new blister, a new burn, a new scar. And she's just, 'Mommy, I want to go home.' And I can't take her home. I can't put water on her lips."" Mom: 'Don't share medication' On a website created to raise funds for Castanada's care, her mother said the harrowing ordeal began soon after her daughter took the medicine. ""A  friend offered her an antibiotic pill that she had from a previous illness,"" Corona wrote. ""She was thinking that it would help her. This would be the biggest mistake of her life."" Now, Corona says she's hoping to spread the word so others don't make the same mistake. ""Don't share medication. Don't give someone else your medication. Don't offer medication,"" she said. She also advises parents to find out what their children are allergic to -- before it's too late. Doctor: Reaction causing skin to separate . At first, doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, which refers to a condition where between 10% and 30% of the skin on the body is affected, Joe said. Now she's experiencing Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, the diagnosis when more than 30% of the body is affected. Joe estimates that 65% of Castaneda's skin and mucus membranes have been affected. The allergic reaction is causing layers of Castaneda's skin to separate, Joe said, creating lesions that grow into large open wounds. ""Patients can experience problems with taste, swallowing, eyesight and sexual functions can be affected. In Yaasmeen's case, we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected. This can cause scarring of the corneas, which could lead to permanent blindness,"" he said. ""We are trying to prevent that from happening."" Photos on the fundraising website show Castanada lying in a hospital bed, with openings for her eyes cut from the bandages that cover her. As part of her treatment for the disease, doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing, Joe said. ""We have chosen to place a dressing that adheres to the open wound, which allows her skin to heal without having to remove the bandages to wash the wounds,"" he said. Mortality for those suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis can be as high as 25% in adults, but tends to be lower with early treatment, according to the Merck Manual. Though it's uncommon, Joe said his hospital has treated around six cases in the past year, because the burn center has experience treating open wounds. ""This is very sobering. The fact that you can get a life-threatening situation from taking a medication.  It can happen, and most people don't think twice about taking pills for things,"" Joe said. ""In fact, most of the time you do have some sort of side reaction to medication, just not this severe."" After recovering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, patients usually only have minor issues with their skin, such as dryness, Joe said. ""Hopefully new skin will come in,"" Corona told KABC. ""I'm just there watching. All I can tell her is, ""Hang on, hang on. It's almost over.'"" CNN's Joseph Netto and Deborah Goldschmidt contributed to this report.","An allergic reaction to an antibiotic sent Yaasmeen Castanada to a hospital burn unit .

"If the concept of being awakened by a complete stranger sounds good to you, as opposed to, say, creepy or disconcerting, then Wakie is the app for you. Originally launched in 2011, Wakie has finally made its way to the iPhone's App Store, after a reported nine-month wait. It's also available for Android and Windows phones and, according to the company, already has 1.5 million users in 80 countries. They call it the ""social alarm clock"" and ""a friendly community of people who wake each other up in the morning."" And the concept is that simple. If you set an alarm through the app at, say, 6 a.m. you'll get a call from another user waking you up when that time comes. Likewise, if you're in the mood to be the waker, not the wakee, (""Wakies"" and ""Sleepies"" in the app's parlance) you can go to the app, see how many people are ready to rise and shine and click to be the person who delivers the news. Connections are made through the app and no one ever sees another user's phone number. The length of a call is limited to one minute, and users are encouraged to sing songs, tell jokes, recite poems or use otherwise creative ways to kickstart their slumbering community members' days. If no ""wakies"" are on the app when you've set an alarm, Wakie sends you an automated robo-call to do the job. It's worth noting that, on the app's social feed, it's not uncommon to see folks who have awakened to the sound of a stranger's voice trying to track down that stranger, or vice versa. So that's all well and good. But ... why? Why get a stranger to wake you up instead of, you know, an alarm. ""A lot of people keep snoozing alarm clocks and still can't wake up,""  Hrachik Adjamian, Wakie's CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. ""Our research shows that a one-minute talk to a stranger wakes your brain up with a 99% guarantee. When someone asks you questions in the morning your brain has to wake up to answer. Also you try to be kind, you try to turn on your social pattern of behavior. After the call you can't sleep anymore even if you had a short sleep."" But what about the creep factor? Is there anything stopping someone from calling up and being abusive or rude? There are in-app tools to report abuse, but Adjamian says it's never really been a problem. Wakie is free, but there are plans for a premium version in the works. Adjamian told TechCrunch that version may allow conversations up to five minutes, as well as letting users choose the gender of the person who calls them. Which starts to sound a bit too much like a wakeup dating app to us -- though there are worse ways to have early morning chats with romantically minded strangers, we suppose.","Wakie lets you wake up to a stranger's voice .

"Four Palestinian fighters were reported killed in clashes with the Israeli military in Gaza early Friday as the Israelis destroyed what they said were two ""terror tunnels"" there. Four fighters with the al Qassam Brigades -- the military wing of Hamas, which controls Gaza -- were killed in the incidents, the militant group's website said. Israel said five of its soldiers were injured. One of Israel's targets was a tunnel, discovered on October 7, that the Israeli military said reached from Gaza into Israel and might have been intended to help Palestinian militants kidnap Israelis. Israeli military engineers early Friday detonated a segment of that tunnel, which it said stretched 1.7 kilometers (1.06 miles) from Gaza into Israel, near Israeli communities. As that happened, Hamas fighters detonated an explosive, injuring five Israeli soldiers, the Israeli military said. Israeli soldiers then opened fire and ""directly hit a terrorist,"" it said. That appears to match what the medical service in Gaza said was the death of a man around midnight Thursday or early Friday along the Gaza-Israel border, east of the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. The man was hit by an Israeli tank shell, said the medical service's spokesman, Ashraf Qidra. The al Qassam Brigades' website said that man was one of its fighters. Al Qassam's Twitter account described the clash as an ambush in which its fighters seriously injured five Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military said it also used aircraft to destroy a second ""terror tunnel"" in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday ""following Hamas aggression."" Israel didn't give specifics about the second tunnel. But the al Qassam Brigades said Israeli helicopters and tanks fired on and killed three of its fighters north of Khan Younis. Qidra, the Gaza medical services spokesman, said the bodies of those three were not immediately recovered. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the mission was imperative to prevent ""future attacks against Israeli civilians."" The first tunnel destroyed, he said, was similar to one that was used to kidnap Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006. His captivity ended five years later, after Israel released more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The tunnel discovered on October 7 was the third such tunnel found along the Gaza-Israel security fence in the past year, according to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that Hamas' ""offensive actions against Israel"" breached cease-fire arrangements reached after last year's ""Pillar of Defense"" operation. In that November 2012 operation, Israel launched a series of military strikes on Gaza designed to stop constant rocket fire. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas. More than 160 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians, were killed. Six Israelis died, including civilians and soldiers. Hundreds were wounded. Friday's clashes come two days after Israel released 26 Palestinian prisoners, part of an agreement that fueled new peace talks. The Palestinian Prison Authority confirmed that 21 prisoners were released early Wednesday in the West Bank and five others were released in Gaza. The released prisoners were the second of four groups -- roughly 100 prisoners -- expected to be freed in a deal cobbled together by the United States to jump-start stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.","Israel says it targeted ""terror tunnels,"" including at least one going from Gaza to Israel .

"A backlash from Democrats over add-ons to a massive government spending bill is throwing passage of the measure into doubt and once again raising concerns about a government shutdown. The House is slated to vote on the legislation Thursday, just hours before agencies run out of money. But on the morning of the scheduled vote, Rep. Steve Israel, a member of Democratic leadership, said the riders in bill have become a ""poison pill"" against Democratic support that the GOP majority needs for the measure to pass. ""At this point I don't see many Democratic votes at all for a bill that is so antithetical to the middle class,"" Israel told CNN following a meeting with other Democratic leaders. The $1.1 trillion spending bill authorizes funding for virtually all agencies through September, but some Democrats on Capitol Hill are vowing to oppose the legislation, arguing that the addition of some key policy changes amount to a giveaway for big special interests. Congress must pass some type of legislation by Thursday at midnight to avert a shutdown. The top concerns from Democrats center on a proposal to ease banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank law and a measure that would allow wealthy donors to give considerably more money to the political parties. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the provisions were ""destructive to middle class families and to the practice to our democracy"" and demanded they be stripped out of the bill.   Pelosi's position is critical because House Republicans need Democratic support for the measure to pass. Though Republicans hold a significant majority in the House, Speaker John Boehner is expected to lose anywhere from 40 to 60 conservatives in his party who oppose the bill because it doesn't block the President's immigration executive action. Democrats will need to provide votes to offset those losses, setting up the sort of political brinksmanship that has become typical in Washington. A shutdown remains unlikely because lawmakers could agree at the last minute to approve a bill that would keep the government running for a few months -- when Republicans will have full control of Congress. House GOP aides say they are surprised Pelosi and others are lobbying for changes, since Democrats signed off on the bill before its release. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, asked by CNN if he was concerned about the bill's prospects, said no, replying with a smile, ""do I look worried?"" Key Senate Democrats are also blasting the deal. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democrats who is in charge of counting votes, said he didn't know if he would support the compromise or how many Democrats would. He called the Dodd-Frank provisions ""awful."" ""It is just an invitation for another financial disaster and the Republicans are hell-bent on getting that included,"" Durbin told reporters in the Capitol. ""Their appetite is whetted by the Nov. 4th election to undo Dodd-Frank. That has been one of their passions, second only to repealing the Affordable Care Act, and it means that the Wall Street interests -- the big banks, you know -- they're back on top as far as the House Republicans are concerned,"" he said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts who is heavily involved in banking regulations, lashed out at the changes to the banking rules. ""The House is about to vote on a budget deal -- a deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system,"" she said in a passionate floor speech.  ""These are the same banks that nearly broke the economy in 2008 and destroyed millions of jobs."" She urged Democrats to oppose the spending bill until ""this risky giveaway is removed from the legislation."" On the campaign finance matter, House Speaker John Boehner said larger individual donations to the parties are needed because Congress had recently eliminated taxpayer funds for political conventions. ""The Congress is very concerned about taxpayer funding of political activities,"" Boehner said.  ""This provision was worked out in a bipartisan way to allow those who are organizing conventions the opportunity to raise the money from private sources as opposed to using taxpayer funds."" Republican aides familiar with the negotiations say that both the chairs of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee supported the change on contributions limits to boost their own coffers. But DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz told CNN it was ""absolutely not"" true that she knew anything about the change to campaign finance laws being added to the spending bill. She said there was a joint effort with the RNC to appeal to the Federal Election Commission to raise the cap for donors for conventions, but she did not support putting this provision in the funding bill. Democratic aides say it's still early to gauge how many members will vote no on Thursday, but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by Democrats and Republicans over several weeks.  Democrats who negotiated the deal defended the end result, saying Republicans had pressed for six different changes to Dodd-Frank but Democrats were able to whittle it down to one.  Democrats also said they successfully removed more than two dozen environmental items and a handful of gun-related policy provisions sought by Republicans. Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a top Pelosi deputy, said he's voting no, and described the opposition as ""running deep and getting deeper"" as more Democrats review the details. The number three House Democrat, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, told reporters he was undecided, but was hearing ""lots of concerns"" about the banking provision, and said ""a lot of civil rights groups have been burning up the airwaves with problems about this."" A similar measure removing this same financial regulation was passed by the House last October, with 70 Democrats voting for it, a point McCarthy noted on Wednesday when pressed about the latest criticism from Democrats . ""Do they want to shut down the government?"" McCarthy said about those Democrats vowing to oppose the spending measure. Boehner's spokesman said the controversial provisions will remain in the bill. ""If Rep. Pelosi doesn't think her negotiators did a good job, she should discuss it with them - but sour grapes doesn't mean she gets to rewrite the deal after the fact,"" Michael Steel said in a statement to CNN. Still Republicans insist that there won't be a shutdown over this issue, and indicated they would consider a short-term funding bill through early next year -- when they will have full control of Congress -- if this bill fails.","Rep. Steve Israel says the riders added to the legislation are a ""poison pill""

"(CNN)Imagine spending your entire career searching for something buried somewhere within the Earth -- and then when you miraculously find it, the federal government seizes your discovery. That's the predicament paleontologist Peter Larson found himself in after he and his team unearthed a nearly complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton in 1990, preserved for some 67 million years in what is now the state of South Dakota. It is the most intact T-Rex skeleton ever found. Larson and his team had permission from the rancher, Maurice Williams, to dig on his property.  Before they had fully unearthed the fossil and realized its significance, they paid Williams $5,000 for the discovery. ""That was the most that any landowner had ever gotten (for a dinosaur fossil in the ground),"" Larson said. ""We shook hands and he (Williams) was pretty excited about seeing it set up in the museum."" Larson and his team from the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota had planned to showcase their discovery at the institute. But that never happened and Larson would soon find himself in the middle of a protracted legal battle that would result in him serving time in federal prison. Flat tire leads to fossil find . Maybe if the 1975 Suburban hadn't gotten a flat tire. Maybe if Sue Hendrickson hadn't been so impatient -- or if she hadn't gotten lost in the fog, the Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton would still be in that craggy South Dakota rockface. On the morning of August 12, 1990, the Black Hills fossil hunter team's Suburban broke down so Hendrickson decided to venture out on her own on Maurice Williams' ranch where the team had spent weeks searching for fossils. That foggy morning, she walked right into the discovery of a lifetime. ""Anybody who had any idea what a fossil versus a rock (looked like) would have seen it,"" Hendrickson said. ""There (were) a lot of broken bones dribbling down (and) about 8 feet up the side of the cliff, there were three articulated vertebrae and a couple of other pieces of bone sticking out."" Hendrickson immediately showed one of the vertebrae to her colleagues. Amazed, Larson said he and the team ""literally ran back to the site."" They nicknamed the T-Rex ""Sue"" after Hendrickson, and spent the next few weeks carefully unearthing the fossilized skeleton after paying Williams for the find. The bones, still encased in plaster and earth, were transferred to the Black Hills Institute where they began the long, arduous process of separating and preparing them for display -- a dream of Larson and his brother, Neal, also a member of his team. ""Ever since we created that little museum on our parents' ranch, it's always been our dream to have a museum here in Hill City (South Dakota),"" Peter Larson said, referring to the Black Hills Institute.  ""And finding Sue, the Tyrannosaurus Rex -- here's the anchor for the museum."" More than 80% of the skeleton was recovered -- making ""Sue"" the most complete and largest T-Rex ever discovered.  And the scientific impact was huge: One of the most interesting discoveries, according to Larson, was that the injuries to the bones indicated that Sue had died after being attacked by another T-Rex. Larson said he and the entire town hoped that a public display of Sue would ""put Hill City on the map."" Their excitement soon turned to outrage as federal agents arrived on the doorstep of the Black Hills Institute. Whose fossil is it? The morning of May 12, 1992, the Black Hills Institute paleontology team was still riding high. They had just succeeded in separating the T-Rex's pelvis from its skull -- a process that took more than a year and, if done incorrectly, could have damaged the prized skull. ""Taking that hip off of Sue's skull was critical. ...  You don't have a second chance,"" said paleontologist Terry Wentz.  ""One little movement (and) it could be cracking it all the way through inside."" Around 7 that morning,  FBI agents and the National Guard arrived at the institute and seized Sue, the records related to the T-Rex and other documents from the Black Hills Institute. ""I go down to the office and there's two FBI agents sitting there (saying) 'You've stolen this from federal land and we're coming here to seize this,' "" Peter Larson said. It took days for the federal agents to load up the fossil and during that time, Hill City residents showed up to protest which attracted the attention of the national media. The ""entire town of Hill City ... was in mourning when they took that dinosaur away,"" said Black Hills Institute's office manager Marion Zenker. Even though the team had gotten permission and paid the landowner for the fossil find, Maurice Williams -- who died in 2011 -- had apparently changed his claim and said the fossil belonged to him, said Kristin Donnan, author of ""Rex Appeal"" and Peter Larson's ex-wife. In addition, it turned out Williams' private ranch was part of Indian Trust land, which further complicated who owned Sue. On top of that, five years before Sue's discovery, the National Park Service (NPS) had begun to investigate the Black Hills Institute for illegally collecting fossils on public lands, said NPS senior geologist Vincent Santucci. ""There was a civil matter that dealt with the ownership of Sue ... (and) there was a separate, criminal investigation that had very little to do with Sue,"" Santucci told CNN. ""I think ... the dinosaur overshadowed a lot of that discussion and ... created confusion."" Navigating the tricky land laws were central to the federal case against the Black Hills Institute.  For 18 months, Sue remained locked up as the federal government gathered enough evidence to charge Larson and the other members of the institute -- giving immunity deals to several employees and friends of the institute in exchange for their testimony. Sue Hendrickson was one of those given immunity -- but she said she had nothing incriminating to say because ""they didn't do anything wrong."" The IRS and the National Park Service conducted the bulk of the federal investigation against Larson and the Black Hills Institute.  Keith Nelson, the lead investigator for the IRS, said the evidence recovered at the institute was overwhelming. ""There were so many bones, so many animals, so many invertebrates that were taken off of public lands, taken internationally, sold internationally. ... There was way more than we ever could have investigated,"" Nelson said. He stressed that Sue ""wasn't ... what was being looked at as far as potential criminal violations."" Larson and his colleagues have denied taking fossils off of public lands. In November 1993, a federal grand jury returned a 39-count indictment containing 153 charges against Peter Larson and five others linked to the Black Hills Institute, including Wentz and Larson's brother, Neal.  The 153 charges in the indictment included fossil theft, money laundering, and false statements to government agencies. None of the charges were directly related to Sue. In fact, during the trial, the court instructed both sides and all witnesses to avoid discussing the T-Rex. In the end, Williams made $7.6 million from the eventual auction of Sue, who was put on display at Chicago's Field Museum -- and Peter Larson served 18 months in federal prison for customs violations unrelated to the T-Rex. After Sue . Today, Peter Larson still runs the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, where his enthusiasm for T-Rexes hasn't abated.  He and his team have found a total of 10 partial Tyrannosaurus Rex skeletons. Despite everything that happened to him and his team, Larson says he's glad that Sue is on public display. He even went to the dinosaur's 2000 unveiling in Chicago as a guest of Sue Hendrickson's. He hasn't given up on his dream of returning Sue ""in some form"" to Hill City: He's asking the Field Museum for a full research cast of the T-Rex . ""I think it's probably the second best place she could have been,"" he said, referring to Chicago. ""People can see her and get the same excitement that I have for her.""

"Facebook wants you to know it doesn't see customers as a mass of faceless moneymaking advertising targets. It understands that you, and the other billion individuals who log on to the social network, are flesh-and-blood humans with feelings. That's why the company no longer refers to members as ""users"" internally. Instead it calls them ""people."" The switch in lingo has even trickled down to internal computer programs. Margaret Gould Stewart, the company's director of product design, explained Facebook's softened approach to humanizing its customers at the Atlantic Technology Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. ""It's kind of arrogant to think that the only reason that people exist is to use what you built. They actually have lives, like, outside of the experience they have using your product,"" she said. Facebook has an empathy team that designs programs to help engineers and designers understand what it means to be an advertiser or small business -- an experience Stewart says they cannot immediately relate to. That can help Facebook employees create better products for those advertisers and be more invested in figuring out why a campaign did or didn't take off with Facebook users (sorry, people). On its own, swapping out a few words doesn't mean much, but it shows that a giant global company is working to shift its internal culture. If engineers, designers and other employees think of the real people on the other side of their products, it might help them create something more personal and human. And that, of course, will make it a little easier to serve people ads.","Facebook stops calling members ""users"" and switches to ""people""

"Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN)I've heard that the Senate report on CIA torture is 6,000 pages long. My story, though, takes place elsewhere: in Guantanamo, away from the CIA program that the report covers. The 6,000 pages of the Senate report are just the start of what Americans have to accept happened in their name.It starts and ends in the silence of a tiny, freezing cold cell, alone. That's when you hold yourself in a ball, and fight to ignore the confusion of what has just happened to you, and the fear of what might be coming next. Or the fear that comes when you realize that no one is coming to help; that the life, family and friends you knew are all far, far away. The cell door opens. The next session, seemingly the 100th in a row. I think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months. Two teams of interrogators running shifts, day and night. Each session begins with shouting, to wake me up. Then they hit me on the face and the back. I am so desperate for sleep, my head is swimming. There are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room. They demand that I identify the individuals, but I can barely focus to see if I might know them. The shouting and the insults get louder, and then they nod to a man in the corner. He injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance. It's the last thing I know. The freezing cold cell. The cell door opens. This time the guards enter, making awful honking noises, like wild animals. I tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me, in protest at all this. The interrogator laughs at me, but then turns angry; he swears loudly, and pours an army meal pack over my head. They tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously. He inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed. Closing Guantanamo: Who's left and what's in the way . The freezing cold cell. The cell door opens. This time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back. I tell the interrogators that I can't face not eating any more. They throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig. They won't let me go to the restroom. They watch as it gets more painful, and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if I pee in my pants. The freezing cold cell. The cell door opens. They make me stand and salute the American flag. I'm in a sort of cinema room, where I have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused. Then they tell me that I have to dance for them, and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains. Every time I try and refuse, they touch me in my most private areas. The freezing cold cell. The cell door opens. It has rained, and there are muddy puddles everywhere. I'm shackled, so I can't really walk; they deliberately drag me through the muddy puddles. Now it's the pornography room. Awful pictures everywhere. There is one with a man and a donkey. I'm stripped naked and have my beard shaved, in a gratuitous insult to my religion. I'm shown pornographic pictures of women. I'm told to make the noises of different animals, and when I refuse, they just hit me. It ends with them pouring cold water all over me. Hours later in my cell, I am discovered, nearly frozen. The doctor tells them to bring me urgently to the clinic, where I am given a blanket and treatment. Over the next hours, they observe me as I warm up. They are just waiting for the moment that they can sign off on my return to interrogation. Four years ago, six U.S. government security agencies sat together and reviewed my case. Their conclusion? That I was innocent of any crime and should be released. The dirty and sadistic methods I endured -- which were then taken directly to Abu Ghraib -- achieved nothing, except to shame that American flag hanging in the prison corridor, which I was made to salute. One hundred and thirty-six prisoners are still being held at Guantanamo, whilst the politicians squabble over how to black out the Senate report.

"A Senate report delivered a scathing indictment Tuesday of torture policies that officially ended when President Barack Obama came into office, but another holdover from the Bush-era war on terrorism is keeping Obama tethered to the previous administration. Nearly six years after Obama signed an executive order on his third day in office to begin the process of shutting down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, 136 prisoners remain in military custody on the U.S. naval base, despite the release of six more prisoners just this week. About 100 have been released since 2009. Obama may have ended the CIA's torture program, but his administration has yet to come close to shutting down Guantanamo, which has become an international symbol of U.S. abuses in the post-9/11 war on terror. And the torture report's release prompted a nearly 13-year detainee of the notorious prison to recount the severe mistreatment he endured, writing in a CNN Opinion column that the report is ""just the start of what Americans have to accept happened in their name."" Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel, a Yemeni man accused of serving in Osama bin Laden's security detail, described conditions at Guantanamo that included the repeated, seemingly incessant interrogations he faced at the hands of U.S. officials. Also on this story: My treatment shames American flag . The abuses alleged by the prisoner are similar to those outlined in the Senate report, which focused on the interrogations of detainees held in secret overseas facilities in the years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Naji listed sleep deprivation, humiliation and beatings -- abuses similar to those described as ""tantamount to torture"" in a 2004 International Committee of the Red Cross report leaked to The New York Times. Naji also described the painful force-feeding he has been subjected to as he and as many as 100 other prisoners have engaged in hunger strikes to protest their continued detention without charge. CNN could not independently verify the claims made in Naji's editorial piece. When contacted by CNN, the National Security Council said it would not comment on individual claims such as Naji's. The abuses asserted by Naji were also suffered by other detainees at Guantanamo, said Tom Wilner, an attorney who has represented Guantanamo detainees in two cases that went before the U.S. Supreme Court. ""Cold cells, uncomfortable positions, beating them up, making them pee in their pants, the sexual taunting -- it was all within the range of what was done to many of them,"" said Wilner, who represented 12 Kuwaitis detained in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2004. Guantanamo Fast Facts . His clients also spoke of the pornography room that Naji mentions in his column, Wilner said. Naji said he was forced to view pornographic images of women and men, as his interrogators stripped him of his clothes. ""I've heard worse. I've heard that they had women come in and touch them, which for Muslim men is a terrible thing,"" said Wilner, who has visited Gitmo 14 times. An international human rights legal group representing Naji and several other Guantanamo detainees contends that the abuses were common. ""Almost every one of my clients has reported identical treatment to what Samir details in this piece,"" said Alka Pradhan, counterterrorism counsel for Reprieve US, an international human rights nongovernmental organization headquartered in London. Reprieve represents a total of 10 Guantanamo detainees, including nationals from Yemen, Pakistan, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, Pradhan said. Pradhan, however, wasn't involved in the preparation of Naji's op-ed, which is written in Naji's words, she said. Some of the abuses continue, Pradhan charged. ""They are still in freezing cells, they still have problems with food, and they are still being treated roughly or hit by the guards,"" she said. ""Recently, this past summer, (the detainees) had incredibly invasive genital searches"" whenever they left their cells to receive a phone call or meet with their attorneys, said Pradhan, who has visited Gitmo three times. ""Some of them felt they were being penetrated,"" she said of the searches. ""It's just that the torture continues in different forms, but as long as the government applies this secrecy to Guantanamo Bay, we won't find out until years after the fact."" Guantanamo Bay: What happens when detainees held for years get out? Guantanamo detainees -- of which there have been nearly 800 -- were allegedly tortured at the site, drawing widespread international condemnation from human rights and civil liberties advocates who decried the interrogation techniques and the U.S. authority to detain the suspected terrorists without charges. Nearly all Guantanamo prisoners are being held without charges, and while about half of those are considered high-level threat detainees, the remainder were determined to be low-level threats by a task force of top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Those in the latter group could gain their freedom, provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries. Security concerns have set back and stalled the shuttering of the notorious facility, and the release of Guantanamo prisoners has drummed up serious opposition in Congress on both sides of the aisle. In December 2010, Congress amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any Guantanamo detainees to the United States. That defeated the Obama administration's plans announced a year earlier to try several Guantanamo detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in U.S. federal court. Among those, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a mastermind of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, was slated to be flown to New York to face trial in federal court. ISIS Fast Facts . The 2010 legislation also banned Obama from using federal funds to build a detention facility to house the Guantanamo detainees on U.S. soil under existing authority. U.S. officials have defended the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists without trial or charges as legitimate under laws of war, saying that Congress' 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force against al Qaeda allows the United States to detain those enemy combatants until the fight against al Qaeda -- and associated groups like ISIS -- ends. It is of course unclear when that fight could or would reach an official conclusion. But members of Congress continue to oppose the release of Guantanamo detainees -- even those considered low-level threats -- because of the risk that they could engage in terrorism against the United States. About 17% of the total of 620 detainees released from Guantanamo -- most during President George W. Bush's presidency -- have since engaged in terrorist activities, according to the September 2014 semiannual report from the director of national intelligence. Another 12% are suspected of engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. Even if all the detainees recommended for release by the interagency task force are transferred out of Guantanamo, about 69 detainees would remain, according to The New York Times. ""So we're stuck with Guantanamo,"" Pradhan said. ""Now, we're in a hole. ""I tend to be a pessimist about it. No matter what the President continues to say, I don't think this is his priority anymore,"" she added. Those detainees include Mohammed and a handful of others slated for trial under the military commission system, as well as dozens who are considered serious high-level threats but could not be tried and convicted -- and that legal limbo is the ultimate conundrum Obama faces as he looks to make good on a long-overdue campaign promise to close the facility before his term ends. And while just four Guantanamo detainees were released under Leon Panetta's 2011-2013 tenure as defense secretary, Obama renewed his commitment to closing the prison in 2013. Since then, 30 prisoners have been transferred to other countries under Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's tenure, The New York Times reported. Those included five mid- to high-level Taliban militants who were released from Guantanamo this spring in exchange for the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was being held by Taliban forces in Afghanistan. And the specter of ISIS has stoked more fears in Washington that former detainees could attack the United States or Americans abroad if freed. Case in point: The U.S. military released Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was captured in 2004 and held at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in Iraq. He was released later that year. He went on to become the leader of ISIS and is the self-declared caliph of the so-called Islamic State.","The U.S. needs to find a destination for Guantanamo's 136 prisoners to shutter facility .

"Germany refused to share the debt burden of stressed eurozone peers on Tuesday, ignoring two of the most influential international economic bodies which offered support for proposals championed by Paris, Rome and Brussels ahead of a summit. Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, has argued that any co-mingling of eurozone debt would remove incentives for southern economies to adopt structural reforms. The calls from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development came on the eve of Wednesday's EU summit. François Hollande, France's new president, has strongly backed common eurozone bonds -- which would ease funding constraints for the eurozone's stressed periphery but potentially raise German borrowing costs by diluting its creditworthiness across the currency union. German officials made clear the idea was a non-starter in Berlin. ""There is no way of introducing them under the current [EU] treaties. Indeed, there is an explicit ban on them,"" one senior German official said, adding Berlin would not drop its opposition in the foreseeable future. ""That's a firm conviction which will not change in June."" Increased jitters over how Europe's banking system would be affected by an exit of Greece from the eurozone have lent urgency to the latest discussions over measures to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. OECD: Euro crisis could derail recovery . Mr Hollande has vowed to raise eurozone bonds at the informal summit. He won backing from the OECD, which in its twice-yearly economic outlook specifically called for such bonds, saying they were needed to break a vicious circle ""involving high and rising sovereign indebtedness, weak banking systems, excessive fiscal consolidation and lower growth."" ""We need to get on the path towards the issuance of euro bonds sooner rather than later,"" Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD chief economist, told the Financial Times. Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, also called for more burden-sharing. Though she stopped short of explicitly backing euro bonds, she said ""more needs to be done, particularly by way of fiscal liability sharing"" -- a thinly veiled reference to such debt instruments. Diplomats said the summit, which just last week looked like it would be a highly scripted affair on European growth, had become increasingly unpredictable, with leaders struggling with how to respond to the havoc wreaked by political instability in Greece. Officials emphasised that no formal decisions would be taken. The euro bonds debate could produce fireworks between Mr Hollande and Ms Merkel -- a possibility that has captivated officials involved, given the comparatively harmonious Franco-German relationship in the latter years of Nicolas Sarkozy's tenure. But most diplomats believe Ms Merkel would succeed in blocking any proposal, producing more smoke than fire. ""They say that when Germany and France don't co-operate, we have a problem,"" one senior diplomat from a smaller EU country said. ""And when they do, we have a problem, too."" Of more urgent concern are ongoing discussions over eurozone banks, with officials saying the fear of a Greek eurozone exit has forced leaders to contemplate massive rescues, particularly in Spain. Rising estimates of bad loans have forced Madrid to part-nationalise one bank and face the increasing likelihood it will need to inject more government money into others. Senior EU officials question whether Madrid, which has faced rising bond market borrowing costs, has the financial wherewithal on its own, spurring a furious series of negotiations over whether the eurozone needs to move quickly towards a common bailout and deposit guarantee scheme. Although officials said such reforms have pushed themselves onto tonight's agenda, it remains unlikely any can be agreed quickly, making the European Central Bank the last line of defence if Greece forces more immediate action.","Germany refused to share the debt burden of stressed eurozone peers .

"(CNN) -- Former members of a Guatemalan special forces unit are believed to have been involved in the killings of 27 people on a farm in a northern province, the country's president said. President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that the former members of the Kaibiles, as the military group is known, had a hand in the massacre that led to a state of siege being declared in the province of Peten. Authorities have blamed the killings on the Zetas Mexican drug cartel, which has been linked before to the Kaibiles. On Tuesday, authorities released details about one suspect who has been arrested in connection with the murders. Hugo Alvaro Gomez Vasquez, also known as ""the Witch,"" has a strong relationship with the Zetas, the state-run AGN news service reported. He was picked up on a triple murder charge related to the mass killings in Peten, officials said. He is accused of kidnapping and killing three people related to the owner of the farm where the 27 bodies were found. Investigators did not say if he was directly linked to the 27 dead. Authorities have sent eight teams into the field, consisting of 25 investigators, to try to shed light on the murders. The killing spree, which officials said took place late Saturday into early Sunday, is one of the nation's worst since the end of the civil war in 1996. The killers decapitated several victims and left their body parts strewn across the terrain, police said. Colom called the killings ""sadistic and perverse."" Survivors who described the killing spree included a pregnant woman who said she covered her daughters and begged for mercy, Guatemala's Prensa Libre reported. The woman said the group that attacked the farm consisted of more than 50 armed men in fatigues, who had Mexican accents.","The president says that ex-Kaibiles are believed to be involved in the killings .

"(CNN)French hostage Serge Lazarevic has been freed after being held for more than three years in Mali by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, French President Francois Hollande announced Tuesday. Lazarevic was captured on November 24, 2011, in Hombori in central Mali and subsequently held in the Sahel. His release means that there are no longer any French hostages held anywhere in the world, Hollande said in remarks broadcast by CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Lazarevic will travel to Niamey in Niger before heading on to France, Hollande said in a statement issued by his office. ""He is relatively healthy, despite the very harsh conditions of his long captivity. He will be quickly repatriated to France,"" the President said. No details have yet been given of how Lazarevic's freedom was secured, but Hollande said discussions had been under way for months, with the involvement of authorities in Niger and Mali. Hollande thanked them for their help and said he shared in the joy of Lazarevic's family at the news of his release. He also saluted the memory of Lazarevic's fellow captive Philippe Verdon, who was abducted with him but slain by his captors several months ago. Lazarevic's release, which comes only days after a failed U.S. military raid in Yemen ended with the deaths of two hostages held by al Qaeda, has prompted wide French media speculation that a prisoner swap was involved. The French consistently deny that they pay ransoms in hostage takings, but they have been remarkably successful at freeing hostages by nonmilitary means. Lawmaker Alain Marsaud, of the opposition UMP party, told BFMTV that he had no doubt that a ransom had been paid for Lazarevic through the freeing of prisoners held in Mali or Niger. ""There's not one French person who believes for one instant that Mr. Lazarevic has been freed just to please Mr. Hollande,"" he said. Marsaud, a former anti-terrorism judge, said he preferred the French position to the American approach, which ends with hostages being assassinated. Lawmaker Bruno Le Roux, leader of the governing Socialist Party's majority in the French National Assembly, was asked on BFMTV whether France had paid a ransom. He replied, ""I ... it is not the strategy of the French state to pay a ransom. But our strategy is to never abandon our hostages, and so to ensure that links with the local authorities are established, with all those who can help us in freeing them."" It's not the first time this year that France has welcomed home freed hostages. Four French journalists -- Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Didier Francois and Edouard Elias -- were released in Syria in April, after being held for months by Islamist militants. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius insisted that France had not paid a ransom, Radio France Internationale reported at the time. CNN's Laura Akhoun, Jim Bittermann and Marion Lory in Paris contributed to this report.","Hostage's release prompts speculation that the French may have done a deal .

"Two bombs explosions at a market in the central Nigerian city of Jos left 32 people dead, a government agency reported, marking the latest instance of violence to hit the volatile region. Nigeria's state broadcaster NTA reported the explosions took place Thursday at the terminus area of the Jos market. According to Mohammed Adams, a security guard there, a young man walked into the market with a small cart claiming he was carrying yams. He kept moving before detonating one device, killing at least two people. People chased him, but couldn't stop him before he managed to blow himself up, Adams said. The security guard initially told CNN that at least 12 people were dead. On Friday, Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency said that the bomb blasts killed 32 people and injured 45 others. It was not immediately clear if the bomber was among those counted as dead. Located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of Abuja, the nation's capital, Jos is in an area that has been beset by violence in recent years. Much of that fighting has pitted Nigerian troops against Boko Haram, the Islamist terror group trying to impose its strict version of Sharia law across the African nation. Citizens have repeatedly been caught up in the mayhem such as mass kidnappings of women and children as well as bombings of schools, churches and mosques blamed on Boko Haram. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack. However, Boko Haram has been tied to violence in Jos before, including a double car-bombing at the same market in May that killed 118 people.","32 dead, 45 injured in bomb blasts in Jos, Nigerian emergency agency says .

"French troops killed a senior jihadist leader in northern Mali -- a man purportedly behind a number of high-profile attacks and kidnappings, and ambitious and brazen enough that the United States had issued a $5 million reward for him -- the French military announced Thursday. Ahmed el Tilemsi was the military head and co-founder of a jihadist group called the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, one of several jihadist groups active in the region. The U.S. government designated el Tilemsi a terrorist in December 2012 and offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to him. He was killed Wednesday night in a French military operation, which was coordinated with Malian forces, in the Gao region in Mali, French military officials said. ""One of the things that proves he was a senior chief (in the group) is that when he got killed ... he was accompanied by a dozen (fighters) who were also ensuring his security,"" French Defense Ministry spokesman Sacha Mandel said. About 10 suspected terrorists were ""neutralized"" -- which means killed or taken captive, according to the French military -- in the same operation, said Col. Gilles Jaron, another French military spokesman. Mali is a former French colony. According to the U.S. State Department, el Tilemsi was among the militants who in September 2011 broke off from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- another terrorist group -- to form the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa. A month later, the group, also known as MUJWA, abducted three aid workers from a refugee camp in western Algeria. The U.S. government blames the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa for an attack on a police base in Tamanrasset, Algeria, and another in Ouargla, Algeria, as well as the kidnapping of seven Algerian diplomats -- incidents that all occurred in 2012. The State Department described el Tilemsi, a Malian born in 1977, as MUJWA's military chief, adding that he directly took part in the October 2011 kidnappings in western Algeria. Before that, as a member of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, he took part in the abduction of two French nationals in the Niger city of Niamey, the U.S. government said.","French troops conduct an operation in northern Mali, coordinating with Malian forces .

"A British court sentenced a 35-year-old woman Thursday to more than five years in prison for using Facebook to promote terrorism -- including urging other women to send their husbands off ""to fight for the sake of Allah"" and saying she looked forward to the day her young son could join them. Runa Khan was arrested in her hometown of Luton, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of London, last December, and she pleaded guilty to four counts of distributing terrorist publications more than seven months later. Her sentencing occurred Thursday in Kingston Crown Court, the Metropolitan Police Service said. The four counts relate to four different specific Facebook posts posted by Khan, under the name Khawla Khattab, according to police. One, from late July 2013, shows a suicide vest with the words ""sacrificing your life to benefit Islam."" Another gives details to another person online about how to go from Turkey to Syria -- a common route for would-be jihadists looking to join groups like ISIS, the Islamist extremist group that has used brutal tactics against nonbelievers while taking vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. In a message posted September 18, 2013, Khan speaks directly to her fellow women. ""Dear sisters,"" she writes, ""if you love your sons, your husbands and your brothers, prove it by sending them to fight for the sake of Allah. ""Don't you want them to enter jannah"" -- an Islamic concept of eternal paradise -- ""without reckoning?"" Khan adds. ""Don't you want them to prepare for you a palace in jannah?"" On that same day, Khan reposted an article headlined ""Sisters' role in jihad off the battlefield"" that suggests that mothers introduce very young children to target shooting as a way of training them for jihad. ""There are two main reasons why sisters themselves also need to get military training,"" the article adds. ""Firstly, so they can participate in jihad themselves. And secondly, so they can train their sons and daughters for it."" Detectives also uncovered other Facebook postings, like one complaining about Muslims who condemned the 2013 murder of British soldier Lee Rigby near a barracks in southeast London. Cellphone footage from right after the attack shows one of the now-convicted murderers, Michael Adebolajo, ranting that the killing was ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" for British soldiers' killing of Muslims overseas. And in late September 2013, Khan posted a comment on Facebook that said, ""Zipping up my 8 year old boys jacket as he wants to play outside for a bit. I pictured the future while I was zipping up his jacket, inshallah"" -- which translates to ""if God is willing"" -- ""I'll be tying the shahada bandana round his forehead and hand him his rifle and send him out to play the big boys game. Allahu Akbar."" Cmdr. Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counterterrorism command, said in a statement that Khan used social media to ""spread extremism, radicalise others and justify children being used for terrorism."" Her case is one of many related to terrorism that British authorities have pursued in recent years. ""We aim to make the internet a more hostile environment for terrorists,"" Walton added. ""Today's sentence supports that aim.""","A British woman, 35, was arrested last year because of her posts on Facebook .

So many have impaled themselves on fishhooks, that for wildlife activist Sharon Schmalz it's a record. ""I've been here 30 years and [have] never seen this many in such a short time."" The birds have been punctured by multiple hooks. ""Every one had two to four to five hooks in them,"" she said. Wildlife veterinarians in Houston have extracted the barbs out of eyes, bills, midsections and untangled fishing line from 38 birds in the last three days. And five more are on their way to treatment at the Wildlife Center of Texas. ""There are going to be some we have to do surgery on.  It's pretty intense; it's a lot like a MASH unit,"" Schmalz said. And there are many more birds flailing near Galveston's Pier 14, Schmalz said. Wildlife officials and police are investigating to find out why so many of them are impaling themselves on so many hooks. For one, their numbers on land are on a seasonal rise. When winter sets in, hunger drives young birds ashore. ""It's colder and hard to find food,"" Schmalz says. They also gravitate toward fishing boats in search of an easy meal: caught fish and fishing bait. But the gouging spate is not the norm. Winters are usually slow for the center's medical unit, where seven veterinarians work, but the fishhooks have them busy around the clock, the center said on its Facebook page. Wildlife educators are working to inform fishermen about the problem. Many of the pelicans are already weakened before getting stabbed by the hooks; they are emaciated and have parasites. Many are unable to eat for extended periods and are dehydrated.","So many fishhook impalings are a record of sorts for wildlife activist in Texas .

"A suspected Islamic militant who was detained in Afghanistan in 2001, imprisoned at the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but later acquitted at trial in Spain, is again facing a trial in Madrid on new charges. The suspect, Moroccan national Lahcen Ikassrien, has been indicted, along with 14 other suspected militants, on charges of recruiting and sending militants to help ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria. Investigating magistrate Pablo Ruz at Spain's National Court, which handles terrorism cases, issued the indictments on Tuesday, which were made public Thursday, and CNN viewed a copy. Ikassrien, who is in his late 40s, was arrested last June in Madrid, where he lives. He is the suspected ""charismatic leader of the organization,"" and was ""the determining factor"" for recruits, providing them with ""cover and international contacts,"" Judge Ruz wrote. The Madrid-based cell had contacts with militants in Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, France and Belgium, the magistrate alleges in a 102-page indictment order, which sets the case for trial before a panel of judges. No trial date has been set. In 2003, a different judge at the National Court, in a separate indictment, repeatedly cited Ikassrien and said he had been recruited earlier to go to Afghanistan by a Syrian-born man, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, who was later convicted of being al Qaeda's leader in Spain. After Ikassrien's capture in Afghanistan by U.S. forces in 2001, he was sent to Guantanamo, but then extradited to Spain in 2005. He was acquitted in 2006 of charges he was a member of a terrorist group. At trial he had argued that he was tortured while a prisoner at Guantanamo. In this case, Ikassrien and the 14 other defendants are charged with membership in a terrorist group. If convicted, they face up to 12 years in prison, the judge wrote. Spain's interior minister said earlier this year that about 50 militants have left Spain to assist ISIS, or ISIL, the extremist group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. Security officials have expressed particular concern about these or other Islamic militant fighters returning from combat zones to Spain and other Western countries, and potentially carrying out attacks.","Lahcen Ikassrien has been indicted, along with 14 other suspected militants .

"(CNN)The long investigation surrounding a mysterious battery fire that made so much trouble for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner is closed. The National Transportation Safety Board report -- released December 1 -- comes nearly two years after burning and smoking batteries grounded all 50 of the world's most advanced airliners flying at the time. When you pick apart the 110-page document, it reveals how any new piece of equipment can pose dangerous problems, even a noncritical piece of equipment like batteries. In this situation, the battery created one of the worst threats possible: an onboard fire. From a broader perspective, the investigation reminds us of the heavy responsibilities shared by the world's aviation regulators and aircraft makers. The battery problems struck Boeing shortly after it had rolled out what was then a new model aircraft, with some of the most sophisticated technology available. It all started in January 2013, when an empty Japan Airlines 787 caught fire while parked at Boston's Logan Airport. A second battery incident nine days later in Japan prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to ground the entire Dreamliner fleet while the problem was fixed. Read more about the battery . Now, with more than 200 Dreamliners in service, the FAA says safer battery systems have been installed in the planes. The NTSB basically blamed the battery problem on two things: . --Overheating from an electrical short circuit that may have been caused by manufacturing defects . --Allegedly unsatisfactory oversight of the manufacturing process by both the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing . Read the full NTSB report (PDF) on the battery fire . To bring the investigation into sharper focus, here are eight questions and answers associated with the report: . 1. What was the root cause of the short circuit? It's remarkable: The investigation was unable to pinpoint the root cause of the battery cell short-circuit. Neither could Japanese investigators, although they had a theory. 2. How closely does the FAA monitor the development of aviation technology? The FAA allows Boeing and other qualified manufacturers to use their own employees to confirm that new aircraft components meet safety regulations. They follow specific FAA guidelines and submit to regular checks by FAA officials. Experts say more and more of that self-checking oversight is moving further down the supply chain to subcontractors. NTSB investigators recommended that both the FAA and Boeing ""develop or revise processes to establish more effective oversight"" of suppliers. The report also called on the Dreamliner's Japan-based battery maker, GS Yuasa Corp., to ""review its cell manufacturing processes and ensure its employees are properly trained."" Kenneth Quinn, a Washington-based attorney who represents the battery maker, said this week that ""GS Yuasa had respectfully disagreed with a number of the observations NTSB made regarding manufacturing defects."" He said the company is studying the report and is ""eager to implement continuous quality improvements with the suggestions of the NTSB, FAA"" and Japan's aviation regulators. 3. How did all this get started? The battery, like those aboard all Dreamliners, was a lithium-ion battery, a technology that airline manufacturers like as a way to save fuel costs because of its low weight. Lithium-ion batteries also power cell phones and laptops. It's a developing technology that has a history of overheating issues. Related: Watch video of the 787 that caught fire in 2013 . Related: 787 Dreamliner infographic . The FAA had already certified these batteries as safe and flight worthy. Apparently they weren't. Passenger safety and billions of dollars in Boeing aircraft orders were at risk. Officials needed to know what went wrong. That's why the FAA did something next that it hadn't done in more than 30 years: It grounded an entire type of airliner, nationwide. For about four months Dreamliners sat idle. To fix the problem, each battery was put inside a fireproof steel box to prevent the battery from catching fire. Just in case, the box includes vents that would force any smoke outside the plane. More insulation against heat was also added, and the batteries were redesigned to charge at lower levels. In the 19 months since the Dreamliner fix, there have been no reports of batteries catching fire, although a 787 battery cell did overheat while on the ground earlier this year. ""The improvements made to the 787 battery system last year appear to have worked as designed,"" Boeing told Flightglobal in a statement at the time. Related: Beacon blamed for London Dreamliner fire . 4. Could it happen again? Boeing and the battery maker say no. Theoretically, if another Dreamliner battery short-circuits and overheats, the system will remain safe because there won't be enough oxygen in the containment box for a fire to be possible, a Boeing spokeswoman said. Does that make the battery maker comfortable with the fact that the root cause of the short-circuit remains a mystery? ""GS Yuasa is very comfortable in knowing that the quality of the manufacturing processes and the redesign of the battery will prevent a situation from occurring as it did in the Boston and Japanese incidents,"" said Quinn. 5. How important are these batteries, anyway? They're necessary, but they have backups in case they fail. The batteries are used only before take-off to power up the cockpit computer and to start the plane's auxiliary power unit. (That's the thing that fires up the 787's two jet engines.) After takeoff -- unless there's a power failure -- these batteries are not in use because electricity to run onboard equipment is generated by the engines. Even if there is a power failure -- which is highly unlikely -- there are other ways pilots can create electrical power to run the 787's steering and other systems. For example, small wind turbines -- called ram air turbines, or RATs -- that pop out of the aircraft to generate juice via wind power. 6. Will Boeing and the FAA develop a more effective process to oversee suppliers? Boeing says it did that already, before the NTSB report. The company said it now has a ""more formal flow of requirements and increased interaction between Boeing, its suppliers and sub-tier suppliers as compared to the processes in place earlier."" The FAA said it also has ""effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification"" of the 787. But it also said it's still evaluating the NTSB recommendations ""and will provide a timely response to the board."" 7. Do airliner manufactures plan to use lithium-ion batteries on new aircraft models? They do. Immediately after the Dreamliner's troubles, Boeing competitor Airbus announced it was pulling lithium-ion batteries from early production models of its new A350 aircraft and going with traditional -- and heavier -- nickel cadmium batteries. But in September Airbus did a 180. It said it planned to switch back to lithium-ion batteries on A350s set to be delivered in 2016. Airbus' chief designer told Bloomberg the company can ""mitigate any risks to zero."" Boeing said this week it would decide whether to use lithium-ion batteries in new planes ""on a case-by-case basis."" 8. Were there any surprises in the report? Yes: a random, unrelated problem with a new type of cockpit voice recorder. The report revealed that a new recorder on the Japan Airlines Dreamliner didn't record voices very well, a situation that ""could impede future aircraft investigations,"" the NTSB said. Almost all crew conversations recorded by the cockpit voice recorder were ""completely obscured"" by ambient cockpit noise, according to the report. The FAA should require Boeing to improve the quality of the audio on the recording device, the NTSB said. Boeing said it's still examining the NTSB recommendations. Overall, for aviation enthusiasts and fans of the Dreamliner, the report offered a mountain of insider data about the popular aircraft. As Quinn, the GS Yuasa attorney, put it, ""I think we can all rest assured that this is the most investigated battery incident, ever.""","Investigation ends into 2013 lithium-ion battery fire on Boeing 787 Dreamliner .

"(CNN) -- Ebola, ISIS and Ferguson grabbed the headlines in 2014, but there is another huge story that should not be overlooked. Historians could look back on this year as the beginning of feminism's third wave. The year was momentous for feminism. For the first time, rape victims and their supporters emerged from the shadows in significant numbers and started naming names -- to significant effect. Women, their voices amplified by social media and with the support of a small but growing cohort of men, have been exposing and shaming venerable American institutions such as the NFL, Ivy League and non-Ivy League colleges, and the entertainment icon Bill Cosby. First wave feminists won the right to vote. The second wave got us the right to work. But even with those advances, women have remained fundamentally restricted by the threat and terrible secret of sexual assault. This year, emboldened and connected by social media, college women formed a powerful grassroots movement that led to universities such as Harvard being publicly named and shamed for not addressing women's rape reports. They brought the issue of campus sexual assault into the White House, where Barack Obama became the first President to use the words ""sexual violence."" The Department of Education released a list of universities under investigation for mishandling sexual violence cases, often letting even repeat predators off with barely a slap on the wrist. These young women had been silent until social media enabled them to come together, even though thousands of miles apart, share debilitating secrets and then act with the confidence that safety in numbers provided. Last week's back-pedaling on the Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity house is an unfortunate example of reporting gone wrong. But it is also a teachable moment about why feminism's third wave is so important: We must make it easier for more women to put their names and faces on their accusations and eradicate the stigma and fear that silences victims. Only when these stories come fully out of the shadows can we assess their validity and see justice done. Cosby's accusers, with their remarkably similar stories of being drugged and assaulted, were also ""heard"" for the first time in 2014, even though many had individually come forward in the pages of national media years ago. Barbara Bowman, a Phoenix artist and mother who was one of Cosby's early accusers, told me that being a rape victim ""is the most shameful, scary, intimidating, filthy place to live. It is a place of darkness and fear."" The bravery of the Cosby accusers and the college women alone is not the only encouraging sign. The public revelations of domestic violence rocking the National Football League, amplified by an elevator video of Ray Rice cold-cocking his fiancee, are another. The NFL dropped the ball on punishing Rice but now is being shamed into paying attention to behavior that it used to ignore and enable. Men are starting to get it. In an article after the latest Cosby scandal, the essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote that he regretted not having paid attention to the women in 2008, when he penned a seminal piece on Cosby. ""I have never been raped,"" Coates wrote. ""But I have, several times as a child, been punched/stomped/kicked/bum-rushed while walking home from school, and thus lost my body. The worst part for me was not the experience, but the humiliation of being unable to protect my body, which is all I am, from predators."" Every alleged image or videotape of a rape and beating that goes viral, every woman coming forward with a Cosby story and every college freshman reporting her rapist form a collective alarm bell waking up the silent majority of Americans who would never call themselves ""feminist"" and yet who abhor sexual violence against women. Rape culture holds all women down, whether soldiers or CEOs or college freshmen or high school girls who drank too much out in blue-collar Ohio or backcountry Oklahoma. My generation of women, who came of age in the 1980s, did not really carry forward the banner of feminism. We took advantage of the gains of the 1970s, getting good jobs and having children and then got so busy having it all that we had no time left over. And it was terribly important to fit in, to be one of the guys, to fly under the radar as women. The last thing we wanted was to be labeled as victims, to wear the humiliation of being prey. I'm in awe of the young women on campuses who have stood up and made it OK to tell the world what happened to them, in their dark places, in the dark of night. Thanks to their courage, more and more Americans are understanding every day that the shame of sexual assault is a burden that belongs on the predators, not the prey.","Nina Burleigh: 2014 marked start of feminism's third wave -- rape victims speaking out .

"After more than a decade on the sidelines of the international community, Serbia has emerged from a long and troubled history to become one of Europe's newest republics. Sitting at the crossroads of central and southern Europe -- and often seen as a geographical region that straddles both eastern and western Europe -- Serbia has been at the center of some of Europe's bloodiest conflicts. Invaded by the Ottoman Turks in 1459, one of the catalysts for World War I in 1914 and, most recently, the diminishing hub of a rump Yugoslavia as the former communist nation tore itself apart in a bitter civil war, Serbia only emerged as an independent republic in 2006 after a referendum in Montenegro that ended the last vestige of the Yugoslav federation. With the secession of Montenegro, Serbia lost its coast and remains one of nine landlocked countries in Europe. Its population is now a little over 7 million people. End of the union . The end of the Union of Serbia and Montenegro was the last move in the bitter dissolution of the six republics that once formed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that also included Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Formed in 1945 under strongman Josip Tito, the authoritarian Croatian-born dictator forced an uneasy alliance amid the ethnically diverse Balkan states by keeping strong, central control over the army and police. When he died in 1980, the Yugoslav Federation continued until the early 1990s but began to fall apart under the leadership of Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic. Slovenia and Macedonia were the first to secede and left the Yugoslav federation with relatively little bloodshed. (The 10-day War in 1991 with Slovenia was a low-intensity conflict that claimed the lives of 19 Slovenians and 44 members of the Yugoslav forces.) Conflict escalates . However, conflicts in neighboring Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo between 1991 and 1999, all states with sizable Serbian minorities, were more intense, leaving upwards of 140,000 people dead and millions displaced. Belgrade led military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs into the long-held nationalist idea of a Greater Serbia. Neighboring states, meanwhile, fought to create new nation states outside the Yugoslav federation. In 1998, violence erupted in the autonomous province of Kosovo in Serbia when the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army rebelled against Serbian rule. Amid mounting pressure on Milosevic, NATO forces unleashed airstrikes on Kosovo and Serbia in 1999. The conflict created a crisis in the region as ethnic Albanians sought refuge in neighboring countries. When Serb forces were eventually driven out, the United Nations administered the region. U.N. talks on the future of the province broke down in 2007, and Kosovo declared independence in 2008 despite Serbian opposition. Kosovo remains only partially recognized within the European Union. Economic realities . Since the dark days of the Yugoslav conflict, Serbia has sought to find equilibrium for an economy that was subject to years of mismanagement under the post-Yugoslavia Milosevic regime, suffered infrastructure damage during NATO bombings in 1999 and endured extended economic sanctions during the Yugoslav conflict. Despite embracing market reforms after the fall of Milosevic in 2000, many of the country's largest enterprises (including its gas, telecommunications and power utilities) remain in state hands, and high unemployment and stagnant household incomes remain persistent political and economic problems. Levels of youth unemployment in 2012 were at a record 51.1%, according to the CIA World Factbook, ranking it seventh in the world and only marginally better than South Africa, Greece and Bosnia Herzegovina. While the most recent jobless figures show an overall fall to over 20%, a historic high of 25% in 2012 ranked the country only slightly better than Sudan and Gaza in terms of joblessness. European reintegration . After years of isolation during the Yugoslav conflict, Serbia has begun reintegrating into the international community. It rejoined the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as it emerged from the heavily state-controlled economy under Milosevic. While high levels of corruption, an inefficient judicial system and an aging population remain challenges to Serbia's progress, it has the advantage of a skilled labor force, a strategic location at the center of Europe and free trade agreements with the EU, Russia and Turkey as well as member states in the Central European Free Trade Agreement. Despite a pro-Western government under current President Tomislav Nikolic, Serbia has historically been a strong ally of Russia, which supported the state during its opposition to Kosovan independence. Russia not only signed a major energy deal with Serbia in 2008, but ties were further strengthened in 2009 when Russia provided it with a 1 billion-euro ($1.4 billion in 2009) loan to help it overcome a sharp downturn triggered by the global financial crisis. Nikolic's stated aim is to develop ties with both the European Union and its traditional ally Russia. While it is a candidate to join the European Union, it is widely considered that it will not be ready for accession until 2020.","Serbia emerged as an independent republic in 2006 .

"Jerusalem (CNN)This much is certain: Ziyad Abu Ein, a senior Palestinian Authority official, died after a confrontation with Israeli troops. But a day after his death, the two sides continued to offer contrasting accounts of what killed him. Palestinians say that autopsy results show that Abu Ein died from a harsh blow to his diaphragm and lungs -- that excessive use of force, in conjunction with the inhalation of tear gas, were contributing factors. Palestinian Minister of Civil Affairs Hussein al-Sheikh told the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency on Thursday that doctors from Palestinian territories, Jordan and Israel participated in the autopsy. He said that while Israeli doctors admitted the results, they did not sign the medical report. On the other hand, a preliminary autopsy report issued by the Israeli government said Abu Ein's death was caused by a blockage of the coronary artery because of hemorrhaging. Stress could have caused the bleeding, the report said, suggesting the poor condition of Abu Ein's heart caused him to be more sensitive to stress. CNN spoke to Dr. Ahmed Bitawi, at the Ramallah medical complex, who ruled out ""99.99%"" that Abu Ein's death was brought on by a heart attack. Bitawi, the director general of the hospital, said the cause of death was asphyxiation; that Abu Ein choked to death on his own vomit brought on by gas inhalation. Clashes with soldiers . Abu Ein died after clashes with Israeli soldiers midday Wednesday in the Palestinian village of Turmusaya, which is northeast of the West Bank city of Ramallah. He was a minister in the Fatah party and head of the Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements, and he was participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international Human Rights Day, longtime chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement. Pictures from various news agencies depict an Israeli soldier with his hands to Abu Ein's neck, followed by another showing him on the ground. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, meanwhile, reported that the Palestinian official lost consciousness after he inhaled tear gas and an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest. ""The Israeli soldiers called Abu Ein by name and seemed to be focused on him,"" witness Kamal Abu Safaka told CNN. ""There was a lot of pushing, kicking and punching by the soldiers. ... When Abu Ein tried to intercede, they hit him on the chest with a rifle butt and grabbed him by the throat and pushed him back and then threw a large amount of tear gas and stun grenades."" Anger and mourning . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will investigate the death. Declaring three days of mourning, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas slammed Abu Ein's death as an ""intolerable barbaric act,"" according to WAFA. ""What happened is a crime by all means, we cannot sit idle and silent (after) this crime,"" he said later on Palestinian television. ""For that, this leadership is meeting now to decide what it wants, and I say honestly all options are open for discussion and for implementation. ... We don't have any other solutions."" On Thursday, thousands of Palestinian mourners marched in Abu Ein's funeral procession as he was taken from the presidential compound to a cemetery.","An autopsy report released by Israel says Ziyad Abu Ein died from a blocked artery .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jordan once summed up his social and political activism in four simple words: ""Republicans buy sneakers, too."" In a world where athletes and celebrities seem more willing to attach their names to high-priced sneakers and headphones than real-world issues, many are thrusting themselves directly into an uncomfortable national debate over police brutality and racial injustice. It's not only people with prominent names; there are medical students, congressional staffers, a university president and even a Northern California police chief. A spate of controversial police slayings of unarmed black men served as the catalyst. But the case of Eric Garner, a New York grandfather who was put in a fatal chokehold by a police officer trying to arrest him for selling cigarettes illegally, has resonated with whites and nonwhites alike. Commentators across the political spectrum have united to condemn last week's decision by a grand jury not to indict white New York Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death, which was captured on a video seen around the globe. According to Pantaleo's lawyer, the officer says he didn't use a chokehold on Garner. The outpouring started in earnest one week before the New York decision, with the long-awaited announcement of a grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson, Missouri, Police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. That decision was met with violent demonstrations in Ferguson and largely peaceful protests throughout the nation. On November 3, five St. Louis Rams players infuriated some people with a silent message before a game against the Oakland Raiders. Stedman Bailey, Tavon Austin, Jared Cook, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt walked onto the field and raised their palms in the air, demonstrating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture protesters in Ferguson had been using for months. Police chief and university president . That groundswell seems to have peaked with the nonindictment in the Garner case. As they warmed up for a game Monday attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were among players wearing T-shirts saying ""I can't breathe"" -- Garner's last words, which have become a rallying cry for protesters. In Los Angeles, the Lakers' Nick Young, Jordan Clarkson, Carlos Boozer, Wayne Ellington and Jeremy Lin donned ""I can't breathe"" shirts on the bench during the first half of an NBA game against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday. The Georgetown University basketball team did the same. In Northern California, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus joined about 100 demonstrators and carried a sign with the popular Twitter hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, according to the Contra Costa Times. At the University of Pennsylvania, protesters crashed university President Amy Gutmann's annual holiday party Tuesday night, according to the university newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian. Gutmann joined the protesters by lying on the floor in a 4Â½ minute ""die-in"" in memory of Brown. Around the nation, medical students on Wednesday staged white-coat ""die-ins,"" organized under the trending Twitter hashtag #WhiteCoats4BlackLives. At the University of Cincinnati, for instance, about 75 medical and pharmacy students held a 20-minute ""die-in"" protest. 'Not Guilty... Not Shocked' In Washington, minority congressional staffers walked off their jobs and gathered on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday with their hands raised to show support for the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association and the Congressional Hispanic Staff Association joined black staffers and the Congressional Black Associates in planning the event. They were joined by Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, who fought to end segregation and racial discrimination in the South in the 1960s. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat and one of two African-Americans in the U.S. Senate, last week posted a column to his Facebook page that he wrote for The Stanford Daily as a university student after the Rodney King verdict in 1992. ""I'm struggling to be articulate, loquacious, positive, constructive, but for the first time in so long, I have lost control of my emotions,"" he wrote then. ""Rage. Frustration. Bitterness. Animosity. Exasperation. Sadness. Emotions once suppressed, emotions once channeled, now are let loose. Why?"" He continued, ""Not Guilty... Not Shocked. I'm a black man. I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and 230 pounds, just like King. Do I scare you? Am I a threat? Does your fear justify your actions? Twelve people believed it did. Black male: Guilty until proven innocent."" After the grand jury decision in the Garner case was announced December 3, Twitter exploded with reaction. Celebrities ranging from musician John Legend to actress Ellen Pompeo expressed shock and disbelief at the failure to indict Pantaleo for Garner's death. Even some commentators on the political right -- such as Noah Rothman of the conservative blog hotair.com and Charles C.W. Cooke of the National Review -- condemned the decision in the Garner case. The case represented ""one of those moments where left and right could unite,"" Rothman wrote. Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, who co-founded Def Jam Records, said Americans have not experienced demonstrations like the ones breaking out almost daily in generations. The failure to get indictments in the Brown, Garner and other racially charged cases was ""like lightning striking the black community over and over and over again."" ""America has not seen protests like those that are coming if justice doesn't start to come down,"" he said. ""We have not begun to engage the young leaders who are waiting to go to work. You haven't seen young people like this in two generations and they haven't even begun. America hasn't seen what's coming.""","Athletes and celebrities, med students and congressional staffers react to Garner case .

"Service had been restored by midday Thursday for tens of thousands of AT&T's U-verse TV, Internet and phone customers after an outage that lasted several days. """"U-verse service has been restored for all customers affected by the outage.,"" AT&T spokeswoman Emily Edmonds told CNN on Thursday. ""We know our customers count on their U-verse service, and we apologize for the inconvenience."" Edmonds said the outage hit ""a limited number of customers"" in the South, some of whom were without service since Monday. The service has roughly 7.4 million subscribers. In all, fewer than 1% of those customers experienced the outage, according to an earlier AT&T statement. The outage was related to a software upgrade, Edmonds said, saying the problem was fixed by AT&T engineers Thursday morning. The service outage did not affect AT&T's landline or wireless service subscribers. User reports on a discussion thread in the AT&T forums spread from Florida to parts of Texas. By Thursday, many of them were reporting that service had returned. Not that it prevented several from venting their frustration.

"At least 50 people have died in Somalia after drinking contaminated water from a well in northern Mogadishu, an official in that East African country said Thursday. Osman Mohamed, the deputy commissioner for Somalia's Yaqshid district, told CNN about the deaths among those who drank from the newly constructed well. More than 150 people who had water from that well were recently hospitalized. Hawo Abdi, a mother of four, told CNN that her 8-year-old child is among those who died after drinking the contaminated water. While access to drinkable water has improved in recent years, it still remains a major and sometimes deadly problem in some places. That's especially true in parts of Africa, and even more so in Somalia, which has some of the lowest rates of water coverage in the world. The United Nations reports that 115 people die every hour in Africa from diseases linked to inferior sanitation, poor hygiene and contaminated water. Of course, available quality drinking water is just one of several pressing issues in Somalia.

"It's known as ""the Titanic of the Golden Gate."" There was a thick morning fog the morning of February 22, 1901, when the SS City of Rio de Janeiro struck jagged rocks at Fort Point near where the Golden Gate Bridge now stands. The name for the famous bridge comes from the Golden Gate Strait, which is the name of the entrance to the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. The ship sank within 10 minutes, killing 128 of the 210 passengers and crew aboard the ship. The ship was filled with mostly Chinese and Japanese emigrants. The U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, who was returning to the United States on leave with his wife and two children, was also on board. The entire family died in the tragedy. Nearby fishermen rescued the survivors clinging to makeshift rafts and flotsam. The shipwreck was the highest loss of life at the Golden Gate, and both the captain (who went down with the ship) and pilot (who survived) were found guilty of gross negligence. Now the first modern images of the ship have been released -- and the detailed sonar pictures and three-dimensional images of City of Rio taken in November are amazing. One of the great maritime mysteries may be solved in Canadian waters . Although salvagers had found the wreck in the 1980s, its exact location was hard to pinpoint during the latest search because the 1980s coordinates didn't match U.S. government sonar data of wrecks in the area. Documenting the shipwreck in 287 feet of dark, muddy water was part of a two-year study by the U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries Maritime Heritage Program. The study is intended to document shipwrecks in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. ""We are undertaking this exploration of the San Francisco Bay in part to learn more about its maritime heritage as well as to test recent advances in technology that will allow us to better protect and understand the rich stories found beneath the Bay's waters,"" said James Delgado, director of maritime heritage for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, in a press release. So far, the agency has mapped nine of nearly 200 ships, including the SS City of Chester, which was rediscovered late last year near the City of Rio. Hibbard Inshore and Bay Marine Services donated a research vessel and crew, and a high-powered remotely operated vehicle, to find and map the City of Rio de Janeiro wreck site using Coda Octopus's three-dimensional Echoscope sonar.","A 1901 San Francisco Bay shipwreck has been found .

"Washington (CNN)Congress is again up against the wire on a bill to avoid a government shutdown. But last-minute brinkmanship, which has become the norm on Capitol Hill, could be in the rear view mirror by Thursday afternoon if House Republicans can find enough Democrats to help them approve a mammoth spending bill. Internal battles among Republicans on spending bills are nothing new. House Speaker John Boehner routinely needs Democrats to help him pass funding bills.  But this time House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn't seem in the mood to help. ""If we don't finish this today, we're going to be hear 'til Christmas,"" Boehner threatened at a Capitol Hill press conference. Democratic and Republican leaders brokered a deal on a $1.1 trillion spending package to fund the government through September and head off a government shutdown, but many liberal Democrats are bailing on the package. Eleventh hour additions of two policy provisions on campaign finance and banking rules have enraged those on the left who now say the bill is a special interest boondoggle. Related: Surprises hidden in spending bill . The final gasp of the lame duck session is also a pivotal moment for Pelosi, who has publicly criticized the bill and called for those two items to be removed. Republican leaders have refused to make any changes.  The top House Democrat has sent strong signals she's vote against the bill, but Democratic leaders weren't officially urging no votes from their members. ""These provisions are destructive to middle class families and to the practice of our democracy,"" Pelosi said Wednesday, making it clear the bill was unacceptable. Securing support from a significant chunk of Democrats is critical for House Speaker John Boehner because many of the conservatives in his party - as many as 60 -- will likely oppose it.  They have insisted the spending bill should try to reverse President Barack Obama's recent executive actions on immigration. GOP leaders opted to postpone the immigration fight until next year, leading members on the right say they'll vote no. Related: Democratic backlash threatens spending deal . It's a gamble for House Democrats if they join unhappy Republicans and take the spending bill down.  If it fails to pass GOP leaders, who have no appetite for a government shutdown, will move quickly to pass a three-month extension of current funding levels for federal agencies.  Those items that Democratic negotiators fought to get included in this legislation -- and the GOP policy changes to gun laws and environmental policies they opposed and blocked -- will be lost.  Democrats would lose any leverage they had on any new deal early next year when both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans. ""We argued. We debated. We fought,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one of the chief negotiators on the spending bill. ""You know - sometimes you give a little, you take a little."" Many House Democrats emphasize they were initially concerned with the spending deal because it only funds the Department of Homeland Security through February. DHS includes immigration and border control agencies. A new funding battle for DHS in February would tee up a fight over President Obama's immigration action early next year. The other policy provisions added to the spending bill - one increasing the limit rich donors can give to national party committees, and one rolling back a key financial reform barring banks from using taxpayer-insured money for derivatives trades - have made it even more unpalatable. ""At this point I don't see many Democratic votes at all for a bill that is so antithetical to the middle class,"" Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, told CNN before heading into a meeting on the measure on Thursday morning. Other Democrats are taking a more pragmatic approach, stressing they are weighing the good with the bad. ""This may be a hold your nose vote,"" Connolly told reporters, suggesting he could ultimately back the measure and any deal next year would only get worse for the programs he cares about.  Connolly's district is home to tens of thousands of federal workers who got a small pay raise as part of the deal. Related: Lawmakers chip away at campaign finance rules in spending bill . The number two House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, who is in charge of whipping votes, wouldn't say how he would vote. ""We're holding our powder dry,"" Hoyer said. House Republican aides feel comfortable that even with large opposition in Democratic ranks they can get enough votes for the measure to eke out its passage. If it passes, the bill will be sent to the Senate, where many of the same divisions exist. While the debate over the measure will echo the bitter partisan tone that's been the marker of this Congress, one thing unites virtually everyone on Capitol Hill.  They all hate the name of the bill -- dubbed the ""Cromnibus"" for a combination of a ""continuing resolution"" and an ""omnibus"" spending bill. ""It sounds like a horrible disease,"" said one House Republican. A Democrat called it the ""Crummy-bus.""","Government funding is set to run out at midnight .
Republicans and Senate Democratic leaders want to pass a catchall spending bill to fund the government until September .
Democrats in the House have balked at language tucked in the bill that would roll out some Wall Street reforms ."
"Mombasa, Kenya (CNN) -- At the Old Port in Mombasa, southern Kenya, tranquil waters lap gently against the shore beneath the ghostly Fort Jesus garrison. Today, it's a pretty and peaceful scene, but one that belies the port's bustling colonial past. It was at this spot just over a century ago that the ancestors of Kenya's successful Indian community first set foot on African soil. They came in ships and dhows, having been coaxed here to build one of the continent's great railways. As that railway -- which was soon christened the ""lunatic line"" because of its high cost and the dangers faced by those constructing it -- snaked through the country towards Uganda in the years that followed, so did the Indian community. The economic and cultural roots they laid down beside the tracks remains to this day. ""(My family is involved) in quite a lot,"" said one businesswoman of Indian heritage we meet in a nearby restaurant. ""We have commodities, transport and various other things."" She tells us her grandfather first came to Kenya to work on the railways and her family has been there ever since. Her colleague chimes in that ""Indians have been traders and economically they play a very big role in the Kenyan economy."" At a spice shop just down the road, meanwhile, the third generation Indian owner tells me that Kenyan Asians are spread widely across industries like construction, retail and tourism. The winds of trade . Of course, merchants from India and what's now known as Pakistan had come to Mombasa long before the railway. The trade-routes linking East Africa and Asia were already well established. Mombasa had been a city-state for over 2,000 years bearing long and fruitful relations with the Middle East, Asia and the Far East. In the port's heyday ""there was ivory being sold like the way we sell cakes now or mahamris as we call them,"" said historian Satmbuli Abdillahi Nassir. ""There was rhinoceros horns ... there was dry skin, there was spices, all this was happening at this port."" It was the railway lines, however, and the need for labor that first brought a mass migration of people from the sub-continent. By the mid-1890's, the British were effectively in control of Kenya and were keen to open up the country's interior and that of neighboring Uganda to counter German influence in the region. Having started construction of railway lines in India nearly 50 years earlier, Punjabi engineers and laborers had the skills the British required. The lion's share . More 30,000 indentured Indian workers were soon enticed to sail to Mombasa and a new life in Africa. The country these expectant migrants found upon arrival, however, was vastly different to the land of comparative business opportunity their ancestors inhabit today. Work on the railways was brutally hard. By the time it had reached its destination in Kisumu on the banks of Lake Victoria, roughly 625 miles from Mombasa, around 2,500 men had died. That's four people for every mile. And it wasn't just the oppressive heat and long hours workers had to contend with. The man eaters of Tsavo were a pair of lions that killed anywhere between 28 and more than 100 workers during the building of the railway, depending which account you believe. They spread such terror that work stopped until they were eventually shot. On top of that, there was also sickness and disease to contend with. ""Many people died of malaria and black fever when they were building because of the difficult terrain and there were no medical facilities resulting (in) many deaths,"" said Komal Shah, whose ancestors settled just outside Nairobi after the railway was built. ""They had to take risks coming to this place,"" she added. Melting pot . Shah is one of the many Kenyan Asians who today run their own businesses in the Westlands and Parklands districts of the Kenyan capital. She teaches the ancient Indian discipline of yoga, a far cry from the grueling and punishing work of the railway lines. But the history and contribution of Shah's ancestors in building the community and the infrastructure of the country make her proud of her roots. ""I would not like to be distinguished as a Kenyan from a different region of the world,"" Shah said. ""I am born here and a third generation Asian Kenyan. I proudly say that I am a Kenyan."" Such open and patriotic sentiments aren't uniform across the country, however. Outside of the big metropolises such as Nairobi and Mombasa, there is a more complex relationship between communities. In Kisumu, where the great railway ends, issues of integration between Kenyan Asians and black Africans remain. Although there are rarely tensions between the groups, neither mixes fully with the other. According to local MP Shakeel Shabbir Ahmed, himself a Kenyan Asian who married a black Kenyan woman, this is something that has to change. ""There has not been a real integration (in Kisumu) ... like in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam,"" Ahmed said. ""In Kisumu the integration is only when it's in the shop or at the business ... but when they go out of that particular environment there is very little integration either by way of recreation or other facilities."" While Kenyan Asian's community makes a substantial economic contribution to wider society, Ahmed believes they should make more of an effort to mix with their compatriots and refrain from being ""insular."" ""We are less than 1.4% (of the population) here in Kenya but we hold the purse strings to maybe 30% or 40% of the economy,"" Ahmed estimates. ""(But) we must remember that if we earn here, we live here, we must contribute to this country."" That's a sentiment that the very first Indian emigres to set foot in this beautiful country would have doubtless agreed with.","Indian migrants flocked to Kenya just over a century ago to build railways .
Lion attacks and diseases such as black fever were just a couple of the dangers workers on the railways faced .
Many descendants of those Indian migrants are today successful business owners across Kenya .
Some say that the Indian community has still not fully integrated into Kenyan society ."
"Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- From Earth, the sun appears as a constant circle of light, but when viewed in space a brilliant display of motion is revealed. Flares that light up the galaxy and eruptions that can be as large as 30 times the Earth's surface occur regularly. During the peak of the 11-year solar cycle, these events can happen several times a day. The flares and eruptions are collectively known as space weather and although they create dazzling visuals in space, it isn't just a harmless fireworks show for the galaxy. Each burst of energy can have a disrupting effect on systems we rely on every day. With their headquarters next to the Rocky Mountains in the state of Colorado, a team of forecasters aims to minimize that impact. ""The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) essentially watches the sun, watches for activity on the sun originating from sun spots,"" explains Bob Rutledge, Forecast Office lead. ""That's really where the magnetic fields of the sun poke through the surface and kind of hold that part of the surface in place allowing it to cool -- that's why it appears dark."" Gas rolls up and down the sun's outer layer, similar to the bubbles in boiling water. When the magnetic field around a sun spot breaks, magnetic energy explodes in the solar atmosphere like a pot boiling over. The size and position of sun spots can give forecasters a clue as to when or where a solar flare may bubble up. They produce daily forecasts that are important to the industries most vulnerable. ""Space weather can have a variety of impacts across many different customer bases -- commercial aviation, precision GPS use, power grid operations -- all these are really critical,"" says Rutledge. Read this: Capturing the cosmos -- stunning photos of the night sky . The sun is currently at its ""solar maximum"" -- the point in its cycle where it is at peak activity -- but the SWPC says that activity is modest compared to recent cycles. Nonetheless, last week the center reported that the sun had produced a ""moderate-level"" solar flare, which had ""short-lived impacts to high frequency radio communications on the sunlit side of Earth."" Solar flares can send blasts of radiation through space that can interfere with satellites and even harm astronauts during spacewalks. ""So when an eruption happens -- when we have that flash of light, those radio waves -- that takes eight minutes to get from the sun to the Earth. So as soon as we start the measurement, it's already affecting the sunlit side of the Earth,"" explains Rutledge. Innovations in spacecraft by NASA are showing us some of the best images of the sun we've ever seen -- giving us a clearer picture and hopefully a better understanding of space weather. But there is still much mystery to the 4.5 billion-year-old star and the emissions that are blasted through space, so scientists and forecasters will continue to watch every movement.

"We all know what makes a great beach bar. Killer ocean views, sunset exposure and a creative menu from which, for once, you don't have to feel ashamed about drinks that come in coconut shells garnished with pink umbrellas. In Hawaii, though, perfect beach drinkeries also have to be imbued with that distinctive mahalo spirit. These 10 waterfront watering holes have all that, and then some. The Edge of Waikiki (Oahu) The Edge of Waikiki almost seems too obvious, with its prime Waikiki Beach location and unobstructed views of Diamond Head. As the name suggests, it sits right on the edge of the Sheraton Waikiki's infinity pool -- happy souls occasionally float past you on orange bean bags. Every morning between 10 a.m. and noon, bartenders serve $3 draft beers and $7 cocktails; in the afternoon, there's live acoustic music and umbrella-topped pina coladas. For all the cliches, the bar remains quintessentially Waikiki, frequented by visitors and locals alike. The Edge of Waikiki, 2255 Kalakaua Ave. on Waikiki Beach, Honolulu; +1 808 922 4422 . Lava Lava Beach Club (Big Island) Lava Lava might be your textbook Hawaiian beach bar -- tiki torches, swaying palms, hula dancing and a live band -- but its kitschy charm works. The location helps -- it's on quiet Anaeho'omalu Bay on the Big Island's northwestern coast. Though its decor can be described as casual, at best -- basic rattan chairs and tables on the sand -- the drinks are strong and cheap, with $5 cocktails during happy hour, and service is attentive and energetic. Lava Lava Beach Club, 69-1081 Ku'uali'i Place on Anaeho'omalu Bay, Waikoloa Village, Big Island; +1 808 769 5282 . Bumbye Beach Bar (Maui) Though Bumbye is located just steps from low-key Mokapu Beach on Maui's southwest coast, it's not exactly what you'd call low key. Its beechwood exteriors, surf-inspired art and artisan cocktails attract a largely young clientele, mainly guests at the Andaz Wailea. But there's no attitude here: bartenders are chatty and easygoing and there's a solid local presence, particularly during football season when drinks are half-price during games. The signature Honua'ula cocktail, a mix of Amaro, tequila, rum, pineapple and lime, is a crowd favorite. Bumbye Beach Bar, 3550 Wailea Alanui Drive on Mokapu Beach, Wailea, Maui; +1 808 573 1234 . House Without a Key (Oahu) Sheltered beneath the sprawling branches of a century-old kiawe tree behind the Halekulani's orchid pool, House Without a Key feels tucked away despite its central Waikiki Beach address. Each night on a small, oceanfront stage, live Hawaiian music is paired with traditional hula dancing performed by former Miss Hawaii winners as the sun sets over Waikiki. The signature cocktail is a mai tai -- more than one call it the best on the island -- served over crushed ice and a sugarcane stick, and garnished with a mint leaf and a Vanda orchid. House Without a Key, 2199 Kalia Road on Waikiki Beach, Honolulu; +1 808 923 2311 . Nalu Kai (Kauai) Quite possibly the only true beach bar on Kauai's north shore, Nalu Kai pairs barefoot appeal with strong drinks and views over Hanalei Bay, Pu'u Poa Beach and Bali Hai. Though the bar is part of the St. Regis Princeville Resort, it's more minimalist than posh. Its clientele skews young and moneyed. Drinks are typically priced for a five-star resort bar -- $10 for a local beer, $16 for a margarita -- but cocktails are served with flair and made with the fresh juice of local fruit like lilikoi and lychee. Nalu Kai; 5520 Ka Haku Road on Pu'u Poa Beach, Princeville, Kauai; +1 808 826 9644 . Serenity Pool Bar (Maui) Though the Serenity Pool Bar at the Four Seasons Maui is known more for its swim-up appeal -- it's on the edge of a 120-foot infinity pool -- it's also located beachfront, directly overlooking Wailea Beach. An ocean-facing terrace with lounge chairs offers views over the West Maui mountain range and the island of Lanai. The bar offers a substantial selection of local and organic beer and 18 cocktails, the most popular being the mai tai, which can be served in a pineapple upon request. Serenity Pool Bar at Four Seasons Maui, 3900 Wailea Alanui Drive, Wailea, Maui; +1 808 874 8000 . Mai Tai Bar (Oahu) Heather Graham and Ellen DeGeneres (for whom a cocktail has been named) are said to frequent the Waikiki Beach institution that is the Mai Tai Bar. Though the outdoor bar is encircled by a low barricade, the separation of bar and beach feels imperceptible thanks to the proximity of the sand -- you can reach over in your seat and grab a handful. A contemporary Hawaiian musical trio plays six nights a week. Their sunset rendition of Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's ""Over the Rainbow"" is predictable but never tired. Mai Tai Bar; 2259 Kalakaua Ave. on Waikiki Beach, Honolulu; +1 808 923 7311 . Ohia Bar at Duke's Beach House (Maui) Located on North Ka'anapali Beach, the lower-key Maui outpost of Duke's Waikiki is an easy stroll from Black Rock, but far enough away from the Whaler's Village beach bar crowds to feel somewhat secluded. Its thatched umbrellas and tiki torches are proudly kitsch -- this is Duke's, after all. Half-price happy hour kicks off at 3 p.m. and ends at sunset. Local crooners hop on the mic shortly after to set the aloha vibe in full swing with renditions of ""Aloha Oe"" and ""White Sandy Beach."" Ohia Bar at Duke's Beach House, 130 Kai Malina Parkway on North Ka'anapali Beach, Lahaina, Maui; +1 808 662 2900 . Oasis on the Beach (Kauai) Just 15 minutes from Lihue Airport, this Kapa'a coast bar is perfectly situated for a pre- or post-flight drink. Its outdoor dining deck overlooks the long expanse of Waipouli Beach, and the bar menu is large and interesting. Popular drinks include macadamia hot-buttered rum with cloves, and the spicy Thai martini. On Wednesday evenings the entire bar menu is half price. The small plates are made with 90% local ingredients. Oasis on the Beach; 4820 Kuhio Highway at Waipouli Beach, Kapaa, Kauai; +1 808 822 9332 . Beach Tree Bar (Big Island) Located on the sands of Kumukea Beach on the Big Island's Kona-Kohala coast, the Beach Tree Bar is good for sunset cocktails and turtle-spotting -- sometimes simultaneously. Though the thatched-roof bar has an informal vibe, it's got a sophisticated beer and wine menu (more than 60 wines by the glass) and 19 cocktails, including the popular limoncello-pear concoction that's the signature Beach Tree Smash. Bartenders and wait staff avoid cheesy aloha shirts for casual blue tees and share local knowledge freely. Beach Tree Bar at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, 72-100 Kaupulehu Drive, Kaupulehu-Kona; +1 808 325 8000 .","Edge of Waikiki borders the Sheraton hotel's infinity pool .

"A suspected U.S. drone strike in northwestern Pakistan on Monday morning killed 15 militants and wounded three others, a local government official said, the third such deadly attack in as many days. The drone fired at least six missiles at a militant compound near the town of Mir Ali in the North Waziristan region near the Afghanistan border, government official Muhammad Amir told CNN. North Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region. The area is widely believed to be the operating base for the Haqqani network and other militant groups that have attacked international troops in neighboring Afghanistan. Monday's attack is the 21st suspected drone strike in Pakistan this year. U.S. officials rarely discuss the CIA's drone program in Pakistan, though privately they have said the covert strikes are legal and an effective tactic in the fight against extremists. A day earlier, a drone is thought to have fired four missiles that killed nine militants at a militant compound in Wacha Dana, a village in South Waziristan, local government official Javed Marwat told CNN. This followed a suspected strike Saturday near the town of Wana in the same province that killed two militants riding on a motorcycle, according to Marwat. U.S. President Barack Obama's administration justified its use of unmanned drones to target suspected terrorists overseas in a rare public statement recently, with John Brennan, the president's top counter-terrorism adviser, saying the strikes are conducted ""in full accordance with the law."" The program utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles, often equipped with Hellfire missiles, to target suspected terrorist operatives in remote locations overseas -- with many such strikes occurring in Yemen and Pakistan, despite some internal opposition within that latter South Asian country. Brennan said the United States ""respects national sovereignty and international law"" and is guided by the laws of war in ordering those attacks.","The suspected drone fired at least 6 missiles, an official says .
Three militants were wounded and 15 killed, the local official adds .
This is thought to be the third such fatal drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region in 3 days .

"(CNN)Always wanted to be in the movies? You may get a chance soon, thanks to the burgeoning world of virtual reality and a film industry keen on exploring it. Major movie studios like Fox Searchlight, the influential Sundance Film Festival and Oculus, Facebook's $2 billion bet on the future of virtual reality, are just some of the players working to make you believe you're fighting in the Battle of the Five Armies or shooting through space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. From Technicolor to surround sound to 3-D to high projector frame rates, the history of film has been built on technology designed to make audiences feel more a part of the movie they're watching. In virtual reality, which uses 360-degree computer simulations to create the illusion of reality, some think they've found the greatest leap yet in that direction. ""The visceral impact of the format is simply too powerful to not to want to touch,"" said Shari Frilot, senior programmer at the Sundance Film Festival. Frilot is curator of New Frontier, an initiative at Sundance devoted to supporting filmmakers who are pushing the boundaries of art and technology. Of New Frontier's 13 installations at next month's festival, nine will feature virtual reality. They'll range from ""Kaiju Fury,"" a feature that puts the viewer in a city being attacked by monsters, to ""Project Syria,"" which will explore the potential for VR in documentary storytelling. ""I think the show this year speaks powerfully to how VR is being embraced by big studios and independent filmmakers and artists alike,"" Frilot said. One of those big studios is Fox Searchlight. ""Wild,"" starring Reese Witherspoon and in theaters now, has been developed into a three-minute virtual experience in which the viewer joins Witherspoon's character hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. That demo, developed along with Oculus and Samsung, will be shown this month at both Sundance and the International CES consumer-electronics show in Las Vegas. HBO partnered with Oculus this year on a similar short ""experience"" promoting ""Game of Thrones,"" in which the viewer is put into the shoes of a Night's Watch member facing an enemy attack. It's a new frontier for Oculus, which set out to make its Rift headset a tool for video games. Now, the company seeks to change everything about how we watch movies. ""At some point, VR is going to eliminate the need to go to a physical place and see a big screen,"" Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe said. ""It can be even richer than the IMAX experience in a theater, because it can be 360 and all around you."" Of course, that sort of mass-market shift isn't going to happen overnight. For one thing, Oculus and other major virtual-reality players like Sony's Project Morpheus aren't even on store shelves. Once they are, they'll have to avoid the curse of other failed ""next big things,"" like 3-D televisions. But Frilot, and others like her, say it could happen. ""Only time will tell how consumers will take to wearing goggles to access their visual entertainment,"" she said. ""But if adaptation looks anything like the way consumers took to wearing earbuds to listen to music, or Bluetooth devices to communicate on their phones, it becomes clear how very powerful a movement on our media landscape virtual reality can become.""","Virtual reality may be the next big innovation in movies .
At the Sundance festival, an experimental program is dominated by virtual reality .
Fox Searchlight is among the major studios giving it a try ."
"Despite the ray of good news in Thursday's Geneva agreement on steps to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine, President Obama was right to sound a note of caution, observing that ""I don't think we can be sure of anything at this point."" The deal, reached by Russia, Ukraine and the West, called for, among other things, disarming illegally armed pro-Russian demonstrators in eastern Ukraine, and the surrender of the government buildings they have seized. These are good and essential first steps, but unless they can now be implemented as a basis on which the parties can move to further, bolder steps to reverse underlying trends, Ukraine could still slide into civil war. If this happened, how would it affect American national interests? Could Ukraine become a 21st century echo of the Balkans in the 1990s, when the collapse of Yugoslavia saw a decade of war between Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians and Kosovars? (No one should forget that just a century ago Ukraine was sucked into a tragic, bloody civil war shortly after gaining independence in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.) There is a saying that history never repeats itself, but it does sometimes rhyme. Fortunately, full-blown civil war in Ukraine still seems unlikely — mainly because one side, the Ukrainian government, appears both unable and unwilling to fight.  Nonetheless, it's not hard to sketch a scenario in which war is the outcome -- and from that to envision a further scenario in which the U.S. finds itself drawn into a direct confrontation. (More on that in a moment.) As we have seen in the past two weeks in eastern Ukraine, Russian speakers— acting either spontaneously, or at the behest of Russian security services, or both — have taken control of government buildings in 10 cities in Ukraine's eastern provinces of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv. Ukrainian military, security and police forces are so impotent, demoralized and compromised by Russian infiltration that their response has so far been pathetic. This week, the New York Times reported on the Ukrainian government's ""glaring humiliation,"" when a military operation to confront pro-Russian militants instead saw Ukraine's 21 armored vehicles separating into two columns, surrendering or retreating.  In several instances, when confronted by pro-Russian crowds, soldiers and policemen have even switched sides. If Thursday's deal unravels and Ukrainian authorities remain unable to restore basic law and order, the pro-Russian demonstrators occupying buildings will be emboldened to expand their reach. Further steps may include the demonstrators setting up an independent ""republic"" in the three Eastern regions and seeking to drive out forces loyal to Ukraine's interim government, provoking the Kiev government to respond with greater force, and then calling in Russian troops to defend them against what they will claim to be ""fascists"" from western Ukraine. Responding to a crackdown, Russian security forces would likely provide arms and other assistance to the Russian speakers, claiming that such a call for assistance from ""compatriots"" is impossible to ignore. As conflict intensifies, western Ukrainians, perhaps even Poles or other Europeans, could come to the aid of Ukraine. In this spiral, one thing could lead to the next, ending in significant bloodshed in eastern Ukraine, and perhaps even spreading beyond. Widespread violence or civil war would certainly be a calamity for Ukrainians. But would its consequences for American national interests require an American military response? Fortunately for Americans, the answer is no. In 2008, when Russia crushed Georgia in a short war that ended in Russia's recognition of independence for the former Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, that was President George W Bush's answer. As the ongoing civil war in Syria has claimed more than 150,000 lives, neither President Obama nor his most ardent critics, like Arizona Sen. John McCain, have judged this such an extreme threat to U.S. interests that Americans must kill and to die to stop it. That the U.S. does not have vital national interests in Ukraine will not mean that the U.S. has no national interest in holding Moscow accountable for violating territorial integrity assurances that Russia and the U.S. gave to Ukraine in 1994 in persuading it to give up nuclear weapons. Indeed, if left to take its course, this crisis has the potential to fuel further developments that engage core American national interests. For example, if Crimea becomes Putin's precedent for creeping annexation in which Russia-instigated Russian speakers occupy government buildings, liberate a territory and establish a relationship with Russia, where will this stop? Could the 25% of the population in Latvia who are Russian speakers be tempted (or coaxed) to follow suit? (Both Latvians and Russians vividly recall that in 1940 Stalin annexed Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, nations that regained their independence only in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.) Russian military intervention in Latvia, even under the guise of special forces in green garb without insignia, would almost certainly be engaged by Latvian military and police. If Russian security forces came to the assistance of their brethren in Latvia, as they would be likely to do, this would mean a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO. Many Americans are not aware that Latvia and its Baltic neighbors are members of the NATO alliance, of which the United States is the leader. How many Americans know that members of that alliance, including the United States, commit themselves in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to regard an attack against one NATO signatory as ""an attack against them all""? Pursuant to that commitment, successive American presidents have approved war plans in which Americans would fight to defend the territory of all members of the alliance. Preventing Ukraine's collapse into civil war must therefore be a high priority for the leaders of both the United States and Russia. The Geneva agreement on ""initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security,"" which U.S. and Russian diplomats signed, along with their EU and Ukrainian counterparts, represents the first real step in the international community's collective effort to reverse Ukraine's slide into chaos. Leaders in both Washington and Moscow will have to follow up with further, bolder steps to prevent Ukraine's spiraling into a civil war that could draw them into a direct confrontation. These additional steps will require all parties to accept arrangements that would be unacceptable — except for the fact that all feasible alternatives are even worse.","Graham Allison: Geneva deal on de-escalation in Ukraine a ray of hope .

"(CNN)""I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth."" -- U.S. President John F. Kennedy speaking before a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the height of the Cold War and the United States and the Soviet Union were battling it out to be the first nation to put a man on the lunar surface. On July 20, 1969, eight years after President Kennedy implored the U.S. congress for funding for space exploration, NASA's Apollo 11 spaceflight touched down on the moon. American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans in history to walk on the Earth's nearest neighbor. Since then a further 10 men have left their footprints on the moon's dusty surface, with the last being Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan in 1972. But after this golden age, moon exploration was seen as not cost effective for international space agencies. Then, last year, China sent its Jade Rabbit explorer on a three-month mission to examine the moon's crust. But it suffered a critical malfunction just half way through and bid farewell to humanity in a final report (although it is still functioning, according to Chinese press reports). Now Google is shooting for the stars and calling for private organizations to participate in an international competition for innovators to go back to the moon. The Google Lunar X Prize hopes to spur exploration on the moon and will see a hefty $20 million jackpot handed to the first team that puts a robot on the lunar surface. But that's not all -- there are a few scientific objectives a team must complete in order to obtain the ultimate honors from Google. Once on the moon, the robot must travel 500 meters and transmit HD video back to Earth. And they've got to do it all by December 31, 2015. Read more: Do we need to go back to the moon? Inspiring innovators . ""Competition leads to innovation, and the Google Lunar X Prize has brought together some of the brightest and most talented minds to accelerate the private NewSpace sector,"" says Chanda Gonzales, senior director of the Google Lunar X Prize. ""We are encouraged to see this prize pushing the industry to take risks and invest in cutting-edge technologies to support lunar exploration, which will result in an entirely new economy around low-cost access to the moon and beyond."" It is now seven years after the prize was launched and 18 private teams remain in the running. Working tirelessly to secure funding (only 10% of financing can come from government sources) as well as designing and building their individual modules, these international innovators are finally moving into the testing phase. U.S.-based company Astrobotic was set up off the back of the competition's announcement, said John Thornton, the company's CEO. ""The Google Lunar X Prize  is a catalyst to get started but it is not the end game. What we're doing as a company is creating a long-term sustainable business of carrying payloads to the moon so it's like UPS or a FedEx truck that flies regularly to the moon."" In partnership with students from Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Astrobotic is building a lander and a rover as part of its Skylight mission to travel to the rather dramatically named Lacus Mortis -- meaning ""Lake of Death."" The team hopes to explore a pit that it suspects could be linked to a larger cave network underneath the moon's surface. Journeying to the 'Lake of Death' ""We think that the right way to settle the moon is underground first. You go underground, you pop up an inflatable or a small habitat under there and you have natural protection from the elements. You're protected from micrometeorites that come in and the moon doesn't have an atmosphere to burn them up. You're protected from radiation,"" says Thornton. ""It's much easier to sustain long-term life on the surface of the moon so it's really a game-changer in the catalyst of the future of the moon. That's why we go there for the first mission: to explore, to see what these [pits] are about, and to cast the vision for the future."" The Astrobotic team will be going down to the wire as it works towards a tentative launch date at the end of 2015 -- right before the competition deadline. And it won't be the only team holding its breath. As part of its funding strategy, Astrobotic has offered to bring up several other prize contenders, essentially creating a secondary moon race within the competition. Thornton explains: ""We'll have other rovers that will deploy from our lander and those rovers will drive out and try to win the X Prize. It will be very much like NASCAR happening live on the moon now and the world will be able to watch, which will be incredibly exciting. ""What you don't want is a provider like us being incentivized to place first and everyone else to come in last. That's not a good scenario for a partnership so the way we've modeled it is in a way that the partners can win and it helps everyone. It's really like a 'coop-petition,'"" he adds. Despite millions of dollars at stake, the Skylight mission comes before the competition, says Thornton. ""The mission is more important for us. The X Prize teams will be a small portion of the total payload that flies ... When we land we'll have payloads from all over the world landing and doing various missions, sub-missions and objectives."" A moon bunny? Another team hoping to reach the lunar surface is Moon Express, which is building a hopper to bounce across the rocky terrain. ""When you are on the moon you have one-sixth gravity and there's no air resistance so we kind of use those to our advantage. And since we already have a spacecraft already designed to autonomously land, it's pretty trivial for it to repeat that and just hop,"" says the company's public outreach liaison Brad Kohlenberg. Competitions like this offer the opportunity to get closer to untapped resources as well as inspire future generations, adds Kohlenberg. ""It is recreating what we call the ' Apollo effect,'"" he says. ""During the Apollo program, we inspired a generation of children who grew up to build their own industries and companies and now these billionaires are reinvesting and building things, investing in space companies. ""You have Virgin Galactic from Richard Branson, you have Elon Musk -- all these people that are called 'Orphans of Apollo' -- people who grew up thinking they would go to college in space and then once they got there, realizing that the space program kind of left them behind and so now they are using their own resources to reinvest in that and make the dreams they had when they were younger a reality."" 'It's not about scientific discovery' For space scientist Lucie Green, this competition is more about technological payoff than scientific discovery. ""These missions are always about process,"" she says. ""So the first mission is about technology -- can we get there? Can we build something that is robust enough to survive in the extreme environment of space? And then the science comes later. So I think first of all, this is very much about a technology development."" Green, who is a Royal Society University Research Fellow based at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at the University College London, uses Mars as an analogy to reveal why it isn't necessarily a bad thing that little scientific research will come out of this particular endeavor. ""The first technology to land on the surface of Mars was primitive really. It was all about getting to the Martian surface and surviving and here we are several decades after the Viking landed and we're still looking for life, we're still looking at challenging questions. You go, you learn, you feedback. You develop new instrumentation that's more capable, that can record more data, can transmit more data, and can be more sophisticated each time."" She adds: ""So for me, this is -- I don't want to say primitive because its not primitive -- but it's not going to be the science be all and end all. This is the start of the process.""

"What is Europe's best music festival? If images of Glastonbury's muddy fields or the swaying crowds at Spain's Benicassim come to mind, you're wrong. The winner of the top prize at the last European Festival Awards was EXIT, a vibrant celebration of music tucked away in a corner of the old continent better known for historical turmoil than progressive techno beats -- Serbia. Hosted in a medieval fortress in Novi Sad, the country's second city, EXIT Festival's roster reads like a who's who of popular music. International stars like The Prodigy have raved about its wild side, and Duran Duran's bassist John Taylor called playing at Exit a career high. Last month, EXIT made more headlines after being named again as one of the nominees for this year's Best Major European Festival Award -- more than 1.2 million people voted from over 30 countries, and the winner will be announced at a ceremony on January 14. But what has grown into a major international event with more than 2.5 million visitors from 60 countries since its inception in 2000, originally started as a student movement against Yugoslavia's then president Slobodan Milosevic. His decade-long rule had seen the country embroiled in a bloody war and left isolated and impoverished. Youth in revolt . ""The main purpose of EXIT in 2000 was to unite and motivate young people to take part in the democratic processes that were going on, and to basically overthrow the Milosevic regime,"" says Dusan Kovacevic, EXIT's co-founder and general manager. Heralded by a group of young activists like Kovacevic, who was 22 at the time, the inaugural festival lasted throughout the summer, with concerts, movie screenings and exhibitions. ""Basically, young people communicate mostly through music and culture,"" says Kovacevic, ""and if you want to spread a very important social message, you need to communicate through that language. So, it was the best way to approach my generation and to animate them and explain what was happening to Serbia at that time,"" he adds. Even the festival's name had a strong social undertone, shortened from ""Exit out of ten years of madness"" referring to the Milosevic years. After his government was overthrown, Kovacevic and his colleagues started approaching international artists to try to revive the country's cosmopolitan spirit. ""EXIT 2001 had such an amazing energy because after a decade of darkness we put on the first international festival of that scale in the country,"" he says. ""We didn't have very big names, but it was huge news that international artists were coming to Serbia. Everyone who came said they felt something different than concerts they usually play -- they said this was their best concert this year, many of them said it was the best concert of their life,"" adds Kovacevic. Mainstream success . Word spread on the global music circuit, and even more famous artists started coming to EXIT , bringing with them journalists and, gradually, foreign visitors. Apart from giving the country, which was then still haunted by a decade of war and sanctions, an image overhaul, the festival brought tangible benefits to the local economy. According to the Serbian government, Exit contributed more than $125 million to the country through tourism, and its PR value was estimated to be $87 million per year. In spite of its commercial success, a strong social message remains ingrained in the festival's ethos. After the Balkans region was hit by devastating floods last May, EXIT rallied to raise $175,000 for victims with a party hosted by Grammy Award winning artist Jamiroquai at its spin-off Sea Dance event in Montenegro. As for next year's edition, which will take place from July 9 to July 12 (with tickets going on sale Friday), EXIT organizers are planning a return to the festival's roots: ""We want to evolve from a music festival to festival of creativity -- invite people from different creative industries to come because we feel that the experience of the festival is supposed to be bigger than just music,"" says Kovacevic. ""Of course, music would be the main draw, but when people come to festivals they want to celebrate life,"" he adds.","Serbia's EXIT festival has been named Europe's best music festival .
It started as a student protest against the Milosevic regime .
It soon developed into a major event hosting famous international artists .
Over 2.5 million people from 60 countries have visited Exit since 2000 ."

"(CNN) -- The young man Miley Cyrus chose to represent homeless youths at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday faces arrest in Oregon, a corrections official said. An arrest warrant was issued for Jesse Helt, 22, when he stopped checking in with his probation officer for a criminal trespass conviction in November 2011, said Polk County, Oregon, Community Corrections Director Martin Silbernagel. ""Reportedly, he has returned to the Polk County area,"" Silbernagel said. ""We will be attempting to serve him his warrant, at which time he will be taken into custody."" Polk County sheriff's deputies are not actively searching for Helt because of a staff shortage, but they would arrest him if they encounter him, spokesman Dean Bender said Wednesday. Helt took center stage at Sunday's VMA broadcast to accept the best video of 2014 award ""on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youths in the United States who are starving, lost and scared for their lives right now."" Cyrus, whose ""Wrecking Ball"" video was being honored, appeared to be near tears as she watched Helt, who said he was homeless, read the acceptance speech calling attention to the large population of homeless young people in Los Angeles. ""I've survived in shelters all over this city,"" he said. ""I've cleaned your hotel rooms. I've been an extra in your movies. I've been an extra in your life. Though I may have been invisible to you on the streets, I have a lot of the same dreams that brought many of you here tonight."" Along with raising awareness of the problem of young people living on the streets of Los Angeles, Helt's story caught the attention of corrections officials in northwest Oregon, where he grew up and where his mother lives. If police find Helt, who some media reports said returned to Salem, Oregon, to visit his mother, he will be taken before a judge to decide whether he will spend up to a year in jail or be allowed to resume his probation, Silbernagel said. Helt was initially arrested in October 2010 on burglary, criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges. The burglary count was dismissed, but he was convicted of the mischief and trespass counts, Bender said. ""The media never fails to disappoint. You've chosen to go after Jesse instead of covering the issue of youth homelessness :("" Cyrus said on Twitter after online reports of his arrest warrant were first published Tuesday.

"(CNN)Whew, that was close. Officials in Hawaii breathed a sigh of relief as one tropical system passed over the Big Island, causing limited damage, and a second system set its sights away from the island chain. ""We dodged a bullet,"" said Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. Just two days ago, the situation looked bleak.  Two hurricanes were on the way -- Iselle and Julio. Hawaii hadn't taken a direct hit from a hurricane since the 1990s.  This had people's attention. But Hurricane Iselle weakened to a tropical storm in the hours before Friday's landfall.  Hurricane Julio, a Category 2 storm with 100 mph winds at the latest update, is expected to weaken and push north of Hawaii over the weekend, forecasters said. ""Julio is expected to pass about 200 miles northeast of the Big Island on Sunday,"" the Central Pacific Hurricane Center said. Track Julio . By Friday night, all but one storm-related watch or warning had been canceled. A flash flood watch remained in place for the state through 6 a.m. (noon ET) Saturday. The heavy rains were the biggest threat from Iselle.  Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches were common, with some areas receiving more than a foot. Soggy election . The state's primary election was expected to take place Saturday despite the lingering effects of the storm. Gov. Neil Abercrombie, who has taken advantage of the storm to show leadership and appear on television, is in a tough race against State Sen. David Ige in the Democratic primary. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz faces a challenge from U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa. Schatz was appointed to the seat after the death of longtime Sen. Daniel Inouye. A rare event . Tropical cyclones are rare visitors on Hawaii. Since the 1950s, only two hurricane eyes have hit the state -- and both approached from the south, where water temperature generally is warm enough to sustain the storms' strength. That's not to say Hawaii hasn't had close calls. The central Pacific sees an average of about five tropical cyclones a year, and some have brushed the state in recent decades. The cyclones generally approach from the east after forming in the eastern Pacific. But close to Hawaii, dry air, cooler water and wind shear combine to weaken approaching cyclones, dissipating them before they can become a significant threat, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Hawaii's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- Hurricane Iniki of 1992 -- came during an El Nino year, or a year of above-average sea surface temperatures. This year hasn't met the criteria for El Nino, but it could in the weeks ahead, Petersons said. Iniki killed at least four people and caused about $2 billion in damage when it hit the western Hawaiian island of Kauai, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","All tropical storm warnings and watches have been canceled .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- The Mexican army has arrested a top drug cartel chief and four of his bodyguards, the government announced Wednesday. Suspected drug kingpin Hector Huerta Rios faces members of the press Wednesday in Mexico City. Hector Huerta Rios, also known as ""La Burra"" or ""El Junior,"" was arrested Tuesday in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States. The state-run Notimex news agency reported the announcement, citing a news conference held by the secretary of national defense and the attorney general's office. Huerta was flown to Mexico City on Tuesday night to face federal charges. Federal officials showed the four suspects to the media in a news conference Wednesday. Video footage on CNN affiliate Televisa shows Huerta flanked on each side by two other suspects. He is looking straight ahead, a solemn countenance on his mustachioed face. Hooded soldiers are stationed to the sides and behind the suspects. Huerta is a suspect in the September 2006 shooting death of Marcelo Garza y Garza, the head of the State Agency of Investigations, news reports said. News of Huerta's capture made the front pages of El Porvenir, La Prensa and El Milenio newspapers. Huerta's arrest came one day after Mexican authorities announced rewards of up to $2 million for information leading to the capture of top cartel operatives. Huerta, considered by authorities as the principal operator for the Beltran-Leyva cartel in northern Mexico, was on the government's list. The reward for his capture was 15 million pesos ($1 million). His arrest resulted from intelligence operations though, and not from a tip, so officials will not pay a reward, El Porvenir reported, citing a military official. During the arrest, officials confiscated 12 cars and four weapons, one of them gold-plated, El Milenio reported. Huerta's capture was the third major arrest announced in the past week. Mexican authorities announced the arrest last week of Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as ""El Canicon,"" also is suspected of attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, Notimex said. The Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant last week. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame drug cartels for a surge in violence in the region. About 6,500 people died last year in the drug war in Mexico, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said this month. On Tuesday, the Mexican attorney general's office said 10,475 people were killed since Calderon took office in December 2006. Nearly 10 percent of those were police. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will visit Mexico on Wednesday for two days of meetings with top officials, with the drug war heading the list of topics to be discussed. Clinton will make clear the United States is committed to working with Mexico and helping it come out of the drug war stronger, aides said. The Obama administration announced Tuesday it is sending hundreds of extra federal agents and crime-fighting equipment to the border with Mexico. The plan, developed by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, calls for doubling the number of border security task force teams as well as moving other federal agents, equipment and resources to the border.","Suspected principal operator for Beltran-Leyva drug cartel in Mexico captured .

"The Israel Security Agency released the identities of two suspects in the kidnapping of three teenage boys from Jewish settlements in the West Bank two weeks ago. ""The Israel Security Agency established less than a day after the kidnapping ... that Hamas was believed to be behind the June 12 abduction, the ISA said in a statement Thursday . ""Hamas activists from Hebron,""  Marwan Kawasmeh, 29, and Amar Abu-Isa, 32,  were behind the abductions, the intelligence agency said. Both men have been arrested by Israeli security forces before, according to an ISA news release.  Kawasmeh served a 10-month prison sentence. ""In his most recent investigation, in 2010, (Kawasmeh) admitted to having been recruited to the Hamas military wing in the Hebron area in 2009,"" ISA said. Abu-Isa was detained several times between 2005 and 2007. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner of the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday  that both men have ""a history of terrorist activity"" and both were ""suspects immediately after the kidnapping."" The three teenagers, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel, both 16, and Eyal Yifrach, 19, were last seen around Gush Etzion, on the Israeli side of the West Bank barrier late on June 12 or early on June 13, according to the IDF. After the release of the suspects' identities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded with a comment directed at Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. ""I now expect President Abbas ... to break his pact with the Hamas terrorist organization that kidnaps children and calls for the destruction of Israel."" Previously Abbas had condemned the kidnappings and called on all sides to refrain from violence, according to an Israeli newspaper report earlier this month. Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the kidnappings almost immediately. A Hamas spokesman said in the days after the abductions that Netanyahu's comments attributing blame were ""stupid and baseless."" Israeli security forces have conducted an extensive search for the teens. Within days after the teens' disappearance, Israeli soldiers had detained more than 150 Palestinian suspects. The military said Hamas leaders and operatives were among the suspects. As the search for the two suspects continues, the IDF and ISA said Thursday several other suspects are also being questioned ""for their personal involvement of the attack.""","The Israel Security Agency names suspects in teens' kidnapping .

"Editor's note: James Losey is a Policy Analyst and Chiehyu Li is a Program Associate, both with the New America Foundation's Open Technology Initiative. The opinions expressed in this op-ed do not necessarily represent those of Ars Technica or CNN.com. (Ars Technica)  -- If you've followed broadband discussions in Washington, DC, then you've heard that wireless is the future of communications. The National Broadband Plan offers wireless as the competitive solution to the broadband duopoly dilemma, and in the recently released White House Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative, President Obama reiterated his State of the Union commitment to helping ""extend next-generation wireless services to at least 98% of Americans."" If you watch TV, you might think this is a good thing. The whole country is moving to 4G -- next generation wireless -- and according to some carriers, this is our chance to beat the world in broadband. For Obama, it's a chance to Win the Future. It will certainly help us win a future -- but if this, as Obama said, is our ""Sputnik moment,"" we are not reaching for the moon. Defining ""4G"" Trying to understand 4G can give you a bit of a headache. Some surveys show that most Americans have no idea what the term ""4G"" means, but many plan to upgrade anyway. It's faster -- and at times more expensive -- but will the technology bring us up to the same speed as other countries? Driving adoption of next-generation technology is essential for America's communications to catch up with the rest of the world; our broadband networks, by most standards, stand in the middle of the pack on speed. However, the wireless upgrade path is not as straight as one might assume. The problem comes down to what ""4G"" really means. The buzzwords flying around the US mobile space are Long Term Evolution (LTE), HSPA+ and WiMAX. However, before this past December, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the global standards-setting body responsible for ensuring some level of interoperability in mobile communications, had set the 4G standard as LTE Advanced -- technology that is not expected to be deployed until 2012 at the earliest. That month the ITU updated their policy, saying that ""'4G,' although it is recognized that this term [is] undefined, may also be applied to the forerunners of these technologies, LTE and WiMAX, and to other evolved 3G technologies providing a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities with respect to the initial third generation systems now deployed."" In other words, the term 4G can be applied to LTE and WiMAX, the leading technologies currently rolling out in the US and globally -- even though they are technically still 3G or (in marketing speak) 3.9G HSPA+, which might otherwise be more accurately defined as 3.5G. Getting beat abroad . Comparing wireless networks globally on the basis of 4G can be like comparing apples and oranges -- while 3G begets 4G, not all 4G is created equal. The real leap forward for next-generation deployments is defined not so much by technology but by speeds. Certainly, in this context, the 4G-branded service available in the United States does not compete with 4G service offered elsewhere. That's not to say wireless speeds in the United States aren't improving; indeed, they are beginning to match the speeds of lower-end broadband connections. Verizon, claiming the ""Fastest, most advanced 4G network in America,"" is rolling out LTE offering up to 5-12 Mbps download speeds. AT&T also claims the title of ""Fastest mobile broadband network"" with two layers of HSPA+ and LTE. Sprint's WiMAX network is slightly slower at 3-6 Mbps. T-Mobile has focused on HSPA+, claiming peaks of 21Mbps, although speeds realized by users are considerably slower and T-Mobile is pushing for the claim of largest, not fastest, network. While these speeds do bring next-generation mobile broadband up to the standard of wireline broadband connections, the FCC found that the average wired broadband speed is between 3 and 4 Mbps. Our past research has shown that broadband in the United States is slower and pricier than service in other developed countries. This gap in speeds persists with the move to 4G wireless broadband. For example, TeliaSonera rolled out LTE services in major Nordic and Baltic countries including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Sweden last year with speeds that blow US 4G offerings out of the water: ""In normal circumstances, the average download speed is 20-80 Mbit/s."" German mobile provider Vodafone is offering LTE service with 7Mbps speeds on the low end while also offering downloads up to 50Mbps on more expensive plans. Asian countries have made great progress in launching 4G services since 2006, including LTE and WiMAX in Japan and Taiwan. NTT DoCoMo, a Japanese major mobile service provider, launched an LTE mobile data communication service called ""Xi"" in November 2010. In its coverage area of five major cities, Xi boasts maximum downlink speeds of 37Mbps. Taiwan is also ahead of the US in 4G speeds. Mobile provider VMAX began WiMax service offering a maximum speed of 16Mbps down and 4Mbps up in Taipei City. We can do better . President Obama threw down the gauntlet with his ""Sputnik Moment"" rhetoric in the State of the Union speech. The comment implicitly referenced the missile gaps and past technological races of yesteryear, but the White House Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative may fall short of those heady days of innovation. For instance, the goal of 98% of American's receiving 4G speeds may have already been met, if one believes the carrier estimates. AT&T says that it has ""completed its deployment of HSPA+ to virtually 100 percent of its mobile broadband network"" and it claims that 300 million people are covered. Those engaged in the effort to free up an additional 500MHz of spectrum, as the National Broadband Plan recommends, must recognize the value of connectivity through unlicensed spectrum with nearly 40 percent of smartphone connectivity through unlicensed WiFi. By definition, a 4G roll-out alone does not bring America up to speed. The ITU has applied the term to describe capable technology but it does not define the actual service received by the consumer. Services branded 4G in the US meet the unambitious National Broadband Plan universalization goals, but they are not next-generation services when compared to speeds in other countries. Our mobile communications will suffer from a generation gap -- whether the technology is called ""4G"" or not.

"For the first time, someone in the Obama administration apologized for the problem-plagued Obamacare website. Marilyn Tavenner also said on Tuesday that the online troubles were being resolved and the overall program was working, albeit slower and less successfully than hoped. In the first congressional testimony from a government official on the botched launch of HealthCare.gov, the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the House Ways and Means Committee that the ""vast majority"" of consumers would be able to successfully use the site by the end of November. ""I want to apologize to you that the website does not work as well as it should,"" she said, adding that HealthCare.gov ""can and will be fixed."" The hearing served as a hot seat for Tavenner, whose agency has been blamed for the website troubles causing a political headache for President Barack Obama and his signature health care reforms, as well as a venting session for Republicans after their failed efforts to scuttle the reforms. Tavenner reports to Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has come under fire for the problems that plagued the introduction of the enrollment website. Some congressional Republicans demand her resignation or firing, and Sebelius will face a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. She is expected to tell that committee the initial experience of HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many, and unacceptable. But she will also defend Obamacare, according to prepared remarks. ""The fact is that the Affordable Care Act delivered on its product: quality, affordable health insurance. The tremendous interest shown in HealthCare.gov shows that people want to buy this product. We know the initial consumer experience at HealthCare.gov has not been adequate. We will address these initial and any ongoing problems, and build a website that fully delivers on this promise of the Affordable Care Act,"" Sebelius is expected to say. The health secretary will provide figures for the site, which has had more than 20 million unique visits to date. Over the past few weeks, nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted. People are also signing up through a call center, paper applications and in-person assistance. ""By enlisting additional technical help, aggressively monitoring errors, testing to prevent new issues from cropping up, and regularly deploying fixes to the site, we are working to ensure consumers' interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one, and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise,"" Sebelius will say. In an exclusive interview last week, the health secretary told CNN that Obama didn't know of the problems with the Affordable Care Act's website until after its troubled launch on October 1. This was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a prelaunch test run. Policies canceled . More trouble for Obama came out of the testimony, as Tavenner conceded that some people with individual health coverage -- rather than the group coverage that most Americans have -- will be forced to get new policies because of increased requirements under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. ""These individuals in a small group, our individual markets, had no protections"" before the reforms became law, Tavenner explained. Until now, such consumers ""could be kicked out any time for pre-existing conditions"" or realize too late that their policies failed to cover hospitalization or cancer treatments, Tavenner said. The reforms protect them by requiring a minimum standard of coverage, she added. For some, that means more expensive policies and any change breaks the oft-repeated pledge by Obama that ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan"" when he was pushing for Congress to pass his signature reforms. Republican Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois hammered Tavenner on that point, noting a constituent who got a letter telling her that the health care reforms caused the cancellation of her current plan with a more expensive alternative in its place. ""She has health insurance that she likes. She's been paying her premium. She wants to keep it. But she can't,"" Schock said. ""Isn't that a lie?"" Tavenner responded that some insurers changed or discontinued plans that failed to meet the Obamacare requirements, even though present coverage could still be offered in some cases under a ""grandfather"" provision in the legislation, despite lacking the full benefits of the reforms. She advised anyone being forced to get a new policy to examine all options under the new system, including the possibility of getting federal subsidies if they are eligible. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans -- at least two-thirds of the population in 2011 -- had coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said ""a significant portion"" of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges. ""One of the issues that the Affordable Care Act was designed to address was the need to provide greater security to those Americans forced to seek insurance on the individual market,"" Carney said. On Capitol Hill, a top House Democrat told reporters on Tuesday that his party ""should have been more precise"" when making the pledge about people keeping coverage they liked. ""I think preciseness would have been better,"" said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland. He added that the promise was made to try to allay the fears of the majority of Americans who get health coverage from their employers or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Partisan exchanges . As expected, Tuesday's hearing included fiery partisan exchanges, with Republicans saying the website problems foreshadow deeper problems that threaten higher premiums and government intrusion in future health coverage while Democrats accused them of trying to kill reforms that benefit millions of Americans. Under GOP questioning, Tavenner said initial figures on how many people have enrolled so far for health coverage under the reforms won't be available until mid-November. She noted that the administration has expected the initial enrollment to be small, but noted that the enrollment period ends on March 31. When asked by Republicans about the expected initial low enrollment, Tavenner pointed out that a similar dynamic occurred with implementation of the Massachusetts health care law, when people waited until the final deadline approached to sign up. To GOP Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the committee chairman, low enrollment signals the failure of the health care reforms, which need young people,  and people who are less expensive to insure, to sign up so insurers can offer affordable plans in markets that include older and people who are more expensive to cover. ""I fear we can see a fundamental breakdown of the insurance market where premiums will skyrocket, pricing millions of Americans out of health care,"" he said. Later, Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas asked Tavenner for a guarantee that consumers will be able to obtain coverage required by the health care law before the deadline. ""What I can guarantee is that we have a system that is working.  We are going to improve the speed of that system,"" she said. But Brady interrupted her. ""Excuse me,"" he said. ""You are saying the system right now is working?"" Tavenner didn't budge, responding: ""I am saying it is working.  It is just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want."" Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey lambasted Republicans on the panel for choosing to pile on the website woes in their continuing attempt to dismantle Obamacare instead of working with Democrats to improve settled law. Citing the political battle last decade over the Bush administration's Medicare prescription drug benefit opposed by Democrats, Pascrell noted ""we lost the policy fight"" then but chose to help make the program work instead of trying to discredit or undermine it. Standing up and pointing at his GOP colleagues, Pascrell shouted: ""How many of you stood up to do that?  None.  Zero.  Zero."" Website problems . Late Tuesday, officials said the data hub behind the Obamacare website was experiencing an outage, prohibiting customers from submitting new applications. Verizon, which provides some technology services behind HealthCare.gov, said federal officials asked the company to provide additional computing and storage ability. ""At the request of HHS's deputy CIO, we are now undertaking infrastructure maintenance, which should be complete overnight,"" Verizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said. ""We anticipate the strengthened infrastructure will help eliminate application downtimes."" A key tech malfunction brought down the site Sunday. In prepared testimony for the hearing, Tavenner said private contractors hired to create the website ""have not met expectations."" Asked about that statement, she cited one of the contractors -- CGI Federal, which has a contract worth as much as $200 million for its work on the system.","Sebelius to testify that initial consumer experience is frustrating, unacceptable .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's reshuffled Cabinet survived a vote of confidence early Wednesday despite widespread opposition to budget cuts he says are needed to prevent a government default. International lenders have demanded Greece cut spending, lay off public workers, raise taxes and raise 50 billion euros ($71 billion) through selling off state-owned enterprises in exchange for another bailout deal for the cash-strapped nation. Weeks of protests against the austerity measures spurred Papandreou to shake up his government last week, leading to Wednesday's 155-143 vote. Analysts warn that a Greek default could cripple the euro, the European Union's common currency, and send shock waves throughout the world economy. Lawmakers are slated to vote on the privatization plan and further tax increases, pension cuts and layoffs on June 30, and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned Greece risks being abandoned by both Europe and the International Monetary Fund if it fails to act. ""There is no alternative to this program. Let's face it,"" Barroso told CNN on Tuesday. ""And that's why it has to be clear. We need Greece to deliver, and if Greece wants this program of support, Europe is ready to support it."" Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Tuesday he was encouraged by bipartisan support he received from main opposition leader Antonis Samaras on the austerity plan, which Venizelos said he would take to Eurogroup ministers July 3. Harsh reforms designed to help reduce Greece's enormous budget deficit have so far led to tax hikes and public-sector job losses alongside already record-high unemployment. Papandreou faces opposition from within his own ruling socialists over the austerity measures needed to secure an additional bailout package. On Sunday, international lenders demanded that Greece stick with tough austerity measures and raise billions of euros by selling off state assets in exchange for further support. Airports, highways and state-owned companies as well as banks, real estate and gaming licenses will all go on the auction block. On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put austerity measures into effect. The government proposes reducing the public-sector workforce by 150,000; workers will also face changes in working hours, practices and wages, and the plan also sets out changes to social benefits, including pensions and unemployment aid. Protests against those plans turned violent June 15 as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the Finance Ministry and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said. But Papandreou did not change course, telling lawmakers over the weekend, ""The government must stop spending more than it takes in."" According to the Finance Ministry, these measures will help achieve 28.3 billion euros ($40.5 billion) in cuts from 2012 to 2015 and shrink Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product, in accordance with the EU target. CNN's Diana Magnay and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: Papandreou's government survives confidence vote .

"A U.S. Marine sergeant jailed in Mexico since late March for crossing the border with several guns in his car said Friday that he had walked across the border on foot and stayed at a Tijuana hotel earlier on the day of his arrest. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who also said he attempted suicide while being abused by his Mexican jailers, has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border, his vehicle carrying firearms he said he legally owns but are unlawful to bring into Mexico. ""I stayed in a hotel earlier in the day,"" Tahmooressi said Friday in an interview with CNN's ""New Day."" ""I parked my truck at a parking lot on the American side ... and I walk into Mexico with a backpack with extra clothes and hygiene supplies, passport, wallet. And I decide to go hang out in Mexico for some good Mexican food, inexpensive place to stay and to hang out."" Asked about Mexican media reports that he had crossed the border into Mexico several times before his March 31 arrest, Tahmooressi told CNN in a telephone interview from La Mesa penitentiary in Tijuana that he had previously traveled there four times ""just to hang out."" He denied crossing the border with the intent of trafficking arms. He had an AR-15 rifle, a .45-caliber pistol and a 12-gauge pump shotgun in his truck. ""I know what they're going to say,"" Tahmooressi said of Mexican authorities. ""They're going to say a whole bunch of lies. They're already saying a whole bunch of lies. I just know that the truth will set me free."" Source: New hearing set for U.S. Marine held in Mexican prison . An Afghanistan war veteran, Tahmooressi, 25, had recently moved to Southern California to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, according to his family. Tahmooressi described a suicide attempt with a shattered light bulb after being punched, slapped, cursed at, deprived of water and food, and shackled to a bed with a four-point restraint in a Mexican prison. ""I had one hand above my head, not both, just one,"" he told CNN. ""I was laying on a bed. ... When I got the opportunity, I decided to stab myself in the neck with a light bulb ... I was paranoid. I had been abused. I was thinking they were going to come and abuse me more and torture me and get information about my family from me. So I said, 'I'm not going to allow them to do that.' "" U.S. Marine tells of abuse in Mexican prison, but says he's still hopeful . Tahmooressi said conditions improved after media coverage of his plight. Mexican prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations. ""I would like everyone to know that I'm an innocent man and that it was just a big mistake and that I had no intention of bringing weapons into Mexico or committing any crime at all,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, I wasn't treated right at the border and my rights were violated."" His mother, Jill Tahmooressi, last week said her son's next court hearing is weeks away. She has said her son immediately disclosed to the border guards that he had weapons and requested that he be allowed to turn around. A 911 tape released by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, appears to support the Marine's version of events. In it, the Marine is heard saying, ""I crossed the border by accident, and I have three guns in my truck, and they're trying to take my guns from me."" After learning he was in Mexico, the 911 dispatcher responded: ""There's nothing I can help you with then, sir. I do apologize. You're not on American soil anymore."" Tahmooressi asked whether authorities have a right to take his guns. The dispatcher said he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it's illegal to enter Mexico with guns. ""There are warning signs that do say that as you're driving down the freeway, before you enter Mexico,"" she said. ""Yeah, I was hoping there would be a turnaround point,"" he responded, ""but there never was."" His mother has said Tahmooressi was searching for permanent housing and often stayed in San Diego hotels. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN last month that he had spoken with Mexican authorities about the veteran's case. Tahmooressi's family and friends also pressed their case in a White House petition that had more than 122,000 signatures -- above the mark needed to garner an official government response. ""I don't know what they're going to do to help me,"" he said. ""If they do help me, it's probably just going to be behind the scenes and the public isn't going to know about it.""

"Cue ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra."" The first half of the seventh, and final, season of ""Mad Men"" ends Sunday night with the characters continuing to grope with a new world -- one with a computer in its center. The computer may not be HAL, and the world is a far cry from the fictional future of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but as the show's many references to that film have made clear, the characters are in transit, trying to get their bearings. It's a mad, mad, mad, 'Mad Men' world . What direction will they go? You've got Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has spent these early months of 1969 demoted from creative director to copywriter (copywriter!) in hopes of forcing him out of Sterling Cooper & Partners altogether. He's been spending his weeks jetting back and forth between the agency in New York and Los Angeles, where his wife, Megan, has been pursuing her acting career. As a couple, they're adrift. Indeed, about the only time this season Don's felt the grounding of family is during an outing with daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka), which ended with an actual profession of love, and a trip to Burger Chef with Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) and Pete (Vincent Kartheiser). And Peggy? She's a manager, essentially No. 2 to the grouchy and limited new creative director, Lou Avery (Allan Havey). She's smarter than he is but gets no respect. Between spending his nights with his orgiastic hippie friends and his days wondering about life, Roger (John Slattery) has practically checked out. Bert (Robert Morse) is a figurehead. The guy pulling the strings appears to be Jim Cutler (Harry Hamlin), who's as sleek and deadly as a certain ""2001"" computer. No wonder Ginsberg (Ben Feldman) cut off his nipple. It's almost the only way to relieve the pressure. The reviews for this year have ranged from respectful to laudatory. Even though ratings have been down from last season, there's a sense that ""Mad Men"" has found its footing again. About the only episode that really took hits was ""The Monolith,"" which had the most heavy-handed references to ""2001"" -- but, then again, what other show would bother with such references at all? ""Mad Men"" being ""Mad Men,"" there are all kinds of theories about how this half-season will conclude.  Megan is going to cross paths with Charles Manson; Don will mount an office coup. You have to wonder how the moon landing will figure into things -- especially since it appears the series' timeline is nearing July 1969. Fans, however, will have to hang on. The second half won't air until next spring. The series could end on a down note, but keep in mind: In 1969, miracles do happen. What do you think of this season of ""Mad Men""?

"Lech Walesa, the man who led Poland to freedom in its Cold War struggle with the Soviet Bloc, is refusing to apologize for suggesting gay Polish politicians should ""sit behind a wall"" in the country's parliament.

""All I said (was) that minorities, which I respect, should not have the right to impose their views on the majority. I think most of Poland is behind me."" Since his comments went nationwide, Walesa has been on the receiving end of furious criticism. ""Why does Lech want me to sit in the back row?"" asked Robert Biedron, a member of parliament from the opposition Palikot Movement and Poland's first openly gay politician. ""If we accept the rules proposed by Lech Walesa then where would blacks sit? They are also a minority. And what about the disabled?"" Others have called for called for Walesa to return his Nobel prize, while the Committee for the Defense Against Sects and Violence filed a formal complaint with prosecutors in Walesa's hometown of Gdansk, accusing him of promoting a ""propaganda of hate against a sexual minority."" Along with damaging his reputation, the controversy could also have a painful effect on Walesa's career. Long retired from domestic politics, he now earns his money from the international lecture circuit, talking about democracy and the fight against communism. But with his comments on gays making headlines around the world, the Polish press has speculated that invitations to speak may soon dry up.

"It was once dominated by children, but today Halloween is a decidedly adult affair -- replete with raucous parties, naughty get-ups and expensive ornamentation. An estimated 71.5% of Americans are planning to celebrate Halloween this year, up from 52.5% in 2005, according to the country's National Retail Federation (NRF) ""A large portion of the growth is coming directly from adults who begin celebrating as early as a month prior to Halloween night,"" says NRF spokeswoman Kathy Grannis. ""We are definitely seeing that it is no longer only a children's holiday."" The trend is going global, too. Within the last five years the holiday has grown considerably outside of the U.S., according to Lisa Morton, author of ""The Halloween Encyclopedia"" and ""Trick or Treat?: A History of Halloween."" In Great Britain, ""there's been an almost 700% increase in adult costume sales since 2009,"" she says. It's also growing in Japan, where costume play has a longstanding tradition. All grown up . The shift from children's to adult holiday can be traced to the 1970s, when Halloween street festivals in several gay neighborhoods in the U.S. began to transform into adult parties featuring lavish and over-the-top costumes. In the mid-1980s, Halloween gained even more traction among adults, helped by the Coors Brewing Company, who ran an ad campaign featuring TV horror host Elvira. According to Morton, the marketing ploy helped make the ghoulish night a ""beer holiday"" in the mold of Superbowl Sunday and St. Patrick's Day. Retailers capitalized on the party mood and responded to the demand for theatrical dress up. Pin-up pirate, naughty nurse, even sexy Big Bird -- you name it, and there's a sultry version of the costume available today. Skimpy Halloween get-ups have been available for as long as costumes have been sold commercially, but in the last decade the prevalence of sexy costumes has really exploded, according to Lesley Bannatyne, author of ""Halloween Nation: Behind the Scenes of America's Fright Night.""

Why the desire to flaunt so much skin during this particular celebration, which falls at a time of year when temperatures in the northern hemisphere take a downward turn? ""Whatever box you're in, Halloween is when you get out of it, and for some, sexiness or outrageousness is their expression of getting out of it,"" Bannatyne says. Halloween also benefits from being seen as a secular celebration, open to all and flexible enough to adapt to the prevailing cultural current, she adds. Scaring up big business . What folklorists say began as ancient pagan festival celebrating the Celtic New Year, has today evolved into a multibillion-dollar commercial opportunity.

To many, Fawcett will always be best known for her red-swimsuited image on the pinup poster, which sold a reputed 12 million copies after its release in 1976. iReport: Share your memories of Farrah Fawcett . Fawcett was a model best known for bit parts, commercials and as ""Six Million Dollar Man"" actor Lee Majors' wife when she shot the poster in early 1976 at the behest of Pro Arts, a Cleveland, Ohio, company. Photographer Bruce McBroom placed Fawcett -- then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors -- in the Indian blanket-draped front seat of his 1937 Chevy and snapped away. Fawcett did her own hair -- a long, tousled cascade of blonde locks -- picked out the red bathing suit and chose the frame later used for the poster, according to a story in the Toronto Star. The poster, with Fawcett's million-dollar smile front and center, became a sensation. Soon after the photo shoot, Fawcett was asked to join the cast of a new Aaron Spelling TV show, ""Charlie's Angels,"" about a trio of female detectives who work for a mysterious man named Charlie, whose only appearance in the show was through his voice (supplied by John Forsythe).

ABC's ""Three's Company"" and CBS's ""The American Girls"" were among the shows that immediately followed, and shows such as ""Baywatch"" owe ""Charlie's Angels"" a debt. But Fawcett didn't stay with ""Angels"" long. At the end of the first season, unhappy with her contract, she left the show and was replaced by Cheryl Ladd. Fawcett's career stagnated for a time after ""Charlie's Angels."" She appeared in a handful of forgettable films and divorced Majors. But her career received a major boost with her starring role in ""The Burning Bed,"" a 1984 TV movie co-starring Paul Le Mat. Fawcett played an abused wife who sets fire to her husband's bed as he lies sleeping. Fawcett received an Emmy nomination for her performance. Fawcett also became romantically involved with O'Neal around this time. The pair had a son, Redmond, in 1985. In recent years, Fawcett has appeared sporadically in the public eye. She posed nude for Playboy in 1995. In 1997, she appeared on ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" an interview that became notorious for Fawcett's apparent incoherence. She later said she was just having fun with Letterman. She reunited with her ""Charlie's Angels"" co-stars, Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, for an awards show in 2006. Fawcett was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1947. She married Majors in 1973; they divorced nine years later.

"Since the days of Hemingway and Faulkner, bars and cafes where writers, painters and performance artists go to procrastinate have often caught the public's imagination. The romance of the artist's hangout is irresistible. From rivalries fermented over drinks to witty one-liners exchanged by Dorothy Parker and her well read pals -- ""Their pooled emotions wouldn't fill a teaspoon"" -- these are the places of a struggling artist's networking dreams. Even better, some of the most iconic artist hangouts and literary pubs continue to welcome patrons today. MORE: Amtrak officially rolls out writer's residency program . 1.

"The Tour de France is arguably the world's toughest event -- but it's just got a whole lot tougher. One of the few sporting occasions where fans don't pay to watch its stars, one of the Tour's charms has been allowing its followers to get up close and personal. You are literally in touching distance of your heroes. That's especially true on the arduous climbs in the Pyrenees and the Alps where hundreds of thousands of cycling fanatics line the roads. But the Tour's three-day visit to Britain has raised a new potential obstacle for the cycling's elite riders -- the selfie. As an estimated million people lined the narrow roads between Cambridge and London, the near 200-strong peloton were taking extra care to avoid spectators taking the social media craze just a little too far. Official estimates put the number of  fans who watched Le Grand Depart in Yorkshire over two days at 2.5 million, with Tour organizers claiming it was close to double. But with most armed with mobile phone cameras, the dangers of individuals taking a shot of themselves but forgetting cyclists were powering past at 45kph per hour only inches away was all too apparent. Team Sky star Geraint Thomas marveled at the fans supporting him as a  home rider, but said the selfish selfie takers were ""a giant pain in the arse."" American rider TJ Van Garderen went further and went on Twitter to send out a warning. ""A dangerous mix of vanity and stupidity. ""Standing I the middle of the road with you back turned while 200 cyclists come at you, just to take a selfie. .think .TDF2014,"" he moaned. Monday's stage saw one of Thomas' teammates, David Lopez,  brush shoulders with a fan who was not paying attention, fortunately without serious injury to either party. Despite being a work day, the crowds were again immense, particularly in the many small towns and villages on the route and in central London with massive fan parks in Green Park and Trafalgar Square. Two years ago sports mad Britain was gripped by Olympic fever, now it was being replicated as the world's greatest cycling race sped past. At the Olympic Park at Stratford in East London the crowd grew rapidly as many people took an extended lunch hour to reserve their own viewing point. Once again most were carrying mobiles or tablet devices but there were no worries about selfies here as the roads around the Olympic Stadium were barriered -- with stewards taking their responsibilities seriously. Malcolm Smither from Essex had been one of the much lauded Games Makers at the London Olympics, and was using his skills again as an official Tour Maker to usher the crowds to their vantage points and keep their spirits up. ""It's the first time I've been to the Tour de France and I'm very excited,"" he told CNN. Fellow Tour Maker Julia Peters, from Portmouth, said it the experience had evoked memories of 2012. ""It's very nostalgic for a lot of us and it is great to be back,"" she said. Not all the fans were British, Tom Russell, from Ohio, was on holiday and as an avid cycling fan was determined to watch the Tour, ""it is such a great atmosphere,"" he said. But most at the side of the roadside had little knowledge of professional cycling. Local resident Sheila Williams had taken her children and grandchildren to watch.  ""You've got to support them,"" she said while professing she had never heard of Britain's great cycling hero Bradley Wiggins. So sure enough as first the breakaway duo of Frenchman Jean-Marc Bideau and Jan Barta of the Czech Republic came flying past, with thousand of cameras capturing the moment, Sheila and her family cheered them to an echo. About a minute later the main bunch muscled past -- already closing fast on the doomed escapees. The whole action had taken probably less than two minutes, after which the crowd slowly dispersed, with many them gathering around one of the big TV screens which had been put in place for the Olympics. They saw Bideau and Barta caught after their heroic 150km effort, sportingly applauding at the moment of the catch. A few minutes later another burst of applause as Germany's Marcel Kittel powered up the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace to win his second stage of this year's Tour with Italy's Vincenzo Nibali holding on to the race leader's yellow jersey. It did not appear to matter to the crowd that Britain's great sprinting her Mark Cavendish, winner of 25 Tour stages, was absent after crashing out of the race Saturday. Keith Wiggans, who hails from Lancashire, had watched the action on all three days, including at Haworth, home of Bronte sisters, who penned a series of literary masterpieces. ""On the climbs the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic,"" he said."" There's been an explosion of interest which started with the exploits of Chris Hoy,"" he added. Hoy won six gold medals at the Olympics in the track sprint events, a far cry from the 3,664km which make up the three-week Tour de France this year. But his exploits and that of Wiggins, who won the 2012 Tour de France and Cavendish, raised the profile of cycling in Britain to new heights. Kittel, who won last year's iconic final stage on the Champs Elysees in Paris, said the atmosphere on the Mall had come ""pretty close"" to that. ""I'm pretty sad that we'll finish only once here because it's a great atmosphere by the side of the road. It was one of the greatest finishes I've ever seen because of this great scenery,"" he added. The Tour will now move to France for the remaining 18 stages and it remains to be seen if in its traditional home the crowds seen in England can be matched. If also remains to be seen if the selfie craze spreads across the channel  to pose a threat to the peloton, who have enough to cope with on those punishing climbs of the Alps and Pyrenees. Defending champion Chris Froome of Team Sky will now carry the hopes of the ever-growing band of cycling aficionados from Britain, well placed just two seconds behind Nibali.","Millions line streets of Britain again for Tour de France .

"The vice chairman of the Federal Election Commission told CNN on Monday he has seen numerous undisclosed e-mails between FEC staffers and the Internal Revenue Service that raise new questions about potential improper contact between two federal agencies in the alleged targeting of conservative political groups. Don McGahn, a Republican FEC commissioner, said an investigator from his agency contacted Lois Lerner, the IRS employee at the center of the political storm now engulfing that agency. He said the contact was made to discuss the status of one such conservative political advocacy group, the American Future Fund. Shortly after Lerner was contacted, the IRS sent a questionnaire to the American Future Fund, McGahn added. ""Who's the dog and who's the tail (in this case)?  Who knows,"" McGahn said.  But ""dealing with Lois Lerner is probably out of the ordinary."" The answers, McGahn stressed, ""could be benign (or) could be more sinister."" Darrell Issa, IRS escalate fight over investigation . McGahn, who did not provide a timeline of events, said FEC commissioners had not given their staffers permission to reach out to the IRS on the matter, which is generally required for such inquiries. The e-mails McGahn described to CNN are exactly what Republican congressional investigators are asking IRS and FEC officials to turn over to Congress as part of its investigation. Ellen L. Weintraub, the Democratic chairwoman of the FEC, said she does not know about the e-mails between the FEC investigator and Lerner to which McGahn is referring. ""If there was any evidence or targeting based on ideology, that would be extremely serious, but I have not seen any evidence of that,"" she said. ""I am not aware of requesting or receiving any confidential taxpayer information. I am not aware of any requests for anything that wasn't publicly available."" Last week, congressional Republicans disclosed several e-mails between Lerner, the former head of the IRS division handling tax exempt organizations, and an unnamed FEC attorney inquiring about the status of the American Future Fund and another conservative outfit, the American Issues Project. The e-mails were first uncovered by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Michigan, who sent a letter last week to acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel requesting additional details regarding exchanges between Lerner and the FEC. Obama to nominate restructuring specialist to head IRS . The e-mails that congressional Republicans released only reference and request publicly available information on the two groups. McGahn told CNN, however, that the additional e-mails he has seen do not clearly state whether the FEC was only seeking public data.  Asking for private data would most likely be a violation of federal law. McGahn was not able to specify whether contact was initiated by Lerner or the FEC, which regulates political speech and handles numerous complaints every election cycle about alleged violations of its campaign rules and regulations. Contacted by CNN on Monday, the IRS emphasized that the agency ""takes its obligation to protect confidential taxpayer information very seriously."" An IRS spokeswoman noted that the agency is prohibited from discussing information contained in specific tax returns. Republicans -- led by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa -- insist that after President Barack Obama's 2008 election, the IRS started intentionally targeting conservative outfits seeking tax-exempt status. The prospect of potential FEC involvement raises the prospect of a broader federal targeting effort. Democrats argue there is nothing sinister and that the contact is nothing more than requests for information that is already in the public domain. Still, Republicans question why FEC staffers would bother contacting Lerner -- herself a former FEC employee -- for information already publicly available. Lerner made headlines after she invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when called before the House Oversight Committee in May to testify on the controversy. ""Things seemed weird to me"" after examining the undisclosed e-mails, McGahn told CNN. ""The FEC has not had a good track record with calling balls and strikes. They've been criticized for not playing fair."" If nothing else, he added, this ""creates the appearance that people are being selectively targeted.  And that's something that should never happen."" American Future Fund founder Nick Ryan argued in a written statement last week that the publicly released correspondence between the IRS and the FEC ""indicates questionable behavior."" ""We will cooperate with (the) ongoing investigations to root out the bad actors in the politically driven, out-of-control bureaucracy the IRS and the government has become."" For their part, Democrats have dismissed the latest revelations and insist groups on both the left and the right were improperly scrutinized as part of a clumsy administration of vague election-related tax laws. ""House Republicans are doing everything they can to distract attention from their inability to focus on jobs and the economy,"" said Josh Drobnyk, a spokesman for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which is also investigating the alleged targeting. ""Republicans are throwing mud against the wall with the hope that some will stick."" To date, Republican-led IRS investigations of tea party targeting have uncovered no evidence any of it was directed by Obama political officials. IRS interviews show no political bias, Democrats say .","Democratic chief of FEC says she doesn't know about the e-mails .

"Watching your health this Halloween doesn't have to be scary. Here are five easy things to keep in mind for you and your family to stay happy and healthy this Halloween. 1. Eat before you (trick or) treat . Hopefully you've already talked to the kids about their trick or treat strategy. Mentally prepare them not to snack while they're walking, and don't be one of those parents who drives them from door to door. ""Talking to them in advance (about not snacking) makes it a lot easier,"" said Wendy Palmer, a registered dietitian with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. She also makes sure her sons trick or treat on a full stomach. ""I know it's crazy that night with everything going on, but you should make it a huge priority that your kids eat dinner before you go out,"" Palmer said. ""Even a quick peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich and a piece of fruit. Kids are really in tune with their appetite and won't be as tempted to snack if they are full."" It's only after Palmer's little Superman and Ninja Turtle get home this year that they can pick out a piece or two. Binge eating -- for child or parent -- is not allowed. Did you know the sugary loot children collect on Halloween adds up to about 11,000 calories, according to Children's Healthcare testing? (They were vague about what happened to the candy afterward.) That's the equivalent of a week's worth of calories. The candy also packs an average of 365 teaspoons of sugar -- the equivalent of 12 double-dip vanilla ice cream cones -- and the same amount of fat as 15 large servings of fast food French fries. What to do with all that candy? ""I would never recommend hiding food as it makes it more valuable to the kids,"" Palmer said. ""If you keep it in the house, it should be free game for mom and dad as well as the kids."" Pure chocolate stays good for about two years without causing any real health risks, although the texture changes after about 12 months. If you are counting calories as you snack, sugar candies tend to be lower in calories than chocolate. Dentists hate the sticky stuff, though, as it is harder on your teeth. If your child has food allergies, be sure to read candy wrappers. Keep in mind, mini-size servings of the candy you know and love can contain different ingredients than their larger cousins. Mireille Schwartz has a daughter, Charlotte Jude, with severe peanut and tree nut allergies.  She founded the Bay Area Allergy Advisory Board and says Halloween is her busy season.  She advises parents to talk to their neighbors about keeping a separate bowl of allergen-free candy for kids like her daughter. Parents who worry about their kids eating Halloween candy could try the Halloween Fairy method, also called the Switch Witch or Great Pumpkin. It's like the tooth fairy: Your kids set out at least some of their candy before they go to bed.  The fairy, witch or pumpkin comes in the middle of the night, takes it and leaves behind something they want, like a toy or tickets to something they want to do. Palmer does this at her house. ""It really works. My kids are actually willing to give up their candy, really,"" Palmer said. 2. Trick or drink . Maybe pumpkin ale is more your thing than pumpkin candy. Because it's a long night of waiting for the doorbell to ring, there is an easy trick to fool yourself into drinking less: Try a skinnier glass. Scientists at Iowa State University watched how much people pour and learned people struggle to assess volume, tending to focus more on the vertical rather than the horizontal measures. Participants poured around 12% more wine into a wide glass than a standard one. Drink from a narrower glass and you'll only think you are drinking more. Plus, you'll get a little exercise if you do have to get up for that refill. 3. Zombie-proof your face . Watch what you put on your face: You don't want a bad mask or face painting accident to leave your co-workers wondering why you are still in costume on Friday. The CDC suggests testing face paint on a small area on your arm. That way you can see if it irritates your skin before you slather it everywhere. Skin around your eyes is extremely sensitive, so check labels on face paint or makeup. If it says avoid applying by your eyes -- even if the people on the package are doing the opposite -- follow the directions. Throw away makeup that smells bad, as it may be contaminated. If your inner devil prefers a mask, wipe it down before wearing it. You likely weren't the first to try it on in the store. CNN Newsource affiliate KTVK took more than a dozen masks to be tested. Even the biologist was shocked by how many germs and molds he found. ""In terms of gross, this is particularly disgusting,"" said Stan Kikkert, a biologist from Mesa Community College. The microscopic monsters can cause infections. Alcohol should disinfect properly. Pay particular attention to the nose and mouth. 4. Just because Michael Jackson wore them ... Color contacts made Michael Jackson look extra spooky in ""Thriller,"" but unless you've got a prescription, don't wear them. Some stores do sell them, but that's illegal without a prescription. Optometrists warn the contacts aren't one-size-fits-all. ""Wearing lenses that don't fit properly can suffocate the eye, causing irritation and infection,""  Dr. Christopher Coad, director of Chelsea Eye Associates in New York, said in a statement. ""Bad infections can even lead to blindness and/or loss of the eye."" If you want to wear them, get a prescription. 5. Don't let chocolate go to the dogs . If you dress up your pet, make sure the costume lets them breathe and move. Avoid costumes with small parts they might swallow. Speaking of eating, chocolate may be a favorite in your goodie bag, but it can be deadly to dogs and cats. Pet insurance company Petplan sees 25% more claims during Halloween -- more than any other week in the year. Swallowed wrappers and lollipop sticks can cause blockages that might not be noticed for days. The darker the chocolate, the deadlier it is to your pet, according to Dr. Ron DeHaven with the American Veterinary Association. ""When kids come home after a night of trick or treating and dump their bag of candy, be sure that your pets are safely away in another room away from your kid's loot,"" DeHaven said. Store it somewhere where your pet can't get to it. If pets do get hold of chocolate, call your vet immediately.  The ASPCA has a poison hot line, too: (888) 426-4435.","Eat before trick or treating to limit snacking .

"She likes Target, the Food Network and sun-dried tomatoes. She loves taking pictures of her dog Beast, and admits to checking her phone ""every five seconds."" Priscilla Chan vaulted into the spotlight on Saturday when it was revealed she had married longtime boyfriend Mark Zuckerberg -- billionaire and Facebook founder. The wedding, according to media reports, came within days of Chan's graduation from medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. The two met more than nine years ago while both were studying at Harvard. In a 2005 Harvard Crimson story about Zuckerberg leaving the university, he is quoted as asking Chan, identified as a ""passing friend,"" ""Hey, Priscilla, do you want a job at the Facebook?"" ""I'd love a job at Facebook,"" she responds while ""offering him a Twizzler."" But Chan, who graduated from Harvard as a biology major in 2007, never worked for Facebook. Instead, the Braintree, Massachusetts, native worked as a fourth- and fifth-grade science teacher at The Harker School in San Jose, California, following her graduation. On Facebook, she described her job as ""hanging out with the little ones and trying to explain how the world works."" She left the school in June 2008 and entered medical school, according to Facebook. ""Learning to be a doctor,"" she noted on her page. On the UCSF web site, Chan is quoted along with other students on the school. ""I was attracted by the faculty's honesty and warmth and the curriculum's inter-disciplinary approach,"" she said. ""San Francisco's quirkiness and diversity sealed the deal."" Chan graduated from Harvard in 2007. A picture posted on another of her Facebook pages shows her in a cap and gown next to Zuckerberg, who was wearing his trademark hoodie. In another picture from 2007, Chan writes she is with Zuckerberg at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, noting, ""My date was wearing shoes!"" In March 2011, the couple adopted Beast -- and, of course, set up a Facebook page for him. ""I am a Puli, which is a type of Hungarian sheepdog,"" according to Beast's page. ""I live in Palo Alto with Mark and Cilla. I like cuddling and herding things."" On his page, Beast is shown lying on Chan's computer keyboard as she looks at the screen; peering into the fridge for a snack; and describing his ""favorite thing in the world ... pooping on Mark's white rug."" Beast is also shown on Chan's page, which had been updated as of Sunday to show her married to Zuckerberg. However, her pages also show a keen sense of humor. She writes that she ""loves cooking and soft things"" and enjoys diet  A&W. ""I am a simple creature,"" she writes. One with the power to help change the world: Zuckerberg told ABC News this month that dinner table conversations with Chan helped him formulate an organ-donation initiative on Facebook. ""She's going to be a pediatrician, so our dinner conversations are often about Facebook and the kids that she's meeting,"" he said. Chan told him, he added, of patients ""getting sicker as they don't have the organ that they need."" According to her Facebook page, Chan speaks English, Spanish and Cantonese. Zuckerberg told ABC that Chan inspired him to try to learn Mandarin Chinese in one year. The venture wasn't very successful, he said, but he picked up enough to talk with Chan's elderly grandmother.","Priscilla Chan marries longtime boyfriend Mark Zuckerberg .

"(CNN) -- Thomas Hagan, the only man who admitted his role in the 1965 assassination of iconic black leader Malcolm X, was paroled Tuesday. Hagan was freed a day earlier than planned because his paperwork was processed more quickly than anticipated, according to the New York State Department of Correctional Services. Hagan, 69, walked out of the minimum-security Lincoln Correctional Facility at 11 a.m. The facility is located at the intersection of West 110th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. Hagan had been in a full-time work-release program since March 1992 that allowed him to live at home with his family in Brooklyn five days a week while reporting to the prison just two days. Last month, Hagan pleaded his case for freedom: To return to his family, to become a substance abuse counselor and to make his mark on what time he has left in this world. He was dressed in prison greens as he addressed the parole board. He had been before that body 14 other times since 1984. Each time, he was rejected. Hagan was no ordinary prisoner. He is the only man to have confessed in the killing of Malcolm X, who was gunned down while giving a speech in New York's Audubon Ballroom in 1965. ""I have deep regrets about my participation in that,"" he told the parole board on March 3, according to a transcript. ""I don't think it should ever have happened."" Hagan had been sentenced to 20 years to life imprisonment after being found guilty at trial with two others in 1966. The other two men were released in the 1980s and have long denied involvement in the killing. To win his release, Hagan was required to seek, obtain and maintain a job, support his children and abide by a curfew. He must continue to meet those conditions while free. He told the parole board he's worked the same job for the past seven years. He told the New York Post in 2008 he was working at a fast-food restaurant. A parole officer checked on him while outside prison, and he had to undergo random drug tests. CNN was unable to reach Hagan for a comment about his release. The Nation of Islam declined comment for this story. Malcolm X is best known as the fiery leader of the Nation of Islam who denounced whites as ""blue-eyed devils."" But at the end of his life, Malcolm X changed his views toward whites and discarded the Nation of Islam's ideology in favor of orthodox Islam. In doing so, he feared for his own life from within the Nation. Malcolm X remains a symbol of inspiration for black men, in particular, who are moved by his transformation from a street hustler to a man the late African-American actor Ossie Davis eulogized as ""our own black shining prince."" The ballroom where he was killed has now been converted into The Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. Board Chairman Zead Ramadan said the center doesn't have a position on Hagan's release. ""I personally find it strange that for a couple decades any person convicted in the assassination of such an iconic figure would be allowed such leniency,"" Ramadan said. There's outrage among some African-Americans, he said, that he's being released. Would he be set free if he had killed an iconic white leader? ""It's really a struggle for Muslims to contemplate this issue, because our faith and our religion is full of examples where we have to exert mercy,"" he added. ""The Malcolm X story has not ended. His populuarity has grown in death. ... Only God knows why this was allowed to happen."" The center is preparing for a special service next month to celebrate what would have been Malcolm X's 85th birthday. Would the center welcome Hagan if he asked to attend? ""We'd cross that bridge if he called us,"" Ramadan said, ""Think about that: How far-fetched is it that he could meet one of the daughters of Malcolm X? And what's going to happen then? Mercy, fury, anger, emotions -- who knows?"" Killed in front of his family . On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X took to the stage of the Audubon Ballroom, a site often used for civic meetings. His wife, Betty Shabazz, and four children were in the crowd. ""I heard several shots in succession,"" his wife later told a Manhattan grand jury. ""I got on the floor, and I pushed my children under the seat and protected them with my body."" Gunshots continued to ring out, she said. Her husband's body was riddled with bullets. The native of Omaha, Nebraska, was 39. ""Minister Malcolm was slaughtered like a dog in front of his family,"" A. Peter Bailey, one of Malcolm X's closest aides, told The New York Times on the 40th anniversary of the killing. The assassination came after a public feud between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam's founder, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X had accused Muhammad of infidelity and left the Nation in March 1964. ""For the next 11 months, there was a pattern of harassment, vilification and even on occasion literally pursuit in the streets of Malcolm by people associated with the Nation,"" said Claude Andrew Clegg III, author of a biography on Elijah Muhammad called An Original Man. ""Malcolm felt that if Elijah Muhammad snapped his fingers, then he could stop the escalation of the violent tone around the split of the two men. And I think there's some truth to that."" Over the years, the killing of Malcolm X has been the subject of much debate, with conspiracy theories involving the Nation of Islam and others. The Nation of Islam has repeatedly denied any involvement in Malcolm X's assassination. On a deadly mission . Hagan, then known by the name Talmadge X Hayer, was in his early 20s and a radical member of the Nation of Islam the day he entered the ballroom armed and ready to kill. His allegiance was to the Nation's founder, and he was outraged Malcolm X had broken from its ranks. After the shooting, Hagan tried to flee the scene but he was shot in the leg. He was beaten by the crowd before being arrested outside. Last month, he told the parole board he felt the urge to kill Malcolm X because of his inflammatory comments about the Nation's founder. ""It stemmed from a break off and confusion in the leadership,"" Hagan said. ""Malcolm X broke with the Nation of Islam, separated from the Nation of Islam, and in doing so there was controversy as to some of the statements he was making about the leader."" He added, ""History has revealed a lot of what Malcolm X was saying was true."" Two other men, Muhammad Abdul Aziz and Kahlil Islam, were also found guilty of murder in 1966 and received 20 years to life. Both proclaimed their innocence. Hagan, who eventually admitted his part in the murder, testified at trial and subsequent parole hearings that both men were innocent. Aziz was paroled in 1985; Islam was freed in 1987. At last month's parole hearing, Hagan again maintained that Aziz and Islam were not the other assassins. He said it was two other men who helped plot, plan and participate in the killing. Did they receive orders from the Nation to carry out the killing? ""I can't say that anyone in the Nation of Islam gave us the idea or instructed us to do it. We did this ourselves for the most part, yes,"" Hagan told the parole board. Hagan said he received a master's degree in sociology while incarcerated and that helped him deal with his actions from 45 years ago. ""I understand a lot better the dynamics of movements and what can happen inside movements and conflicts that can come up, but I have deep regrets about my participation in that."" He added, ""Unfortunately, I didn't have an in-depth understanding of what was really going on myself to let myself be involved in anything like that. ... I can't really describe my remiss and my remorse for my actions -- basically a very young man, a very uneducated man. "" He is still a Muslim but no longer a member of the Nation of Islam. He volunteers at a mosque to help young men. He told the parole board he hopes to become a qualified substance abuse counselor. His primary mission is to help his four children, ages 21, 17, 14 and 10. He has two other grown children. ""My focus is to maintain my family and to try to make things a little better for them. It's upward mobility, and to encourage my children to complete their education because it's a must.""","NEW: Thomas Hagan walks out of Lincoln Correctional Facility at 11 a.m.

"What would spur someone to walk up to a war memorial, fatally shoot a soldier guarding it, then rush into Canada's Parliament and open fire? The attacker, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, may have taken the answer to his grave when he himself was shot dead before he could seriously hurt anyone inside Parliament. Yet, bit by bit, we're learning about the 32-year-old Zehaf-Bibeau, a man with a criminal record and, according to a friend, an unstable mind. Investigators are digging to find out more. One thing they already know, though, is that the bloodshed is ""a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,"" according to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Here's what we know so far about Michael Zehaf-Bibeau: . He's the son of a Libyan father, Canadian mother . He was born October 16, 1982, to father Bulgasem Zehaf and mother Susan Bibeau, according to court documents tied to his parents' 1999 divorce. His father is from Libya, while his mother is Canadian, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said. The Globe and Mail newspaper described the father, Zehaf, as a businessman. Zehaf-Bibeau's mother is the deputy chairwoman of the immigration division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, according to her official profile. She's been with that agency since 1990, having worked as a refugee protection officer, legal adviser and manager of operational support, among other roles. ""I know that the mother was very caring and a very involved parent. Actually both parents seem to have been,"" Janice Parnell, a former neighbor, told CNN partner network CTV. ""The boy seemed to have had a very good upbringing. He had a good home base. He was involved in community things."" He lived in several places in Canada . According to Canadian media reports, Zehaf-Bibeau worked as a miner and a laborer at various points in his life. Not only did he change jobs, he changed places. Born in Montreal, Zehaf-Bibeau also lived in Calgary and most recently in Vancouver, according to Paulson. He had a criminal record . One way that authorities traced Zehaf-Bibeau's past was by following his criminal record. Paulson said that  Zehaf-Bibeau's ""record indicated infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities."" Specifically, court documents obtained by CNN partner network CBC reveal Zehaf-Bibeau was charged with drug possession in Quebec in 2004. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. In 2011, he was charged with robbery and uttering threats in Vancouver, CBC reported. He was found guilty of only the second charge and sentenced to a day in jail. What, if anything, does this criminal record have to do with what happened Wednesday? The RCMP commissioner said that Zehaf-Bibeau ""had a very developed ... non-national security criminality of violence and of drugs and of mental instability."" Investigators are trying to determine what role that criminal past, if any, played in Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization and decision to attack Wednesday, Paulson said. Sergeant-at-arms hailed as 'hero' Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' He asked to go to jail to overcome crack addiction . In December 2011, as part of a psychiatric evaluation prior to a trial in Vancouver, Zehaf-Bibeau said ""he wants to be in jail as he believes this is the only way he can overcome his addiction to crack cocaine,"" according to a psychiatric assessment provided by a Canadian court. The 2011 assessment continues, ""He has been a devoted Muslim for seven years and he believes he must spend time in jail as a sacrifice to pay for his mistakes in the past."" The psychiatric expert who completed the assessment wrote, ""I am unable to find any features of signs of a mental illness."" ""Although he seems to be making an unusual choice, this is insufficient basis for a diagnosis of mental disorder,"" the expert said. A convert to Islam, he had 'radical views' As mentioned , Zehaf-Bibeau converted to Islam about a decade ago. At some point after that, he became radicalized -- though officially haven't specified when or who he rubbed elbows with. Paulson, the RCMP commissioner, spoke Thursday about Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization as well as his ""association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views."" Asked later what he meant by ""association,"" the national police commissioner said Zehaf-Bibeau's ""email was found in the hard drive of somebody who was charged with a terrorist-related offense. ""What does that mean?"" the commissioner asked. ""We need to understand what that means."" Some found his behavior troubling . Zehaf-Bibeau was asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque he attended because elders found his behavior ""erratic,"" a friend told the Globe and Mail. The friend, Dave Bathurst, said Zehaf-Bibeau once told him the ""devil is after him,"" and frequently talked about supernatural spirits. ""I think he must have been mentally ill,"" Bathurst told the paper. He wanted to go to Syria, couldn't get passport . Zehaf-Bibeau spoke of wanting to go to the Middle East to study. Bathurst, the friend, told the Globe and Mail that he ""urged his friend to make sure study was on his mind and not something else."" More specifically, his mother told authorities Wednesday that her son ""wanted to travel to Syria,"" according to Paulson. He applied for a passport, which was ""subject to an investigation,"" at the time of the Ottawa attack, the commissioner said. ""I think the passport figured prominently in his motives and -- I'm not inside his head -- but I think it was central to what was driving him,"" Paulson said. He visited the U.S. at least four times . U.S. law enforcement officials are tracing back Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's travel to the United States and interviewing people with whom he came into contact, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. He visited at least four times, most recently in 2013, the official said. There's no reason to believe he's connected to any extremists in the United States, the official said. He had 'connections' to jihadists, wasn't necessarily part of a big network . Zehaf-Bibeau had ""connections"" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. According to two U.S. counterterrorism officials, Zehaf-Bibeau was connected to Hasibullah Yusufzai through social media. Yusufzai is wanted by Canadian authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside Islamist fighters in Syria, The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, reported. Other radicalized individuals connected to Zehaf-Bibeau are still believed to be in Canada, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. Early indications are that his connections involved ""interactions"" online, including via Islamic extremist websites, a U.S. source told CNN. There is no evidence so far that Zehaf-Bibeau had any ""operational links"" to other jihadists, according to the source, who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack. And when asked Thursday by CNN's Christiane Amanpour if Zehaf-Bibeau is linked to a wider network of jihadists, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said ""there's no evidence, at this stage, for us to know that. ... That's something authorities are looking at right now."" He was not on a Canadian list of possible extremists . Whatever his associations, Zehaf-Bibeau wasn't high on Canadian authorities radar when it comes to potential terrorist attacks. He was not among about 90 individuals that Canadian authorities are examining for possible Islamic extremist ties. ""Had we have known that he wanted to travel to Syria, and had we had some basis to suspect that he wanted to do that for a criminal purpose, then he certainly would have been"" on that list, Paulson said. The commissioner also noted, ""There is no one path or formula to ... radicalization. And understanding each individual's path to that state is the challenge."" He recently came to Ottawa, was staying at shelter . Paulson said  Zehaf-Bibeau had been in the Canadian capital since at least October 2. During those few weeks, he stayed at the Ottawa Mission shelter, according to residents there. One resident, who asked to be identified only as Brian, recalled running into Zehaf-Bibeau -- who was then chanting and praying -- on the shelter's stairs the night before the attack. ""I just walked by and I started singing (a Christian song),"" Brian said. ""And it didn't affect him at all. He just kept going."" Perhaps related to his short time there, Zehaf-Bibeau didn't frequent mosques in Ottawa, according to Aymler mosque imam Mohammed Lahlou . ""We have no clue about that person,"" Lahlou said. ""And that kind of person should not have any place in our community."" He is believed to have acted alone . All day Wednesday, Canadian officials vacillated back and forth on whether Zehaf-Bibeau acted alone. By Wednesday night, they settled on the answer: yes. ""It appears there was just one shooter and that shooter is dead,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He's not connected to a similar incident this week . On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" killed a Canadian soldier with his car in Quebec. That man, Martin Rouleau Couture, was then shot and killed. Paulson said Thursday that investigators have not found any link between Couture and  Zehaf-Bibeau.

"Legendary photographer Michel du Cille, a 26-year veteran of The Washington Post, unexpectedly died on Thursday while on assignment in Liberia. The Post said du Cille, 58, collapsed ""during a strenuous hike on the way back from a village"" affected by the African country's Ebola outbreak. He was traveling with Post correspondent Justin Jouvenal. ""He remained unconscious, and was taken to a nearby clinic, where he had difficulty breathing,"" the Post said. ""He was then transported to Phebe hospital, two hours away, where he was declared dead by doctors."" The news stunned many staffers at the Post, where du Cille was respected and beloved. He was a three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the highest honor in print journalism. Post executive editor Marty Baron called du Cille ""one of the world's great photographers."" Du Cille's wife, Nikki Kahn, also is a photographer. ""Michel du Cille was one of the people who made the Post the Post,"" the newspaper's senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg wrote on Twitter. ""We lost one of our heroes today,"" wrote Emilio Garcia-Ruiz, the Post's managing editor for digital. Lenny Bernstein, who traveled with du Cille on an Ebola reporting trip in September, wrote, ""An indescribable loss for us and the people of Africa you brought into our homes with your photos."" According to the Post, du Cille had taken a four-week break and had gotten back to Liberia on Tuesday. ""Michel died at 58 doing the work he loved,"" Baron said in a memorandum to staffers. ""He was completely devoted to the story of Ebola, and he was determined to stay on the story despite its risks. That is the sort of courage and passion he displayed throughout his career.""

"Britain's Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is spending a second day in a central London hospital Tuesday after being admitted with acute morning sickness. ""The Duchess of Cambridge is continuing to feel better,"" a St. James's Palace spokesman told CNN Tuesday afternoon. Her husband, Prince William, arrived Tuesday morning to visit her at King Edward VII Hospital, after spending much of the day at her bedside Monday. The news that he and Catherine are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage was announced by the palace Monday as she was admitted for treatment, and followed months of tabloid speculation. The duchess is likely to remain in the hospital for several days, the palace said Monday. The palace said her illness is hyperemesis gravidarum, which involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy. Read more: Who can inherit the British throne? ""As the pregnancy is in its very early stages, Her Royal Highness is expected to stay in hospital for several days and will require a period of rest thereafter,"" the statement said. Catherine, 30, is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, Clarence House told CNN, so the palace is not announcing a due date for the child. William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday. Planned changes to the law of succession that end the tradition of a boy jumping over an elder sister are already de facto in effect, the Cabinet Office said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Tuesday that all 16 countries that recognize the British monarch as their head of state have formally agreed to the change and British lawmakers will change the rules as soon as possible. Clegg also said that the change in succession will allow someone in line to the throne to marry a Catholic -- but not to be a Catholic. The Church of England is the nation's official church. It split from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. William and Catherine were married at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, in London's biggest royal wedding in three decades. The baby would be the first grandchild of the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Baby news sparks media frenzy . British bookmaker William Hill said it would be paying out ""a small five-figure sum"" to people who had placed bets on William and Catherine having a baby in 2013. Wagers are now being taken on the likely name, gender and hair color of their first-born, the bookie said in a written statement. It has Frances and John as the favorites for the baby's name, at 9-to-1, with Charles, Victoria and George at 10-to-1. ""We fully expect that the betting public will get involved in speculating what the baby will be called,"" said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly. Fellow bookmaker Ladbrokes has Elizabeth -- the name of the baby's great-grandmother -- as an 8-to-1 favorite, with Frances, John, Charles and George at 10-to-1. The news of Kate's pregnancy immediately became a top trending topic worldwide on Twitter. Former PM: William and Kate reinvigorated monarchy . British Prime Minister David Cameron was quick to tweet his joy: ""I'm delighted by the news that the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a baby. They will make wonderful parents."" British Labour Party leader Ed Miliband tweeted: ""Fantastic news for Kate, William and the country. A royal baby is something the whole nation will celebrate."" Catherine is an art history graduate and the eldest child of Michael and Carole Middleton, self-made millionaires who run a party-supplies company. In photos: Duchess of Cambridge at 30 . Tabloid speculation about a pregnancy increased in September when Catherine substituted water for wine during a state dinner toast in Singapore. The buzz reached a boil two weeks ago when Australia's New Idea magazine quoted close friend Jessica Hay saying her former schoolmate, Catherine, would soon announce ""wonderful, happy news."" Life & Style magazine in the United States published its own ""exclusive"" with the same Hay quotes of a December announcement, which she said she had on ""the highest authority."" A family history website did the math last summer and predicted Catherine would be with child by November, according to a Time.com report. Genesreunited.co.uk calculated that ""the average period between a royal wedding taking place and the couple's child being born is 851 days."" Based on that, it predicted a pregnancy in November and a birth on August 27, 2013.

"I always look forward to a good Super Bowl party, especially one with a delicious spread of food. But when I decided to go vegan, I worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy the array of tasty snacks I'd traditionally binged on while watching the big game. Luckily, I was wrong. In fact, I -- and several of my meat-loving friends -- actually prefer some of these treats to their dairy- and/or meat-infused counterparts. So whether you're vegan, have vegan friends or just want to try something new, check out these ideas for tasty vegan snacks guaranteed to satisfy any football fan. upwave: A carnivore's guide to becoming vegan . Buffalo Cauliflower-Wing Pizza With Tofu Blue-Cheese Spread by Keepin' It Kind . This dish combines two great party foods (both personal favorites): pizza and buffalo wings. A cauliflower buffalo wing may sound odd, but if you give it a chance, you'll likely enjoy it. Roasting the cauliflower gives it a crunchy yet chewy -- but not rubbery -- texture, so you avoid the sogginess associated with most boiled/steamed cauliflower. Combine that with the crispy cornmeal crust and faux (but still tasty) blue-cheese spread, and partygoers will be dancing in the endzone with every bite. Mexicali Sliders by Chef Chloe . Sure, sliders may seem like a snack more apt for the World Series than the Super Bowl, but these delicious little ""burgers"" are going to be the talk of your football party. The caramelized onions folded into the savory black bean patties infuse a flavor not achievable by just piling them on top, and the carrots, onion, chili powder and cilantro add a unique, zesty kick not found in other burgers, regardless what they're made of. Add to this the fresh, homemade guacamole and you have a truly southwestern sensation guaranteed to warm you up, no matter how your team is doing. And don't forget the mango sauce! Its sweet flavor complements the taste of the rest of the burger quite well. upwave: Why avocados are good for you . Baked sriracha potato chips by Oh My Veggies .

While there are plenty of vegan options available, there's nothing like the satisfaction that comes from knowing you made these from scratch and didn't just dump them out of a greasy bag. Plus, you have complete control of their flavor level and crunchiness. I love the kick sriracha gives this recipe, so I add a little more than others with tamer taste buds might like, giving me an excuse to make two batches: really spicy for me and not-too-spicy for my wife and our guests. This recipe is ultra simple: You just need a Russet potato, sriracha, peanut oil and salt. Apple nachos by Allyson Kramer . If there's one item I expect to see at any Super Bowl party, it's a plate of nachos. But apple nachos instead of traditional corn chips?! Sure! You'll appreciate the crisp crunch of the apples in this dessert-like dish, and the always-winning combo of peanut butter and chocolate mixes well with the flavor of the apples, nuts and coconut. Plus, this recipe will give your Super Bowl spread the sweet-tooth fix guests will likely be craving after those savory snacks.

"The corpses lay strewn in the restive Syrian city of Douma, all slain in what residents there call a government-backed ""massacre."" The scene in the aftermath of the assault, punctuated by images of grief-stricken people and blood-covered pavement, was recorded last month by opposition activists who braved the wrath of Syrian security and slipped into the suburban Damascus city to bear witness to the tumult with their cameras. The three-man media team moved about the pockmarked urban battleground in shadows and whispers. Edging step-by-step and block-by-block, they hugged buildings' walls to avoid catching the eyes of rooftop snipers. But they would pick up the pace amid bursts of gunfire. That was at the end of June. The intense bombardment of Douma by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces in the days that followed trapped the activists for more than a week, with government forces blocking the routes out of town and shelling forcing them to take shelter. Bracing for a Syria showdown . The footage -- just delivered to reporters in Lebanon -- also highlights the resolve of a guerrilla force of activist-journalists: brave souls who've risked their lives since March 2011 to record examples of the regime's actions. The carnage is the latest example of what activists say is relentless abuse against civilians by al-Assad's security apparatus over the past 16 months. Douma, a major city in the province of Rif Damashq -- meaning Damascus countryside, which includes the suburbs that surround the capital city -- has been consumed by bloodshed since the protests last year morphed into a nationwide uprising against the regime. These latest sights, recorded by the activists at a dingy building in the dark of night, bear witness to the grim conflict in cities, towns and villages across Syria. The people seen dead in the scene were among 45 people killed in an attack. Residents say Syrian security forces raiding a building in search of weapons wiped out members of several families. One image shows a little girl sprawled among the dead, many of the bodies covered in bloody funeral sheets. A man points to a body and says ""he was executed, a civilian."" He points to a second corpse and says, ""This is his cousin, shot because he tried to save him."" Another man said security forces ordered men and women into two rooms and executed them, one after the other. CNN cannot independently verify these accounts. But the aftermath rings true for Syrians caught in the maelstrom of what is now called a civil war and the sight has become routine in areas where resolute residents have not buckled under to regime soldiers and their militia allies. Residents prepared the bodies for burial by unceremoniously wrapping up the dead in funeral sheets and removing them from the building where they were found. It is only now that the activists who filmed the grisly scenes were able to get the footage to Lebanon. The risk, the activists say, is worth it. Syrians activists say the world needs to get one more glimpse of the horror and despair engulfing Syria.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul is appearing in a new wave of ads for Republican Senate candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire less than one week before Election Day. The Chamber of Commerce, which produces the ads and has featured Paul in a previous round of spots, says it's using the Kentucky Republican as a voice to appeal to independent voters. And it's not a bad arrangement for the likely White House hopeful: The new ads appear in the first two presidential primary states. ""If you're a freedom-loving, liberty-loving voter, I urge you to get out and vote for Joni Ernst this Tuesday,"" he says in a spot -- first shared with CNN -- for Iowa's GOP Senate nominee. He repeats a similar message in a separate ad for Scott Brown in New Hampshire, but adds a special touch for the Granite State's politically-mixed climate. ""If you're a freedom-loving, liberty-loving, leave-me-the-hell-alone voter, I urge you to get out and vote for Scott Brown this Tuesday,"" Paul says. The ads appear to have been shot in the same setting as Chamber ads that he cut for GOP Senate nominees in Alaska and North Carolina, two closes races with for potential of a libertarian spoiler. A Chamber source said the ads ""fit into our theme this year of using credible messengers in target races, particularly to help break through the clutter and carry the free enterprise message."" Paul has repeatedly said he'll announce his 2016 decision in the spring. If he decides to run as expected, it could be a big boost for him to get this kind of exposure in Iowa and New Hampshire -- and the blessing of a major mainstream and respected Republican group like the Chamber. Talking about the first round of ads, he told CNN in New Hampshire earlier this month that he thinks his appeal goes ""beyond the Republican Party"" and he can be helpful in bringing in independents. ""At the very end, it's that five or 10 percent that are undecided, might vote for a third party, or might vote independent that we really need,"" he said. ""I'm trying hard to let people know that Republicans will do things differently if we elect a Republican majority.""","Rand Paul is in two new ads for Senate candidates in New Hampshire and Iowa .

"(CNN)When it's completed, it will be so large as to be visible from space. If it succeeds, it will create a top ecological attraction, reduce economic hardships and help modernize a community. It's the Giant Flag of South Africa, and it's an ambitious project by almost any measure. Located in the Camdeboo Municipality of Karoo, an arid region between Cape Town and Johannesburg, it will transform a patch of desert into a living national flag spanning about 163 acres, the size of 66 soccer fields. Some 2.5 million red, yellow, blue and green desert plants, including cacti and spekboom, will be arranged in a pattern like that of South Africa's flag. The flag's black triangular area will contain a 4-megawatt solar-panel field, generating much-needed electricity for the region. The idea is simple and elegant: use green tourism to fight poverty. Guy Lieberman came up with the idea after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when the South Africans played host and were united by the spirit of their flag. His employer, FCB South Africa, a communications firm, asked him to come up with a legacy project related to the flag. It's about ""how we treat ourselves, nature, our built environment, and how we choose to view our common future on the planet,"" Lieberman said. Organizers say the succulent plants will reintroduce nutrients to the soil and sequester upwards of 200 tons of carbon every year. With the looming threat of climate change, this can only be a good thing. Meanwhile, the solar panels are expected to power the equivalent of 4,000 homes. Organizers hope to complete the flag in 2017. ""The Giant Flag aims for a blend of ecological balance and social stability. One could call this compassionate capitalism,"" Lieberman said. ""If this works, we're looking toward a socioeconomic shift that will change realities in the Camdeboo forever."" Camdeboo Municipality, with a 40% unemployment rate and a marked racial and economic divide, has one of the worst income disparities in South Africa. The flag project, according to estimates, will create 700 jobs, most of them for women who can work on the botanical components. Local tourism is expected to increase by 20% to 25%. Jeunesse Parks, a longtime environmentalist and founder of Food and Trees for Africa, has high hopes for the venture. ""With the soil restoration, the carbon offsets, the message around renewable solar energy, as well as the socioeconomic impact this green innovation will have on a rural community, the flag is a truly unique initiative,"" she said. So far, funding for the $18 million project has come from sponsorships, partnerships and donations from local governments, private companies, nonprofits and individuals. Organizers say the next step is to leverage crowdsourcing on a large scale, which they hope will raise more than $2 million of the final price. People from around the world can adopt succulents for $10 each to help build the flag. If all goes well, the adopted plants will live for hundreds of years, forming a green legacy for each donor. Lieberman sees the Giant Flag as ""an opportunity to do something dramatic and wonderful that embodies the spirit of the nation -- beyond the politics and factions."" Indeed, South Africa has gone through great political upheaval and is still trying to find its identity in the post-apartheid era. If the Giant Flag can create a sustainable future, it may well turn into a national symbol.","A vast array of plants in the South African desert will be visible from space .
The colored plants will be arranged in a pattern like that of South Africa's flag .
The flag will harness solar power, generate jobs and electricity for the region ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A human rights protester was in police custody Monday after throwing a shoe at Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during a speech at Cambridge University. The shoe landed several meters from Wen Jiabao. The shoe landed several meters from the premier and the man was quickly apprehended by security and handed over to police for questioning on suspicion of committing a public order offence, according to witnesses. A student who witnessed the incident told CNN that the man had stood up and shouted, ""Why are you prostituting yourself? How can you listen to the lies he is telling?"" Cameras filming the speech remained fixed on Wen during the incident, but video images later showed an unidentified student being escorted out of the building by a university proctor. The student was then handed over to police, a university spokesman, who would not disclose his name due to 'university regulations,' told CNN. ""Fortunately the incident did not spoil the event. The auditorium was full, with nearly 500 people present, of whom just one misbehaved,"" a the spokesman said. ""At no stage was there any serious threat to the Premier, or anyone else."" The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said of the incident: ""The Chinese side has expressed its strong feelings against the occurrence of the incident. The British side said that they are very sorry that the incident should have happened and the person will be dealt with according to law. Facts have shown that the despicable behavior of the perpetrator is extremely unpopular and can in no way stem the tide of the growing friendly relations and cooperation between China and Britain."" The incident occurred while Wen, on a three day visit to the UK to strengthen economic ties, was speaking about China's role amid the global economic recession. On Sunday, several hundred Tibetan activists had demonstrated outside the Chinese Embassy Sunday to protest his visit to London. China has long been criticized by the international community for its human rights record in Tibet, where many Tibetans are pushing for greater autonomy and religious freedom. Monday's shoe-throwing incident is the second of its kind in less than two months. In December, an Iraqi journalist narrowly missed striking then-U.S. President George W. Bush with both his shoes during a news conference in Baghdad, where Bush was making a farewell visit. -- CNN's Per Nyberg and Bridget Fallon in London, Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad, and Erin Mclaughlin in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Shoe thrown at Wen Jiabao during lecture at Britain's Cambridge University .

"The West has slapped stringent sanctions on Russia in response to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, believed by the U.S. and others to have been shot down with a Russia-supplied Buk missile system by eastern Ukraine rebels. While the introduction of financial sanctions will create the most immediate squeeze on Russia, it is the crack-down on the arms trade which has triggered debate. Future imports and exports between the EU and Russia are now banned -- but existing contracts, including France's $1.6 billion Mistral-class warships deal, are allowed to go ahead. But Russia is one of the few countries in the world that is nearly self-sufficient in its defense production, according to IHS Jane's expert Guy Anderson. So will the arms embargo have an impact? Here is a cheat-sheet on Europe's arms trade with Russia. How big is the arms trade between Europe and Russia? European Union countries earned $583 million from weapons exports to Russia in 2013, the bulk of which was part-payment of the Mistral deal, according to analysis from IHS Jane's. Russia is, by comparison, the world's second largest military exporter after the U.S., earning $13.2 billion from arms exports last year. Its biggest customers are India and China, countries which have not joined the sanctions against Russia. The industry is heavily regulated and EU figures track the bloc's arms trade by licenses approved. In total, European Union countries granted 922 licenses to sell $259 million worth of weapons to Russia in 2012, according to the latest statistics available. However, according to Anderson, the licenses -- which in the UK, for example, expire after two years -- are more an ""expression of intent"" than indication of likely sales. The trade with Russia compares to $4.3 billion worth of weapons the EU licensed arms companies to sell to the U.S. What are the biggest deals? While Russia is a significant player in the supply of arms, it has also leaned on Europe for some big deals. The biggest -- and now most controversial -- is the Mistral contract of 2011, signed by France's previous government. The warships are powerful vessels equipped with six helicopter landing zones. Each of them can carry up to 16 heavy helicopters and around 500 marines. The first of the two carriers due to be delivered is now completing sea trials, and 400 Russian troops are currently training on it in the French port of Saint-Nazaire. David Prater, of Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said they were Russia's first ""serious"" weapon supplied by Europe. Russia's other significant deals include its purchase of two German engines for missile boats in 2001, and four light transport aircraft from the Czech Republic in 2012, according to the SIPRI databases. Details on the contracts are scarce but the Czech planes were reported to be worth around $3.2 million each. Russia also bought 60 army vehicles, reportedly worth estimated $24 million, from Italy in 2011. According to the SIPRI, Russia has also agreed to buy at least eight drones from Israel in 2009, worth a reported $50 million. Russia was also importing arms and military equipment from Ukraine, but the Russian Defense Ministry was reported saying it would phase this out within two years. ""Ironically, the loss of Ukraine as a supplier to Russia is far more significant that the loss of Europeans,"" Anderson said. ""A lot of subcontracted work for Russia's industrial base took place in Ukraine."" Russian President Vladimir Putin's office did not respond to a request for comment on the deals and impact of sanctions. Why is the Mistral deal so politically hot? The Mistral warships -- which experts say are ""very capable weapons of mobile war"" -- have landed France in a politically awkward spot. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius last week argued the country is contractually obligated to deliver the ships -- but his comments were made as  European relations with Russia deteriorated. UK Prime Minister David Cameron declared the deal's completion ""unthinkable"" before being slapped back by Fabius, who echoed the phrase in reference to the UK's involvement in the 2003 Iraq invasion. The Mistral deal keeps some 1,000 Frenchmen and women employed in a country with a 10% unemployment rate -- and reversing it would be costly. However, French President Francois Hollande has thrown doubt on delivery of the second ship, saying last week it ""depends on Russia's attitude."" What happens next? European leaders are trying to hit Russia where it hurts with the latest round of sanctions. As of Thursday, Russia state-owned banks will be restricted from accessing European capital markets and exports of oil-related equipment and technology to Russia will be slowed or stopped by red tape. All new contracts for arms imports and exports between the EU and Russia will stop, and there will be a prohibition on exporting goods and technology that can be used for both military and civilian purposes. But in the short-term, the arms ban is unlikely to have a significant impact on Russia's military might. ""The embargo in itself doesn't change anything in Russian military capabilities right now,"" Siemon Wezeman, senior researcher with SIPRI said. In the long term, he said, Russia could feel pain from losing access to the latest high-tech defense electronic systems developed in the EU.

"(CNN) -- Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho's uneasy relationship hit a new low as their ugly managerial spat overshadowed Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal Sunday to extend its lead at the top of the English Premier League. The pair squared up to each other and had to be separated by the fourth official after Wenger shoved Mourinho in the Chelsea technical area. The Arsenal boss was angered by Gary Cahill's challenge on Alexis Sanchez but the pair's seething rivalry has been a constant theme in the English football soap opera. Back in March, Mourinho labeled Wenger a ""specialist in failure"" and then his side rubbed salt into the open wound by thrashing Arsenal 6-0. It was also Wenger's 1,000th game in charge of the Gunners and he has now failed to beat his Portuguese nemesis in 12 tries. After the touchline incident, Chelsea proceeded to take the lead through Eden Hazard's first-half penalty after he was fouled by Laurent Koscielny. Arsenal was always a factor in a closely-fought match at Stamford Bridge and might have had a penalty when former player Cesc Fabregas appeared to block Jack Wilshere's shot in the area in the second half. Fabregas, whose signing by Chelsea from Barcelona dismayed Arsenal fans who hoped he might return to the Emirates, then set up Diego Costa for the clinching goal. His pinpoint pass, his seventh assist in the EPL this season, left Costa to score his ninth in seven games since moving from Atletico Madrid, another key Mourinho signing. The win left Chelsea five points clear of Manchester City at the top, with Arsenal in eighth, already nine points adrift. Both manager tried to play down the incident in post-match press conferences. ""Forget that (the push). A football pitch is a football pitch, so no problem,"" said Mourinho. ""It becomes heated because this is a big game, big clubs, big rivals, an iportant match for both teams. These conditions make a game of emotions. Wenger was asked if he regretted the incident. ""What is to regret after that? I wanted to go from A to B and somebody confronted me in between without any sign of welcome,"" said the Frenchman. ""B was Sanchez, to see how badly he was injured,"" he claimed. Earlier, Manchester United moved up to fourth with a 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford, but owed a lot to the goalkeeping heroics of David De Gea, who saved a first half penalty from Leighton Baines. United were already ahead through Angel Di Maria, but the visitors pulled level when Steven Naismith scored in the 55th minute. Colombian star Radamel Falcao put Louis Van Gaal's men ahead just after the hour with his first goal in English football before De Gea denied Leon Osman with a stunning save to preserve three points for his side. Tottenham Hotspur is up to sixth, level on points with United and Swansea, after a 1-0 win over their manager Mauricio Pochettino's former side Southampton. Christian Eriksen scored the only goal of the match at White Hart Lane in the first half. Ahead of the international break, Italian heavyweights Juventus and Roma played out a pulsating five-goal thriller in Turin. Both sides had won its opening five games in Serie A, but champion Juventus came out on top 3-2 thanks to a volleyed late winner from Leonardo Bonucci in the 86th minute. The first half saw a series questionable penalties for either side, the first two converted by Carlos Tevez for Juve and Francesco Totti for the visitors. Roma coach Rudi Garcia was sent to the stands for arguing the first penalty, but he would have been pleased to see Juan Iturbe put his side ahead on a breakaway in the 43rd minute. Juventus almost immediately drew level in first half injury time with another disputed penalty, put away by Tevez. The match looked headed for a draw until defender Bonucci proved an unlikely match winner, but there was still time for Alvaro Morata to clash with Roma defender Kostas Manolas and both were red-carded. European champions Real Madrid also scored a key victory Sunday, thumping Athletic Bilbao 5-0 in the Bernabeu, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick and Karim Benzema adding a double. The win takes Real to within four points of leaders Barcelona after seven rounds of La Liga.","Chelsea stretches EPL lead after beating Arsenal at Stamford Bridge .

"Four-year-old filly Treve defied her critics and the starting odds to secure back to back wins in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamps Sunday. Given the perfect ride by jockey Thierry Jarnet, 11-1 shot Treve stormed to the front in the final furlong to win from Flintshire and favored English filly Taghrooda. Unbeatable as a three-year-old, Treve had been winless after being kept in training, until giving a timely reminder of the old sporting adage that form is temporary, class is permanent. It was a fairytale victory for her trainer Criquette Head-Maarek, who has twice beaten life-threatening illnesses, and knew her horse had similar fighting qualities. She controversially took the decision to take famous jockey Frankie Dettori off the filly, replacing him with Jarnet, who rode Treve to the 2013 success and was winning his fourth Arc. ""This is a great personal satisfaction for me,"" said the 66-year-old from the famous Head racing dynasty, who have secured a string of Arc victories over the years as jockeys and trainers. Her grandfather William Head and father Alec trained two and four Arc winners respectively, while brother Freddie won three as a jockey. Head-Maarek has now trained three winners, the first back in 1979 before Treve's double triumph, but she believes this is her greatest achievement. ""It is the best race I have ever won with all the problems with her back and hoof and criticism aimed at her. This is brilliant, I'm not yet back down to earth yet! It is my best day,"" she added . Treve is only the seventh horse to win successive Arcs and the first since the Vincent O'Brien-trained Alleged was ridden to a 1978 success by legendary English jockey Lester Piggott. Andre Fabre's Flintshire rode a strong race, ahead of Oaks and King George heroine Taghrooda and St. Leger winner Kingston Hill. But the three-pronged Japanese challenge never materialized with Harp Star the best finisher in sixth place. The autumn showdown in Paris has the richest prize purse in the sport of flat racing at $5 million and attracts the leading Thoroughbred horses in the world to the French capital.","French-trained Treve wins Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe .

"Much as exit polls in the U.S. show after the election this week, the economy is a top concern for Chinese leaders as the ruling Communist Party (CCP) gathers Thursday for the 18th Party Congress. The party is expected to select Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang to become the president and premier, respectively, of China for the next decade. The new leaders will take over an economy at a crossroads. On one hand, many analysts predict that when they hand over the reins to the next leaders in 2023, China will be nearing the U.S. as the world's number one economy. On the other hand, the pair will be the first leaders in three decades since China opened to economic reform that haven't presided over double-digit growth. Xi Jinping: From 'sent-down youth' to China's top . ""We're going to have to see a new normal,"" said Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center, at a recent conference. ""The hyper-fast growth rate over the last 10 years is unlikely to be replicated in the future."" The challenge is moving China from an export and investment led economy to one based on domestic consumer-based growth.  The flood of investment and exports in the past decade helped the nation's economy grow an astounding five times -- from $1.5 trillion in 2002 to an estimated $8.3 trillion this year -- and leap-frogging from the world's sixth largest economy to its second. The stability of modern Communist Party rule has been built on the promise that it will create a better future for China's 1.3 billion citizens, one that has largely been delivered by leaders since Deng Xiaoping opened the country to economic reform in 1979. In that time, more than 600 million people have been lifted out of abject poverty. A government think tank predicted this week that in seven years 600 million Chinese will be part of its swelling middle class. More than half of the country's workers now reside in urban areas, as rural migrants move to cities for better employment opportunities. China's next leaders: Who's who . Now the economy has entered an adolescent phase, analysts say, with a burgeoning middle class that's spending more domestically -- making China the world's number market in everything from beer sales to car purchases. Yet the economy is still strongly tied to exports, as seen by its slowdown in the wake of the European debt crisis and anemic growth in the U.S. Beijing set a target of 7.5% this year, the first time the government has forecast growth below 8% in the past decade. ""The average migrant worker's wages increased 15% this year, and inflation is only 1.9%, so that means lower-wage workers can spend,"" said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. ""It's the middle class consumer that is getting squeezed, especially at multinational corporations, because their wages are being squeezed."" The expectations of China's emerging consumer class are also changing. ""When I came to China 20 years ago, the average age of a Chinese worker was 24 -- now the average age is 37,"" said Chris Devonshire-Ellis, the founding partner of Dezan Shira & Associates in Beijing, which advises firms on foreign direct investments. Shadow of Mao still lingers over China . ""When a worker is 24, he's interested in earning a bit of wages, chasing girls, buying cigarettes and beer,"" Devonshire-Ellis said. ""Now that guys is 37, married, has a kid, car, mortgage, wants to send kid to a good school, and travel abroad with the family on trips."" But as China's fortune's rise, more of that wealth is going into fewer hands. A study earlier this year by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in China four that China's top 10% of households surveyed have 57% of  the country's total income and 85% of total assets. ""Inequality is no longer just a social issue,"" Feng said. ""Very importantly, for the migrant (workers) -- there are about 200 million of them in the cities -- and their income has gone up fast but below those who are older city residents. What do you do with this? They require reform."" Addressing income disparity is a thornier proposition than simply building the new roads, airports and other infrastructure projects that have helped propel the Chinese economy. 'One party, two coalitions' -- China's factional politics . ""An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment,"" said Professor Gan Li, director of the China Household Finance Survey. ""If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services."" The pressure on health and pension services will soon skyrocket. China's one child policy started in the 1980s curbed population growth, but Beijing now faces a rising tide of retiring workers. By 2030 the number of people over the age of 60 will ""increase from about 185 million to over 350 million and that's going to be larger than the size of the United States (population),"" Wang noted. In his speech at the opening of the Party Congress, outgoing leader Hu Jintao made an ambitious target for 2020 to double per capita income in China from 2010 levels for both rural and urban dwellers -- the first time a resident's per capita income has been included in economic targets, state-run media Xinhua notes. China's 18th Party Congress: Why so secretive? ""The development gap between urban and rural areas and between regions is still large, and so are income disparities,"" Hu said. ""Unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development remains a big problem."" It's a clear sign Beijing is worried about income disparity, and the setting of hard targets could put fire to reforms. Time will tell if China's new leadership will be able to deliver.","Economy is a top concern for Chinese leaders as the ruling Communist Party (CCP) gathers .

"(CNN)Bill Cosby's long relationship with his beloved Temple University has come to an end, another effect of the scandal engulfing the once adored television star and comedian. Cosby's Monday resignation from Temple's board of trustees, a position he held for 32 years, was first reported in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Cosby also attended Temple. At least 17 women have spoken publicly accusing the comedian of sexual misconduct, and many of the women say he drugged them before he raped them. Some of the alleged attacks took place decades ago. Cosby's attorney, Martin D. Singer, has repeatedly denied the claims. Singer said in a written statement sent to CNN that it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" ""I have always been proud of my association with Temple University,"" Cosby said in a statement released by the university. ""I have always wanted to do what would be in the best interests of the university and its students. As a result, I have tendered my resignation from the Temple University Board of Trustees."" ""The Board of Trustees accepts Dr. Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university,"" was the university's response. Rape allegations won't go away for Bill Cosby . The board of trustees had been under pressure from alumni and other members of the Temple community to cut ties. A change.org petition demanding the university end its relationship with Cosby had more than 1,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon. The University of Massachusetts at Amherst recently also cut ties with Cosby. ""Bill Cosby has agreed to resign as an honorary co-chair of UMass Amherst's capital campaign. He no longer has any affiliation with the campaign nor does he serve in any other capacity for the university,"" said Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Cosby got his master's and doctorate in education from the university in the 1970s. Cosby's accusers . One of Cosby's accusers worked at Temple. In a report to police in her home province of Ontario, Canada, in January 2005,  Andrea Constand said that in January 2004, when she was a 31-year-old staffer for the Temple women's basketball team, she was at the comedian's Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy. She told police she later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray. Though no charges were filed, Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand that alleged 13 Jane Does had similar stories. One of those Jane Does is now talking publicly about her ordeal. Donna Motsinger, 73, said she worked at a restaurant in Sausalito, California, that was popular with celebrities in the early 1970s. She met Cosby there, and said he asked her to his show. She accepted. ""I was so young, so innocent, I was so impressed that somebody so famous wanted to go out with me. My goodness, I was over the moon,"" Motsinger told CNN. She said they stopped for gas and had an alcoholic beverage. By the time they got to the theater, she felt sick and asked for an aspirin. Motsinger said Cosby gave her what she thought was an aspirin. ""The next thing I remember from that minute on, after that there was some conversation and laughing and stuff, but then the next thing I remember and I don't know the time between the aspirin and this time but the next thing I remember I had become conscious in the limousine, he's next to me, he's got his hands on me and I look up I see the lights of the city. I could see it clear as a bell in my mind right now, the lights of the city coming back and it was all blurry, kind of the lights, and I passed out again,"" she said. Motsinger continued: ""The next thing I knew I woke up the next morning in my own bed, in my own house with all my clothes off except for my underwear and I didn't tell a soul."" At least 17 women have been speaking to various media outlets accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct, including 14 women who CNN has either spoken to, who have spoken on camera about their allegations, or whose public allegations have been addressed by Cosby's attorney. Cosby attorney John Schmitt sent a blanket denial of several allegations that have cropped up recently, but later amended his denial to say he wasn't referring to Constand, who resolved her differences ""to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago."" 'It's not gonna end here' Another of Cosby's accusers spoke to CNN on Monday. Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel, says Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. She alleges he gave her a pill and a glass of red wine shortly before she passed out. When asked what went through her mind when she heard there were other women accusing Cosby, Dickinson said: ""I am here for those women ... I want to validate these women and I want to applaud them for their courage."" At one point in the interview, she broke down in tears and covered her face. ""But I'm strong, and I'm gonna stand on my own two feet and I'm gonna tell my side of the story, and it's not gonna end here,"" she said. Singer, Cosby's attorney, has said that Dickinson's allegation is a ""fabricated lie,"" and that it contradicts what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview. The latest allegations come amid the revelation that Cosby gave an exclusive interview to the National Enquirer in exchange for the publication not printing the story of Beth Ferrier. Ferrier told media outlets in 2005 that she met Cosby in Denver in the mid-'80s. He mentored her for a time, but one night, she said, he gave her a drugged cappuccino. ""I woke up in my car in the parking lot with my clothes all a mess,"" she said. ""I wondered, I still wonder, 'What did he do with me? Why was my bra unhooked?'"" The two later conducted an ""on-and-off consensual affair"" that lasted several years, she told People magazine. At the time, Cosby's publicist told People that he had no comment. ""I would give them an exclusive story, my words"" Cosby said, according to court records of a 2005 deposition, talking about what his understanding was with the National Enquirer. ""What would they give you in return?"" he was asked. ""They would not print the story of -- print Beth's story,"" Cosby said. The transcript continues: ""Did you ever think that if Beth Ferrier's story was printed in the National Enquirer that that would make the public believe that maybe Andrea (Constand) was also telling the truth?"" ""Exactly,"" Cosby replied. CNN's Dana Ford, Ronni Berke and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","At least 17 women have spoken publicly accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct .

"People who suffer from migraines with aura during middle age have double the risk of developing Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders later in life than those who do not, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. Migraines are the most common brain disorder in both men and women, according to the World Health Organization, and one of the top 10 most debilitating conditions. Aura is the term used to describe the feelings and symptoms that happen shortly before and during a migraine. ""Roughly one-third of affected individuals can predict the onset of a migraine because it is preceded by an 'aura,' visual disturbances that appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines or a temporary loss of vision,"" according to the National Institutes of Health. Researchers followed more than 5,000 people between the ages of 33 and 65 for 25 years, who were originally enrolled in a clinical trial designed to study heart disease in Iceland. The participants were interviewed about migraine symptoms in middle age and then, about 25 years later, asked about Parkinson's disease symptoms. They were also asked about symptoms for a related disorder called Restless Legs Syndrome. The results were based on the study participants' self-reported diagnoses, though in the majority of the cases researchers confirmed the diagnoses by looking at medical records and the participants' medication use. ""The patients in this study were not carefully examined and definitely diagnosed with Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr. Michael S. Okun, national medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, which is why he believes more research is needed before drawing any conclusion that the two are related. ""Head trauma and other neurological issues can manifest with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease and future studies will need to better control for these factors."" Compared to those without headaches, people in the study who suffered from migraines with aura in middle age were about twice as likely to have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease when the researchers checked back. They were also more likely to report at least four symptoms commonly associated with Parkinson's disease later in life. Parkinson's-like symptoms were also more common in those with migraine without aura, though the link was not as strong, lead study author Ann Scher told CNN in an email. Scher, a professor of epidemiology at Uniformed Services University in Maryland, wants to make sure people understand the actual risk of Parkinson's disease in people with migraine is still very low. Researchers don't yet understand why migraines might be linked to Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders, Scher says. They don't believe that the link is due to medications taken to treat migraines, some of which block dopamine. Nor do they think that the link is due to related brain diseases, ""since we controlled for these factors."" Possible explanations for the connection, she agrees, might be a previous head injury or a shared genetic risk factor that increases the risk for both migraine and Parkinson's disease. One common link may be abnormalities in dopamine production and dopamine receptors in the brain, said Okun. Some groups suggest the same dopamine treatment that helps Parkinson's patients may also help with migraines. ""Another theory is that in migraine sufferers there seems to be a higher deposition of metals, such as iron, in the brain and specifically in areas important to movement,"" said Okun. ""Some experts believe that this metal deposition may place patients at risk for diseases like Parkinson's.""","Migraines are the most common brain disorder in men and women, WHO says .
Researchers followed more than 5,000 people for 25 years .
Experts say link between migraines and Parkinson's disease needs further study ."
"(CNN) -- The midterm elections are a week away. Control of the Senate will be decided by a handful of close contests that remain competitive in the final days. In an era of narrow majorities in the upper chamber, just one or two races can make all the difference in terms of who will be in control. Most experts are predicting that Republicans will gain the Senate, though there are a few outliers, like my colleague at Princeton University, Sam Wang, whose statistical models have been showing that Democrats can still be victorious. In the coming days, here are six campaigns to watch. In each of these states Republicans are holding their ground by connecting their opponent to President Obama while Democrats strike back by reminding voters of extremism in the GOP. Four of the states have incumbent Democratic senators who are waging close races for re-election. In the other two, the retirements of senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican, have created an opportunity the two parties are contesting. North Carolina: This is a Senate race that has been extremely expensive, with the national parties pouring money into advertising based on the view that this one can go either way, and it's close. Incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan is a Democrat who voted for President Obama's health care program and who has faced a tough challenge from Thom Tillis, a businessman who pushed back the tea party candidate in the Republican primary. Hagan, who had been expected to keep this seat, has made some mistakes along the way, such as skipping a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting to raise campaign funds, something that was a no-no in her home state, where the military is a cherished institution. Superstars from each party have made appearances for the campaign—Hillary Clinton for Hagan and Rand Paul for Tillis—trying to boost their competitive edge. Outside groups and the National Senatorial Republican Committee are pouring money into Tillis' campaign, smelling the potential for a real upset. President Obama's drive to increase African-American turnout is key for the Democratic strategy. Republicans are continuing to hammer away at Hagan by criticizing her party for how the White House has handled the Ebola epidemic and ISIS. Politics: How the 'war on women' is changing . Colorado: This is a state that makes Democrats very nervous. A recent poll by a Democratic company reported that this race is a deadlock, a disappointment to Democrats who thought they were safely in the lead. Their hope was that Sen. Mark Udall would be able to capitalize on the demographic trends—such as the expanding population of Latino-Americans—that have been building a solid base for the party, allowing President Obama to win in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. But recent polls have shown that Rep. Cory Gardner is doing much better than expected, including with female voters. This in itself has caused Democrats great concern, because Udall has made his opponent's position on women's issues the major focus of his campaign. ""Congressman Cory Gardner's history of promoting harsh anti-abortion laws,"" explained the narrator in one of his ads, ""is disturbing."" Alaska: Freshmen Democrat Mark Begich is scrambling to keep his seat. From the start, this has been one that was always going to be tough for Democrats to retain. Begich barely won in 2008 in this Republican state, and he has suffered repeatedly from being connected to President Obama's unpopular presidency. Begich was also accused of allowing a misleading advertisement that suggested Attorney General Dan Sullivan had responsibility for a mistake that allowed a sex offender to go free and commit another sex assault and killings. Right now, Sullivan is enjoying a growing lead. Arkansas: Even with the Clinton machine rallying to his side, Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor has been struggling against GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, a veteran and Harvard graduate who has been hammering away at Pryor for his ties to President Obama, a common theme on the campaign trail. A recent article in The New York Times showed how Democrats face a number of big demographic challenges in what was once a solid Democratic state, like the massive growth of population in the conservative exurbs. One new poll shows that Cotton is ahead by 49% to 41%. Pryor has also made a number of embarrassing mistakes, including being unable to come up with an answer to a question asked of him during a campaign rally about how the White House was handling Ebola. In this state, voter turnout will be absolutely key. Democrats are counting on high levels of spending on ground operations and a surge of African-American voters to bring them to victory. Georgia: Despite a series of setbacks, such as the leak of a revealing campaign memo, Michelle Nunn has been putting on a strong campaign against businessman David Perdue to capture the seat held by retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican. Democrats are going to need Georgia if they are going to keep control of the Senate. While this election might result in a runoff in January, Nunn has been doing a good job overcoming the negative sentiment associated with President Obama by hitting hard against her opponent's record in the private sector, using some of the same kinds of attacks that were used against Mitt Romney on issues like outsourcing. Perdue has struck back by saying that the Democrat doesn't really understand ""what it takes to create jobs and create economic value,"" which he says he does through his work with the retailer Dollar General. Of course, Nunn's beloved family name also helps. Iowa: The right-wing state senator Joni Ernst has rattled the electorate with a controversial campaign that many thought would never work. While the GOP expunged tea party candidates in most of the primaries, Ernst was one of the exceptions. Bidding to take the seat held by retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, Ernst turned heads with an ad boasting of her experience castrating hogs, saying she would do the same in Washington to cut government spending. ""Mother. Soldier, Independent leader,"" reads the sign on her campaign bus. Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley—who has received the support of Democrats like Michelle Obama—is having trouble stopping Ernst in the polls. Begala: Candidate's gun remarks should scare us . There are a few other races, such as in Kansas, where the outcome remains uncertain and each party is pouring in as much money and manpower as they can in the final few days to swing states their way. Election night should be interesting, as we'll see if Democrats can somehow defy the historical trend of the party of the White House doing poorly in midterms, or whether Republicans lock up control of Congress and give President Obama two more years of gridlock as he finishes his term.","The outcome of six races could determine whether the U.S. remains in Democrats' hands .

"Hillary Clinton used an appearance in Ottawa, Ontario, on Monday to talk up the work she did to combat ""violent extremism"" during her time as secretary of state. ""We took decisive action against the threat of violent extremism,"" Clinton said of her four years as America's top diplomat, ""certainly most practically from Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda's syndicate of terror."" The line is new for Clinton and comes at a time that some have raised questions whether the Obama administration underestimated ISIS, a terrorist group that has swept into power in areas of Syria and Iraq. President Barack Obama decided during his first term not to help train and arm rebels in Syria, despite urging from Clinton and other top advisers. In hindsight, some of those advisers say not arming Syrian rebels helped lead to the rise of ISIS. Last month, Obama authorized airstrikes against the terrorist group and training for Syrian rebels. The United States was joined by a coalition of countries, including Arab states, and Clinton backed the action. On Monday, the former secretary of state called dealing with ISIS a ""long-term struggle"" in which military action is essential. The former first lady also refused to call the group by the name it calls itself: the Islamic State. ""Whether you call them ISIS or ISIL, I refuse to call them the Islamic State, because they are neither Islamic or a state,"" Clinton said. ""Whatever you call them, I think we can agree that the threat is real."" Clinton justified military action against ISIS, but not against other terrorist groups, because ISIS' ""kind of jihadist extremism is expansionary."" ""They believe that it is part of their mission to launch attacks, to infiltrate through foreign fighters into Western societies,"" Clinton said. ""If that were not the case, then we could have a different debate. I think the evidence is convincing, at least to me, that this is a group that will try to pick up where al Qaeda in Afghanistan left off."" Clinton later argued that groups like Al-Shabaab or Boko Haram ""have not yet evidenced a commitment to expanding their reach the way that this ISIL group has. So, therefore, I think military action is critical."" But military action is ""not sufficient alone."" ""There has to be more,"" Clinton said. ""You have to combat them on social media, you have to do more to enlist Arab support ... to demonstrate this is not some sort of an American/Western effort and it involves significant Arab participation."" ISIS has quickly gained sizable attention outside the Middle East because it has beheaded a number of Western aid workers and journalists. Clinton touted what the Obama administration did to stop al Qaeda in Afghanistan. ""What we were able to do at great cost,"" Clinton said, ""was to ferret out and decapitate the leadership of al Qaeda, (which) severely undermined their capacity, as an organization, continues to threaten the West.""","In Canada appearance, Hillary Clinton touts her work to fight ""violent extremism""

"(CNN) -- The Texas Department of State Health Services on Thursday ordered the recall of all products ever shipped from the Peanut Corporation of America's plant in Plainview, Texas, after discovering dead rodents, rodent excrement and bird feathers in the plant. The plant produced oil-roasted and dry-roasted peanuts, peanut meal and granulated peanut. The order, which applies to products shipped since the plant opened nearly four years ago, came a day after the discovery of filth in a crawl space above a production area during a health services inspection, Texas Health Department Press Officer Doug McBride told CNN in a telephone interview. The plant's ventilation system pulled debris ""from the infested crawl space into production areas of the plant resulting in the adulteration of exposed food products,"" a health department news release said. Officials at the plant, which opened in March 2005 and produced oil-roasted peanuts, dry-roasted peanuts, peanut meal and granulated peanut, voluntarily stopped operations Monday night. ""Our understanding is that the bulk of their products go to other food manufacturers,"" McBride said. ""We're not aware of any direct sales to consumers."" The state has the authority to stop a company's operations and order a recall if it finds ""a condition that poses an immediate and serious threat to human life or health,"" as was the case here, he said. Though tests are being carried out to determine if the products contain salmonella or other disease-causing organisms, the orders are not contingent on what is found, he said. The plant is barred from resuming operations without health services approval. The company's peanut butter and peanut paste products produced at its plant in Blakely, Georgia, have been linked to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella poisoning that has affected 600 people, killing nine. A call to the company's telephone number, which was working earlier this week, elicited a recording that said it was no longer in service.","Texas orders recall of products shipped from Peanut Corporation of America plant .

"Vice Adm. Jan E. Tighe has made history with her appointment as head of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and the U.S. 10th Fleet, making her ""the first female commander of a numbered fleet in U.S. Navy history,"" according to that military branch. Tighe succeeded Adm. Michael S. Rogers -- who is moving on to become director of the embattled National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command -- in a ceremony Wednesday at Fort Meade in Maryland. She's the fleet's third commander ever and had been its deputy commander since November, according to the Navy. ""Jan Tighe, you are one of the best people that our military has across all of the services,"" recently retired NSA chief Keith Alexander said. ""... You are exceptional in every category, and you will do great with the 10th Fleet, which I believe is just a stepping stone for future things for you."" Born in Kentucky and raised in Plantation, Florida, Tighe graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, learned Russian at the Defense Language Institute and earned advanced degrees in electrical engineering and applied mathematics from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Her extensive Navy history includes stints in the Naval Network Warfare Command, the U.S. Cyber Command and the Naval Security Group Activities. Among other assignments, she was an airborne special evaluator in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield and Storm during the early 1990s. Tighe's new job will be heading the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command, which has a mission that includes cryptologic operations and electronic warfare. Her appointment comes at a time when the Navy and other military branches have been on the defensive over accusations that not enough is being done to protect women within their ranks from sexual assault. Figures have shown the rate of assaults in the armed forces is increasing, and some top officers are under fire for condoning such acts. President Barack Obama told newly commissioned officers at the Naval Academy last May that a rash of sexual assaults undermines Americans' confidence in the military.","Vice Adm.

"Syrian airstrikes on a rebel-held neighborhood in Aleppo on Sunday killed at least 22 people, including 14 children, the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights said in a statement. The SOHR said it expects the death toll to rise, because other people wounded in the attack are in critical condition. The opposition organization says it's not the first time the Syrian regime has dropped barrels filled with explosives on Aleppo neighborhoods. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have also been injured. In addition, more than 2.3 million people have fled Syria, and another 4.25 million Syrians have become refugees within their country since the civil war began, according to an Amnesty International report released on Friday.","Syrian planes attacked Aleppo neighborhood, says Syrian Observatory For Human Rights .

"Honoring the legacy of a former president he's barely mentioned previously, President Barack Obama on Thursday cast Lyndon B. Johnson's push to end legal segregation as a factor in his own ascension to the White House. Obama joined three other living presidents in marking the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, and the movement that spurred its signing, at Johnson's presidential library in Austin. The landmark measure, signed in 1964, made it illegal to discriminate based on race, outlawing for the first time segregation at lunch counters, buses, and other public spots. ""Because of the Civil Rights movement, because of the laws President Johnson signed, new doors of opportunity and education swung open for everybody,"" Obama said. ""They swung open for you, and they swung open for me.  And that's why I'm standing here today -- because of those efforts, because of that legacy."" Johnson, the nation's 36th president, became an unlikely hero to the civil rights movement by using his stores of political capital to pressure lawmakers to pass the legislation -- an effort initiated by President John F. Kennedy and continued by Johnson after Kennedy's assassination. Johnson wasn't above horse trading and flattery to achieve his goals, Obama said. ""Passing laws was what Lyndon Baines Johnson knew how to do,"" Obama said. ""No one knew politics and no one loved legislating more than President Johnson."" Johnson's descendants hope to turn his legacy toward that of a civil rights pioneer, rather than the President who presided over the Vietnam War. The fight was personal for Johnson, who'd grown up in the Southwest amid racial inequality. The four-day Civil Rights Summit in Austin was meant partly to change shift Johnson's legacy toward civil rights. Legends of the movement like Rep. John Lewis and singer Mavis Staples appeared directly ahead of Obama. Music played before the event — Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young — evoked the tumult of the era. Obama has said as the first African-American president that he's indebted to civil rights leaders, though during his time in office he has not spoken frequently about his place in the movement's history. He's spoken even less about Johnson's legacy. Thursday's speech marked one of the first times he's even made reference to a predecessor who had a long career in the Senate and served in the White House from 1963 to 1969. Other predecessors — including Republicans Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon — have all been used in speeches more often. That changed during Obama's remarks, which effusively praised a man whose major pieces of legislation — including the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the laws that created Medicare and Medicaid — reflect a staunchly liberal agenda Obama himself has attempted to emulate. ""What President Johnson understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression. It required the presence of economic opportunity,"" Obama said, co-opting a phrase he's taken as a rallying cry during his second term. ""A decent job. Decent wages. Health care. Those too were civil rights worth fighting for."" In the last year, Obama has begun speaking more often about race, though the topic is by no means a frequent part of his speeches and remarks. He addressed the issue in deeply personal terms following a jury's acquittal of the man accused of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin, and earlier this year the President spoke about the challenges that young men of color face in today's society. Many suspect Obama will use his post-presidential years to focus on the issue. While race isn't a common theme for Obama, combating inequality has become the central tenant of his second term agenda, through his push to close the gap between rich and poor and his efforts in closing the wage gap between men and women. He also makes regular references to ending discrimination against gays and lesbians, and has come out in support of same-sex marriage. Facing a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, his legislative efforts on those issues have thus far come up short -- leading to some negative comparisons between Obama and Johnson, the so-called ""master of the Senate."" Those comparisons ignore Johnson's later tenure, Obama claimed last year in an interview with The New Yorker. ""When he lost that historic majority, and the glow of that landslide victory faded, he had the same problems with Congress that most presidents at one point or another have,"" Obama told the magazine's editor, David Remnick. ""I say that not to suggest that I'm a master wheeler-dealer but, rather, to suggest that there are some structural institutional realities to our political system that don't have much to do with schmoozing."" That historical reflection was absent in Thursday's speech, though Obama did contend the debate in which Johnson was embroiled still raged. ""Today we remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity, and the role of government in ensuring each,"" he said, declaring the government, and the presidency, were meant to try and affect change in peoples' lives. Obama said in remarks at the Civil Rights Summit that Johnson possessed a unique grasp of the power of government to bring about change, and used his office and his enormous legislative skills to get what he wanted. Obama said Johnson ""fought for"" and ""bullied"" and ""persuaded"" until the Civil Rights Act was signed into law. ""And he didn't stop there,"" he said, using the legislation as a springboard for other sweeping changes. Many doubt 1964 Civil Rights Act could pass today .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down Friday and handed over power to the military -- three decades of his iron-clad rule ended by an 18-day revolution. In a somber one-minute announcement on state television, Vice President Omar Suleiman said Mubarak had resigned and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will ""run the affairs of the country."" Tens of thousands of emotional Egyptians exploded in deafening cheers on the streets of Cairo, electric with excitement. It was a moment they had anticipated throughout long days of relentless demonstrations -- sometimes violent -- that demanded Mubarak's departure. It was also a moment that many had thought unimaginable in the Arab world's powerhouse nation. ""Egypt is free!"" and ""God is Great,"" they chanted in the honeymoon of the moment. They waved Egyptian flags, honked horns and set off fireworks as they savored a moment that just days ago had seemed unimaginable. A source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders told CNN that Mubarak had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. The Swiss government has directed banks to freeze all assets belonging to Mubarak and his family, said Norbert Baerlocher, a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington. The banks do not as yet have a clear picture of what Mubarak has but protesters on the streets had worried that he would attempt to flee the country with looted money. In a televised speech Thursday night, Mubarak had indicated he was delegating authority to Suleiman, but Friday, deeply disappointed crowds calling for his ouster kept swelling throughout Cairo and in other major cities. Friday night, they got what they wanted all along. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, however, sounded words of caution amid the euphoria. He urged Egyptians to stay united beyond the moment of euphoria. ""We have challenges ahead of us,"" said the Nobel laureate whom many believe could emerge as Egypt's next leader. ""I think we need to not worry about retribution. Mubarak needs to go and we need to look forward."" Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian activist who became a reluctant hero of the revolution said only one word would be used to describe Mubarak in history books: ""Dictator."" ""I want to say: 'Welcome back Egypt,"" he told CNN. Ghonim -- a Google executive who is on leave from his job and whose Facebook page is credited with triggering the popular uprising -- was seized by security forces and released Monday. His words and tears in a television interview galvanized the protesters in Tahrir Square. He said he knew Mubarak would be forced out after a revolt in Tunisia forced its leader out in January, and he said he believed the military can be trusted to respect the demands of the protesters. Many of the anti-government protesters had been calling for Egypt's powerful army, well-respected within the country, to take over as interim caretakers. Friday night, they voiced optimism that the military would pave the way for free and fair elections. But it's uncertain what will come next in the most populous nation of the Arab world, and how Egypt's revolution, that succeeded on the 32nd anniversary of Iran's, will reverberate throughout the region. U.S. President Barack Obama was notified of Mubarak's decision Friday morning, said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, and was closely watching the extraordinary developments unfold in Egypt, a key U.S. ally. He will make a statement Friday afternoon, the White House said. Mubarak's decision to step down is ""obviously a welcome step,"" said a U.S. official involved in the Egypt discussions. Now comes ""an unpredictable next chapter,"" the official added. It is ""a sign the military chose society."" Amre Moussa, the secretary-general of the Arab League, said Egyptians are ""looking forward to a different (and) better future."" A high-ranking Egyptian military official said the army's command was discussing whether to dismiss Mubarak's government and parliament and also when the next election would be held. An announcement was expected later Friday. But some analysts were already sounding the alarm over a military takeover. ""Suleiman's statement is the clearest indication thus far that the military has carried out a coup led by Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi,"" analysts with the Stratfor global intelligence company said in a statement. ""Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers. The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts,"" the statement said. Amnesty International, whose staffers had been among human rights workers and journalists detained by Egyptian authorities during the uprising, congratulated Egyptians for ""their extraordinary courage and commitment to achieve fundamental change."" But it warned that the departure of one man did not mean an end to a police state. ""The repressive system that Egyptians have suffered under for three decades has not gone away and the state of emergency remains in place,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general. ""Those in power must grasp this opportunity to consign the systematic abuses of the past to history. Human rights reform must begin now,"" Shetty said. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Nic Robertson and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","Vice President Omar Suleiman says the armed forces will run the country .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to impose sanctions on Libya amid Moammar Gadhafi's escalating attacks on anti-government protesters. The approved resolution includes an arms embargo, asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and several of his key associates. It also refers the violent crackdown to the International Criminal Court. ""The text send a strong message that gross violations of basic human rights will not be tolerated and that those responsible for grave crimes will be held accountable. I hope the message is heard, and heeded, by the regime in Libya,"" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Ibrahim Dabbashi, Libya's deputy ambassador to the United Nations who earlier voiced opposition to Gadhafi's government, said after the vote the resolution would provide moral support to the people resisting in Libya. He urged officers in the armed forces to renounce Gadhafi. One point of contention revolved around language in the resolution that referred to adopting ""all necessary measures to enable the return to Libya of humanitarian agencies and to secure the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need."" There was concern that the language could be interpreted as including military intervention. That section of the resolution was softened in the approved version to call on member states to work together to ""facilitate and support"" the return of humanitarian agencies. Gerard Araud, France's ambassador to the United Nations, described the pace of the resolution proceedings earlier in the day as ""an earthquake."" The United Nations estimates that 1,000 people have been killed since the Libyan uprising began last week. Ban had urged the Security Council to come up with immediate actions against Gadhafi's regime. ""In these circumstances, the loss of time means more loss of lives,"" Ban told the 15-member body Friday. The session Saturday comes the day after Libyan Ambassador Mohamed Shalgam made an impassioned appeal to his United Nations counterparts. ""I hope within hours, not days, that they can do something tangible,"" he said. Some, however, were skeptical of the sanctions and said they would not have teeth. Fouad Ajami of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies told CNN that Gadhafi had survived sanctions once before, in the aftermath of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. ""The sanctions never worked,"" he said. ""Anyone with money can break these sanctions.""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Bowing to eight days of protests, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday he will not seek office again in elections scheduled for September, but vowed to stay in the country and finish his term. The concession, the largest the embattled president has made so far, was remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades. But it was unclear whether the offer would do anything to calm opposition groups and protesters who have called for Murarak's immediate resignation. ""My first responsibility now is to restore the stability and security of the homeland, to achieve a peaceful transition of power in an environment that will protect Egypt and Egyptians and which will allow for the responsibility to be given to whoever the people elect in the forthcoming elections,"" Mubarak said in a televised address Tuesday night. The announcement rang flat in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where thousands of protesters erupted in chants of ""Down with Mubarak!"" and ""The people want the president to be judged!"" following his announcement. Some waved shoes in the air -- a deep insult in the Arab world -- and said they would continue their demonstrations until Mubarak quits outright. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who has become a leading opposition figure, said Mubarak's decision was ""an act of deception"" that would only ""extend the agony."" ""Whoever gave him that advice gave him absolutely the wrong advice,"" ElBaradei said. However, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister, said demonstrators should weigh what Mubarak has said before responding. ""I'm aware that there are certain currents in Egypt that will not see that as satisfactory and they need more,"" Moussa, a possible presidential contender himself, told CNN. But, he added, ""I believe that there is something new that has been offered."" Mubarak has led Egypt for nearly 30 years since the 1981 assassination of his predecessor, Anwar Sadat, aided by an emergency decree that has allowed him to rule with an iron fist. But following demonstrations that have only grown in the past week, the 82-year-old former air force general told his people Tuesday night, ""I have spent enough time serving Egypt. ""I will pursue the transfer of power in a way that will fulfill the people's demands, and that this new government will fulfill the people's demands and their hopes for political, economic and social progress,"" he said. Tuesday's turnout in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities came despite efforts by the government to suspend rail service and cut off mobile phone and internet networks, and in spite of the mounting hardships facing Egyptians. Banks and schools have been shuttered during the demonstrations, teller machine screens are dark and gas stations have run out of fuel. Long lines snaked around bakeries and supermarkets as shops began to ration how much food customers could buy. In Alexandria, protesters clashed with supporters of Mubarak, leaving 12 people injured, said Qutb Hassanein, a member of an opposition group. The military was called in to restore calm. Mohammed Mahmoud, a protester, said he was hit in the head by a stick during the clash. ""We don't want him (Mubarak). We are staying here until we die,"" he said. Mubarak's announcement capped a day in which anti-government demonstrators stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Tahrir Square for a ""march of millions."" It comes less than three weeks after a wave of protests that forced Tunisia's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January. Protesters last week taunted, ""Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you."" But despite calls for him to leave the country, the aging leader vowed Tuesday that ""This dear country is my country ... and I will die on its land."" Opposition leader Ayman Nour called the speech ""very depressing."" Nour said Mubarak was already expected to step down at the end of his term -- but he is believed to be maneuvering to have his son, Gamal, succeed him. ""He did not at any point in his speech reject the possibility that his son could run for president,"" said Nour, who spent three years in prison after challenging Mubarak in Egypt's first multiparty presidential election in 2005. He said the protesters in Tahrir Square ""are angrier than ever"" after the address. Mohammed Habib, deputy chairman of the officially banned Muslim Brotherhood, said Mubarak's speech was built around emotional appeals to his decades of military service and the presidency. ""After 30 years during which corruption and diminishing the strategic role of Egypt in the region became the norm, I do not feel it is time to appeal for people's emotion,"" Habib said. ""We should say 'thank you' to him, 'and get out.' "" In Washington, President Barack Obama said he spoke with Mubarak soon after he announced he would not seek re-election. Obama called for an orderly transition in Egypt that, he said, should be meaningful, peaceful and must begin now. The U.S. president stressed the Egyptian people will be the ones to determine their own leaders and destiny. In Cairo, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Margaret Scobey, met Tuesday with ElBaradei and will be speaking with leaders of other political movements, a senior State Department official said. The official cautioned that Scobey's talks with ElBaradei doesn't mean the United States favors him. As in Tunisia, the protests have been fueled by economic woes, including a dramatic rise in the cost of living coupled with high unemployment. Despite the government's food subsidies, people are struggling, with an estimated 40% of the country living in poverty. The majority of Egypt's population -- and the vast majority of its unemployed -- is under 30, and many protesters are young men looking for economic opportunities and a better life. As the demonstrations grew, Mubarak fired his cabinet and ordered newly appointed Vice President Omar Suleiman to hold talks on political reform with opposition leaders. And on Monday, the military -- the foundation of the modern Egyptian state -- announced it would not open fire on peaceful protesters. ""I think it's all over with once the army makes that announcement,"" said Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan. Cole said he had expected the regime to endure the crisis with the support of the military, but that the military appears to have ""cut Mubarak loose."" Shibley Telhami, a University of Maryland professor and Brookings Institution analyst, said the military may have anchored the government but, ""At some point, they are going to have to make a decision about protecting the institution beyond the man."" And Fouad Ajami, a Johns Hopkins University professor and Hoover Institution analyst, said Mubarak's invocation of his years of service was ""almost pathetic."" ""I believe the crowd was discovering its power as Mubarak was discovering his own weakness and the vulnerability of his own regime,"" Ajami said. Now, ""No one believes his promises, and now no one really believes his threats."" The demonstrations had turned ugly last Friday, when thousands of riot and plainclothes police used brutal force to crack down on people on the streets. Unconfirmed reports suggest up to 300 people may have been killed during the protests, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Tuesday. Human Rights Watch has reported 80 deaths from two hospitals in Cairo, 36 in Alexandria and 13 in Suez. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll. But since the weekend, the army has replaced police as the enforcers of security, and the gatherings have been largely peaceful. In recent days, protests inspired by the Tunisian outcome have spread to Algeria, Yemen, Jordan and Sudan. Calls for political reform prompted Jordan's King Abdullah II Tuesday to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister, and a Facebook page urged similar demonstrations in Syria.

"(CNN)  -- What's the best way to find great links on the web? Is it algorithmic search engines like Google, people-powered decision-making, or a combination of both? This has been the perennial question online ever since Yahoo's human-organized directory of web links lost the battle to Google's automated crawlers. And yet now, in some circles at least, the pendulum appears to be swinging back: Google is broken, say some technologists, and people-power is the best fix. What's the problem with Google search? Spam, say the critics. Or rather, a new genre of not-quite-spam. So-called ""content farms"" have sprung up to produce thousands of articles per day with titles that match popular search terms -- dig in to the content however, and you'll find it anything but useful. This Google-fatigue began as early as December 2009, when venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky remarked that using Google to search for a new dishwasher delivered nothing but spam results. ""Info-krill"", Kedrosky called it, ""Identify some words that show up in profitable searches -- from appliances, to mesothelioma suits, to kayak lessons -- churn out content cheaply and regularly, and you're done."" It's a concept that was revisited this month by prominent British blogger Alan Patrick, who remarked: ""This year it really hit home just how badly Google's systems have been spammed, as typically anything on Page 1 of the search results was some form of SEO spam"". Others have come to the same conclusion. Prominent software developer Jeff Atwood this month declared ""Trouble in The House of Google"", while entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa outlined his reasons ""Why We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google"", namely ""spammers and marketers"". Developer Marco Arment, meanwhile, decried the ""apparent explosion recently of cheap-'content' sites"", which have contributed to ""Google's apparent defeat by spam."" While the problem is clear, do technologists agree on the solution? It appears they do. Atwood asks: ""Are we seeing the first signs that algorithmic search has failed as a strategy? Is the next generation of search destined to be less algorithmic and more social?"" Kedrosky too proposes a human-powered solution, declaring that ""curation is the new search."" Wadhwa, meanwhile, points to new search engine contender Blekko, which searches within sets of websites defined by human editors. And Arment proposes a combined approach: ""One solution may be for Google to radically change their algorithms and policies for web search to de-emphasize phrase-matching and more strongly prioritize inbound links and credibility. And, in what's probably a huge departure for them, have human employees use their opinions of site quality to manually adjust the relevance of domains."" While I'm inclined to agree that human-powered decision-making may increase the quality of search results, it's worth noting that the path to ""curation"" is littered with bodies. In December 2010, news leaked that Yahoo was looking to close down the social-bookmarking site Delicious. Yahoo later clarified that the company was instead looking to sell the service, which had pioneered wide-scale, people-powered categorization of web links. Yahoo's attempts to jettison the site are hardly a shining example of the rise of human curation. Last year also saw the downfall of another Web 2.0 pioneer -- Digg.com, which enables users to vote on Web links and ranks the most popular results, saw its web traffic plummet after a redesign that aimed to keep pace with Twitter and Facebook. It's there, I think, where we might finally see curation bloom: On Twitter and Facebook, where users share millions of links per day without even the mildest sense that they're ""curators"" of the web. To these everyday internet users, they're just sharing cool websites with friends; To those who seek to make sense of an increasingly complex web, these millions of social signals are gold dust. The solutions will come in many forms, from Bing's integration of Facebook ""Likes"" into its search results to Twitter- and Facebook-powered newspapers like Paper.li and The Twitter Tim.es. But ultimately, and with a few stumbles, we'll find numerous ways to combine human judgment with the efficiency of algorithms.","Google is broken, say some technologists, and people-power is the best fix .

"(CNN) -- Unprecedented demonstrations sweeping the Middle East and North Africa spread Wednesday to Libya, where police clashed with anti-government protesters in the coastal city of Benghazi, an independent source told CNN. About 200 protesters came out to show support for human rights activist and lawyer Fathi Terbil, who had been detained earlier, the source said. Several people were arrested after police confronted the protesters, the source added. But Libya -- ruled by Moammar Gadhafi since 1969 -- is not Egypt, said a highly placed Libyan source close to the government who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media. ""There is nothing serious here,"" he said. ""These are just young people fighting each other."" Driven by discontent and fueled by social media, protests in the region spread this week not just to Libya but to Iran and Bahrain. Anti-government sentiment has also manifested itself on the streets of Algeria, Jordan, Syria and Yemen. In Yemen, Sanaa University students protested Wednesday, calling for an improved curriculum, but the demonstration rapidly morphed into an anti-government stand. Participants said government supporters outside the university gates hurled rocks, but the situation stayed under control. It was at least the sixth day that scuffles had broken out between the government's supporters and foes. Activist Abdul Rahman Barman said three anti-government protesters were injured when government supporters attacked them after the demonstration. One had to be hospitalized for head injuries, he said. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for 32 years but has pledged not to run for re-election when his current term ends in 2013. In nearby Bahrain, thousands of people marched in a peaceful funeral procession for Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed when clashes erupted during the funeral for another protester. They camped out at the Pearl Roundabout, a landmark in the capital, Manama, that has been adopted by protesters as their Tahrir Square, the epicenter of Egypt's revolution. A massive pearl sits at the apex of a circle of inward-sweeping arches, and Wednesday, Bahrainis camped out at its base and painted anti-government slogans. Later in the day, flag-waving pro-government demonstrators were out in Manama and the second largest city of Muharraq. New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof said security forces have backed off after ""a concerted deliberate effort to use a truly stunning amount of force."" ""Now that the regime has backed off, it's a little hard to say where things will go,"" Kristof told CNN. ""It is possible that ... there will be some kind of truce and agreement to have more democracy, some more concessions."" Large crowds showed up for a funeral as well in the Iranian capital, where 26-year-old Saneh Jaleh was laid to rest. Iranian authorities said Jaleh belonged to the pro-government Basij militia and was shot to death by the outlawed People's Mujahedeen of Iran. But some of Jaleh's acquaintances disputed that account, and Jaleh's funeral strangely drew both supporters and foes of the Islamic regime, which has cracked down on dissent even though it publicly praised Egyptians for toppling President Hosni Mubarak. International journalists are barred from covering Iran's unrest, but a protester told CNN that police fired tear gas and beat people with batons. Sara, whose full name has been withheld for security reasons, said she was risking her safety to march on the streets because Jaleh was part of Iran's reformist Green Movement. ""We are not allowing his blood to go to waste,"" she said. ""I am doing this for him."" In the place that gave rise to the spirit of the region's freedom movement, changes were still slowly unfolding. Tunisia lifted its midnight-until-4 a.m. curfew, though a state of emergency remains intact, the state-run Tunis Afrique Presse said. Weeks of demonstrations forced the ouster of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January. ""Tunisia now after the revolution of its population is now searching for its independence,"" said Lazhar Samali, an engineer who protested against the government. ""It's a sovereign state, and Tunisia has in its own hands its destiny."" The end of Ben Ali's 23-year rule inspired Egyptians, and then others, to rise up for their rights. Last Friday, after 18 days of mass demonstrations in Egypt, Mubarak stepped down, leaving the nation in the hands of its powerful military. CNN's Tim Lister, Mohammed Jamjoom, Jenifer Fenton and Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Source: Several people arrested after police confronted protesters in Benghazi, Libya .

"Africa has indeed turned the corner. A continent once synonymous with death, disease and destruction is showing signs of improvement. Virtually unscathed by the global financial slowdown, the African continent boasts some of the fastest growing economies in the world. Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania are some of the countries leading the way in this exclusive economic growth club. With a combined population size of 1 billion, 70% under the age of 30 and an annual spend of $600 billion, the African continent is an attractive business proposition for any investor. It comes as no surprise then that the U.S. is making huge strides to accommodate Africans. Hosting one of the largest gatherings of African Leaders in Washington, the U.S. is showing the world -- and sending a signal to its closest rival, China -- that it can and will have African influence, which it can convert into commercial opportunities that can translate to receipts. Chinese dominance . The acceleration of China across Africa has been breathtaking. A long standing business relationship with the continent has translated to huge trade volumes in excess of $200 billion in 2013, doubling what the U.S. achieved in that same year. Read this: Twitter reacts to U.S.-African Leaders Summit . Taking the world by surprise, a liberalized African continent voted with its feet changing suppliers -- re-affirming China's dominance, with the U.S. fast closing the gap; the Washington conference is confirmation of President Obama's new ambition in making up lost ground. Challenges . Security challenges facing the African continent are huge. Africa is by no means a picnic. The U.S. government will have to put security at the top of it agenda as American businesses expand operation across the African continent. Instability in Libya, Central African Republic and extremist Islamic groups can be a constant threat. Doing business in Africa will have its hazards; the business environment can be harsh and unforgiving. Yet, despite these challenges, exceptional growth figures in Nigeria prove that despite repeated and sustained attacks by militant group Boko Haram, Nigeria is still considered a thriving hub for businesses worldwide. This week the presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone canceled their planned trip to the summit amid the spread of Ebola virus. Good and affordable health care is a major concern for many Africans. As the Ebola virus spreads across West Africa, many Africans are relying on the U.S. to support failing and fragile health care structures in the areas of financing, technology and science as a bridge to halting the spread of this deadly virus. Bright future . Today, the African continent boasts the second fastest growing region in the world, an average growth rate of 5% and a large youthful work force. Job creation is still Africa's biggest challenge -- there are too many people living in poverty earning less than a dollar a day. If President Obama can create real tangible jobs, then the U.S. can start to claw back China's grip on the African continent -- whoever builds Africa's infrastructure, provide cheap products for African markets and loans to support government initiatives will have influence over African affairs. If the U.S. pushes for better African governance, enforcement will be difficult. The usual carrot and stick approach will not be effective. If the U.S calls for trade opportunities to be linked to better, open and transparent democracies then it will be possible for U.S. businesses to make the commercial advances on the African continent. African leaders are very savvy and have a healthy understanding of geopolitics. They will leverage on multiple investors competing for African influence. African governments, unilaterally or as a block, will not hesitate to change suppliers and investors. The Chinese business model is seen by many Africans as hassle free. The Chinese relationship with African governments is one of mutual respect, not intrusive and with a minimal involvement in domestic politics. The Chinese model is still an attractive proposition for many African leaders. Hence, President Obama will have to tread carefully and not rock the African boat too hard. To his critics, President Obama has been accused of neglecting the African continent. But by hosting this African Leaders Summit, the U.S. President is starting to rediscover Africa. And with commitments of $33 billion in private and public assistance, President Obama is already winning the hearts and minds of a billion Africans.

"Daniel Flesch, then a college student at the University of Illinois, had heard too much anti-Israeli sentiment. He had family members who had survived the Holocaust and felt compelled to fight back at what he perceived as a growing level of anti-Semitism in America. So in 2010, he joined Israel's military. ""I just didn't want to sit on the sidelines,"" the now-26-year-old said in an interview via Skype. ""I wanted to actually fight back against those who think Israel and the Jewish people should not exist."" Flesch, now a graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, became what's known as a ""lone soldier"" --  a citizen from another country who joins the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It's believed there are approximately 750 Americans currently serving in the Israeli military, according to the New York-based Friends of IDF. The group raises funds for the cultural, recreational and social needs of Israeli soldiers. Going to Israel? Share your story . Although there are no firm numbers of those who have signed up in recent days, the interest level of Americans seems to have increased amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, according to Orit Mizner, southwest regional director for Friends of Israel Scouts, an organization that helps North American Jews stay connected to Israel. ""Those kind of phone calls keep on coming. ... There's definitely a sense of the need to be in Israel and a need to take part in what's going on,"" said Mizner, whose organization runs a program called Garin Tzabar, which helps facilitate Americans' entry into the IDF. Americans have been serving in the IDF for decades. Israel requires that its citizens serve in the military when they turn 18 --  three years for men, two years for women. Young Americans with dual citizenship living in Israel are required to serve as well. Those outside Israel, whether they hold Israeli citizenship or not, can apply for the IDF if they meet requirements including no criminal record, a high school diploma and the ability to speak Hebrew. The U.S. government doesn't discourage those wanting to join, but some may question why those willing to put themselves in harm's way would choose the IDF as opposed to the American military. ""As much I'm a proud American,"" said David Meyers of Belmont, California,  ""there's an incredibly deep and long connection that I have to Israel."" Meyers, who now works in sales in Silicon Valley, holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. ""The United States with its strength and size, perhaps, isn't quite needing your abilities and your efforts,"" he said, explaining his choice to spend six years in the Israeli navy. His Israeli-born comrades sometimes expressed puzzlement over his decision to leave the comforts of American life for the dangers of military service, he said. ""They sometimes scratched their heads when they see people coming from other countries,"" said Meyers, who served in the Israeli navy in the late 1980s and early '90s. But he added that he was warmly embraced. Flesch, who is not an Israeli citizen, served more than 18 months.  He became a paratrooper in the Israeli army and was recognized twice as the outstanding soldier of his platoon. His proudest achievement:  ""That I'd done my part to defend the Jewish people (from) those who tried to harm us throughout the years.""

"(CNN) -- The world's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment, the World Wildlife Fund said Friday. These two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in Australia. The WWF's latest Living Planet Index shows terrestrial, freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005, with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop. The index is included in a report called ""2010 and Beyond: Rising to the Biodiversity Challenge,"" which the WWF prepared for an international biodiversity conference in Germany later this month. ""No one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines, greater vulnerability to natural disasters, and greater effects from global warming,"" said James Leape, director-general of WWF International. The Living Planet Index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species, which the WWF says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends. Terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period, the WWF said. Marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period, with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005, the WWF said. ""Many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence, and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched,"" the WWF report said. Freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003. The WWF said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet, inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species. In tropical regions, freshwater species were especially hard-hit; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000. The WWF said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003. The causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere, such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems, the WWF said. The dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species' capacity to replace itself, the WWF said. Overfishing is one example. Overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species, according to the report, which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals. Overharvesting of timber is also a major factor, it said. Invasive species, whether introduced deliberately or not, are another threat, especially in freshwater ecosystems, where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species, the WWF said. Pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity, it said. The WWF called on governments attending this month's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010. It wants governments to establish protected areas, particularly those areas important for food security, water supply, medicine, and disaster mitigation, and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020.","The world's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of humans .

"Raffaele Sollecito reasserted his innocence Tuesday as his attorneys continued to distance him from his ex-girlfriend Amanda Knox. ""This has been a real tragedy,"" he said.  ""I'm not a criminal."" Sollecito's new defense strategy comes as their legal teams prepare to appeal the couple's murder convictions in the death of Knox's former roommate Meredith Kercher before Italy's Supreme Court next year. It's a dramatic departure from the past seven years, where the tactic has been to ""stick together"" and be ""tried"" together. Sollecito attorney Giulia Bongiorno said that approach no longer works. ""They are not Siamese twins -- one body with two heads,"" she said. The old approach began to change shortly after an Italian appeals court sentenced Sollecito to 25 years in prison and Knox to 28 years in January, and that change continued Tuesday. Knox found guilty of murder again by Italian court . New tactics . Sollecito's lawyer John Kelly started laying the groundwork in February. ""It's imperative that the Italian courts consider Raffaele's case separate from Amanda's case,"" he said. ""By necessity, he has to distance himself and his case from Amanda and her case."" In a CNN interview at the time, Sollecito followed his attorney's lead. Though he said that the evidence clears them both, he used more selective language. ""There is nothing against me and nothing very strong against Amanda,"" Sollecito said. ""And in my case, I really did nothing wrong, and I don't want to pay for someone else's peculiar behavior."" In a note on her Facebook page in February, Knox acknowledged Sollecito's new stance and appeared to back it up. She said he's a scapegoat. ""The only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi,"" she wrote. Raising questions . Knox's behavior on the morning Kercher was found stabbed to death in the apartment she and Knox shared seems to be a new wrinkle in the Sollecito defense. That was early November 2007, and he and Knox had been dating for only a week. Sollecito expanded on his doubts in an interview with Italian television that also aired on NBC. Knox had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower, he said. When she returned, she was ""very agitated,"" he said. She told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom, Sollecito said. But rather than call police, she showered and returned to his place. He finds it odd, he said. ""Certainly I asked her questions,"" he said. ""Why did you take a shower? Why did she spend so much time there?"" He didn't get any real answers from her, he said in the interview. ""I'm not saying that Amanda is responsible for all this situation, but they focus on her and they accuse her all the time, but I have nothing to do with all these circumstances and all these accusations,"" Sollecito said. Tuesday's news conference in Rome was a profile in contrasts. At one point, Sollecito called into question Knox's version of events on the morning Kercher was found stabbed to death, saying it was ""imagination and hallucination."" Yet, a few minutes later, he added, ""Amanda and I still believe she is innocent."" There are some anomalies, Bongiorno said, but the legal team hopes that Italy's high court will rule in their favor by ""annulling the sentence in full."" Long-running case . Since Kercher's death, Knox and Sollecito have gone through a legal odyssey that led to a conviction in 2009 that was overturned, followed by a second conviction in January. Knox is now living in the United States. Sollecito lives in Italy. Another man, drifter and drug dealer Rudy Guede from the Ivory Coast, is serving 16 years for Kercher's murder. He was tried separately from Knox and Sollecito. He admitted having sex with the young British woman but said someone else killed her while he was in the bathroom.","""This has been a real tragedy,"" Raffaele Sollecito says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli forces have arrested a wanted Hamas leader accused of planning one of the worst suicide attacks on Israel, the Israeli military announced Wednesday. An Israeli solider guards the hotel on the first anniversary of the suicide bombing. Omar Jabar was wanted by Israel for six years ""for his direct responsibility in carrying out"" the 2002 Passover suicide bombing in Netanya that killed 30 Israelis and left 143 wounded, the Israel Defense Forces said. Israeli military and security forces nabbed Jabar -- identified as the head of Hamas in the Tulkarem area -- in a West Bank village near Tulkarem overnight Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said. He was arrested a day before the six-year anniversary of the attack, one of the deadliest in Israeli history. On March 27, 2002, a suicide bomber walked into the seaside Park Hotel and made his way toward a dining room, where he detonated his explosives as 227 people were eating their Seder meal. According to IDF, Jabar recruited the person who dispatched the suicide bomber, introducing him to the head of the Hamas in Tulkarem at the time, Abed Sayad. The IDF says Sayad told Israeli investigators that he and Jabar met and began working together in 1994 during a stint in prison. After the Passover attack, the Israeli military said Jabar continued to recruit militants to Hamas and over the past year was involved in their combat training. He hid from Israeli forces in villages near Tulkarem, using his family members to send coded messages to Hamas operatives ""in order to lead the Hamas terror organization in Tulkarem, finance his and other militants' terrorist activity and purchase weapons,"" the IDF said. Israel and the U.S. considers Hamas a terrorist organization. Its military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, has admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as well as attacks against the Israeli military. It also operates an extensive social services network in the Palestinian territories and won parliamentary elections in 2006. Last year, it seized control of Gaza from the rival Fatah group, which backs Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's military toppled the country's first democratically elected president Wednesday night and reportedly put him under house arrest while rounding up some of his top supporters even as the deposed Mohamed Morsy insisted that he remains the country's legitimate leader. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Egypt over the military's actions that were decried by Morsy's supporters as a ""coup"" and celebrated as a ""correction"" by his opponents. At least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in sporadic violence that at times pitted Morsy's supporters against the opposition and the military. Morsy ""did not achieve the goals of the people"" and failed to meet the generals' demands that he share power with his opposition, Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, said in a televised speech to the nation. Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, will replace Morsy as Egypt's interim president, El-Sisi said. Mansour was expected to be sworn in on Thursday. The military has not publicly commented on Morsy's whereabouts. But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad told CNN the deposed president was under ""house arrest"" at the presidential Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo. He said some members of Morsy's inner circle have also put under house arrest. The country's constitution has been suspended, and Mansour will ""establish a government that is a strong and diverse,"" said El-Sisi, head of the country's armed forces. New parliamentary elections will be held, and Mansour will have the power to issue constitutional declarations in the meantime, he said. El-Sisi said the military was fulfilling its ""historic responsibility"" to protect the country by ousting Morsy, a Western-educated Islamist elected a year ago. Morsy remained defiant and insisted he was Egypt's proper president. ""The world is looking at us today,"" he said in a taped statement delivered to the Arabic satellite network Al Jazeera. ""We by ourselves can bypass the obstacles. We, the sons of Egypt, the sons of this country -- this is the will of the people and cannot be canceled."" Shortly after Morsy's statement aired, Al Jazeera reported its Cairo studios were raided during a live broadcast on Wednesday and its presenter, guests and producers arrested. The Muslim Brotherhood, the long-repressed political movement that propelled Morsy to office, said its broadcast outlets had been shut down. Muslim Brotherhood arrests . The state-run Middle East News Agency said the two top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party had been taken into custody, and another state-run outlet, the newspaper Al-Ahram, said another 300 were being sought by police. El-Haddad told CNN that he has been told hundreds of names have been put on an ""arrest list"" but couldn't confirm any arrests beyond those of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party chief, Saad el-Katatni, and its deputy, Rashad Al-Bayoumi. Morsy said he remains open to negotiations and dialogue, and he called on supporters to demonstrate peacefully. But at least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in clashes around the country on Wednesday, Health Minister Dr. Mohamed Mustafa Hamid told Al-Ahram. U.S. student killed in Egypt was enthralled with region . Morsy opponents who packed Tahrir Square, now the epicenter of two Egyptian upheavals, erupted in jubilation and fireworks when El-Sisi made his announcement. ""This is a united people of Egypt,"" anti-Morsy organizer Ahmed el Hawary said. ""Mohamed Morsy has actually succeeded in uniting the people, after two years that we were totally against each other ... Mohamed Morsy, with his bad management, with his risking all the lives of Egypt, brought all Egyptians back together to be facing again their future, hand in hand."" But Abdoul Mawgoud Dardery, a former member of parliament from the Morsy-allied Freedom and Justice Party, called that ""ridiculous."" ""I don't know how can anyone with common sense support a military coup in a democracy,"" he said. Egyptians ""will never recognize a coup d'etat,"" he said. And across the Nile River from Tahrir Square, Morsy supporters chanted chanted ""Down with military rule"" and ""The square has a million martyrs."" Before Wednesday night's announcement, troops moved into key positions around the capital, closing off a bridge over the Nile and surrounding Rabaa Adawya Square, where Morsy's supporters were gathered. Military had demanded reforms . Morsy was elected president in June 2012. But his approval ratings have plummeted as his government has failed to keep order or revive Egypt's economy. The chaos, including open sexual assaults on women in Egypt's streets, has driven away tourists and investors, while opponents say Morsy's rule was increasingly authoritarian. Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a leading opposition figure, said the plans announced Wednesday were ""a correction for the way of the revolution"" that drove Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011. Opinion: In Egypt, rage must lead to game plan . ""The road map guarantees achieving the principal demand of the Egyptian people -- having early presidential elections through an interim period through which the constitution will be amended,"" he said. ""So all of us build it together and agree on a democratic constitution, so we can guarantee our freedoms."" The Egyptian military dominated the country for six decades and took direct power for a year and a half after Mubarak's ouster. On Monday, after a previous demand that Morsy offer concessions to the opposition, it gave him 48 hours to order reforms. As the hour of the ultimatum neared, Morsy offered to form an interim coalition government to oversee parliamentary elections and revise the constitution that was enacted in January. ""One of the mistakes I cannot accept -- as the president of all Egyptians -- is to side with one party over another, or to present the scene from one side only. To be fair, we need to listen to the voice of people in all squares,"" he said. Rand Paul: Stop using U.S. taxpayer money to aid Morsy . Shortly after the deadline, Morsy aide Essam El Haddad said in a Facebook posting that a coup was under way and warned that the generals risked bloodshed by moving against Morsy. ""In a democracy, there are simple consequences for the situation we see in Egypt: The president loses the next election or his party gets penalized in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Anything else is mob rule,"" he wrote. But Naguib Abadeer, a member of the opposition Free Egyptians Party, said what was under way ""is not by any means a military coup. This is a revolution."" Morsy lost his legitimacy in November, when he declared courts could not review his decrees and ousted the country's prosecutor-general, Abadeer said. And the Muslim Brotherhood ""hijacked the vote of the people"" by running on a religious platform, ""so these were not democratic elections,"" he said. Egypt's anti-Morsy protestors -- in their own words . Obama says U.S. reviewing aid . In Washington, President Barack Obama said the United States is ""deeply concerned"" by Morsy's removal and the suspension of the constitution. Washington has supplied Egypt's military with tens of billions in support and equipment over more than 30 years, and under U.S. law, that support could be cut off after a coup -- a term his White House statement avoided. ""The United States does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the rule of law,"" Obama said. He said he had ordered ""the relevant departments and agencies"" to study what American law would mean for U.S. aid and urged the generals to hand power back to an elected government 'as soon as possible."" In the wake of Morsy's ouster, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed Obama's call for an immediate return to civilian rule. He appealed for ""calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint."" Wednesday's events capped days of massive demonstrations for and against Morsy. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but health officials said 23 people died in clashes overnight at Cairo University, Al-Ahram reported. Anti-Morsy demonstrators have ransacked Muslim Brotherhood offices around Egypt in the past several days. Obama called Morsy on Monday to urge him to take a less-rigid stance toward his opponents, telling his Egyptian counterpart ""that democracy is about more than elections,"" a White House statement said. But the State Department denied that Obama had urged Morsy to call early elections, as a senior administration official had said Tuesday. Opinion: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy . Morsy's opposition said it had collected more than 20 million signatures on a petition to remove him -- millions more than the number who voted Morsy into the presidency. Tuesday night, Morsy had vowed that he would not comply with the ultimatum and demanded that the armed forces stand down, even ""if the price of upholding this legitimacy is my own blood."" But political analyst Hisham Kassem told CNN the speech was Morsy's ""final bluff."" ""He was trying to give the impression 'We are there in numbers, and we are going to retaliate, we are not going to allow this to happen.' However, with almost 24 hours since his message, it's clear his supporters will not dare challenge the crowds on the street,"" Kassem said. And faced with the throngs that filled Cairo's Tahrir Square, ""the military had to intervene. Otherwise this crowd was going to get Morsy from his palace."" CNN spells the deposed president's name with a 'y' in accordance with what his spokesman said is his personal preference, his own e-mail and the country's Foreign Ministry. Should tourists still visit Egypt? CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Ivan Watson, Jill Dougherty, Dan Lothian, Amir Ahmed, Ben Brumfield, Ali Younes, Chelsea J. Carter, Schams Elwazer, Elise Labott, Ian Lee, Housam Ahmed and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","U.N.'s Ban Ki-moon calls for ""calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint''

"Dr. Karl Williams says he normally sees three or four deaths from drug overdoses in a typical week as the chief medical examiner in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. In the past week, he saw 15 -- men and women, of various ethnicities, ranging in age from 22 to 53. All of them appear to have been heroin users who instead received a mix of heroin and fentanyl, a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients' pain, Williams told CNN. ""This is pretty clearly somebody manufacturing fentanyl and selling it as heroin,"" Williams said. The deaths Williams has recorded are among nearly two dozen in western Pennsylvania linked to a heroin-fentanyl mix, state Attorney General Kathleen Kane said Monday. The ""extremely dangerous and potentially lethal"" combination has killed 22 people in six counties, Kane said in a written statement. ""We are working with the Allegheny County Police Department, the Pittsburgh Police, and their counterparts in the region to get this deadly mix of heroin off the streets of Western Pennsylvania, and to arrest and prosecute anyone caught selling, distributing, and producing these drugs,"" her statement said. Williams said fentanyl can be 10-100 times more potent than morphine, the base molecule in heroin, and it's only distributed as a powder when someone is manufacturing it illegally. The drug is being distributed in bags marked ""Income Tax,"" ""Bud Ice"" and ""Theraflu, Williams said. ""This is not accidental. Somebody is deliberately trying to make a big batch of fentanyl,"" he said. ""It is not an extraordinarily complex molecule to synthesize, and you can find instructions on the Internet. It does not take a sophisticated chemist to do this."" It's not the first time that fentanyl has turned up on the streets of Pittsburgh. In 1988, Williams said, 17 people died when a chemist distributed fentanyl as heroin. And in 2006, in Philadelphia, 269 people were killed by fentanyl overdoses, the state Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs said. The agency raised new alarms about fentanyl in July, blaming it for 50 deaths in Pennsylvania by mid-2013. Bags of heroin labeled ""Obama Care"" seized .","""This is not accidental,"" Pittsburgh medical examiner says .

"Fans of anime master Hayao Miyazaki may remember the mystical, moss-covered forest that serves as the setting for much of ""Princess Mononoke"", his epic about humans and the environment. That otherworldly backdrop was inspired by the very real forests of Yakushima, an Eden-like island in southern Japan. It's an eco-paradise of stunning landscapes, crystal clear waters, and diverse wildlife. The 195-square-mile island rises swiftly from sea level to a mountainous interior of mile-high peaks that can be snow covered in winter, despite the subtropical climate. The granite bedrock is covered by cedar forests, some primary, others the result of reforestation after Edo-period logging. In summer its beaches serve as the largest nesting grounds in the region for loggerhead turtles. The surrounding waters are filled with flying fish, which figure prominently in local menus. Small white-tailed deer roam the island (and another curious creature, Björk, has said she enjoys hiking in Yakushima). Indigenous Yaku macaques sprawl along the roads and fly through treetops. Together, the deer and monkeys outnumber the 13,000 permanent human residents. This unique ecology earned Yakushima a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site designation in 1993. Since then, tourism has flourished. In 2012, about 215,000 people visited, according to Steve Bell, who, with Helen McNamara, runs Y.E.S. Yakushima, the official English tourist website for the island. Read more: The world's best unknown hike . But the vast majority of visitors come to see one thing: An ancient cedar called Jomon-sugi, estimated to be up to 7,200 years old. During the summer holiday and Golden Week (a series of public holidays in Japan at the beginning of May), up to a thousand people make the nine-hour round trip on a given day, crowding the viewing platform that was erected to protect the tree and its environment. The upside? Most other sights and trails remain blissfully uncrowded. Life is quiet here. Most people live in the towns along the coastal road that circles the island, skirting past rocky shores and citrus groves. Miyanoura is the largest settlement, and the main port, followed by Anbo, whose river is a favorite kayaking spot. There's Onoaida in the south, Kurio and its rocky tide pools in the southwest, Nagata and the sandy Inakahama beach (beautiful but dangerous for swimmers) and Isso, which also has a beach. It's an early to bed, early to rise kind of place. Every morning at 7 a.m., an island-wide sound system wakes everyone up with classical music. It's time to eat your natto, grab a bento lunch, and hit the trails. A 40-minute drive inland and uphill from Anbo is Yakusugiland, a cheesy name for a gorgeous set of paths set over 270 hectares that takes walkers through dense woods, past ancient cedar trees including Kigen-sugi (3,000 years old), Odasugi (2,500 years old), and Buddha-sugi (1,800 years old, said to resemble the enlightened one). Shiratani Unsuikyo is a similar park, though with more varied terrain, including the stretch of impossibly green forest that inspired Miyazaki. The furthest trail here leads up to Taikoiwa Rock, a climb that's rewarded with sweeping views over the valley below. Read more: 11 things to know about Tokyo . Shiratani is the second most visited place, after Jomon-sugi, though far less crowded. ""The Shiratani Unsuikyu trail is a great trail in late afternoon after the buses of tourists have left and the monkeys come down the mountain,"" says Clive Witham, author of Yakushima: A Yakumonkey Guide, and the blog Yakumonkey. ""You'll pretty much have the trail -- and monkeys -- to yourself. It's similar at Yakusugiland, the later in the day you go, the more personal the experience becomes."" A system of no-frills mountain huts dots the island, for more ambitious hikers interested in overnight treks. But there are shorter routes, too, and suitable to almost all ability levels. Witham's book, can direct hikers on a six hour trip on the Yodogawa trail, a varied walk through lush forest, over rushing streams, up to Hana-no-ego, the most southerly high altitude marsh in Japan (look for frogs). A final series of scrambles leads to Karumi-dake, a 1,831 meter peak with panoramic views. Explore further: Mapping Mount Fuji . The sound of water is never far away. Yakushima is the wettest place in Japan, a fact best appreciated at the foot of one if the many waterfalls. The Oko-no-taki will inspire quiet meditation in onlookers, while the Senpiro-taki impresses with its scale as it cascades along a huge slab of granite. After all this physical exertion, a soak on one of the many onsen on the island will hit the spot. Bell likes the indoor spa at Onoaida. ""It's full of locals,"" he says. Witham prefers the outdoor spa at Yudomari: ""There is a smaller bath further along the path and obscured by the rocks and here you can soak while listening to the waves lapping the shore and watching the stars."" At 9 p.m., the music plays again. It's time for bed. Where to stay . Most of the lodgings on Yakushima are Minshuku, small inns or cottages, where meals are usually included. Hearty breakfasts of fish, rice, pickles, miso soup and natto are the norm. Near Onoaida, at the foot of Mochumo-dake, Shiki-no-yado has a set of spacious cottage accommodations with private baths, delicious local food (some from their own garden) and some large but friendly spiders. Just outside of Miyanoura, the rooms at Lodge Yaedake Sanso have small decks looking onto the surrounding forest. Baths and toilets are shared. It's rustic, peaceful, and the food is fantastic. For luxury, the Sankara resort, near Onaida, is the best (and only) choice. How to get there . By air: Japan Air Commuter, part of JAL, has direct flights from Osaka (Itami) and Fukuoka. All other flights stop at Kagoshima. By sea: A fast jetfoil ferry has eight daily departures from Kagoshima. The journey takes 2-3 hours. It's possible to navigate Yakushima via public bus, but a rental car will make life much easier. National brands like Nissan have offices here, but the local companies are cheaper. Y.E.S. Yakushima has listings, and a free booking service. When to go . Yakushima is enjoyable year round, but you'll need snow gear to hike during the winter months, even though temperature at sea level remain relatively mild. Summers are warm and humid. Typhoons can be an issue. It rains year round, but autumn is a bit drier. The island is busiest during Golden Week (end of April, beginning of May) and the August summer holiday. Resources . Y.E.S. Yakushima can help with rental car bookings, lodging, and can arrange guided hikes. Yakushima: A Yakumonkey Guide contains detailed descriptions about trails, and other useful information. It's available through yakumonkey.com .","Yakushima is one of Japan's most southerly islands and a UNESCO World Heritage site.

"(CNN)As harried people everywhere will tell you, the pace of modern life seems to be constantly accelerating. It feels like we're always rushing -- to our next appointment, our next business meeting, our next errand, our next plane. When we have a few precious minutes of downtime, we fill it on our phones, swiping from email to Facebook to ""Candy Crush"" and back. No wonder there's a growing chorus of experts urging us to slow down and unplug. Or even -- horrors! -- to sit alone quietly with our thoughts. One of the leading proponents of this movement is essayist and travel writer Pico Iyer, whose recent TED talk, ""The Art of Stillness,"" has been viewed almost a million times. ""My sense is that so many of us are racing around these days, from text to phone call to Twitter to breaking-news update, that we never have time to collect ourselves, to direct ourselves towards what we love,"" Iyer told CNN in an email. Stillness is a cousin of mindfulness, another fashionable concept that encourages people to live in the moment. But where mindfulness focuses mostly on calming stress, stillness, as defined by Iyer, seeks to bring insight and perspective by stepping back from one's daily existence. ""It can restore our sanity and balance; it can remind us of what we really want to be doing -- and what we care most about,"" said Iyer, who was inspired in part by a woman he sat next to on a plane who ignored her seatback screen and sat quietly for 12 hours without talking, reading, sleeping or listening to music. He recommends that people take a few minutes every day, or at least every week, to be alone without distractions and let their mind wander. Of course, this can be difficult in 2015, when digital devices are constantly competing for our attention. But Iyer is not suggesting we give up our phones and laptops. ""None of us would want to go backwards or uninvent all the machines that have made our lives so much brighter and healthier and more fun."" Instead, he said, ""it's up to us to take conscious measures to make sure we're not lost in the rush."" Iyer's ideas may be catching on. Tech workers are unplugging with ""Internet Sabbaths,"" companies are adding stress-reduction programs for their employees, and ""mindful"" practices such as yoga and meditation are flourishing. Iyer believes his talk (and related book) have struck a chord with people who feel overwhelmed by the demands of the digital age. ""People are drowning in information and running around so much that they get nothing done,"" he said. ""It's only by stepping back, I feel, that you can ensure that you're making a life as well as a living.""","A growing movement encourages people to slow down, unplug and let the mind wander .

"New York (CNN) -- A smartphone or tablet feature high on your holiday list this year? How about a robot instead? Cynthia Breazeal, head of the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab, is launching a crowd funding campaign that will let you buy exactly that. What is being billed as the first family robot -- Jibo -- is on the way. At $499 for consumers and $599 for developers, the price is in line with a high-end smartphone. But Jibo is intended to be so much more. Breazeal, who has pioneered work in making robots more social and interactive, believes Jibo can be an organizer, an education tool, even assist elderly family members. ""Jibo is this helpful presence that helps support your family, your human network, to be more efficient and feel more connected,"" says Breazeal. We got a chance to meet Jibo and see a demo of what he can do. It is a big leap from the likes of Siri, which most of us are used to. As a mom, I loved the fact it can snap pictures -- finally I will be in some! The reminder functions would be great for my busy family and I also think kids will engage. I spent time with Breazeal in her lab this week and I was amazed to see the way small children respond to robot interaction, as opposed to a learning app which they can tire of quickly. There is, however, much Jibo can't do yet, so keep your expectations in check. Jibo does not think independently. He is not going to be your personal butler, or dinner date. If you order Jibo now you are getting a prototype, which by definition means not everything will work the way you hope. This rollout is intended for those who want to help refine Jibo. The software running the robot is an open developer platform and Breazeal and her team fully expect that community to come up with novel ideas that will help Jibo mature. I, for one, hope someone can make Jibo mobile. Right now, he spins but can't follow you around the house. But if you're are ready to embrace the robot revolution and invite one into your family, Jibo says he wants to meet you too.","Jibo, a personal robot, has been launched by robotics pioneer Cynthia Breazeal .

"Over 4,400 solar panels compose the roof of Blackfriars bridge in the City of London, making it the largest solar-powered bridge in the world. The old Victorian bridge was built across the river Thames in 1886, but unlike other bridges throughout the city, it also operates as a railway station to serve commuters from all the surrounding areas, while offering a stunning view. Being the first station to span the river Thames, the bridge has always had high demands on power. In 2009 it received a makeover: the wrought-iron bridge was dismantled and rebuilt to generate its own power using the sun. A new roof was installed, housing solar panels over 6000 square meters, which is enough to cover 23 tennis courts. On a sunny day, the canopy can produce up to a megawatt of electricity. The bridge reopened in 2012 and the installation of the array was part of a larger upgrading project involving the station as a whole to cater for more passengers and improve services. ""It generates enough electricity to make about 80,000 cups of tea a day,"" explains Chris Binns, head of engineering at Network Rail who led the upgrade. The use of solar power now provides up to 50 percent of the energy needed at the station and is estimated to reduce carbon emissions by 511 tonnes per year. The increased production of solar panels worldwide, particularly in China, has brought the previously high expense of solar cells plummeting down to make designs like this more affordable. ""It's a wonderful showcase of how Britain can actually build something that's significant,"" says Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes, an expert on solar energy at Imperial College London. ""This is the most powerful bridge in the world and it's using solar power in Britain, not a country well known for its sunshine."" Cities across the world are increasingly harnessing the sun's energy, with landmarks as iconic as the Eiffel tower and Taj Mahal planning to incorporate solar panels into their architecture. If the gray skies of London can accomplish such results across the Thames, imagine the potential elsewhere. Read more from Future Cities: . Shared space, where the streets have no rules .

"(CNN) -- Getting a foothold on the property ladder can be a challenge at the best of times, and the prospects for many of us have been battered further by the global recession. But necessity is the mother of invention and there are routes to home ownership that are not blocked by estate agents and eye-watering fees. For the aspirational, willing to bend their backs and broaden their minds, the materials for a dream house are all around us; in tin cans, tires and scrap metal, ready for construction projects anywhere from city centers to tropical islands at minimal expense. Cooler containers . High concept architects Infiniski of Spain have carved a niche in recycled construction that does not compromise on aesthetics. Their stylish designs are spreading through Europe, Asia and Latin America, with around 85% of the materials pre-used. The basic components are shipping containers supplemented with wooden pallets, which in addition to dramatically reducing cost, also have the benefit of providing a cooling effect in hot climates. Cano's Castle . Thousands of square meters of scrap aluminum came together for this towering complex in Colorado, courtesy of Donald 'Cano' Espinoza, a Native American veteran of the Vietnam War. Beer cans, hubcaps and window frames provide much of the raw material for four separate buildings, with four floors in the largest. Cano uses the gleaming site as a farm and reportedly does not encourage visitors. Save the Beach hotel . Launched in Madrid in 2010, the brainchild of German 'garbage artist' H.A. Schult -- who had also produced a whole army from trash. The hotel was constructed from the contents of landfills and beaches to highlight the environmental impact of waste. The rooms were fully disinfected to allow guests to sleep safely, and the hotel took an international tour to raise awareness. How to build your home from scratch for $35,000 . Don Justo's Cathedral . An astonishing labour of love, for over 50 years former monk and farmer Justo Gallego has been singlehandedly creating a cathedral close to Madrid, modeled on St Peter's basilica in Rome. Standing over 40 meters high, complete with cloisters, crypt and grand domes, the epic structure has been built entirely from discarded materials; broken bricks and tiles for the walls and oil drums for the columns. Despite working from 4am each day, 89-year-old Gallego may still require another decade to complete the project. Joyxee Island . British artist Richart 'Rishi' Sowa built himself one floating island in Mexico, but when that was destroyed by a hurricane, he replaced it with Joyxee. Measuring a spacious 20 meters in diameter, the island floats on 100,000 plastic bottles with cabins of recycled wood. Complete with beaches and waterfall, the island has become a popular tourist attraction as well as an extravagant home for Sowa. Home sweet homeless . Designer Gregory Kloehn re-purposed a New York dumpster into an apartment, featuring a separated kitchen, bathroom and sun deck. He then expanded the concept, accessorizing waste disposal units further with abandoned washing machine, bicycle tires and scrap wood, for as little as $30 a time. Several of these have been made available for the city's homeless community. Earthship Biotecture . Originating in New Mexico, the Earthship designers are now exporting their sustainable building principles as far afield as Malawi and Haiti. Steel-belted rubber provides the primary building component for the distinctively shaped off-grid structures, with interior walls composed of colored glass from reclaimed bottles. Energy is also harvested from the immediate environment at minimal cost. The company run courses across the world teaching their methods adapted to local resources. Would you live in a house made of sand and bacteria? Toothbrush house . An entirely recycled concept creation in the British city of Brighton draws on an imaginative range of construction materials. Thousands of toothbrushes and video tapes make up the wall insulation, bicycle tires hold the windows in place, with supporting roles for denim jeans and chalk waste. The ""house of waste"" will be monitored over a trial period to determine whether the design could be reproduced at scale. A place in the woods . American artist Ethan Hayes-Chute makes found wood his foundation, which have been displayed around the world in a series of inhabitable installations. The designs explore themes of ""quiet, solitude and isolation"", leaning to a rough-edged aesthetic that the average hermit could realistically aspire to. Maison Gomme . Dutch artist group Refunc made use of locally-sourced car tires for the walls of a chic garden cabin, completed with the windows of a bankrupted local business and recovered steel. The group have become masters of tire re-purposing, having also used them as a building block of furniture and vehicle construction in South Africa. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN)  -- I was 5 years old and my dad and I were on our way to the neighborhood bakery to buy a loaf of bread. It was early on the morning of January 1, 1959. A stranger stopped us on the deserted street right outside our second-floor apartment. CNN's Arthur Brice remembers his fear, uncertainty and excitement as a boy during the Cuban revolution. ""Did you hear?"" he asked. ""Batista is gone."" Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista had fled the country in the middle of the night. Fidel Castro would soon be in power. Not many people can remember details from when they were 5 years old. But not many people have lived through what I did in the late 1950s. Conversations with my parents have refreshed those memories. I remember a sense of surprise and excitement that morning, tinged with fear and uncertainty. My dad says I was tranquil and quiet. ""Let's go back upstairs,"" he said after hearing the news. ""Yes, let's go, Papi,"" my dad quoted me as saying. Back in our apartment, we tuned the radio to a local station, which confirmed the news. My mother insisted we stay inside, saying there would be trouble. Indeed, a short while later, we heard loud gunshots as rebels hunted down Batista officials and supporters door-to-door. That night, someone went up to our building's rooftop patio, looking for a Batista supporter. Two shots rang out. I cringed, squatting next to a wall. I remember the terror I felt. That was the day the revolution triumphed. In two short years, Fidel Castro and his ragtag band of rebels had done what many considered impossible. They would soon march triumphantly down the spine of Cuba from their rebel stronghold in Oriente Province on the eastern end of the island to Havana to assume power. Fifty years later, Castro, his younger brother Raul and other revolutionaries are still there -- but not so for the millions of Cubans who have fled to the United States and elsewhere. Twenty-one months after that morning when we heard the news, my family and I would be among those refugees. It is fair to say that few Cubans who lived through the revolution expected that outcome. Castro had been hugely popular and widely seen as a savior who would deliver Cuba from 50 years of dictatorships and unstable governments. He had promised free elections and a return to constitutional government. The highly unpopular and much-feared Batista had been a major player in Cuban politics since 1933, when he and a group of low-ranking army officials took control of the government. A power-broker, Batista effectively ruled behind the scenes until he was elected president in 1940. He held power until 1944, when he was defeated for re-election. Batista did not go away quietly. He was elected to the Senate in 1948 and was running for president in 1952 when he staged a coup after it looked like he wouldn't win. Ruthless and dictatorial, he ruled with a bloody iron fist. Fidel Castro, meanwhile, had been a student leader at the University of Havana in the late 1940s, heavily involved in the violent and passionate Cuban politics. On July 26, 1953, he and a group of about 100 followers attacked the military Moncada Barracks in the eastern city of Santiago. The attack failed miserably and about half of the insurgents were killed. Castro fled to the nearby Sierra Maestra mountains, but was captured a short while later. While on trial in late 1953, he gave his famous ""History Will Absolve Me"" speech in which he said, ""Condemn me. It does not matter. History will absolve me."" Pardoned under a general amnesty in 1955, Castro fled to Mexico, where he continued to plot against Batista. He formed the 26th of July Movement, named for the date of the Moncada Barracks attack, and gathered money and support. It was there that Castro met a man who would become a revolutionary legend, the Argentinean Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. In late November 1956, the rebels set sail from Veracruz aboard an old yacht named ""Granma."" Castro and his group of less than 100 followers landed a week later in eastern Cuba, where most of them were caught or killed. Castro, his brother Raul and Guevara were among the handful who escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains, where Castro had sought refuge after his disastrous Moncada attack three years earlier. The rebel leader won popular support among the peasants in his remote hideaway while urban dissidents sowed insurrection in the cities. Adopting guerrilla warfare tactics, Castro and his followers were able to inflict stinging defeats on Batista's army, which was mostly composed of young, untrained and unmotivated soldiers. My mother, father, new baby brother and I lived in Santiago during the revolution, near the Sierra Maestra. From a vantage point in the city, we could see Batista's planes bombing the rebel strongholds in the distance. We would see Batista's armed troop convoys leaving their garrisons in the morning, heading for the jungle of the mountains. There were whispered comments among Cubans that  the ambulances full of dead and wounded soldiers were returning under cover of darkness in the middle of the night. What happened during the revolution registered strongly on a young boy who was robbed of a normal childhood, but who grew up witnessing history outside his front door. I remember my dad coming home from work one day with a bullet hole in his car from a stray shot. I remember heading to the beach one day along a country road outside Santiago and my dad unsuccessfully trying to push my head down in the back seat so I couldn't see the body lying next to the highway, barbed wire strung around the man's neck. I remember looking out the second-floor balcony of an apartment we previously lived in and seeing a car full of young men chasing a screaming woman down the middle of the street. The men's arms stretched out of the windows as they pointed weapons at the woman. The woman and the men disappeared from view, blocked by the corner of the building, so I never knew what happened to her. That day, a major shoot-out broke out in the plaza in front of our apartment and my mother and I hugged the floor for safety. She crawled into the kitchen and got me a small glass of wine, which she had me drink so I would fall asleep. When I woke, there was quiet -- but no peace. Another day, a car with four Batista secret police pulled up downstairs and the men got out, leaving the doors open and the engine running. They went into the business downstairs, searching for a Castro supporter. I don't know what happened there, either. I remember a few days after the announcement of Batista's defeat, Castro started his procession down from the mountains and along Cuba's central highway to the capital, Havana. My parents were thinking about going down to watch the triumphant parade, but I asked that we not. I was scared of what might happen. A few days later, I remember watching our console black-and-white TV as Castro gave his first speech before tens of thousands in Havana. I don't remember his words, but I do remember a white dove that perched on his shoulder as Camilo Cienfuegos, a major revolutionary leader and cohort, stood by his side. Every once in a while, Castro would stop and turn to Cienfuegos and ask him, ""Voy bien, Camilo?"" Am I doing OK, Camilo? And Cienfuegos would answer, ""Vas bien, Fidel."" Ten months later, Cienfuegos' plane disappeared over the ocean during a flight to Havana, and the whispering started. Although it is widely held that Cienfuegos perished in an accident, many Cubans started saying privately that Castro or his brother Raul had him taken out over political differences or because of a perceived threat from the charismatic revolutionary known for wearing a wide-brimmed hat. To this day, the Castros continue to pay homage to Cienfuegos. An official logo for the 50th anniversary of the revolution bears a drawing of Castro and Cienfuegos. And to this day, I remember the day 50 years ago that began with a journey for a loaf of bread that would change my life and that of so many others forever.","CNN's Arthur Brice in Santiago when Castro, other rebels rose up against Batista .

"(CNN)There was a time when Roger Ebert was, simply, ""the fat one."" When TV viewers first saw Ebert -- whether it was on ""Sneak Previews,"" his and Gene Siskel's national PBS movie review show, or ""Siskel & Ebert & the Movies,"" the widely syndicated version -- they latched on to the look: a slightly rumpled, sweater-vested guy with glasses, paired off with the much taller, balding Siskel (who, of course, was ""the bald one""). Never mind the Pulitzer Prize for criticism, which Ebert was the first film critic to win. Never mind the probing interviews with figures such as Kirk Douglas and Burt Reynolds. Never mind the expertise he brought to his job or the no-nonsense attitude he had in offering his critiques. Most people didn't see that -- until they settled in and watched the two Chicago critics go after each other, debating the finer points of ""Blue Velvet"" or ""Die Hard."" It was only then that, perhaps, viewers realized this wasn't just a show about movies. Movie quiz: How 'Ebert' are you? It was also a show about movie reviewing, movie embracing, movieGOING. A shared awe and love of pictures projected in the dark. And that was Ebert's genius. (Siskel, who died in 1999, should get some credit, too. The pair's chemistry was integral to the show's spirit.) They reveled in film in ways that appealed to the aficionados -- folks who knew who Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael were -- and to the masses, popcorn-loving audiences who didn't care so much about art as wanting to be entertained for two hours. But well before ""Sneak Previews"" and well after Siskel's death, Ebert reveled in film and shared his enthusiasm with others. In 1967, when he was hired as the Chicago Sun-Times' movie critic, he hadn't yet turned 25 but sounded like a film veteran. A generation later, when the Internet came calling, he was all over it, developing his own website, tweeting incessantly, sounding off in one format or another. He made his site a home for young movie enthusiasts and ran reviews from ""far-flung correspondents."" He invited comments and, perhaps surprisingly, rarely had to deal with trolls. By loving conversation, he made sure the dialogue was always respectful. Trolls and fanboys went elsewhere to vent. It's not that he wasn't opinionated. His arguments with Siskel -- and later with Richard Roeper -- testify to that. One of his books was titled ""I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie."" Another was ""Your Movie Sucks."" But even the emotion was less about anger than disappointment, a sense of ""how dare you."" He knew how hard it was to make a movie; after all, he'd written the script for a couple, including ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"" and went out of his way to praise small performances and little-known filmmakers. A film that didn't try was more than a waste of time. It was an offense. ""(I) hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it,"" he wrote about ""North."" ""I've seen bad movies before. But they usually made me care about how bad they were,"" he wrote about a film called ""Mad Dog Time."" Not even cancer, which forced the removal of his lower jaw and eventually took his life, could tamp down his energy. As he watches a movie, ""Ebert scribbles constantly, his pen digging into page after page, and then he tears the pages out of his notebook and drops them to the floor around him. Maybe 20 or 30 times, the sound of paper being torn from a spiral rises from the aisle seat in the last row,"" Chris Jones wrote in a 2010 Esquire profile. ""The lights come back on. Ebert stays in his chair, savoring, surrounded by his notes. It looks as though he's sitting on top of a cloud of paper."" Watching movies has been compared to waking dreams: the darkness, the colors, the sense of being immersed in another world. More than once, Ebert wrote about the experience of seeing films as a reverie and escape. Few were better at conveying that sense to those outside the theater. And that cloud? One can see him there, a man among the mist, lost in the light.","Movie critic Roger Ebert appealed to film aficionados and the popcorn-loving masses .

"A wave of explosions targeting Syrian government forces killed dozens of people at a popular Aleppo square Wednesday in an attack for which a Syria-based extremist group has claimed responsibility. Al-Nusra Front said the strikes were carried out by suicide bombers driving cars packed with explosives, followed by raiders disguised in Syrian military uniforms, according to a statement posted on a website that publishes claims from extreme Islamist groups. ''The second explosion happened at 8:17 a.m. outside the Governorate Building where a suicide bomber blew up a car bomb loaded with 500 kg of explosive material,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Two mortar shells also fell near the Municipal Palace, it said. At least 40 people were killed and about 90 were wounded when three car bombs exploded in Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Though Syrian state-run media put the death toll at 34, with 122 injured. State television, meanwhile, aired footage of the carnage, which included the bloody and mangled bodies of men in military uniforms. Why Syria turmoil threatens the Middle East . A fourth car bomb exploded near Aleppo's chamber of commerce, the government and opposition said. The number of casualties from that incident was not immediately known. The blasts highlight the escalating crisis in Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, which has morphed into a major battleground between government and rebel forces. Aleppo is also a major financial lifeline for President Bashar al-Assad's government; a rebel takeover of the city would deal a significant blow to four decades of Assad family rule. Opposition groups later reported that ""a number of regime forces"" had been killed following the shelling of a Syrian military center near the town of Tal Abyad. The deaths were not part of the Wednesday toll distributed by the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. It said at least 200 people died across Syria on Wednesday, including 67 in Damascus and its suburbs and 29 in Idlib province. More than 28,000 people have been killed across Syria since March 2011, the LCC says. CNN is unable to independently confirm casualty reports, as the Syrian government has severely limited access by international journalists. 300,000 and counting: The crisis of Syria's refugees . In other developments: . Shelling from Syria strikes house in Turkey . At least five people were killed and 10 injured when a shell landed on a house in the Turkish town of Akcakale, near the Syrian border, the town's mayor said Wednesday. The artillery shell was fired from the Syrian district of Tel Abayad, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency. However, it is not yet clear what military force or group launched it. Mayor Abdulhakim Ayhan said those killed were three children, their mother and a female neighbor. Two police officers were among those hurt, he said. In return, Turkey fired on Syrian government targets. ""Our armed forces on the border responded immediately to this atrocious attack within the rules of engagement, and points in Syria determined by radar were hit with artillery fire,"" a statement from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said. ""Turkey, within the confines of the rules of engagement and international law, will never leave these types of provocations aimed at our national security unanswered."" UK steps up aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey . The United Kingdom will provide an additional 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) to help Syrian refugees through the Turkish winter, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Wednesday. ""Refugees from Syria face what is likely to be a bitterly cold winter. The supplies this extra funding will deliver will go some way to helping them through this difficult time,"" Clegg said in a written statement. The United Kingdom has given 38.5 million pounds ($62 million) in humanitarian aid during the Syrian crisis. The added funding is expected to help about 10,000 refugees with supplies such as blankets, clothing and heaters .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Not so long ago, we defined relations between Mexico and the United States by how its president got along with our president. Yet, when the U.S. chief executive is distracted by events in Russia and the Middle East, what counts now is how Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto relates to the governors of U.S. states. As U.S. governors go, Pena Nieto has his favorites and his not-so-favorites. In the first camp, there is California Gov. Jerry Brown, who seems to be el presidente's new BFF for pursuing a progressive agenda concerning Mexicans living in the Golden State. In the second camp, it's a good bet that you'll find Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who may be getting ready to fuel a 2016 presidential bid on anti-Mexico fear-mongering. With Americans concerned about immigration and drug violence, perhaps Perry's gambit is that painting our neighbor as an obstacle to a secure border will play well with voters in conservative arenas like the Iowa Caucus. During a recent visit to Los Angeles, where he spoke to a gathering of several hundred dignitaries and Mexican and Mexican-American leaders, Pena Nieto praised Brown for pursuing a progressive agenda regarding Mexicans living in California. The Mexican leader made clear he is pleased that California is giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants and making it easier for them to work and start businesses in the Golden State. ""I want to thank you for what you have done for migrants, especially the ones from Mexico,"" Pena Nieto told the crowd. ""It's no coincidence that my first visit to the United States is in California."" As opposed to, well, Texas -- which, nonetheless, might have been on Pena Nieto's mind as he delivered his remarks. ""There are still states that have not evolved so much as California, that still skimp on recognition and, even worse, the rights of immigrants,"" he said. ""Those who still believe and bet for the exclusion and discrimination or the rejection of diversity ... I only have one thing to say: the future, and a very near future, will demonstrate your ethical mistake. Time will show we're right."" Pena Nieto didn't specifically name which states he was talking about. But, if you've been following the news along the U.S.-Mexico border recently, you know that, as far as Mexico is concerned, Perry is on the naughty list. Eager to cast himself as the Republican candidate who is best-equipped to protect and defend the homeland against another terrorist attack, Perry recently floated the terrifying idea that Islamic terrorists affiliated with ISIS could have already entered the United States through the U.S.-Mexico border. ""There's the obvious great concern that because of the condition of the border, from the standpoint of it not being secure and us not knowing who is penetrating across, that individuals from ISIS or other terrorist states could be,"" Perry told a gathering at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank based in Washington. ""I think it's a very real possibility that they may have already used that."" It could be a ""real possibility"" but -- as Perry acknowledged -- no evidence backs it up. Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said on CNN's ""New Day"" that the Pentagon has ""no information that leads us to believe that"" ISIS was crossing at the U.S.-Mexican border."" That said, we do know they have aspirations to hit Western targets, and it's something ... we've got to take seriously and we have to try and be ready for it."" So, if nothing points to this, why would the Texas governor say something so irresponsible? See above, under ""Iowa Caucus."" Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Jose Antonio Meade was not amused. He took Perry to task, insisting that his statements about Islamic fundamentalists crossing the U.S.-Mexico border were based on nothing more than ""beliefs, speculation and absolutely unfounded and absurd analysis."" That's going easy. What Perry said wasn't just absurd. It was dangerous. The marriage between the United States and Mexico is vitally important, and it pays dividends in law enforcement, economics, cross-border trade and intelligence gathering. A border governor shouldn't toy with damaging that relationship just to get a leg up on the next presidential election. And because Perry is a border governor, and thus privy to sensitive information gathered by the Texas Department of Homeland Security, he has to be especially careful about leaking some of that material -- either in total, or in part -- without putting it in its proper context. Letting the enemy know what we know is not smart, and it could put Americans in danger. That's a high price to pay for a soundbite.","Texas Gov. Rick Perry said ISIS terrorists may come into U.S. through border with Mexico .

"In an otherwise smart suburb of Beirut is a small prison housing some of the women Lebanese society would rather forget. Some of the 70 inmates of Baabda Prison are accused or convicted of murdering their husbands, others of drug trafficking. Many of the women have themselves been victims of circumstance all their lives and are now for the first time discovering they have a voice, according to Zeina Daccache, an actress and drama therapist working with the inmates. Several times a week for the past six months, Daccache has spent an afternoon with the women encouraging them to talk about their experiences. In February or March, the project will culminate in a performance called ""Scheherazade in Baabda,"" named after the fictional Persian Queen and narrator of ""One Thousand and One Nights,"" and based around the women's own stories. Among the 20 prisoners involved is Fatme, now 26, and awaiting trial for a murder she denies. In video footage of the project, Fatme said: ""I never learned to say no. I was always obedient, saying yes to my very early marriage, saying yes to my parents who forbid me to get divorce. Now I'm learning that I have a voice and it can spell no."" Libya's accidental child victims . Daccache, who has a weekly political satire show on Lebanese television and also runs a drama therapy center Catharsis, said the project -- funded by the Swiss-based Drosos Foundation -- had empowered the women and for the first time gave them an opportunity to express themselves. She said: ""You would be amazed how many are there for murder and it's mostly for killing their husbands. They were married at 12 or 13 years old to someone they had never met before. ""They were pregnant at 13 and had husbands who beat them or had psychological issues. If they went to their family or to the police for protection, they would just be told it was a domestic issue. ""They ended up protecting themselves with their own hands. They are not saying their crimes were the best solution, but in some ways they had no other choice."" Daccache said several other inmates were in jail for drug trafficking and their young children were left on the streets. ""If the woman and her husband are both in prison, there is no protection for their children if they don't have families who take them,"" she said. Other inmates who are serving shorter sentences for adultery have joined the project for a limited period but will be released before the final production. Daccache said: ""For many of them, the real crime was that they were born a woman. There's this underlying patriarchy to everything in this country."" Who are Middle East's most influential women? The play will be performed in the prison in front of invited guests, including government ministers, prison authorities and the women's families. Daccache said: ""They are in prison, but many of have said they feel free for the first time because it's the first time they can talk about anything they want. ""The play is giving them the space to do things they have never done before and to convey a message. ""It's a message to protect women's rights and to protect women from domestic violence."" Another of the inmates is Maryam, 40, who was married by her family at the age of 15 to a cousin and had three children. She is accused of murdering her husband. Maryam is taking part in a flamenco dance for the production. In film footage she said: ""For the first time I learn how to move this body of mine, as if I was imprisoned in a body that didn't belong to me."" Four years ago, Daccache began a similar project with male inmates in Lebanon's largest prison Roumeih. A documentary film she made about the work, called ""12 Angry Lebanese,"" won several international awards. This is the first time she has worked in a women's prison. Daccache is filming the work in Baabda for a similar documentary about the women involved. She said the women were initially reluctant to show their faces on camera, but eventually realized it was an opportunity to tell their stories. ""At first they wore disguises to cover their faces when we were filming, but eventually decided to take them off,"" said Daccache. ""People tell me they can't believe the women agreed to be filmed because of the stigma, but they had been hidden away all their lives and didn't want to be suppressed anymore."" One of the inmates, Nisrine, a 28-year-old woman serving a three-year jail term for fraud, said in film footage: ""I was so worried about appearing in front of the camera, then after thought if I hide my face I'd be only contributing to hiding myself, my voice, the women and human being within me. ""I'm taking off my mask and showing (myself) as I wish to."" Respected American drama therapist Amand Volkas joined Daccache to run workshops with her in January. He said: ""In Lebanese society, she is a visionary. She is able to use her prominence as an actress to have a very powerful impact.""","Drama therapy helps Lebanon's women prisoners tell their life stories .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Young girls were sitting in the back of their family's car, with their backpacks and a Hello Kitty notebook, when a Palestinian attacker tossed acid at them Friday, Israeli authorities said. The Jewish family, including four girls, stopped to pick up an Israeli hitchhiker near a Jerusalem checkpoint, The Israel Defense Forces said. A nearby Palestinian man ""attacked both the passengers and the hitchhiker with acid, wounding them lightly to moderately,"" the IDF said in a statement. The wounded hitchhiker and another civilian ""began chasing after the terrorist,"" who turned on them with a screwdriver, the statement said. A nearby driver then tried to ""halt the Palestinian with his vehicle. The Palestinian attempted to flee and the driver fired at his lower extremities, identifying two hits. The terrorist, as well as the victims, received preliminary medical care at the scene."" The perpetrator was a 44-year-old from Nehalin who ""is known to have been previously involved in illegal and hostile riots and activities,"" the IDF said. The Palestinian man was taken to a hospital in Hadassah ein Kerem to be treated, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The IDF tweeted what it said was a photo of the car in which the attack occurred.

Abu Ein -- a minister in Abbas' Fatah party and head of the Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements -- was there participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international Human Rights Day, according to Erakat's statement. There were varying reports of exactly how Abu Ein died, including what role -- if any -- Israeli authorities played in it.

"(CNN)The Pentagon's recent statement that Iran may have conducted air strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq's Diyala Province is tantamount to a U.S. tacit approval of Iran's growing military footprint in Iraq. No military operation of such scale evades detection from U.S. radars. Even if not pre-approved or coordinated, Iran's air and ground operations against the murderous thugs of self-proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi make the Islamic Republic effectively a U.S. partner in the fight against America's greatest enemy: Islamist fundamentalism. The U.S. strategy towards the Middle East since the Arab Spring has been defined by proactive disengagement and hesitance. Haunted by the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan, the American public has no stomach to get bogged down in lengthy ground-intense military operations -- particularly not to fight a fight that at least in Washington is perceived to be primarily a matter of regional concern. And it seems as if apart from a general war fatigue and casualty aversion back home, U.S. President Barack Obama does not want to be remembered as the President who embarked on a third Middle East adventure. As a hostage of public opinion, Obama in his second term increasingly appears to be the lame-duck choosing a path of minimal resistance overseas, making decisions not based on long-term strategic considerations but based on a short-term approach of damage control. In Libya, Syria and Iraq the U.S. has taken a backseat calling on local partners and proxies to take over. Any ex-ante foreclosure of boots on the ground means that the U.S. will not bring its military might to bear to deal with those threatening to tear the Middle East apart. In Syria the U.S. ignored the problem of Bashar al-Assad, in Iraq it turned a blind eye to Nouri al-Maliki's policies of exclusion while allowing Libya to degenerate into a state of anarchy. Without a sustainable proactive strategy towards the Middle East, the U.S. policy towards the region was more often than not shaped in reaction to quickly escalating events on the ground. As a result, the U.S. today looks at a region where the states of Libya, Syria and Iraq have effectively ceased to exist. The socio-political vacuum has been filled by transnational non-state actors of whom many subscribe to the black banners of jihadism -- something that leaves the American public deeply unsettled. The broadcasted images of U.S. citizens being brutally beheaded in front of a global audience shook America to its core. After years of relative disengagement and idleness, Obama is now forced to do something in Syria and Iraq at last. Thereby, the overriding principle seems to be to keep the military footprint as small as possible. The major burden of intervention has to be borne by force multipliers who operationally as well as strategically substitute U.S. willingness and capability -- all this in a war that is no longer about protecting the revolutionary achievements of the Arab Spring but about primarily containing the threat of Islamist fundamentalism. In this war, Libyan renegade general General Khalifa Haftar, al-Assad and Iran are the lesser of two evils. The unlikely coalition formed the multilateral response of the U.S. administration to the dilemma of reconciling public security concerns with public war fatigue. Everyone seems welcome. Yet, Iran appears the more reliable partner: a regional superpower with the necessary capability, strategic will and input on the ground. Good cooperation with Tehran, even if indirect, allows the U.S. to put pressure on its Arab partners in the Gulf to step up their game against Islamist fundamentalism in the region. At the same time the U.S. wants the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf to constructively commit to providing the options on the ground, the U.S. is no longer able or willing to provide. Not to forget, the rapprochement with Iran also allows Obama to put a final end to Netanyahu's saber rattling vis-à-vis Tehran. The U.S., although committed to Israel's security, will not be available for a military solution to the Iranian nuclear question. The American-Iranian rapprochement on the region's most sensitive battlefield of all things, further undermines America's position in the Middle East. Apart from losing the hearts and minds of the region, America's credibility as a superpower is in doubt as long as capability is constrained by the political unwillingness to use it. Without the American willpower to take a more long-term strategic approach to tackling the socio-political root causes of regional upheaval, regional players, including al-Assad, will step in to develop their own strategy independently. The result will be a gradual intensification of regional confrontation along sectarian and ideological fault lines -- a confrontation to which the U.S. will be a mere onlooker.","The U.S. strategy towards the Mideast has been disengaging, writes Andreas Krieg .

"(CNN) -- It would be dishonest to say that 2014 has been a good year for women. We looked in disbelief as a terrorist group in Syria and Iraq turned women into slaves, and another radical group in Nigeria captured hundreds of female students and disappeared with them. But 2014 was also a year in which many women fought back and inspired the world with their bravery and savvy. They taught us that the stakes are high and the road to a better future is fraught with difficulties, but with strength and dignity, we can get there. Here are some of the women who in 2014 stared down the odds, helped change history, or changed our perceptions. 1. Vian Dakhil and the Kobani women who fought ISIS . The most enduring and inspiring images of 2014 come from the besieged city of Kobani, the Kurdish town on Syria's border with Turkey where ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, met unexpectedly fierce resistance. ISIS militants, who have brutalized girls and women, knew they would face opposition but did not expect Kobani's defending army to include large numbers of women. Women make up about one-third of Kobani's defenders and are part of a dramatic effort by female residents in Iraq and Syria to turn the tide against ISIS's misogynistic extremists. It was Vian Dakhil who captured the world's attention by telling her fellow members of the Iraqi parliament about the impending genocide of the Yazidis. There were also women in Mosul, Iraq, who gave their lives fighting against ISIS in other ways. Their collective message? They would do everything possible to stop ISIS from reviving the practice of selling women into slavery. 2. Josephine Finda Sellu and Kaci Hickox took on Ebola . International attention on Ebola -- and panic that it will spread in the West -- has waned. But the battle to stop Ebola in West Africa continues, and the front lines are guarded by women, mostly nurses risking their lives to care for the ill. The story of Sierra Leone's Josephine Finda Sellu, showed the incredible courage and commitment of the task. She recalled more than a dozen nurses in her staff already dead, wondering how many more would perish. Most of those fighting the disease are Africans, but Western volunteers have joined, also doing heroic work. They included Kaci Hickox, a Maine nurse who found herself at the center of a politicized dispute when she returned home. Hickox refused to allow politicians and public health officials give in to public fears. By refusing to sit quietly in an airport isolation tent, and later in home quarantine, she forced Americans to look more clearly at the risks and helped put an end to the overblown panic. 3. Oby Ezekwesili helped rally the world to #BringBackOurGirls . When hundreds of Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram, the Islamist radical group, Nigerian women needed help to resolve the crisis. Oby Ezekwesili was one of the key figures who helped launch a viral campaign, #BringBackOurGirls, that took the Twitterati by storm and got the world's attention. Some of the girls managed to escape, and bravely told the horrifying story of their captivity. The threat from Boko Haram is no longer secret. Neglect by the central government is harder to conceal, and the search is not over. Hope for their return is not lost. 4. Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Prize . When it comes to defying those who would stop women's equality, the foremost icon is Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl shot in the head by the Taliban to stop her efforts to help girls attain education. Malala survived and kept up her mission. She and Kailash Satyarthi, an Indian children's rights advocate, won the Nobel Peace prize together. She is the youngest person in history to win the award. 5. Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and others came out against Cosby . More than a dozen women have come out accusing Bill Cosby, a beloved television personality, of sexual assault and rape. Women such as Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Janice Dickinson, Judy Huth and others. Perhaps what's most surprising is that these accusations are not new but that the world had not taken them seriously. Nothing has been proved in a court of law, but the women, whose voices are finally being heard, have created an important zeitgeist moment. Sexual assault by anyone, even powerful people, is simply not acceptable. These women are breaking down the barriers for others to come out and tell their stories. 6. Minal Sampath and fellow space explorers boosted India . When Indian scientists and engineers put a rocket into orbit around Mars, mission control exploded into cheers. Among them were scores of women in colorful saris. India's space program is drawing worldwide accolades, and many of the people responsible for its success are Indian women. Bravo! 7. Shonda Rhimes and Julianna Margulies are changing prime time . For decades, women were relegated largely to supporting role on U.S. television. That has changed, with strong women now playing the lead in several prime time shows. The small screen is suddenly filled with powerful, multidimensional characters -- women whose lives are not centered on the men in their lives. There's Olivia Pope, the lead character played by Kerry Washington in ""Scandal,"" from producer Shonda Rhimes. There's Alicia Florrick, played by Julianna Margulies in ""The Good Wife,"" from producers Robert and Michelle King. And there's Elizabeth Faulkner McCord, played by Tea Leoni, in ""Madam Secretary,"" a show created by Barbara Hall. The landscape of television is being transformed -- we now have new role models not to mention more interesting programming. 8. Taylor Swift and Sofia Vergara know how to build empires . Women may have performed for a long time, but the phenomenon of women taking charge of their careers and building empires is newer. Talented, entrepreneurial women are creating entertainment empires with themselves at the center. This year, Taylor Swift seemed to have been everywhere while her album is the biggest of the year in copies sold. Meanwhile, Sofia Vergara remains the highest paid actress on TV for a third year in a row. They have become powerhouses, expanding their reach and their influence.","Frida Ghitis: 2014 is a year in which many women fought back against injustices .

"If only this was just a Halloween trick. Visitors trying to log on to the Obamacare website early Thursday morning saw the same stubborn phrase that has roiled users for weeks: ""The system is down at the moment."" It's been almost a full month since the HealthCare.gov website launched, riddled with technical problems despite a series of advance warning signs. And despite a chorus of apologies out of Washington, it may be another month before everything's running smoothly. Vice President Joe Biden became the highest-ranking administration official to apologize Wednesday for the botched rollout. ""We assumed that it was up and ready to run,"" he told CNN's sister network HLN. ""But the good news is although it's not -- and we apologize for that -- we are confident by the end of November it'll be, and there'll still be plenty of time for people to register and get online."" That came after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius apologized for the ""miserably frustrating"" problems with the website during a 3 1/2-hour congressional grilling. The former Kansas governor promised a ""vast majority"" of consumers will be able to shop online for health insurance under Obamacare with greater ease by the end of November. Analysis: Sebelius deals with a difficult day . 5 things we learned from Sebelius hearing . ""In these early weeks, access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans, including many who have waited years, in some cases their entire lives, for the security of health insurance,"" Sebelius said. To the frustrated users who have had problems, she said: ""You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems."" She said she made a mistake when she told President Barack Obama that HealthCare.gov was ""ready to go"" for its October 1 launch. ""Clearly, I was wrong. We were wrong,"" she said. ""We knew that in any big, new, complicated system there would be problems. No one ever imagined the volume of issues and problems that we have had and we must fix it."" Obama couldn't log on . Biden said he didn't even bother logging on to the Obamacare site. ""Actually, the President tried to get online, and my daughter tried to get online,"" he said. ""I did not, because it was clear that I was not getting online."" Obama himself acknowledged that too many people ""have gotten stuck, and I am not happy about it."" ""There's no excuse for it,"" the President said. ""And I take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed ASAP."" Glass half full? Sebelius said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its central promise to provide affordable health care coverage. Thousands have been able to access the website to look at new health coverage options that will give them security of knowing they won't go bankrupt if they get sick, she said. Who is Kathleen Sebelius? She echoed the overall administration stance -- that a team of experts is scrambling to fix the website's errors. Republicans have called for Sebelius to be fired for the Obamacare problems, but a White House spokesman said Wednesday that Obama has ""complete confidence"" in her. ""She took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the (Obamacare) website, but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the Affordable Care Act implementation that have gone well,"" spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. In fact, Obama tried to turn the tables on Republican opponents of his signature health care reforms, challenging them to come up with helpful ideas instead of undermining the federal law. ""Anyone defending the remnants of the old, broken system -- as if it was working for people -- anybody who thinks we shouldn't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody ... those folks should have to explain themselves,"" he said. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans have coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that ""a significant portion"" of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges. Sufficient preparation? Some of the criticism of the website's launch has to do with what Obama and other officials knew and when they knew it. CNN has learned the administration received stark warnings a month before the launch that the Obamacare site was not ready to go live, according to a confidential report. The caution, from the main contractor CGI Federal, warned of risks and issues for HealthCare.gov, even as company executives were testifying publicly the project was on track. Administration was warned before site launch . Sebelius told the House committee the outside contractors that built the website never recommended delaying this month's launch. But she conceded that ""we did not adequately do end-to-end testing."" The contracts with the private companies working on the Obamacare website -- which amount to $174 million so far, with more bills due well into 2014 -- do not have ""built-in penalties"" allowing her department to charge them for disappointing or faulty work, Sebelius said. But the Sebelius said the agency will not pay for incomplete work. Security questions . Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, accused Sebelius of putting the private information of Americans at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website. ""This is a completely unacceptable level of security,"" he said. ""You know it's not secure."" Sebelius responded that testing occurs regularly, and she told Rogers she would get back to him on whether any end-to-end security test of the entire system has ever occurred. Rogers responded that he knows there have been no such comprehensive security tests. Memo warned of high security risk at health care website . An internal government memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday and written days before the website launched warned of a ""high"" security risk because of a lack of testing. ""Due to system readiness issues, the (security control assessment) was only partly completed,"" said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services memo. ""This constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the Marketplace Day 1 operations."" Sebelius told CNN last week that Obama didn't know of the problems with the site -- even though insurance companies had complained and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run -- until after it went live. A senior administration official said Obama now gets a ""nightly readout"" with the latest Obamacare statistics and an update of the website's status.

"Rep. Michele Bachmann says now that she's leaving Congress, she can ""take the handcuffs off."" In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday, the eight-year Minnesota congresswoman said she wants to play a major role in the 2016 presidential campaign -- even though she has no plans to seek the Republican nomination. ""I intend to go around the country and speak nationally on a variety of issues. I'll be writing. I'll be affiliating with groups,"" she said. Bachmann had harsh words for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), calling Thursday night's vote to pass a government funding bill -- which Bachmann opposed -- the most consequential of her four terms. She voted against the bill Thursday. She said Boehner had linked arms with President Barack Obama to avert a government shutdown without defunding Obama's executive action overhauling U.S. immigration rules. ""The cake was baked months ago,"" she said. Bachmann, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, repeatedly deflected questions about whether she'd run again in 2016. She said she hasn't formed a campaign committee -- and that's a sign that she has no plans to jump into the race. But, she said, she does want to ""be involved"" in the race. ""I'm the only woman on the Republican side who's ever been in a presidential debate. I've been in 15 of them,"" Bachmann said. ""I have no plans to put together a committee and run again, but I do intend to be involved.""","Rep.

"Forget college basketball players cutting down the nets after a victory. Some fans of March Madness are making their own monumental snips: vasectomies. ""If you are going to be laid up on the couch for a few days, you might as well get  (a vasectomy) done when there is some great college basketball on TV,"" said Mike LaSalle, a 40-year-old father of two who had a vasectomy Friday.  ""You had all the conference championship games over the weekend and the NCAA tourney starts this week."" Dr. Philip Werthman, urologist to the rich and famous in Los Angeles, performed the vasectomy on LaSalle, who is a partner in a private equity firm. ""(LaSalle) came in wearing his Notre Dame cap,"" said Werthman with a laugh.  ""He said, 'My team is not in it this year, but I might as well hang out at watch the March Madness games.'"" Werthman says he is booked solid throughout the year, so he sees no spike in the number of vasectomies during March Madness. But he does see patients jockeying for coveted time slots just before and during the NCAA men's basketball tournament by booking the procedures much earlier than usual. A major clinic in Ohio reports it performs 40 or 50 more vasectomies a month before and during the 68-team basketball tourney. ""We do have (in March) typically about 50% more vasectomies than in other months,"" said Dr. Ed Sabanegh, chairman of the Department of Urology at the Cleveland Clinic. ""A lot of patients come in and say, 'I have to have this during March Madness, you have to talk to my wife about it. Tell her what my limitations are and that I need to be on the couch.' ""They'll even tell us to exaggerate a little about how long it takes to recover."" Sabanegh adds some enthusiastic fans stroll into their procedures, which take 30 minutes to an hour, sporting the jerseys of their favorite teams, and one fan prepared for his vasectomy recovery with a colorful aid. ""This patient in the past few years came in with his team's logo on an ice bag, Ohio State,"" the urologist recalled.  ""He was just excited about the game, and I said, 'We are all Ohio State fans today.'"" During the surgical procedure, tubes are tied to block the release of sperm when a man ejaculates to prevent pregnancy. Tales of March Madness and vasectomies seem to confound the American Urological Association. ""The AUA does not have data showing any link between March Madness and an increase in the number of vasectomies performed,"" the AUA said in a statement to CNN. But Urology Associates of Cape Cod placed a cable ad for vasectomies during last season's NCAA basketball tournament to drum up business. ""Want to watch college basketball guilt-free?"" the announcer in the promotion asked.  ""Camp out on the couch for uninterrupted basketball."" The Cape Cod clinic gave away 41 coupons for free pizza to vasectomy patients last February and March as part of the promotion but declined to repeat the deal this year. ""There was definitely an uptick in our business,"" said Ethan Cohen, the clinic's practice coordinator.  ""The promotion gave the wife an opportunity to take about vasectomies, because in our experience usually the guy doesn't bring it up, it's the wife."" The department of urology at the Cleveland Clinic is already preparing by opening up extra appointments to handle the higher number of vasectomies. Urologists recommend vasectomy couch potatoes wait a week before they become romantic but offer a warning when they rediscover their inner Austin Powers. ""We won't know that the vasectomy has completely worked for three months,"" says Sabanegh. ""So they need to use an alternate form of contraception."" Just when it seems a possible March Madness vasectomy trend may be starting, there a twist. ""I had a patient come in on Thursday with another idea,"" said Werthman. ""He received a reverse vasectomy he wanted timed before March Madness."" So far there are no stories of March Madness winners retying the nets.","Some college basketball fans plan their vasectomies near the NCAA tournament .

"This Congress is going out just the way it began: in complete disarray. Fourteen months after tea party conservatives ignored Republican leaders and forced a two-week government shutdown, another one came close to happening -- this time because liberals were blowing off President Barack Obama's pleas to support a government funding measure. In the early morning hours Friday, Obama signed a two-day extension, and the Senate is expected to pick up the legislation and vote on it later Friday, though they have until midnight Saturday before the next deadline. For weeks, legislative leaders insisted another shutdown wouldn't happen. And it didn't. But the House was just two hours away, and the Senate might not cast its final votes until this weekend. Another flirtation with another deadline -- this one after a midterm election that swept Republicans into control of the Senate -- offers a grim glimpse at the paralyzing levels of dissent that could come next. Republicans don't fear their leadership. And Democrats don't need their President. After November's elections, when the GOP won the Senate and expanded its majority in the House, party leaders claimed a mandate. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged that with Republicans in control of both chambers come January, things will be different. More amendments will be allowed. ""Center-right"" legislation will advance. But long-clear divisions on the right remain -- and were evident in the House when 16 Republicans, many angry that the party hadn't fought harder to block Obama's executive action on immigration, opposed the measure in a key procedural vote and nearly dealt their leaders a major blow. By the end of the night, 67 Republicans voted against the measure's final passage. Conservative lawmakers complained that House Republican leadership punted their latest opportunity to combat Obama's signature health care law -- which they fought to defund during the October 2013 shutdown -- and his executive overhaul of immigration and deportation rules. ""We've seen the same pattern ... Now Obamacare is funded. Now Obama's executive amnesty is funded,"" Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said on Fox News. Alongside him, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, called the vote ""disrespectful"" to midterm voters. Even if Republicans gain stability, Democrats are splintering. Fresh off an election that purged the Democrats of many of their most centrist members, liberals -- now more influential within their own ranks -- have gone rogue, saying ""no"" to what the White House called a fair compromise, even though their bargaining position isn't going to get better. In an extraordinary scene Thursday afternoon, two of the party's most influential members made high-profile breaks with Obama. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the government funding measure ""blackmail"" because of its inclusion of language rolling back a Wall Street reform that Democrats had fought hard to win in 2010. Meanwhile, the party's liberal hero, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, declared on the Senate floor that it is ""time for all of us to stand up and fight."" Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were calling House Democrats, urging them to support the measure. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough rushed into a caucus meeting to make its case. But Democrats insisted as they exited that meeting that McDonough hadn't won many members over. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, said Democrats need to draw a line now to signal that they won't accept these kinds of deals in the future -- when Republicans will control the Senate, too, and are certain to advance bills with more conservative priorities. ""If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything,"" Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, said in the meeting. Still, some influential lawmakers said the government funding measure was a chance at redemption. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, said Thursday night was an opportunity for Congress to break a pattern in which lawmakers have ""paralyzed ourselves by making the perfect the enemy of the good."" ""We tried to govern on a bipartisan basis,"" she said. ""We reached across the aisle and we reached across the Capitol dome.""","President Barack Obama signed the deadline extension early Friday morning .

"He's a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement, officials say. Eric Matthew Frein apparently cut his hair into a mohawk-style haircut as part of his mental preparation for the attack on police and was active in a military simulation unit that reenacted Cold War-era European conflicts. And now authorities worry the man suspected of gunning down two Pennsylvania State Police troopers may be on the hunt for more officers. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday investigators are trying to determine why Frein may have attacked in the small, central Pennsylvania town of Blooming Grove. But they know that, generally, Frein ""has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder,""  according to Noonan. ""He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society."" Police say he's responsible for the chaotic, bloody scene Friday night at the state police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Wednesday, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens provided a few new details about Frein, including his apparent fascination with Eastern European armies, their history and attire. His simulation group -- which Bivens declined to name -- would stage re-enactments using Airsoft guns. In this case, though, authorities say Frein is using live ammunition and shooting to kill. ""It is believed that Frein has assumed the simulation role, and is now acting it out in real life,"" Bivens said. The police lieutenant colonel said Frein has ""his head shaved on the sides with long hair on top,"" wider than a ""mohawk"" haircut, apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers. The hairstyle is ""completely different from what he had worn for years. In words directed at Frein, Bivens was blunt. ""If you are cowering in some cool damp place,"" Bivens said, ""We are coming for you. It is only a matter of time until we bring you to justice for committing these cowardly acts."" Nearly 200 officers are scouring eastern Pennsylvania for Frein. The manhunt has prompted schools in the area to close Wednesday. Until Frein is caught, no one is letting their guard down. Bivens said Frein has had a ""longstanding gripe with law enforcement and government in general"" since at least 2006 and will likely ""stay focused on that fight."" The police lieutenant colonel thinks he's likely still in the general area. ""This fellow is extremely dangerous,"" Noonan said. 'Get him inside' Cpl. Bryon Dickson was just ending his shift around 11:50 p.m. Friday when he walked out the station's front door. He barely made it outside when a gunman shot him multiple times, a probable cause affidavit said. Another officer who saw Dickson on the ground came outside to help, the affidavit said. But as Dickson told her what happened, another shot pierced through the air. According to the documents, Dickson asked his colleague to ""get him inside."" But she couldn't. At about the same time, a third officer headed in to start his overnight shift. But as Trooper Alex Douglass walked toward the front door, he, too, was shot, the affidavit said. While Douglass managed to crawl into the station, other officers had to devise a plan to safely move Dickson inside. They swooped into the front of the building in a marked SUV to block troopers as they brought Dickson into the building. But it was too late. Dickson was declared dead at the station. Douglass was rushed to a hospital in Scranton and is recovering from a gunshot wound to the pelvic area. Authorities have been looking for Frein since. They haven't found him. But, on Monday morning, a man walking his dog in a wooded area of Pike County noticed a green Jeep slightly submerged in a retention pond, according to the affidavit. As he walked closer, he noticed no one was inside. But when troopers executed a search warrant, they found a cache of items inside: two spent .308 cartridge casings, camouflage face paint, military gear and ""various information concerning foreign embassy's,"" the affidavit aid. They also found Frein's driver's license and Social Security card. A survivalist by hobby . Frein, 31, is a survivalist by hobby who lives in Monroe County, authorities said. Noonan said anyone who might know something about Frein or spot him should contact authorities right away. But a friend of the suspect described Frein as ""a pretty rational guy."" ""He's intelligent. When people say that he's a survivalist, there's almost somewhat of a negative connotation to that,"" the friend, who wanted to be identified only as ""Jack,"" told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""He definitely let his opinions about the government be known,"" Jack said. ""He was obviously a big critic of the federal government, but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me. No indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular. Most of his aggression was (toward) the federal government."" Frein's father told authorities that two firearms were missing from the family's house, including an AK-47 and a rifle. The father said his son grew up with guns and was a member of his high school's rifle club. When Frein shoots, his father told authorities, he ""doesn't miss."" Troopers, town hurting: 'Everybody feels it' As Pennsylvania state troopers hunt for Frein; they are mourning one of their own. About a dozen of their vehicles, lights flashing, passed through Dickson's hometown of Dunmore en route to his funeral Wednesday at Marywood University in adjacent Scranton. Jim Williams told CNN affiliate WNEP that he was happy to give coffee and lunch to some state troopers that came into his Dunmore business, Varsity Pit Stop. But he understands they'll need much more to cope with their loss. ""What they're going through now, it's terrible,"" Williams said. Many people in the borough of 14,000 people are hurting, too. ""It's a small town. Everybody knows everybody,"" Dunmore resident Mike Brazil told WNEP.  ""And it's hard ... Everybody feels it.""","Pennsylvania state troopers, town hurting as slain officer is buried .

"The Korean Air executive who kicked up a fuss over a bag of nuts will resign from her remaining posts with the airline, the company chairman -- who is also her father -- said Friday. The executive, Heather Cho, found herself at the center of a media storm after she ordered that a plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed -- all because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class. Although her role put her in charge of in-flight service, she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity. The incident, which took place last week at New York's JFK airport, stirred anger among the South Korean public over Cho's behavior. Cho, whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah, resigned Tuesday from the airline's catering and in-flight sales business, and from its cabin service and hotel business divisions, the company said. But the 40-year-old kept her title as a vice president of the national carrier, according to company spokesman. That's going to change, her father, Cho Yang-ho, said Friday as he made a public apology for what happened. She will be resigning from the vice president job and positions held in affiliate companies, he said. Asked by reporters how the incident could have happened, the company chairman blamed himself, saying he'd raised her badly. 'Outburst of anger' A local English-language newspaper, The Korea Times, said her behavior has deepened public resentment of South Korea's large family-owned corporations, known as chaebol. ""Through her outburst of anger, she not only caused inconvenience to KAL passengers, but also to those on other flights,"" the newspaper said in an editorial Tuesday. The most annoying type of airline passenger is ... South Korean authorities are now investigating the incident, which occurred on a flight due to take off for Incheon International Airport near Seoul. Cho arrived at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport on Friday as part of the investigation, according to local TV coverage. She spoke in such a low voice that it was inaudible from the TV footage. 'An excessive act' Korean Air apologized for any inconvenience to those on the flight and said there had been no safety issues involved. The plane arrived at its destination 11 minutes behind schedule, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. ""Even though it was not an emergency situation, backing up the plane to order an employee to deplane was an excessive act,"" the airline said earlier this week. ""We will re-educate all our employees to make sure service within the plane meets high standards."" The airline also issued an apology on Heather Cho's behalf, Yonhap reported, in which she asked for forgiveness and said she would take ""full responsibility"" for the incident. According to her biography on the website of Nanyang Technological University, Heather Cho joined the airline in 1999 and has since been ""actively involved in establishing a new corporate identity for Korean Air."" She studied at Cornell University and the University of Southern California.","Airline chairman: Heather Cho will be resigning from all posts with the company .

"(CNN) -- At 35,000 feet, the orange glow of a European sunrise begins to pierce the horizon from beneath a tufted layer of clouds. Unfortunately, it will be only a matter of minutes before that glow transforms into a pupil-penetrating annoyance through the windscreen of our 777. The irritating glare won't, of course, affect the way we navigate our way to London's Heathrow Airport; a complicated and well-engineered computer system using GPS positioning provides information to air traffic controllers. But what if this well-oiled machine breaks down? Do we need to start worrying? That was a question facing pilots in airspace over the United Kingdom on Friday, when Shanwick Oceanic, a part of the UK's NAT system of air traffic control, developed a computer glitch. Shanwick is the airspace that most flights transit to or from not only Britain, but also from France and other European countries, covering airspace from south of Iceland to north of the Azores, and just west of France to almost the middle of the North Atlantic. So when Shanwick develops a computer glitch, air traffic arriving and departing into the United Kingdom is most affected. But while a malfunction affecting the flight of objects hurtling through the sky at 600 mph might sound scary, rest assured that Mom and Dad celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary aren't at any risk of colliding with another airliner en route. It just means they might be a little late arriving for their vacation. Airplanes that are already airborne receive priority by virtue of the fact controllers understand that only a finite amount of fuel remains in the tanks. As airline pilots, it becomes a matter of calculating whether our fuel on board is sufficient to fly a few circles in a holding pattern or divert to our alternate airport. Traditional radar is still available once the flight travels in range of a land-based facility. Departures, however, will be delayed until the situation is rectified or mitigated. So, why isn't there a risk of collision? As it has been since the days of the DC-3, the track system is a nonradar environment. Radar signals don't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean, so before airplanes enter the North Atlantic track system, from either east or west, a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude. In other words, airplanes are separated both vertically and laterally based on their known performance. This is still the case. Before the latest computer technology became prevalent, oceanic controllers would track airplanes manually based on verbal pilot position reports at designated degrees of longitude. With the advent of more precise navigation, more precise onboard automation and more exact ground-based air traffic control systems, the separation limits have decreased, allowing for more flights between North America and Europe. All this means that airplanes can still maintain this separation even if the ground-based oceanic computers take a temporary vacation. How? Because we are required to maintain our assigned altitude and our assigned airspeed. And since the actual tracks change daily according to weather and winds, the performance of all the participating airplanes will be affected exactly the same. When the current technology system breaks down, the solution is either to increase separation limits or just wait until it is fixed. Verbal position reports would be required because our onboard ADS-B system wouldn't be able to communicate with the particular oceanic facility. Unfortunately, stopping departures that will be transiting the airspace is the simplest solution rather than temporarily resorting back to the old methods -- hence the delays on departing flights that were experienced Friday. This of course raises the question of whether the global air traffic control system has become computer dependent. The simple answer is, absolutely. But it is also worth remembering that the technology has also increased efficiency. And, more importantly, it has added another degree of safety to air travel. With all that in mind, we are just going to have to suffer through the compromise of inconvenience when the technology breaks down. Or find another way to get to our intended destinations.","Air traffic control system for London airspace has technical failure Friday .

"(CNN) -- ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams has come up with a nostalgic way to reveal the names of the movie's characters. We've known for months that ""The Force Awakens"" features fresh faces like John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac. We even got to see them in action in the movie's first trailer, which was released the day after Thanksgiving. But the lingering mystery was who exactly those actors are playing. Now, thanks to some clever retro-style trading cards, we know the names of their characters. The Force is with the new 'Star Wars' trailer . Abrams teamed up with Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy to create a set of trading cards that are a callback to the ones issued with ""Star Wars"" debut in 1977. The cards, which were unveiled by Entertainment Weekly, don't tell us a lot; we pretty much just get a name and a small description. Hate the new lightsaber? Stephen Colbert shows why you're wrong . In other words, let the speculation begin. According to the cards, Isaac, the X-wing pilot seen in the first trailer, is playing someone named Poe Dameron. We don't know whether he's a good guy or a villain, but that name isn't exactly friendly. John Boyega, the actor seen at the start of the trailer stressed out in his Stormtrooper suit, is playing someone named Finn. His card acknowledges that he's ""On the run,"" which might fuel speculation that Boyega's wearing Stormtrooper gear as a disguise. And Daisy Ridley, the actress we see speeding through a desert landscape in the trailer, is playing a character named Rey. Earlier this year, rumors circulated that Ridley's character was called Kira on set. In addition to those three, Abrams also revealed the name of the cloaked figure wielding that heavily debated new lightsaber: That character is Kylo Ren. Plus, we also learned that the little rolling droid at the beginning of the trailer is called BB-8, which Entertainment Weekly suspects will be as sweet as it looks. That's all Abrams has shared for now, but we're still a long way off from ""The Force Awakens' "" release date. The movie is set to bow on December 18, 2015.

"He was -- in every sense of the word -- Hollywood royalty, with critically acclaimed performances in some of the biggest films of the last decade and friendships with A-list actors. Even so, there was something about Phillip Seymour Hoffman that made him so identifiable to so many. What made Hoffman different? 1. He made some of our favorite movies . Make a list of your all-time favorite films and, chances are, several of Hoffman's are there. As prolific as he was talented, Hoffman is best-known for his portrayal as writer Truman Capote in the 2005 biopic ""Capote."" It earned him an Academy Award. He also stole the screen in ""The Master,"" ""Doubt"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War."" But his films weren't always so serious. Hoffman could wear his roles as light as caps. Remember ""Boogie Nights?"" Or ""Along Came Polly?"" Hoffman was the sort of actor that no matter who else was in the film, or what his part was, if you saw he was in the cast, you knew it had to be good. 2. Mr. Hollywood, he was not . Hoffman was one of us. For all his larger-than-life roles, he had a reputation as a regular guy. He didn't live in a mansion in Hollywood but rather an apartment in New York. He sent his children to public school, and he was routinely seen walking them there, said CNN's Rose Arce, who lived two blocks from the actor in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.

"(CNN) -- A string of ""brazen attempts"" to kill members of a gang task force in Riverside, California, has led to a $200,000 reward for information. Authorities hope the reward will encourage people to come forward with information related to three booby traps targeting members of the Hemet Gang Task Force, part of a countywide initiative dedicated to combating gang-related violence in Riverside. ""These brazen attempts to kill police officers in the line of duty are an outrage and even a form of urban terrorism. Our brave men and women in uniform put their lives on the line every day to keep our streets safe,"" California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Thursday. ""We urge anyone with information on the attacks to come forward immediately."" Brown was joined by Riverside District Attorney Rod Pacheco, Sheriff Stanley Sniff, Hemet Police Chief Richard Dana and Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone in the public appeal for information. Multiple local, state and federal agencies, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives contributed to the reward. Authorities believe the close timing and identical targets of the attacks indicate they could be related, said John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. On December 31, 2009, the unmarked headquarters of the Hemet Gang Task Force was targeted by someone who redirected the natural gas line on the roof into the building, filling up the office with deadly gas. Two task force members entering the office smelled gas and backed away before flipping the light switch and potentially causing the building to explode. On February 23, a task force member at the Hemet headquarters opened a security gate outside the building, which launched a homemade zip gun attached to the gate. The weapon fired, missing the officer's head by inches. The headquarters has since been moved to an undisclosed location, where extra security precautions are being taken, Hall said. On March 5, 2010, criminals targeted a task force member who had parked an unmarked police car in front of a convenience store in Hemet. The officer found what appeared to be a homemade pipe bomb hidden underneath the vehicle. ""There's a person or people out there, a bunch of idiots that are trying to do damage to us. We mean to catch them. We mean to see them spend the rest of their life in jail,"" Dana said. ""I'm hoping now, with $200,000, somebody's gonna have noticed one of them, call us, tell us who it is, and let us get something done."" Hemet is one of eight local, state and federal agencies that make up the Riverside County Gang Task Force, which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs countywide. As the county expanded and its population grew, so did the presence and reach of organized crime, Hall said. Since 1997, the number of gangs in Riverside County has grown from 266 to 391, according to the task force's Web site, and total gang membership has grown to 10,620 members countywide. Since the task force's inception, the number of gang members and violent crimes has decreased and the amount of arrests and warrants served has increased, Hall said. On Wednesday, at least 31 members of the Vagos motorcycle gang were arrested at locations throughout Riverside County in ""Operation Everywhere,"" which spanned four states. Hall said he could not say whether the Vagos were believed to be involved in the Hemet booby traps, citing an ongoing investigation. He said it was safe to assume that some gang activity was involved in the attacks. ""It's possible that the gang members are feeling threatened, that we're starting to impede on their activity and they're retaliating,"" he said. ""The investigation is still fluid and no arrests have been made, but they're not targeting regular police. It's reasonable to believe that they are targeting members of the task force specifically."" CNN's Brett Roegiers contributed to this report.","Authorities hope $200,000 will produce tips on ""brazen attempts"" on gang task force .

"A 4.4-magnitude earthquake shook the Los Angeles area on Monday morning, jolting some people awake just before sunrise but bringing no immediate reports of serious damage. The quake, centered about 6 miles north-northwest of Westwood and about 15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, happened at 6:25 a.m., the U.S. Geological Survey said. ""I sort of sat up in bed, waited a second, then put my head down for a bit. I wasn't really afraid,"" a man walking his dog in downtown Los Angeles less than an hour after the quake told CNN affiliate KTLA. He didn't provide his name.

""The sliding-glass doors were just rattling like somebody had slammed into them. Nothing fell off the walls."" The USGS's online ShakeMap showed that strong to moderate shaking would have been felt near the epicenter, with lighter vibrations felt in Los Angeles proper. Geophysicist Paul Caruso said that significant damage or casualties generally wouldn't be expected with earthquakes weaker than a 5.5 magnitude, though results vary by region, often depending on construction codes and types of rock that exist underground.

"Visitors to the Houses of Parliament on Friday may have seen more than they bargained for. Protesters against new rules limiting online pornography gathered to simulate some of the now-banned sex acts, including ""face-sitting."" The campaigners aimed to highlight what they say are arbitrary and sexist changes to the law that don't distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual acts between adults. But to spare onlookers' blushes (and a potential brush with the law), those taking part in what was dubbed the #PornProtest on Twitter remained fully clothed. The new regulations, which came into force on December 1, ban various acts being depicted in online pornography produced in the United Kingdom, including face-sitting, female ejaculation and spanking, in part to protect children from being exposed to potentially harmful content. However, they do not make it illegal for people to watch videos produced outside Britain or to perform the acts themselves. One of the protest organizers is Charlotte Rose, winner of the UK sex worker of the year title in 2013 and a free-speech advocate. She told CNN that the bill could be perceived as being sexist because the banning of certain acts appears to target women's sexual enjoyment. ""This is about censorship, and what the government is doing is they're censoring our consent -- so yes, it does affect women, but it also affects every man and every woman,"" she said. ""It affects anybody who enjoys these particular activities."" Consenting adults . Rose says she believes the law will be ineffective and will impinge on people's personal liberty and right to freedom of expression. ""The whole point of the law was to protect people against violent acts of sex, but who can state what is violence when you've got consenting adults?"" she said. The law won't stop people from performing the banned acts, she said. ""All it's doing is adding more frustration and concern to the public that we are coming away from democracy"" and moving toward more government control. Her Facebook event page for the protest reminds people to bring a mat to lie on and to learn the words to Monty Python's ""Sit on My Face"" song. 'Canary in the coalmine of free speech' Myles Jackman, a lawyer specializing in sexual liberties and obscenity law, has also opposed the new regulations. ""Pornography is the canary in the coalmine of free speech: it is the first freedom to die. If this assault on liberty is allowed to go unchallenged, other freedoms will fall as a consequence,"" he wrote on his blog. What he describes as a ""declaration of state censorship"" will affect millions of consenting adults who choose to view British pornography, he said. It will also impose an unnecessary barrier to trade, hitting independent content producers within the United Kingdom and costing the Treasury tax revenue, he said. Besides these issues, Jackman said, the law ""is practically unworkable as it can be circumvented by proxy servers; and has implications for all forms of freedom of expression on the internet."" Speaking to CNN at the protest in central London, he said ideas on social values and sexual morality among the general public were about 15 years ahead of those held by those making the laws. ""Free speech is fought on the fringes, and it's the mainstream which is at risk of falling if the fringes aren't protected, so this is a very strong free speech issue,"" he said. Rose also warned that the new regulations would affect smaller, independent UK pornography producers rather than the big websites. One lawmaker, Julian Huppert of the Liberal Democrats, put forward a motion in Parliament last week calling for the new measures, set out in the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014, to be annulled. The protesters hope that by causing a stir outside Parliament, others may back their case for it to be dropped.","Critics say changes to the regulations governing online porn are arbitrary and sexist .

"(CNN) -- While others will sharply disagree, I believe John Brennan deserves a national salute for his press conference yesterday about the CIA. At a time when we are tearing ourselves apart over one controversy after another, he provided a model of a calm, adult leader trying to put the country first. No doubt there will be counterattacks trying to blow holes in his story. Maybe there are some. But we sorely needed someone to come forth with views that are more balanced and impartial than a tragically one-sided report released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee. There were half a dozen aspects of the Brennan press conference that were welcome: . For starters, he placed the interrogation program into a context that too many are forgetting. As Brennan pointed out, the attacks that morning of 9/11 terrified the country and we quickly looked to the CIA to track down those responsible and ensure they never attacked us again. We didn't want those agents -- as the phrase goes -- to bring a baguette to a knife fight; both the White House and Congress wanted them to do whatever it took. Brennan also made clear that the CIA (he served as deputy director under President George W. Bush) was not prepared to run a detention and interrogation program -- who would have thought they needed one? They put it together quickly, but -- as Brennan readily conceded -- some agents then went far beyond the rules, employing brutal interrogation techniques. He should also have conceded that was torture. What has been missing in much of the hyperventilation over the Senate report is that the number of people water boarded was actually tiny: three says Brennan, though the Senate Committee insists the number is slightly higher. With numbers that small, it is far more believable that most agents -- as Brennan said -- acted within the rules. Is this any basis for treating the CIA like a brutal, rogue operation? In law school, one of the first lessons learned is how important distinctions are. Brennan made a crucial one: the difference between causation and correlation. The agency, he says, gained valuable intelligence -- such as leads on bin Laden -- from prisoners who had undergone enhanced interrogation techniques (""EITs"" in the trade). BUT it is unclear whether they might have given that same information had they not been treated to EITs. The latter, he kept insisting, is ""unknowable."" In other words, he does not think that harsh techniques necessarily caused detainees to open up. Yet it is also clear from his version of events that interrogators saw a correlation: Valuable leads could often come after harsh techniques. This correlation makes it easier to understand why Bush officials would want to continue the EITs, and why so many CIA directors and deputy directors defend the program. This is a distinction that is thus very, very important. To be fair, Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein insists that much of the information given up by detainees was obtained before they were subjected to EITs. This disagreement between her and Brennan is one of several that need further scrutiny. But Brennan's version of events lends credence to the notion that neither the agency nor the Bush administration was acting as criminally as their critics charge. On one side, we now have a stinging indictment of the CIA drawn up by committee staff members all hired by Democrats. Only Democratic members of the Committee approved their report. Their report was drawn up based upon millions of documents, but not a single interview with CIA agents. On the other side, we have a well-laid out defense coming from John Brennan, who worked in the White House under Bill Clinton and was so trusted by another Democrat, Barack Obama, that he was appointed to run one of the most sensitive organizations in government, the CIA. This same man admits that the CIA made many mistakes, that the interrogation program was deeply flawed, and that it was properly stopped -- but he insists that overall, CIA agents deserve respect for bravely putting their lives on the line for the country -- some 20 have died -- and very importantly, for helping to prevent a new 9/11. Given this background, isn't John Brennan at least as credible as the Committee, if not more so? Aren't his views more balanced -- and thus deserving of respect? Shouldn't his views help us to moderate the red hot coverage in the press and the monotonous partisan attacks among politicians? I think so. One more thing: Brennan asked us to keep things in perspective. We need to do that -- to remember what makes us Americans. No other country to my knowledge has been so transparent about its paramilitary techniques in the midst of a dangerous war. Indeed, we all know what the terrorists would have done had they captured a bunch of Americans: They would have butchered every last one. Good for John Brennan, he's helping us think clearly again.","David Gergen: CIA chief is talking sense about the CIA interrogation program .

"Militants allied with al Qaeda fired rockets at Yemen's largest military airbase Thursday, claiming they were aiming at U.S. targets at the facility. Ansar al Sharia, an al Qaeda affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying on Twitter that its fighters targeted the U.S. section within Al Anad airbase in retaliation for attempts the United States made to rescue American hostage Luke Somers. Yemeni Defense Ministry officials said six rockets were fired at the airbase in the country's southwest. They couldn't give an exact number of casualties but said some Yemeni troops were wounded. No militants were reported to have been captured or killed in the aftermath of the attack. One rocket exploded near an oil storage facility, which resulted in a fire but no major damages. The rockets missed their intended targets, a Yemeni Defense Ministry official said. Somers and another hostage, South African Pierre Korkie, were both killed in a failed U.S. military raid on militants over the weekend.","Ansar al Sharia, an al Qaeda affiliate, claims responsibility for the attack .

"Washington (CNN) -- Investigators believe that Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shahzad had ties to TTP, a Pakistani Taliban group, a senior law enforcement official and a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday. The law enforcement official said the extent of Shahzad's involvement with TTP has not been determined and could range from communications to training, and does not necessarily mean that TTP directed the attack. TTP released a video making a claim of responsibility for the attack on a website established the day before the failed bombing attempt, but a spokesman for TTP has denied any connection with the 30-year-old Pakistani-American. A U.S. official said earlier in the day that connections to TTP were ""plausible,"" but noted that numerous connections among insurgent groups in Pakistan made it difficult to zero in on a single responsible group. The advance came shortly after a senior U.S. official said that new leads developed from the Pakistani end of the investigation show Shahzad likely had training in Pakistan from extremists. The official has direct knowledge of discussions between senior U.S. and Pakistani officials about the case. ""Did he receive help in Pakistan? Yes he did,"" said the official. The official said Shahzad is believed to have received training of some sort but would not say if the training was specific to the Times Square bombing attempt. The official and another U.S. official said investigators had not concluded from which group Shahzad may have received help. Also Thursday, a high-level team of U.S. and Pakistani investigators grilled Shahzad's father and interrogated four people linked to a notorious Pakistani militant group, intelligence officials said. The interrogators questioned Bahar Ul Haq in the northwestern Pakistan city of Peshawar. The retired senior Pakistani air force officer is the father of Shahzad. Ul Haq -- who lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad -- was neither detained nor arrested, the source said. Another official said the team was also questioning four men suspected of having links to the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Banned in Pakistan, the group's aim is to unite the disputed territory of Kashmir with Pakistan and to expel foreign troops from Afghanistan, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. It is also close to al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. India and Pakistan have had disputes over Kashmir for decades. Shahzad told investigators he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan area of Pakistan, sources said. North and South Waziristan are regions in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas; both border Afghanistan. Officials said they suspect that Shahzad may be part of the Pakistani Taliban, a militant group fighting Pakistani forces. While the Pakistani Taliban has praised Shahzad in the wake of the failed bombing, it has denied a link to the man. In recent days, authorities in Pakistan have rounded up a number of people for questioning. One was Muhammed Rehan, an alleged associate of Shahzad who allegedly has links to Jaish-e-Mohammed, a senior Pakistani official said. Rehan allegedly was instrumental in making possible a meeting between Shahzad and at least one senior Taliban official, the official said. The official said that Rehan drove Shahzad on July 7 to Peshawar. At some point, they headed to the Waziristan region, where they met with one or more senior Taliban leaders, the official said. Several officials in Karachi said Rehan was picked up in Karachi's North Nazimabad district. They said others were taken into custody for questioning on Wednesday, but they could not say how many, who they were or where they were seized. It was not clear if Rehan was one of the four with alleged Jaish links being questioned on Thursday. Others taken in for questioning include Iftikhar Mian, the father-in-law of the suspect, and Tauseef Ahmed, a friend of Shahzad. They were picked up in Karachi on Tuesday, two intelligence officials said. Meanwhile, efforts to determine what may have motivated the suspect continued. An official familiar with the investigation said Wednesday that Shahzad felt Islam was under attack. Any grudge Shahzad may have held against the United States appears to have developed recently, according to a senior U.S. official who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly. The investigation has found nothing to indicate that Shahzad had any long-standing grudge or anger toward the United States, the official said. In Connecticut, where Shahzad was living, a prominent member of the Pakistani-American community said Thursday that he had maintained a low profile and appeared to have become more religious over the past year. CNNMoney: Faisal Shahzad's $65,000 home equity piggy bank . ""He was somebody who was under the radar; he was never a part of our community, never a part of our events or meetings,"" said Dr. Saud Anwar, founder and past president of the Pakistani American Association of Connecticut. After news broke about the suspect, the pulmonologist sent out e-mails to others in the community to dredge up what he could about Shahzad. ""As a physician, I look at it as a disease,"" Anwar said of Shahzad's apparent radical turn. ""I try to understand what led to the disease ... how we can prevent a disease like this."" Anwar said his e-mails turned up a man who studied with Shahzad at the University of Bridgeport and had stayed in touch with him since then, but does not want to be identified publicly. ""He recalled him as a regular individual, outgoing, interacting with people, interested to learn, not isolated,"" Anwar said. But, in the past year or so, ""he felt there was a change in his personality,"" Anwar said, explaining that Shahzad appeared to become introverted, asocial and ""a little bit more religious."" Anwar added, ""There was a little anger in there. [The friend] felt [Shahzad] was looking at things as true black and white."" Returning to his disease analogy, the physician said that, after Shahzad returned from Pakistan early this year, ""The disease became a little bit more progressive, much stronger."" Shahzad told his friend that, as a Pakistani-American, he was looking for work in the Middle East ""because he was having challenges with his job over here,"" Anwar said. ""He just mentioned that he was seeking something. I don't know if he found anything or not."" Shahzad has admitted he drove a Nissan Pathfinder into Times Square on Saturday night and attempted to detonate the vehicle, which was packed with gasoline, propane tanks, fireworks and fertilizer, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York. The previous day, he carried out a dry run, parking his Isuzu SUV on West 38th Street between 9th and 10th avenues a few blocks from Times Square to be used the following day as a getaway car, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told said. But on Saturday, after he left the smoking Pathfinder on West 45th Street just west of Broadway and walked to the Isuzu, he realized he didn't have the Isuzu keys, the source said. So he headed to Grand Central Terminal and boarded a train to Connecticut. Two store owners on West 38th Street said they had turned over surveillance tapes to authorities at their request. After a 53-hour police manhunt, Shahzad was arrested late Monday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after boarding a flight bound for Dubai, United Arab Emirates. His final destination was to have been in Pakistan. Read complaint filed in federal court Tuesday (PDF) He has been charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, and three other counts in connection with the incident.

"A top U.N. official arrived in Damascus on Tuesday in an attempt to ""draw attention to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria,"" the United Nations said. Valerie Amos, the U.N.'s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, is on a three-day trip to Syria and Lebanon. ""The humanitarian situation in Syria has further worsened in recent weeks as fighting has spread in Damascus and to Aleppo and other cities,"" the United Nations said. ""Two million people are now estimated to have been affected by the crisis, and over one million have been internally displaced."" She met with Prime Minister Wael al-Halaki, Syrian TV reported. In Aleppo, the line between life and death is thin . In Lebanon, Amos will meet with families who fled Syria and will talk with the government and humanitarian agencies about how to best support the refugees, her office said. Across Syria, the reports of relentless bloodshed mount by the hour. At least 70 people were killed Tuesday, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria opposition group said. The toll included 10 children and three women. Syria said the assistant director of the Health Directorate in Daraa was ""assassinated"" by ""an armed terrorist group"" Tuesday. Attackers  waited for Dr. Ma'moun al-Zoubi at the garage of his building ""and opened fire on him, causing his martyrdom,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported. In recent days, fierce shelling in and around dissident strongholds has aggravated the humanitarian crisis, opposition activists said. In the Homs suburb of Rastan, residents pleaded for intervention ""to break the siege of the disaster-stricken city, which has no access to any of life's essentials including bread, water, baby formula or electricity,"" the LCC said. Syria said authorities ""arrested dozens of terrorists"" in Aleppo and destroyed seven cars equipped with machine guns. Armed forces also killed and injured ""terrorists"" in an area called al-Kura al-Ardiya, SANA reported. Foreign ministers of Islamic countries have agreed to suspend Syria from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, ahead of the group's two-day emergency summit this week. The Syrian civil war is a key topic on the agenda of the summit, which opens Tuesday in the Islamic holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Read more: Syria expected to dominate Islamic summit . ""There is an agreement to support the Syrian people, and standing by their side, we are agreeing on freezing the membership of Syria until it retains its balance,"" Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafiq Abdul Salam said, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. The heads of state must approve the suspension before it can take effect. Meanwhile, a Syrian presidential adviser was scheduled to visit China on Tuesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. China, along with Russia, has repeatedly vetoed attempts at the U.N. Security Council to take stronger action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. A spokesman for the ministry said Bouthaina Shaaban, al-Assad's political and media adviser, will meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. ""To promote the political solution to the Syria problem, China has always actively balanced its work between the Syrian government and the opposition to urge Syria to put to practice (former Arab League and U.N. envoy Kofi) Annan's suggestions and advice by the U.N. Security Council -- immediately cease fire and all violent actions, protect civilians and resolve the crisis through talks,"" the spokesman said. ""China is also considering inviting members of the Syrian opposition to visit,"" the ministry said in a statement. The United States, meanwhile, lifted sanctions against the former Syrian Prime Minister Riyad Hijab, who recently broke with the regime. ""Recent civilian and military defections from the Assad regime are further indications that the government is crumbling and losing its grip on power,"" David S. Cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury, said in a statement. ""The United States encourages other officials within the Syrian government, in both the political and military ranks, to take similarly courageous steps to reject the Assad regime and stand with the Syrian people."" While the war rages on, Syrian rebels claimed one of their biggest achievements yet Monday -- the shooting down of a military jet. Struggling to define the Syrian opposition . Video posted by the rebel forces shows a jet framed in a cloudless sky being shot at, catching fire and falling out of frame. ""A MiG warplane shot down in Mouhassen!"" says an excited man off-camera, citing a location in Deir Ezzor. ""God is great!"" The government denied the jet was shot down, blaming the crash instead on a ""technical failure."" It said that the jet fighter was on an ""ordinary training flight"" and that the pilot ejected safely. The search for the pilot was still under way late Monday, according to SANA. A few hours after the rebels made their claim, the opposition LCC posted a video showing what it said was the pilot, whom it identified as Col. Mufeed Mohamad Suleiman. No identification card was shown. The man, dressed in civilian clothes and surrounded by armed men, called on other military officers to defect. He said the rebels had provided first aid for the bruises on his face that he suffered in the parachute jump. A man who identified himself as a rebel captain said the pilot would be treated as a prisoner of war. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of either video. A report Monday from opposition activists underscored the difficulty in resolving the Syrian crisis. It said that Syrian forces in Damascus had publicly executed at least 10 people in one town, and that residents were unable to reach the bodies because ""regime forces have been firing at anything that moves,"" the LCC said. The Syrian crisis has claimed roughly 17,000 lives since it erupted last year, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last month. Opposition activists have put the toll at more than 20,000.

The USS Lake Erie launches a missile as the satellite travels over the Pacific Ocean. ""We have a high degree of confidence we got the tank,"" Marine Gen. James Cartwright said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday morning. A fireball and a vapor cloud seen after the strike appeared to indicate the toxic hydrazine fuel had been destroyed, he said. The missile that struck the satellite did not carry an explosive warhead. Cartwright also said the satellite seemed to be reduced to small pieces. ""Thus far, we see nothing larger than a football,"" he said. The military was analyzing data from the strike to confirm that the tank was hit and that no larger pieces of debris escaped detection, Cartwright said. The missile that struck the satellite was launched from the ballistic missile defense cruiser USS Lake Erie from the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii at 10:26 p.m. ET Wednesday, the general said. Breakup of the satellite more than 130 miles above was confirmed 24 minutes later, Cartwright said.   Watch as the general explains how debris will be monitored » . Cartwright said the Navy took its first opportunity to hit the satellite and acted before days of expected bad weather may have prevented a missile launch. Cartwright said debris from the satellite was burning up in the atmosphere over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This process was expected for the next day or so.   Watch a report on the shootdown » . Officials had said the missile would not be fired until the space shuttle Atlantis landed, which it did Wednesday, to ensure debris from the destroyed satellite didn't strike the shuttle. The satellite was launched in December 2006. It lost power and its central computer failed almost immediately afterward, leaving it uncontrollable. The satellite carried a sophisticated and secret imaging sensor. Because it malfunctioned immediately after being launched, it had a full tank -- about 1,000 pounds -- of frozen, toxic hydrazine propellant. Without intervention, the satellite would have fallen to Earth in early March, officials said. Watch how the failing satellite failed to spark fears » . The fuel tank might have survived re-entry if the satellite had fallen to Earth on its own. It could have dispersed harmful or even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields. Hydrazine is similar to chlorine or ammonia in that it affects the lungs and breathing tissue. But some analysts said the Pentagon had reasons other than safety for bringing down the satellite. ""The spy agency doesn't want some part of the satellite to fall into the wrong hands,"" Philip Coyle, a former assistant secretary of defense, told SPACE.com. The Web site also reported that Coyle said the shootdown allowed the Pentagon to show off U.S. missile defense capabilities and to prove to China ""we can shoot down a satellite in a test without creating a lot of debris like they did."" The Chinese military destroyed an aging weather satellite last year. James Jeffrey, deputy national security adviser, denied the allegation that the U.S. was flexing its military muscle. ""This is all about trying to reduce the danger to human beings,"" he said. But Beijing appears to have doubts. ""China is continuing to closely follow the possible harm caused by the U.S. action to outer space security and relevant countries,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Thursday. ""China further requests that the United States ... promptly provide to the international community the necessary information ... so that relevant countries can take precautions."" Later Thursday, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Pentagon would share some information on the shootdown with China. In January 2007, China used a land-based missile to destroy a 2,200-pound satellite that was orbiting 528 miles above the Earth. The impact left more than 100,000 pieces of debris orbiting the planet, NASA estimated -- 2,600 of them more than 4 inches across. The U.S. agency called the breakup of the Fengyun-C satellite the worst in history. In 1989, a U.S. fighter jet destroyed an American satellite by firing a modified air-to-air missile into space from an altitude of 80,000 feet. That move adds to evidence the U.S. acted Wednesday strictly to guard against the prospect of a potential disaster, Cartwright said. The military timed its shootdown attempt so that resulting debris would tumble into the atmosphere and not interfere with other satellites, said Christina Rocca, a U.S. diplomat and expert on disarmament. Her comments were included in an online U.N. report on this month's Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Switzerland.  See dangers and possible solutions to the satellite problem » . The military also timed its efforts to minimize the chances that debris would hit populated areas. But the United States is ""prepared to offer assistance to governments to mitigate the consequences of any satellite debris impacts on their territory,"" according to a report of Rocca's remarks on the Web site of the Geneva office of the United Nations.

"Vice President Joe Biden spoke Wednesday night about how, as a child, he stood up to a local bully by smashing the boy's head and threatening to kill him. The remarks, which were published by the Daily Beast, came at an event organized by Vital Voices, a women's rights group, where Biden was recognized as a man who combats violence against women. Biden set the scene during the speech by detailing how his family would stop by a doughnut shop after Mass every Sunday. ""We'd get donuts, and my dad would wait in the car. As I was coming out, my sister tugged on me and said, 'That's the boy who kicked me off my bicycle,'"" Biden recalled. ""So I went home, we only lived about a quarter mile away, and I got on my bicycle and rode back and he was in the doughnut shop."" Biden then said he walked up behind the boy, who was with his parents, and ""smashed his head next to the counter."" When the crowd applauded, Biden said, ""I'm not recommending it."" After the scuffle, Biden says the boy's father grabbed him. The future vice president then said to both son and father, ""If you ever touch my sister again, I'll come back here and I'll kill your son."" ""Now, that was a euphemism,"" Biden said, getting to the point of the story. ""I thought I was really, really in trouble. My father never once raised his hand to any one of his children — never once — and I thought I was in trouble. He pulled me aside and said, 'Joey, you shouldn't do that, but I'm proud of you, son.'"" Six times Joe Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache . Biden has a substantial record of combating violence against women. As a senator in 1990, he introduced the Violence Against Women Act, legislation that changed law enforcement response and criminal justice sentencing for crimes against women. The oldest of four siblings, Biden was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania until age 11. In 1953, his family moved to the Delaware would regularly make the short trip to visit family in Scranton. Scranton also appears to have molded Biden into a fighter, too. 'White boy' Biden calls tea party 'crazy' In a 2012 interview with the AP, Tom Bell, a Biden childhood friend from Scranton, retold a story about how he asked Biden to beat up a bully next time he was in town. Biden, according to Bell, did just that. Richard Ben Cramer, in the seminal book ""What It Takes: The Way to the White House,"" also documented Biden's fighting steak. ""Once Joey [Biden] set his mind, it was like he didn't think at all—he just did,"" Cramer wrote. ""That's why you didn't want to fight him. Most guys who got into a fight, they'd square off, there'd be a minute or so of circling around, while they jockeyed for position. Joey didn't do that. He decided to fight ... BANGO—he'd punch the guy in the face."" Cramer noted that this fighting prowess came as much out of necessity as it did out of desire. ""Joe was kind of skinny, and he stuttered, and the kids called him Bye-Bye, for the way he sounded when he tried to say his name,"" Cramer wrote. ""But Joey would never back down, and he knew how to box, when no one else did.""

"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson blasted Rep. Duncan Hunter's suggestion that ISIS fighters have crossed the United States' southern border into Texas. ""Let's not unduly create fear and anxiety in the public by passing on speculation and rumor,"" Johnson said Wednesday on CNN's ""Situation Room."" Hunter, a California Republican, claimed on Fox News on Tuesday night that he'd learned from Border Patrol officers that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught trying to cross the Mexican border -- and that ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" Johnson said those claims aren't supported by ""credible, specific intelligence to that effect."" He said public officials should ""be responsible in what we decide to share with the American public, so that the public is informed."" His comments came after a Homeland Security spokeswoman called Hunter's statement ""categorically false.""

Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the congressman stands by his comments. ""A high level source informed the congressman -- it was also said that DHS is actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border,"" Kasper said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Torrential rains moved walls of rock and mud Friday in Southern California, burying homes in one neighborhood, closing a coastal highway and prompting evacuations of foothill communities imperiled by landslides. The damage marked the second day of a fierce storm slamming the Pacific Coast that, in California, served to trade one natural disaster for another, namely the state's record drought of the past three years. At a minimum, the biggest storm in years slaked the dry earth, but it is coming at a high price for many people. Mudslides swarmed or threatened homes near recent hillside fires. Ten homes in the Camarillo Springs area were damaged and red-tagged as uninhabitable after a mudslide crashed into a subdivision and piled rocks almost as high as roof lines, authorities said. An elderly couple needed to be rescued after they stayed in their home despite a voluntary evacuation order and suddenly found water and earth plowing into their bedroom, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. ""It just came pouring in, so I told my wife just stay in bed,"" the man told the affiliate after he was rescued. ""I could just feel the mud... there must be 3 or 4 feet of mud in there."" Firefighters carried the couple to safety, uninjured. ""I'm OK,"" the man told the station. Later Friday, Jim and Grace Shiraishi's son called his parents' survival of the landslide as ""pretty darn amazing."" ""It gets you by surprise,"" son Jim Shiraishi said. Swift water recovery and rescue . Firefighters in Orange County conducted a rescue in the swift waters of a flood channel in Garden Grove. The man being rescued, however, appeared to be dead and was stuck on a central pillar of a ditch tunnel, said Lt. Ben Stauffer of the Garden Grove Police Department. The victim was identified as 34-year-old Garden Grove resident Mario Alberto Hernandez. Detectives were investigating the circumstances of his death, Stauffer said. A pedestrian discovered Hernandez's body in the channel, he said. Meanwhile, Los Angeles firefighters rescued two people who were clinging to trees in the Los Angeles River, and they were in fair condition in a local hospital, the fire department said Friday. Evacuations . Residents piled sandbags outside their homes near where the so-called Colby Fire scorched 1,952 acres in Angeles National Forest in January near Glendora and Azusa. Glendora imposed a mandatory evacuation on unspecified homes in the Colby Fire Impact Area. Meanwhile, Azusa issued a voluntary evacuation order for its residents in the burn area, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Flooding, rocks and mud closed parts of the scenic Pacific Coast Highway from Monterey County down to Huntington Beach, the California Department of Transportation said. Northern California recovering . The Bay Area and other pockets of California began returning to normal Friday after the tempest doused exceptionally drought-stricken California with water, causing street and moderate river flooding, and producing blizzard-like conditions in the Sierra Nevada. The storm took a deadly toll further up the coast. Falling trees killed two people in Oregon and left a third seriously injured. At one point, the combination of powerful winds and battering rains knocked power out to 225,000 customers from Northern California to the Canadian border. Inundating rain . The rain intensity in Northern California on Thursday was reminiscent of a tropical shower in some places, a biblical deluge in others. Nearly 2.5 inches doused the San Francisco Bay Area, but north of there, just beyond wine country, 14.6 inches washed down on the Petrified Forest. The rain will put a dent in a historic three-year drought that has sapped reservoirs, threatening farmers and driving up food prices. ""We need it, but I wish it would come more evenly spread out, instead of all in one night,"" said Kim Cheadle, who commuted from Marin County but found her San Francisco office building closed Thursday. An 'atmospheric river' Much of the moisture, at least along the California coast, comes from an ""atmospheric river,"" a band of heavily moist air that split off from a larger such band in the tropics. It's as if a river in the sky spilled its banks, sending a new tributary 250 to 400 miles wide northeastward to California. Such atmospheric river drenchings in California are rare but also normal and necessary, the National Weather Service said. They're how the parched state gets up to 50% of its annual rainfall. The current ""river"" has been around since late November and already soaked the state last week. CNN's Greg Botelho, Dave Alsup, Topher Gauk-Roger and Erica Henry contributed to this report. Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles.

"Ukrainian sovereignty won't be the only casualty of Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to assert Russian influence and interest in Crimea. It's still far too early to calibrate how this crisis will play out and what its consequences will be -- but it's a fair bet that whether it ends in a Putin victory, defeat, or draw, it's going to make a difficult situation in the Middle East even more complicated. Whether Putin wins or loses in Ukraine, the odds that Russia could be a reliable partner for the U.S. have decreased dramatically.  And this only reinforces the painfully obvious:  When it comes to the core issues facing the U.S. in the Middle East, the U.S. must focus on outcomes, not solutions, and be very sober about what it might do to contribute to them. Russia's friends . As go Putin's fortunes, so go those of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. However the crisis turns out, with one possible exception, the Syrian regime is likely to benefit. And that exception is the highly unlikely contingency that Putin is so weakened from a botched policy in Ukraine or an uncharacteristically bold response from the United States and the West that he is permanently damaged and diminished, or removed from power. Not likely. The possibility that events in Ukraine will leave Putin victorious will only buck up al-Assad further and demonstrate that Russian street cred is rising.  After all, in September, Putin masterfully intervened and used diplomacy to stay a U.S. military response against al-Assad's use of chemical weapons against civilians. Now Putin appears to be standing up to the international community and ready to use force to protect Russia's interests in Ukraine. He's clearly not prepared to do that for Syria. But victories for Russia, particularly in the face of the West's empty rhetoric and red lines, can only reinforce al-Assad's conviction that he's betting on the right ally. Ukraine mobilizes troops amid crisis with Russia . A Putin win -- maintaining significant Russian influence in Ukraine that clearly undermines Ukraine's sovereignty -- will leave Russia stronger and more dependable as a partner and ally in the eyes of al-Assad and, probably, Iran. Although Iran is not nearly as dependent on Moscow as al-Assad is, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei looks at the crisis and sees Russian resolve in the face of a feeble West. The hardliners in Tehran will draw their own conclusions about their margin for maneuver in maintaining nuclear weapons aspirations. Russia has never been as allergic as America to the possibility that Iran will become a nuclear threshold weapons state. Iran will cut its own deal with America on the nuclear issue if it gets the right terms, regardless of what Putin thinks. But given the long odds against a comprehensive accord, should diplomacy fail, Tehran will likely be able to count on Russia to block punitive action in the U.N. Security Council and discourage the use of U.S. military force. A Putin defeat in Ukraine won't help matters in the Middle East much either, unless the crisis somehow delivers a knockout blow to Putin. A chastened Putin would probably be even more ornery and recalcitrant about cooperating with the international community on Middle Eastern issues. But either way, the Russians are determined to frustrate U.S. solutions to Middle Eastern problems that seem like a Pax Americana and exclude Moscow. The reaction to the West's efforts -- to meddle in what Putin believes is Russia's sphere of influence and to oppose Moscow -- will create a mini-Cold War that could, for the remainder of the Obama administration and probably beyond, freeze productive U.S.-Russian cooperation across the board. Small powers are watching . Beyond this, should Russia manage to have its  way in Ukraine, smaller powers will take notice, particularly those nations whose interests can be at odds with the West and the U.S. Russia is not a small power. But it is standing up to America and the West.  And for the true smaller powers, how ""big"" reacts when faced with a challenge from ""small"" can be instructive.  And the Syrians, Iranians and North Koreans will pay attention to the West's resolve. It can't be a good thing if Russia acts in Ukraine without cost and consequence. Israel isn't a friend of Russia nor an adversary of the U.S. But the Israelis have already seen what U.S. words mean when it comes to their own determination to continue settlement policy, and to U.S. threats to use military force in Syria, or even against Iran. And they have concluded that words mean very little. The Saudis have reached many of the same conclusions about the Obama administration's willingness to say what it means -- and more important, act upon what it says. America's image . Over the years, America has gotten into trouble when the issue of protecting its credibility is the be-all and end-all, in defiance of common sense and wise policy. Credibility comes from believability -- when a president speaks of policy, he will make good on his words, if need be. If there is is no cost or consequence for saying no to the U.S., then Washington will have zero street cred. At the same time, if the U.S. tries to maintain credibility by doing dumb or stupid things, or by overreaching, it undermines what it's attempting to protect. The Obama administration's street cred is very low.  Everyone says no to the U.S., seemingly without consequence: al-Assad; Putin; Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai; North Korean leader Kim Jong-un; Iraq's President Nuri al-Maliki. It seems the U.S. even gets ""yes, buts"" from friends and allies like Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Partly this comes from the U.S. setting expectations too high; misreading the way the world actually is; underestimating how determined smaller powers can be; and it comes from the reality that America doesn't control the world now and never did. We have a very risk-averse president who's focused more on domestic affairs than foreign policy. And he is a leader more committed to improving the middle class as his legacy than he is to the Middle East and its insoluble troubles. That president is facing a crisis in Ukraine, where geography, history, and proximity favor Putin and leave Washington with a weaker hand. Perhaps some face-saving win-win can be devised. But if not -- and perhaps unfairly, because Obama's options are bad ones -- America will again be judged a weak and feckless power. As for the Middle East, regardless of how Ukraine goes, the President's fortunes will remain more or less the same: The U.S. will remain shackled with a Putin who is no friend and stuck in a region it can neither repair nor leave.","Aaron David Miller: Putin's intervention in Ukraine affects more than Ukraine's sovereignty .

"Holiday albums could be less forgettable when pictures of a Mediterranean meal carry the scent of olives; a selfie on the beach contains a trace of salt spray or a rainy London scene conveys the distinctive aroma of freshly wet concrete. If the digital age has increased the volume of communication, it may not have improved the quality. Reversing that trend is the goal of a new generation of sensory engineers who are going beyond sight and sound to produce devices that use our untapped faculties. Perhaps the most exciting breakthroughs right now are arriving in the form of smell-centered communication. ""Our motto is 'aroma tells a thousand pictures'"", says Dr. David Edwards, biomedical engineer at Harvard and founder of Le Laboratoire, known for producing radical sensory devices such as calorie-free chocolate spray. Every human has thousands of distinct smell sensors, Edwards explains, a resource he taps with his newest invention the oPhone. Read more: Wireless electricity? It's here . Set for a beta launch in July, this phone offers the most sophisticated smell messaging yet created. In collaboration with Paris perfumers Givaudan and baristas Café Coutume, Edwards has created a menu of  scents, contained in 'Ochips'. MIT electrical engineer Eyal Shahar designed containers for them that release when heated by the touch of a button, but cool quickly to keep smells distinct and localized, a historic difficulty with the much-mocked smell-o-vision experiments in cinema. Mix and match . The oPhone user can mix and match aromas and then send their composition as a message, which will be recreated on a fellow user's device. Up to 356 combinations will be possible in the first wave, rising to several thousand in the next year, and the dream is an exhaustive base -- the 'universal chip'. ""Biologically we respond powerfully to aroma, so if we become familiar with the design of aromatic communication we might be able to say things we couldn't before"", says Edwards. He sees the limited aromas of the oPhone as the first letters of a rich new language, that may be used as a basis for novels and symphonies. The faith is grounded on the acknowledged influence of smell on the subconscious, and the potential to learn its secrets. The first oPhones will be limited to a select community of coffee enthusiasts. But the launch on July 10 will be accompanied by a more inclusive product: the first olfactory social network. A free app will allow anyone to compose and send a smell note by text or email, based on a set menu of aromas and variations. The message can be received by any normal phone as a text. The recipient can then download the composition from hotspots which will be set up in the launch city of Boston. ""We're expecting an interest in self-expression and we're ready to learn with the public"", says Edwards. ""We would like to be reactive as new ideas for aromatic vocabularies arise, and to continue providing them for new interests."" Read more: How to mend your body with silk . He is betting the public around Boston's famous technology centers are early adopters, and will take the concept forward. Beyond the city, the network will include a public interface for people to trade tips and recipes, and store them in cloud software. Edwards plans to feature 'smell emoticons' and viral stunts, and may offer a mixing deck that allows overlap with music production software. The concept can benefit from saturation of the current communication market, says trend analyst and editor of 'Green Futures' Anna Simpson. ""We're reaching a limit with what we can do with text data, and there is the potential to connect more deeply and personally through smell."" Simpson also believes a consumer shift toward experience could drive adoption. ""There is growing interest from brands in resources for creating richer experiences. Smelly start-ups . Giants such as Olympus are publishing research, but for now start-ups are taking the initiative. Singapore's Mixed Reality Lab has been prolific in this space, engineering Japanese device Scentee that allows users to send a single fragrance between them. The company released an app worldwide in February, and has lucrative partnerships such as with Mugaritz restaurant in Spain, that allows for online cooking tutorials with leading chefs to give students a whiff of the smell they are aiming for. Read more: 'The night I invented 3D printing' ""Right now it's the equivalent of music before mp3s, when you had to record a song on a tape and physically give it someone"", says Dr. Adrian Cheok, founder of the Mixed Reality Lab and professor of pervasive technology at City University, London. ""We can send a basic scent through a device like Scentee, but we need the framework to make millions of them available through digitization."" Cheok is testing a device that would connect us directly to the Internet, inspired by the successful connection of optical fibres to neurons of mice. His lab experiments involve subjects wearing a mouthguard-like device containing magnetic coils, from which electric signals are directed into the olfactory bowl to simulate the effect of smell. The wearer's brains are scanned before and after to pinpoint the effect, and the results have encouraged Cheok enough to believe a prototype could be available in two years. A similar technique has already born fruit with a similar design simulating the effects of taste. But taste has just four primary forms -- bitter, sweet, salty, sour-- whereas smell involves identifying individual molecules with no primary form. ""The most basic smell still has hundreds of molecules and you need analytical chemistry to see what's there"", says Dr. Joel Mainland of the Monell Chemical Senses Center. ""Perhaps only 5% would have an impact on smell, so it's difficult to pick them out. It's more trial and error than quantitative science."" Healthy aroma . Monell are also pursuing the goal of digitizing olfaction, with healthcare applications high on the agenda. One of their research areas is seeking smell biomarkers in cancer patients, using an 'e-nose' to hunt chemicals in the blood to deliver early diagnosis. The process was inspired by the ability of dogs to sense sickness, although their smelling ability is multiples higher. Although this research is still young in the lab, similar technology is already being smartphone-enabled. A NASA-developed chemical sensor has been released to a commercial partner as the basis for mobile applications that could breath-test users. UK Nanotechnology company Owlstone are raising several million dollars in venture capital for a handheld sensor that that could detect a wider range of diseases. Medical uses are high on the agenda for the burgeoning Digital Olfaction Society, whose upcoming conference will discuss olfaction technology for identifying dangerous gases, guidance for the blind and cognitive aid for Alzheimer's sufferers. But industries as varied as military, travel, jewellery, food and entertainment will also be represented. Dr. Cheok believes the ultimate direction of goal is a multi-sensory device unifying all five senses to create an immersive virtual reality, and could be usable within five years. The neglected senses are making up for lost time. More from Make, Create, Innovate: . New technology can detect your mood .

"(CNN) -- Getting a song to hit in the summer can change a career -- just ask Katy Perry or Robin Thicke. Before the reign of ""I Kissed a Girl"" in the summer of 2008, Perry had been tirelessly striving to create a name for herself in the music industry and was starting to find some long-sought success with her debut single, ""Ur So Gay."" But right around Independence Day 2008 -- which reminds us to make the most of what's left of the season -- Perry's loud and bold ""I Kissed a Girl"" pushed through to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 and refused to let go for seven weeks. That single gave Perry an entree as pop's newest princess. As for Thicke? He'll tell you himself that his 2013 single with Pharrell Williams and T.I., the controversial ""Blurred Lines,"" ushered in a new era, creating the kind of success of which most artists can only dream. Thicke had been working as a singer and songwriter for years when ""Blurred Lines"" arrived in the spring of 2013. But after that song was played at every pool party, barbecue, nightclub and wedding reception -- topping the Billboard 100 in late June and staying there until September -- Thicke became a global pop star. Having the song of the summer doesn't always translate into album sales later. Thicke's latest release, the lovelorn ""Paula,"" has performed dismally. But it is a fast and easy way to gain notoriety, even if it only lasts for the season. So who's going to claim the title for 2014? The obvious answer is Iggy Azalea, the Australian rapper who's swiftly gaining fame as the rapper on the Charli XCX-assisted ""Fancy"" and Ariana Grande's ""Problem."" But Iggy Igg, as she's known to her fans, has some competition. Including ""Fancy,"" here are the 10 tracks poised to be the staple song of summer: . ""Fancy,"" Iggy Azalea ft. Charli XCX . The combination of Iggy Azalea's flow with Charli XCX's cocky singing on the hook has made ""Fancy"" as irresistible as running through sprinklers on a hot day. You think you might be too old for it, but why not? It's fun! Cute lyrics, easy to sing along to and upbeat enough to spin at a party, it's little wonder that this release from Azalea's ""The New Classic"" album has been No. 1 on the Billboard 100 since June 7. ""Summer,"" Calvin Harris . The Scottish DJ/producer/singer/songwriter has captured exactly what a summer song needs to be with this seasonally appropriate single. With wistful lyrics about a warm weather romance and a pulsing beat, Harris' single is an easy favorite. ""Rude,"" Magic! Canadian reggae fusion band Magic! has crooned its way almost to No. 1 with its single ""Rude."" The song arrived last fall, but it wasn't until beach season that ""Rude"" really took off in the States. Ridiculously catchy, it comes complete with a heartfelt backstory that makes it applicable to this season of makeups and breakups. ""Wiggle,"" Jason Derulo ft. Snoop Dogg . Is Jason Derulo's ode to the rear end a little silly? Sure. But that's also what makes it perfect for summer. With a hypnotic beat and an artist-supplied dance move, ""Wiggle"" is made for carefree nights. Not even Zac Efron could resist ""Wiggle-ing"" while on vacation. ""Ain't It Fun,"" Paramore . This rock group's fourth album has been a wellspring of hits, with 2013's popular ""Still Into You"" being followed by the light-hearted ""Ain't It Fun,"" a bouncy track that lives up to its title. Paramore's Hayley Williams says the making of the single was as breezy as the song itself. ""Problem,"" Ariana Grande ft. Iggy Azalea . Ariana Grande hasn't had any problems climbing the charts with this horn-heavy dismissal of an unnecessary love. Funky and featuring the rapper du jour, Iggy Azalea, ""Problem"" is nipping at the heels of ""Fancy"" to be the top choice of summer 2014. ""Stay With Me,"" Sam Smith . In case you missed our very detailed memo, this is Sam Smith's year. The British soul singer has released his debut solo album and has gifted us all with the kind of song that'll be sung at karaoke for months to come. It isn't as danceable as Smith's work with Disclosure, the still-hot ""Latch,"" but it is memorable and affecting. ""Turn Down for What,"" DJ Snake and Lil Jon . Since its release last year, DJ Snake and Lil Jon's ""Turn Down for What"" has become the go-to party anthem for anyone wanting to turn up their night. It worked just fine when it was cold and darkness fell early, but ""Turn Down for What"" demands listening when it's 8 p.m., the sun is still bright, and your day's just getting started. ""Sing,"" Ed Sheeran . Ed Sheeran used to be known as the guy who sang sad love songs. That's still true, but with his new album, ""x,"" Sheeran's branched out into more upbeat territory.

""Am I Wrong,"" Nico & Vinz . Like with ""Rude,"" Norwegian duo Nico & Vinz invoke a beach vibe with their hit ""Am I Wrong.""

"Anthony Weiner thinks Rand Paul is playing it smart. The former Democratic congressman from New York, who resigned in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, offered up some 2016 insight Friday, saying the Kentucky Republican senator is wise to make privacy concerns a big part of his potential presidential platform. ""Paul's strategy could put him in a great place in a Republican primary,"" Weiner wrote in a column for Business Insider. Paul has been the most vocal opponent in Congress against the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance programs involving phone metadata collection. He filed a now-stalled lawsuit against the Obama administration earlier this year, and he voted against an NSA reform package last month because he felt it didn't go far enough in tweaking the agency. (He took some heat, however, from some in the anti-NSA community for his vote because the measure ultimately failed to advance.) Privacy issues have become a staple in Paul's stump speeches on the 2014 campaign trail, where he was known to hold up his cell phone in the air and declare that what Americans do on their phones is ""none of the government's damn business."" The senator, Weiner argued, understands the marketplace and is trying to appeal to the same demographic targeted by companies like Apple and Google. Meanwhile, Weiner added, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Mitt Romney are taking the traditional path of courting ""the middle of the road."" ""(Paul's) looking to build a White House bid with his own new age coalition of privacy-concerned, party-non aligned, previously-non voting, SOPA hating, pot tolerant youth,"" he wrote. ""(If) Paul wins, it won't necessarily be through red states,"" he continued. ""He's betting on Reddit.""","Former Congressman Anthony Weiner wrote a column praising Sen. Rand Paul .

"Editor's note: Mike Galanos hosts ""Prime News"" from 5-7 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays on HLN. ""Prime News"" uses the day's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives, spirited debate and your points of view. Mike Galanos says child pornography charges are too harsh for teens caught ""sexting."" ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Sexting."" Have parents out there ever even heard of this term? Whether you want to admit it or not, teenagers are sending sexual messages and naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and girlfriends. In most cases it's the girl sending a picture or message to the guy. If you're thinking to yourself right now, ""What's the big deal?"" then you should think again. This practice can ruin our teenagers' lives. Six teens in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, were charged as juveniles with possessing child pornography after three girls sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves to three boys. It gets even worse. A 13-year-old boy in Middletown, Ohio, is facing felony pandering obscenities charges after taping a sex act and showing it to friends at a skating party. A felony? Yes this kid needs to be punished but we don't need our 13 or 14-year-olds charged with child porn and lumped in with adult pedophiles and labeled as sex offenders. I've spoken with several attorneys on our show and it seems there is no one reason prosecutors are opting to charge teens with child porn instead of lesser charges. Some may be doing it to ""send a message."" Some may feel they have an obligation to charge these teens with the most serious offense possible and, according to the law, naked pictures of underage kids are usually considered child porn. And others may feel they are left with no options since there aren't really any laws that apply specifically to sexting. In any case, it's clear we need to change our laws to catch up with technology. A great illustration of why change is needed now is the story of Phillip Alpert, of Orlando, Florida. He didn't ask, but his girlfriend sexted him naked pictures of herself, according to the Orlando Sentinel. When they broke up, he mass e-mailed the photos to get back at her. Alpert, 18, was convicted of transmission of child porn and he will carry the label of ""sex offender"" until he is 43. He lost friends, was kicked out of school, he can't even move in with his dad because his dad lives near a school. Should Phillip be punished? Yes. Should the six teens in Pennsylvania face consequences? Yes. But let's kick them off cheerleading squads and sports teams. Make them do community service and take classes on sex crimes. Educate other teens on the dangers of sexting. Pay a price, yes, but these young people shouldn't pay for this for the rest of their lives. And if you think this couldn't happen to your kid, think again. Sexting is more prevalent than you think. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy teamed up with CosmoGirl.com and asked over 1,200 teens about their sexual behaviors in cyberspace. According to their study, 39 percent of teens (that's ages 13-19) are sending or posting sexually suggestive messages over IM, text or e-mail and around the same number of teens are receiving such messages. Half of those teens, 20 percent, are sending or posting nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves. That's frightening. Why are our kids doing this? On our show, psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser said, ""What I'm finding is a lot of girls are doing this because they're hoping it will help them get or keep a boyfriend."" The numbers agree with Stacy. According to the study, 51 percent of girls say it's ""pressure from guys"" that's making them send sexual messages and pictures of themselves. So guys are expecting this and our girls are saying ""OK."" It makes me wonder how much progress we've really made in how young women are viewed and treated. The bottom line: We need to educate, not incarcerate, our teens and it has to start with parents. Don't let the culture indoctrinate your little boy or girl about sex before their time. So strike first as a parent. If your kids are older, let them know a digital record is for life. When little Suzie tries to win the affection of little Bobby by sexting him a picture, she is putting her future at stake. There is no control over that image or video once it gets out. But that doesn't mean little Suzie should be charged as a child pornographer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Galanos.","Mike Galanos: Teens are sending explicit photos of themselves to other kids .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Army rescinded its invitation to evangelist Franklin Graham for the upcoming National Day of Prayer at the Pentagon over controversial remarks he made about Islam. ""True Islam cannot be practiced in this country,"" he told CNN's Campbell Brown last December. ""You can't beat your wife. You cannot murder your children if you think they've committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries."" Graham later tried to temper his remarks by saying that he had Muslim friends. However, the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham has a history of comments that bothered the Pentagon. Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, for instance, Graham called Islam a ""very evil and wicked religion."" Graham, who said a prayer at the inauguration of President George W. Bush, said he regretted the Army's decision but stood by his comments. ""I don't like the way they treat women, the way they treat minorities. I just find it horrific. But I love the people of Islam,"" he said, adding some of his work has been in Muslim nations. For instance, Samaritan's Purse, the international charity that he heads, works with Iraqi refugees in Jordan. ""It's a part of the world I love very much,"" Graham said. ""And I understand it. But I certainly disagree with their teaching."" ""I want to express my strong support for the United States military and all our troops,"" he said. ""I'm very proud of them and it's just unfortunate that I won't be able to participate on May 6th."" The Army, which oversees the National Day of Prayer ceremonies at the Pentagon, feared that if Graham spoke at the Pentagon, Islamic militants would publicize his comments, potentially fueling tensions in Muslim nations like Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are deployed. Concerns about Graham were flagged by the watchdog group Military Religious Freedom Foundation, which also raised objections that the Pentagon prayer ceremony had become a fundamentalist Christian event. The group penned a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates on behalf of Muslim military members and defense department employees. It said that Franklin's remarks had sparked outrage. ""Mr. Graham has never retracted or apologized for these statements,"" the letter said. But Graham's supporters disagreed with the Army's decision. ""What are they afraid Franklin Graham is going to say?"" said Rep. Randy Forbes of Virginia. ""I think again we are getting to the point in the country where we are trying to exclude everybody from speaking if I disagree with what they are going to say."" Graham's invitation was not the only controversy swirling about the National Day of Prayer this year. Last week, a federal judge struck down as unconstitutional the 1952 law that established the day, saying it violated the ban on government-backed religion. On Thursday, the Justice Department informed a federal appeals court that the Obama administration will appeal that decision. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Army pulls invitation for Franklin Graham over remarks on Islam .

"The deadliest outbreak of Ebola virus on record has sparked fears that the killer virus could spread from West Africa to other regions and continents. The outbreak began with just a handful of cases in Guinea in March. Since then, that number has grown to 909 confirmed cases and another 414 probable or suspected in that country, Sierra Leone and Liberia and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. Some 729 people of the 1,323 total confirmed and possible infections have died, reports WHO as of July 27. The WHO says ""drastic action is needed"" to contain Ebola, warning that previously undetected chains of transmission are boosting the numbers of sick and increasing the chances that the disease spreads from Africa. ""This epidemic is without precedent,"" said Bart Janssens, director of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as Doctors Without Borders. ""It's absolutely not under control, and the situation keeps worsening. ... There are many places where people are infected but we don't know about it."" What's the latest? The Ebola outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where authorities have been working to contain the virus. In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced Wednesday that, ""without exceptions, all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the Ministry of Education."" She also declared Friday a nonworking day ""to be used for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities."" On the same day, the Peace Corps said it was temporarily removing its 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak. The announcement comes as two Peace Corps volunteers were isolated after coming in contact with someone who ended up dying of Ebola, a spokeswoman for the group said. She said these two Americans ""are not symptomatic,"" and the Peace Corps will work to return them to the United States once they get medical clearance to travel. Concerns about Ebola aren't confined to those three countries. Last week, a Liberian government official who had contracted the virus died in isolation at a hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Patrick Sawyer, a naturalized American citizen who worked in Liberia, flew to Nigeria intending to attend a conference. After exhibiting symptoms upon arrival July 20, he was hospitalized and died on July 25. He's the first American to die in the outbreak, though two other U.S. aid workers in Liberia have contracted Ebola and are being treated. Sawyer's was the only known case in Nigeria, WHO said. And the British government convened an emergency meeting to discuss the threat of Ebola to the UK, even though no case has been reported there. Officials discussed what measures could be taken if UK nationals in West Africa should become infected, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. Why was someone infected with Ebola allowed on a plane? It is unknown whether Sawyer was displaying symptoms before he flew from Monrovia, Liberia's capital, to Ghana and then to Togo to switch planes to fly to Lagos. His Minnesota-based widow, Decontee Sawyer, told CNN that he had cared for his ill sister in Liberia, though she said he didn't know at the time that his sister had Ebola. When he arrived in Nigeria, he told officials that he had no direct contact with anyone who had the disease. Because it takes between two and 21 days before Ebola symptoms to show, there's little health officials can do to stop an asymptomatic person from flying to another country, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. So, serious viruses such as Ebola may be just ""a plane ride away"" from reaching the developed world, according to Marty Cetron of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mindful of this, Nigeria-based airline companies ASKY and Arik Air suspended operations at the end of July into Monrovia and Freetown, the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. ASKY said passengers departing from Conakry, Guinea, would be screened for signs of the virus. Cetron says it is unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids. Stressing the key role that those working at airports play in keeping Ebola in check, the CDC spokesman said: ""Being educated, knowing the symptoms, recognizing what to do, having a response to protocol, knowing who to call -- those are really, really important parts of the global containment strategies to deal with threats like this."" What else is being done to stop the spread of the disease? Ebola patients are being isolated by health officials in West Africa, and those who have come into contact with them are being told to monitor their temperatures. President Sirleaf has closed most of Liberia's borders with neighboring countries, and the few points of entry that are still open will have Ebola testing centers. The President also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five-minute video on Ebola safety. The CDC has issued an alert to health workers in the United States to watch out for any patients who may have recently traveled to West Africa and could have contracted the virus. Why does Ebola generate such fear? Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" ""It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90% of the people who catch it, causing terror among infected communities,"" it says. The death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 55% because of early treatment. There is also no vaccination against it. Of Ebola's five subtypes, the Zaire strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly. The WHO said preliminary tests on the Ebola virus in Guinea in March suggested that the outbreak there was this strain, though that has not been confirmed. What is Ebola, and what are its symptoms? The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis or even the plague. MSF says some patients may also develop a rash, red eyes, hiccups, chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing. The early symptoms progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests. How is it treated? There are no specific treatments for Ebola. MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers. ""This consists of hydrating the patient, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections,"" it says. There have been cases of healthcare workers contracting the virus from patients, and the WHO has issued guidance for dealing with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus. Carers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose, mouth and eyes. MSF says it contained a 2012 outbreak in Uganda by placing a control area around its treatment center. An outbreak is considered over once 42 days -- double the incubation period of the disease -- have passed without any new cases. How does it spread? The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa, passing on the virus to other animals. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, chlorine disinfection, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water. ""People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick: because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient,"" she said.","There are more than 1,300 confirmed and suspected Ebola cases, hundreds of deaths .

"Seven bodies have been recovered near a cold storage facility at a Karachi airport Tuesday morning, more than a day after a deadly militant attack there left 29 others dead. The seven cargo workers were found in rubble near the hall where a fire broke out during the attack, Sindh province Health Minister Dr. Saghir Ahmad said. Heavy machinery was used to break into the area to retrieve them. Rescuers had been trying to reach the cargo workers, who were trapped at Jinnah International Airport, the largest and busiest airport in Pakistan. Families of the workers blocked a busy road leading to the airport, demanding that authorities help find their relatives, CNN affiliate Geo TV reported. ""We will work to investigate any negligence in rescue efforts by the authorities and those found guilty of negligence will be punished accordingly,"" Sindh province Gov. Ishrat Ul Ebad Khan said. The rescue operation unfolded nearly a day after terrorists entered the airport from two places with a plan to destroy a group of parked airplanes and ""bring down our aviation industry,"" according to the Pakistani government. It was late Sunday night, and the militants were armed with guns, grenades and suicide vests. They went into the cargo area, about a kilometer (0.62 miles) from where commercial planes take off. In a ""heroic"" effort, security forces ""laid down their lives"" to block the terminal and stop the attackers, surrounding them and killing all of them, the prime minister's office said. There were 10 terrorists, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said, and two of them detonated suicide vests. By the time the attack was over, officials said 29 people were dead, including 10 militants. Another 24 people were injured, the military said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault on the country's largest and busiest airport. Speaking from an undisclosed location, Pakistani Taliban commander Abdullah Bahar said the attack was retaliation for the death of former chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November in North Waziristan. Bahar warned more attacks will follow. ""As long as we are breathing, our attacks will be continuing 'til the end of our lives,"" he vowed. Fire followed attack . A building caught fire in the attack, but no planes were damaged, Bajwa said. The airport reopened Monday. Some Pakistani media reported a renewed gunbattle at the airport later Monday morning. But officials told CNN the noise was from fire-heated chemical containers exploding. Still, as a precaution, security forces opened fire, said Ahmad Chinoy of the Citizen's Police Liaison Committee. He said he was 100% sure there were no militants left in the airport. Several days ago, Pakistan's government had warned provincial officials of a possible ""high-profile attack on a sensitive or key installation,"" said Qaim Ali Shah, chief minister of Sindh province. But the warning, he said, did not mention the airport. 'We felt like sitting ducks' Farooq Sattar, a member of parliament, was on a plane at the airport when the attack took place. ""My aircraft was on the tarmac ready to take off when suddenly, from what I understand, a message came to the pilot saying to get off the runway and return to the gate,"" Sattar said. ""I heard shots and saw smoke."" ""Before the pilot could announce anything, I had text messages blowing up my phone saying 'Karachi airport under attack.'  We were in the aircraft for three hours, full of fuel. They locked the doors. ""The airport was poorly guarded. It was only due to some airport security personnel that the attack got thwarted and the militants didn't make it to our part of the airport. Passengers were extremely nervous. They started looking at me for answers."" ""We felt like sitting ducks on the tarmac,"" he added. Two crew members who were on their first ever flight ""freaked out,"" Sattar said. History of terror . The Pakistani Taliban, which is formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, has long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government. ""Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military,"" said Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank. ""It resents the fact that (Pakistan) has an alliance with the West, and it wants Sharia to be imposed in Pakistan."" The group claimed responsibility for a December 2009 suicide bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. The attack killed seven U.S. citizens, including five CIA officers and a member of Jordanian intelligence. The U.S. Justice Department charged Mehsud in 2010 for his alleged involvement in the attack. Mehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Four years later, Hakimullah Mehsud suffered the same fate. More claims and threats . Another TTP member claimed the Pakistani government has been ""abducting and killing innocent people,"" and explained why the airport was targeted. ""We chose a location where there would be less civilian and more official casualties,"" TTP representative Shahidullah Shahid said. Shahid warned the group will engage ""in a full-out war with the Pakistani state, starting on June 10."" But ""if even now the Pakistani government backs down,"" Shahid said, ""we are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue."" Karachi airport attackers were disguised as security workers . More violence . The airport wasn't the only site of violence in Pakistan on Sunday. Twin suicide attacks near the border with Iran left 24 people dead, including four terrorists, authorities said. Qambar Dashti, commissioner of the Quetta Division, said two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a hotel where dozens of Shia pilgrims from Iran were staying. Dashti said 14 out of 18 wounded pilgrims were in critical condition. Extremist Sunni militant group Jaish el-Islam, a splinter group of Lashkar e Jhangvi, claimed responsibility. On Monday, while Karachi operated as usual, there was violence in other parts of the country. Three soldiers were killed and many others were wounded in a suspected suicide attack at a checkpoint in North Waziristan, military officials said. What's behind Karachi airport attack?","The bodies of 7 cargo workers are found in rubble near a cold storage facility at the airport .
29 others were killed in the airport attack, including 10 militants, officials say .
The Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, say the attack is revenge for the death of Hakimullah Mehsud .

"The U.S. House unanimously approved legislation on Tuesday to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at non-VA facilities. A similar measure has been proposed in the Senate, which could act later this week. An internal Veterans Affairs audit released on Monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the agency system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested. Scandal over delayed wait times has triggered a review of nearly 70 VA medical facilities nationwide by the agency's inspector general's office and forced the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki.

"(CNN) -- ""He knows if you've been bad or good..."" doesn't hold quite as much weight when Jolly Old Saint Nicholas is vomiting on a Manhattan sidewalk into his gift bag. This is the ghost of SantaCons past, an annual event when thousands of revelers decked out in Santa costumes take to the bars of New York to get into the spirit -- and spirits -- of the season. In recent years, city residents have publicly complained that the bad Santas far outweigh the good, citing highly publicized instances of extreme intoxication, lewdness and vandalism. In preparation for the now-infamous event, Metro-North and Long Island railroads issued a temporary ban on alcoholic beverages on their trains, while community boards in the Lower East Side and East Village neighborhoods of Manhattan and the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn said they will not allow the bar crawl to take place in their areas. ""Some of the stories that I've heard about that certain neighborhoods don't want them in their neighborhood, these are public streets. Neighborhoods can't say to people you can't come on our public streets,"" Norman Siegel, an attorney for SantaCon, told CNN affiliate WABC. In an attempt to get back on the public's nice list, SantaCon organizers hired Siegel, a civil rights attorney, to help the group with street permits and to revitalize their image. They say they do more good than harm, raising money for charities like Toy for Tots and the Food Bank of New York City. ""Even if you disagree with the content of the message of the group, they have the right to express that viewpoint,"" Siegel said. With ""compassion"" for the current civil rights protests going on around the country and public objection to SantaCon, the organizers have vowed to rein in the debauchery. On the SantaCon website, they encourage participants to moderate their drinking and behavior, and suggest they spend most of their time inside the venues versus out on the streets. ""...It's more important this year than ever to pace yourself, watch out for your elves and stay safe. Fighting, public urination and vandalism are unacceptable and a great way to ensure that there will be no SantaCon in 2015. #dontscroogesantacon,"" the organizers said in a press release earlier this month. The event is scheduled to take place on Saturday. The participating bars were announced on Friday through SantaCon's app, and are located mainly in the Murray Hill and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods of Manhattan. ""If a venue isn't on this list, it's because they don't want you there,"" the organizers emphasized.","SantaCon is being toned down this year due to public protest over the participants' behavior .
Organizers say their roots are charitable and Santas should be allowed to celebrate .
SantaCon will take place on Saturday, December 13, in New York ."
"Their sons -- Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner  -- have become symbols of a raging national conversation about police brutality and racial injustice. The mothers of these four unarmed black men and boys felled by bullets or excessive police force have no doubt their sons would still be alive if they were white. No question, they say. ""I think absolutely my son's race and the color of his skin had a lot to do with why he was shot and killed,"" Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday. ""In all of these cases, these victims were unarmed. These victims were African-American. That needs to be our conversation."" In their first interview together, Fulton was joined by Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden; Tamir's mother,  Samaria Rice; and Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. They spoke of reliving the horrific final moments of their son's lives with each controversial death, of gaining strength from protesters and other supporters, of the importance of coming together to effect change. ""It seems our kids are getting younger and younger,"" Fulton said. ""They're killing them younger and younger. There is no regard anymore for human life. There has to be somewhere where we draw the line and say, 'Listen, our kids want to grow up, too.'"" Carr said she had confidence in a federal investigation into whether her son's civil rights were violated. A Staten Island grand jury last week refused to indict a white police officer in the death of her son, was put in a fatal chokehold by the officer as he tried to arrest Garner for illegally selling cigarettes. ""If Eric Garner was a white man in Suffolk County doing the same thing that he was doing -- even if he would have been caught selling cigarettes that day -- they would have given him a summons and he wouldn't have lost his life that day,"" she said. ""I believe that 100 percent."" Fulton's son was shot and killed in Florida in February 2012 by George Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watch captain. The case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges. ""We have to change mindsets,"" Fulton said. ""We have to let people know that our children matter. Our sons and our daughters matter.  We are hurting. This country is hurting."" Demonstrations followed Zimmerman's acquittal even though some people around the country supported Zimmerman's actions. ""It's not happening to them, so they don't quite get it,"" she said. ""They don't quite understand. They think that it's a small group of African-Americans that's complaining. ...The people say that all the time: 'What are they complaining about now? What are they protesting about now?'"" To those people, Fulton said: ""Until it happens to them and in their family then they'll understand the walk. They don't understand what we're going through. They don't understand the life and they don't understand what we're fighting against. I don't even think the government  quite gets it."" President Barack Obama publicly addressed the Martin case, as he did last summer's shooting of Brown -- an unarmed teenager shot to death by white police Officer Darren Wilson. A St. Louis County grand jury declined to bring charges against the officer, leading to days of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. ""I was (sure) they would indict the officer that shot my son without a video tape,"" McSpadden said. ""You had so many witnesses."" The death of Rice, a 12-year-old boy shot last month by a Cleveland officer after police allegedly mistook the child's air gun for a real firearm, has also drawn national attention. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday it has ruled the death a homicide. Samaria Rice, his mother, said she found out about the shooting after two boys knocked on her door. ""The police shot your son in the stomach,"" she recalled one of the boys saying. One of her daughters was handcuffed and thrown into the back of a police car when she protested the shooting, said Samaria Rice. She described going out to the street and seeing her son on the ground and ""nobody ... doing anything"" to help him.  One of the Tamir's sisters screamed, ""They killed my baby brother!"" Attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented some of the mothers, said police cared more about preserving the crime scene than trying to save Tamir's life. Fulton said each new tragedy brings people together. ""I think this is shedding light to what's going on,"" Fulton said of the protest movement that has risen out of the tragedies.""This is not something new. It's been happening. ... But it's just been bringing light to what's happening. It's bringing it to the forefront which is why there's so much conversations. ... Because people are now realizing ... it's not just about African-American rights ... it's about human rights."" Carr asked, ""What are they doing to our children today?"" Fulton said she has a son graduating from college next week. ""I want him to enjoy life and fulfill his life and goals, but at the same time I'm afraid for him,"" she said.","The mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner meet .

"The man accused of opening fire at a Seattle college had a fascination with school shootings, telling investigators he had once visited Columbine High School, a police source told CNN affiliate KIRO on Friday. According to the unnamed police source, the suspect admitted to the attack and told police he ""wanted to shoot up a school."" Aaron Ybarra, 26, of Mountlake Terrace, was ordered held without bail in connection with the shooting at Seattle Pacific University that left one dead and two wounded, Leesa Manion, a spokeswoman for the King County prosecutor, said. Charges against Ybarra are pending, she said. The shooting at the university on Thursday afternoon began when a man armed with a shotgun opened fire inside Otto Harris Hall, which houses the engineering, math and science departments. Authorities say the gunman walked into the building's foyer, confronted three students and then shot them. The shooting rampage ended when a student security guard doused the shooter with pepper spray and tackled him as he tried to reload his shotgun, police said. 'Long-standing mental health issues' Ybarra isn't a student at the school. Police say they think he acted alone, but the investigation is continuing. ""So far, police have not found any connection between the suspect, Seattle Pacific University or any of the victims,"" according to statement released by the Seattle Police Department. Ybarra had a history of mental health problems and is on suicide watch at the jail, public defender Ramona Brandes said . Ybarra has ""significant and long-standing mental health issues, including delusions that were in play"" at the time of the shooting, she told reporters. ""...He's on suicide watch for a reason. He did not think he was going to survive yesterday. He intended to die."" She declined to comment on what Ybarra told authorities, including his claim that he visited Columbine -- the Colorado school where a mass shooting carried out by two students in April 1999 left 13 people dead and 24 wounded. Brandes said Ybarra is aware of what happened. ""He is cognizant of the suffering of the victims and their families and the entire Seattle Pacific community,"" she said. ""He is sorry."" Ybarra had several run-ins with police in recent years. He was taken into custody in 2010 and 2012 for a mental health hold, Mountlake Terrace Assistant Police Chief Pete Caw told CNN. In both cases, authorities determined Ybarra was intoxicated, incoherent and suicidal, Caw said. The image of the suspect as a gun-toting killer is a difficult one to reconcile for those who know him. One friend described Ybarra as ""socially awkward"" but ""appreciative,"" according to CNN affiliate KOMO. ""I have no idea what set him off,"" said Nate Flesch. ""That's why this whole thing kind of surprises me -- that he was trying to turn his life around, that he was trying to be a better person, and he was kind of working on his social skills, too."" 'I'm grateful' Ybarra is accused of killing Paul Lee, a 19-year-old student, authorities said. One of the wounded, a 19-year-old woman, was in serious condition in intensive care Friday after five hours of surgery the day before, Susan Gregg of Harborview Medical Center said. A second victim, a 24-year-old man, was discharged Friday, she said. Police are convinced the shooter would have killed or wounded more people had those around him not intervened. ""This story is not about an evil act but about the people that actually lived through this scenario and assisted each other when things were pretty tragic,"" said Seattle police Assistant Chief Paul McDonagh. University President Daniel J. Martin praised the school's students, emotionally telling CNN affiliate KCPQ that they had ""acted without regard for their own safety."" KOMO identified the student security guard who tackled the suspect as Jon Meis. ""He saw the guy and got his pepper spray, sprayed him and tackled him,"" Meis' friend Patrick Maguire told KOMO. Maguire said he's not surprised that Meis didn't hesitate to put his own life in danger to save others. ""I could have been one of these people that was injured or in critical condition,"" he said. ""A lot of (students) were in that building and he stopped him in the lobby. He didn't get any farther than that. I'm grateful for him. Who is the hero student who pounced on the Seattle gunman?","One victim has been discharged from the hospital, a spokeswoman says .

Ma Ailun, a flight attendant with China Southern Airlines, was picking up her handset to answer a call last Thursday when she received an electric shock, police said Sunday, in reports carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Police, who are continuing their investigation, have not yet identified a cause -- whether the phone or anything else. In a statement received by CNN, Apple said: ""We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic incident and offer our condolences to the Ma family.

Meanwhile, Ma's father, Ma Guanghui, said that his daughter was electrocuted, adding that her body showed signs of electrocution, Xinhua said.

"When Stephanie Van Pelt needed to care for her son after surgery, her company gave her the option to work from home. ""They didn't lose my productivity,"" Van Pelt posted on Google+. ""They gained an intensely loyal, hard-working employee that was so pleased with not having to take (time) off."" Van Pelt was weighing in on the recent news that Yahoo is ending its work-from-home policy. The change, announced Monday by Yahoo human resources chief Jackie Reses, is expected to affect hundreds of employees. It is one of many changes CEO Marissa Mayer has made since being hired last July. But Van Pelt doesn't work for Yahoo. She doesn't work for Google, Twitter, or any high-profile tech company. Instead, Van Pelt represents how the changes at Yahoo have gotten the attention of workers everywhere, regardless of industry. ""This is just ridiculous,"" she continued. ""Glad I have no desire to work for Yahoo!"" A 2011 study by Telework Research Network found that working remotely increased 73% from 2005 to 2011 in the United States. Parenting is not at the heart of the issue, despite expectations Mayer would be more flexible after the recent birth of her first child. In the thousands of social media posts made about Mayer's decision since Monday, people have attempted to classify the policy as a statement about everything from feminism to incompetent management. On Tuesday Yahoo issued a short statement, saying ""This isn't a broad industry view on working from home -- this is about what is right for Yahoo right now."" But two themes seem to anchor the discussion, and they center on debate about what it takes to create a truly innovate workplace -- something Yahoo needs -- and the role morale plays in productivity. Opinion: CEO right -- Yahoo workers must show up . On innovation . Psychologist Eve Ash wrote for SmartCompany.com that, ""The combined efforts of a group can provide quantum leaps in innovations."" Hired to essentially reinvent Yahoo, Mayer is clearly attempting to reignite the ""spirit of collaboration.""  In an opinion piece for CNN, Raymond Fisman said Mayer has it exactly right: Personal interaction is still the most effective way of conveying a company's direction. The assertion that new ideas spring up through ""chance encounters"" is backed by academic research, he says. David Hirsch, who uses @startupman on Twitter, agrees. As a managing partner of Metamorphic.vc and a father of two, he says for every restart or start-up, real-time collaboration and strategy needs to happen ""every 5 minutes."" ""As a parent who occasionally works from home -- I feel bad for all those impacted,"" posted JD Fairweather. ""As a consultant who has seen the challenges of managing remote workers and the complications of rebuilding a company -- it's the right move."" ""Yahoo needs employees who want to live breathe and evangelize Yahoo,"" wrote tech blogger Shawn Farner. ""The company needs employees in Sunnyvale, walking the halls, eating lunch with colleagues, brainstorming on whiteboards, gathering around monitors -- basically, doing the things you'd see a small start-up doing in companies that emphasize collaboration and comradery."" A work-at-home mom defends Mayer . On productivity . Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, quickly posted his opposition to Mayer's policy, saying a big part of successfully working with other people depends on, ""trusting people to get their work done wherever they are, without supervision."" Donald Trump tweeted that Mayer is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace. ""She is doing a great job!"" Lynn Dang, a former IBM employee posted to Facebook that the policy is silly and short-sighted for three reasons. First, unproductive staff will be unproductive anywhere. Second, Yahoo now risks losing top performers, and third the policy speaks of control and distrust unlikely to boost morale and engagement. ""I do think team building and interaction are useful but it doesn't have to be an all or nothing approach like this,"" Dang posted. ""Especially in 2013. Especially for a tech company."" In an article on HLNTV.com, Sarah Evans, owner of Sevans Strategy, a public relations consultancy, wrote that each year, $1.4 trillion is lost in productivity regardless of where a worker's desk is physically located. ""Finding a better way to work should be a company's priority -- not telling people where they can do said work,"" Evans said. For Scott Jordan, the policy signaled a much greater issue, which is that Mayer and her team have not planned and deployed technology properly. ""There should be no time when an employee is more than a couple of taps away,"" he posted to Google+. Opinion: Allow Yahoo workers to work at home .","Yahoo's new policy will encourage innovation, some workers say .

"(CNN) -- Long established as the premier portal for sound, your ears are facing increased competition from emerging techniques for transmission through your skeleton. Bone conduction has rapidly become a critical asset for treatment of hearing loss. While a new generation of cochlear implants has had spectacular success in recent years, they rely on air conduction and the patient possessing a functional pathway from outer to inner ear. For patients with severely damaged pathways, such implants offer no solution. Baha (bone anchored hearing aids) units work by passing sound from a microphone to a magnet or implant beneath a patient's skin, which is converted into vibrations in the skull and eventually arrives at the inner ear. This process extends the miracle of restored hearing to victims of such conditions as microtia or atresia, where the ear or canal is closed or deformed. ""It's the natural spectrum of sound compared with traditional hearing"", says Brian Walshe, spokesperson of hearing treatment company Cochlear. ""Even with amplification it's the same, there's no distortion."" The company recently launched a wireless Baha set, an indication of the technology's progress and growing popularity. Implants have become smaller and less invasive, while cosmetics have improved so that the system can be worn without advertising it. Bone conduction is not a new discovery. Ludwig Van Beethoven overcame deafness by biting a metal rod attached to his piano to hear his work. Neither do they need to be compensation for disability - such systems have been used by military in environments that require awareness as well as audio instructions. A member of the SEAL team which killed Osama Bin Laden wrote in his autobiography that bone conduction communication was critical to co-ordinating the raid. The innovation is beginning to seep into consumer electronics. In the early 2000s, headphone sets appeared that played music via the user's bones, but the systems were hamstrung by high cost and low quality, with common complaints about muffled and distorted sound. The makers of Aftershokz believe they have solved those problems with a unit that retails for $79. ""The difficulty for bone conduction has been transmitting vibrations through bone with enough power for music, you need to be on the 20 - 20,000 Hz frequency range,"" says CEO Bruce Borenstein. ""We have been able to power dual transducers with enough vibration to make the sound musical, which has been our big breakthrough."" The bone conduction system offers key safety advantages over traditional earphones, by leaving the user's ears free so that they are not distracted from their environment. It is even possible to drive wearing them, as they comply with the legal requirement to be able to hear on the road. The Audiology Foundation of America have also supported the concept, stating that it causes less damage to the ears than ear buds. A flood of competitors are entering the market and innovation is not limited to headphones. Google Glass are using bone conduction rather than ear buds for their speaker system, although there have been teething problems. Multiple patents are emerging for underwater and deep sea communication systems, and the technology has become cheap and accessible enough to be viable for novelty items such as talking pillows. The field has even expanded to offer audio communications through diverse body parts including the teeth and eyes. ""In theory you can hear from anywhere"", says Dr. Sunil Puria, ear biomechanics expert at Stanford University. ""Although practically there would be disruption by having to pass through soft tissue depending on the point of contact."" The technology has offered a new dimension to advertisers, with BBDO trialling a system on German trains that plays targeted messages to commuters as they lean against the window. The company claim a positive public reaction, and promise the concept will deliver social benefits through delivering announcements and emergency warnings. But the scheme has been controversial, with civil liberty activists arguing it is invasive and delivers content without consent. Dr. Puria foresees another ethical concern. ""As it vibrates your skull to generate sound, others around you can also potentially hear a message sent to you, so there will be privacy issues. That's a problem that needs to be solved."" But he believes the major technological hurdles have been overcome. ""There has been tremendous progress, from miniaturization, to wearable and wireless, so that we have reached the holy grail of not requiring earphones.""

"The United States diplomatic office in the Libyan city of Benghazi was attacked Tuesday night, the embassy in the capital Tripoli said Wednesday. A Libyan security source told CNN a jihadist group that is suspected of carrying out the strike, the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, left leaflets at the scene claiming the attack was in retaliation for the death of Libyan al Qaeda No. 2 Abu Yahya al Libi. ""Fortunately, no one was injured"" in the improvised explosive device attack, the embassy said. The blast damaged the front gates, the embassy said. ""The United States deplores the attack on its diplomatic mission in Benghazi ... we have requested the Libyan Ministry of Interior to increase its security around U.S. facilities in Libya,"" the embassy said. The embassy said the attack would not affect the U.S. commitment to Libya. U.S. officials said Tuesday that Abu Yahya al-Libi, effectively the terror network's second-highest leader, was dead. Noman Benotman, a former senior member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting group, said that according to his sources in Benghazi, the leaflets also promised more attacks against the United States. Benotman, now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation in London, said the attack involved the explosion of a rudimentary homemade device and the operation appears to have been hastily put together. Benotman said on  Tuesday that pro al Qaeda groups operating in Libya could use the death of al Libi as a pretext to expand their operations. The Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades were first heard from when they claimed responsibility for an attack on a Red Cross office in Benghazi late last month. A purported video of the attack was apparently posted on  jihadist websites that regularly feature statements by al Qaeda. The video showed several rockets being fired into a building at nighttime.  In claiming responsibility, the group stated, ""We do not recognize [state] borders when we plan for our operations, and we have prepared a message that will soon reach America in response to polluting the clarity of the defiant city of Derna,"" according to a translation by Flashpoint Partners, which monitors jihadist websites. According to several sources, al Qaeda has developed a presence in and around the city of Derna in eastern Libya, where it has recruited and trained militants. According to a senior Libyan official, there are five ""significant"" Islamist leaders in eastern Libya. They include Abdulbasit Azuz and Sufian bin Qumu, a former Guantanamo detainee. Of the five leaders, all but Qumu have agreed not to carry out attacks, the official said. The official said Azuz has a training camp outside Derna and the Obeidi tribe, which is responsible for security in that area of Libya, has the camp surrounded.","U.S. diplomatic office in Libya was attacked Tuesday night .

"(CNN) -- Twenty years ago this month, Ukraine, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States signed an agreement that represented a major step in global anti-proliferation efforts. Under the deal, known as the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine voluntarily surrendered the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, which it had inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But fast forward two decades, and an agreement once heralded as a breakthrough is gradually being undermined by one of the very countries that signed it. As part of the agreement, Ukraine willingly gave up more than 1,000 strategic and 2,500 tactical nuclear weapons, and agreed to the destruction of 176 silos used to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles. In return, Ukraine was offered security assurances by Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States in a document that highlighted the inviolability of Ukraine's existing borders and its sovereignty, called for the abstention from forceful actions that could threaten Ukraine's territorial integrity and prohibited economic pressure being placed on Ukraine. Unfortunately, Russia has disregarded each of these provisions. Russian aggression against Ukraine, first in Crimea and soon after in eastern regions of Ukraine, has created an unprecedented challenge to international peace. Indeed, rather than simply being a domestic or even regional crisis, what has been unfolding this year constitutes a violation of international law, undermining the existing checks and balances of the international system. For many years, the Budapest Memorandum served as a practical model for the implementation of the international nonproliferation regime. But recent violations of the agreement now risk undermining a system that safeguards states against national security threats through diplomatic means. As a result, many states may start to view the possession of weapons of mass destruction as the only effective means of safeguarding against external risks, in the process provoking a new arms race and ultimately increasing the threat of nuclear disaster down the road. None of this is to suggest that Ukraine is not grateful for the effort behind the memorandum; other nations offered decisive support for our country's independence. More recently, there has undoubtedly been practical assistance in our efforts at countering Russian aggression, and the United States and United Kingdom have both remained reliable and virtuous partners on the international stage. And yet, despite this assistance, it has become increasingly clear that the power of the Budapest Memorandum to guarantee our national security has taken a hit. It is that realization that has prompted Ukraine in recent months to push for closer integration with NATO, a cause that is popular both with the Ukrainian people and which is also gaining political support. As President Petro Poroshenko noted last month, ""it is clear that the non-bloc status of Ukraine proclaimed in 2010 couldn't guarantee our security and territorial integrity. ...This position has led to serious losses. That's why we've decided to return to the course of Euro-Atlantic integration."" There is, of course, much work to be done if we are to reach the alliance's compatibility standards, which is why the government has formulated a six-year plan for meeting membership requirements. But in the end, it seems only fitting that the status of Ukraine's relationship with NATO be left to the Ukrainian people, and any decision in this regard will only be taken after consulting them in a form of referendum. More broadly, recent events in Ukraine have underscored the need for a rethink of the existing global security architecture. And while Russian aggression is clearly the catalyst, any changes should not be seen as simply directed at a single country, but as part of generally much-needed changes. It is imperative in our fast-changing world that states are granted new means of defending their territory, and that the most effective mechanisms are in place for preserving international peace. It's a conversation that Ukraine, now more than ever, is keen to take part in.","Ambassador: Russian aggression against Ukraine has been challenge to peace .

"The moment 18-year-old Army Pvt. Tim Josephs arrived at Edgewood Arsenal in 1968, he knew there was something different about the place. ""It just did not look like a military base, more like a hospital,"" recalled Josephs, a Pittsburgh native. Josephs had volunteered for a two-month assignment at Edgewood, in Maryland, lured by three-day weekends closer to home. ""It was like a plum assignment,"" Josephs said. ""The idea was they would test new Army field jackets, clothing, weapons and things of that nature, but no mention of drugs or chemicals."" But when he went to fill out paperwork the morning after his arrival, the base personnel were wearing white lab coats, and Josephs said he had second thoughts. An officer took him aside. ""He said, 'You volunteered for this. You're going to do it. If you don't, you're going to jail. You're going to Vietnam either way -- before or after,'"" Josephs said recently. From 1955 to 1975, military researchers at Edgewood were using not only animals but human subjects to test a witches' brew of drugs and chemicals. They ranged from potentially lethal nerve gases like VX and sarin to incapacitating agents like BZ. Read the secret (now unclassified) Army document revealing BZ tests on soldiers (PDF) The military also tested tear gas, barbiturates, tranquilizers, narcotics and hallucinogens like LSD. Read the confidential (now unclassified) Army document uncovering LSD tests on volunteers (PDF) This top secret Cold War research program initially looked for ways to defend against a chemical or biological attack by the Soviet Union, thought to be far ahead of the United States in ""psycho-chemical"" warfare. But the research expanded into offensive chemical weapons, including one that could, according to one Army film obtained by CNN, deliver a ""veritable chemical ambush"" against an enemy. ""This incapacitating agent would be dispersed by standard munitions, and the agent would enter the building through all nonprotected openings,"" the film's narrator boasts. President Nixon ended research into offensive chemical weapons in 1969, and the military no longer uses human subjects in research on chemical agents, said a spokesman for Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, as the facility is known now. Tests began for Josephs almost as soon as he arrived at Edgewood for a two-month assignment on January 1, 1968. ""Sometimes it was an injection. Other times it was a pill,"" Josephs told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Josephs said he didn't know what drugs he was getting. ""A lot of chemicals were referred to as agent one or agent two."" Some weeks, he would undergo one test; other weeks, more, Josephs said. And when he questioned the staff about whether he was in any danger, they reassured him: ""There is nothing here that could ever harm you."" But Josephs, 63, believes the chemical agents he received during his two-month stint at Edgewood did harm him, triggering health problems that continue to plague him four decades later. Even when he talks about Edgewood, he said, ""I get a tightness in my chest."" Parkinson's symptoms . Days before his Edgewood duty ended, in February 1968, Josephs was hospitalized for days with Parkinson's-like tremors, symptoms he said have followed him on and off throughout his adult life. From Edgewood, Josephs said he went to an Army installation in Georgia, where he experienced tremors so severe, he had to be admitted to the base hospital and given muscle relaxers. The Army then sent Josephs to Air Force bases in Thailand, in support of the war effort in Vietnam. He was told never to talk about his experiences at Edgewood and to forget about everything he ever did, said or heard at the Maryland base. Josephs left the service when his three-year tour ended, and he began a career as a real estate agent. He married Michelle, a nurse, in 1977, but the couple decided not to have children, fearing his chemical exposure might somehow affect them. In his mid-50s, Josephs was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological condition that forced him to retire early. Medications cost $2,000 a month, which he was paying for out of pocket. Josephs applied for veterans benefits based on chemical exposure at Edgewood. Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs granted him partial benefits for his Parkinson's for Agent Orange exposure during his time in Thailand, giving Josephs 40% disability. The letter granting him benefits made no mention of Edgewood. Josephs says he now takes two dozen pills daily. His symptoms vary from day to day. Sometimes, he has trouble swallowing. Other times, he experiences numbness in his joints or or tremors. He says he tires easily. He blames his time at Edgewood for all this, and he has joined a lawsuit on behalf of Edgewood veterans seeking medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Read the lawsuit complaint document (PDF) Read about an Edgewood volunteer's widow who blames the VA for his death . Gordon Erspamer, lead attorney in the suit, has reviewed the partial Edgewood medical records that Josephs was able to obtain with the help of his wife. Erspamer said Josephs probably received an injection of sarin or another nerve gas, because the records show that he received the drug P2S on February 1, 1968, to treat ""organophosphate poisoning."" During experiments that began on February 19, 1968, Josephs experienced Parkinson's-like tremors after receiving Prolixin, an antipsychotic medication, Erspamer said, prompting the Edgewood medical staff to give the young soldier Congentin and Artane, two drugs used to treat Parkinson's symptoms. Erspamer said he sees a connection between Josephs' Parkinson's disease and the drugs he received at Edgewood. ""Those substances affect the same region of the brain,"" Erspamer said. ""Tim clearly had adverse health effects because they gave him such high doses that he ranged from overdose with one substance to the antidote, back and forth, and he actually had to get ... a very powerful antipsychotic drug because, in the vernacular, he flipped out."" In addition to medical benefits, the lawsuit is asking that the Defense Department and Department of Veteran Affairs find all Edgewood veterans and provide them with details of the chemicals they received and their possible health effects. Erspamer said the government has reached very few of the 7,000 or so Edgewood veterans, and the VA has turned down almost all Edgewood-related health claims. Court documents show that the Veterans Benefits Administration rejected 84 of 86 health claims related to chemical or biological exposure. ""The whole thing stinks, and if the American people knew about it, they would not tolerate it. This kind of behavior toward our veterans would not be allowed to happen,"" Erspamer said. Josephs has not received any health benefits related to his time as a human test subject at Edgewood. ""They're hoping we die off, so you apply [for benefits], you get turned down,"" Josephs said. ""And it just goes on for years and years, and they just want to wear us down. They want to use young men as guinea pigs and throw them away."" The Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs declined face-to-face interviews with CNN, citing pending litigation. In a statement, the Defense Department said that it ""has made it a priority to identify all service members exposed to chemical and biological substances ... and the VA has contacted and offered free medical evaluations to thousands of veterans."" Josephs received his letter from the VA in 2008, four decades after he arrived at the Maryland base. ""In order to best serve veterans and their families, VA continues to study the possibility of long-term health effects associated with in-service exposure to chemical and biological weapons,"" the letter promised. At the Army's request, The Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit organization that is the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, produced a three-volume report in the 1980s on the long-term health of Edgewood veterans. The IOM decided in the end there wasn't enough information to reach ""definitive conclusions."" Josephs enlisted in the military fresh out of high school -- at the height of the Vietnam War. ""I really felt a duty to my country to go and serve,"" he said. ""Things were different back then. You believed in your government. And you just wouldn't think they would give you something that would harm you intentionally.""","Tim Josephs blames secret Army program for health issues, including Parkinson's disease .

"(CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants a mandate. Apparently, the one he and his Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, or LDP, claimed less than two years ago wasn't enough. So, as his policy agenda faltered and his approval ratings plummeted, the Prime Minister called snap elections last month (less than half way through the Japanese Diet's term) to try to claim a vote of confidence from the public and crush dissenters who oppose his agenda. Abe will almost certainly get his election victory; a mandate is another matter, however. The most notable outcomes of the December 14 ballot are likely to be apathy and cynicism, even if his party holds its majority in Parliament or -- as polls last week predicted -- increases it. Abe and the LDP returned to power in December 2012 determined to reassert Japan's role in a rapidly changing East Asia. Abe put economic rejuvenation at the top of his policy agenda, seeking to end two-plus ""lost decades"" to both consolidate political support and, perhaps even more significantly, to provide the foundation for a more robust international role. ""Abenomics"" was an instant success. The yen plunged in value, spurring exports (and corporate profits), and producing growth that, while mild, well outpaced that of the year before. With that accomplishment in his pocket, the new Prime Minister turned to his real interest: an activist foreign policy that would remind the world that Japan is a ""first tier nation."" Abe traveled the globe, offering political and financial support to diplomatic partners and reasserting Japanese national interests. A core, if not the most important, component of his agenda was lifting domestic obstacles to a more intense regional security role, long inhibited by constitutional constraints. For the vast majority of Japanese voters, support for the LDP stemmed from the prospect of economic revival, and they were prepared to swallow parts of Abe's security agenda if that was part of the package. Unfortunately for Abe, the economy has slowed in recent months with Japan now technically in recession after two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Companies are doing well, but wages remain stagnant, and with inflation picking up -- an integral part of Abenomics is getting consumers to spend before prices rise -- pay packets are shrinking. The economic woes mean Abe can't buy support for the rest of his agenda; in fact, public complaints about the Abe administration are increasing. The public is hostile to his goal of restarting Japan's nuclear energy program, shut down since the triple catastrophe of March 11, 2011, is suspicious of the National Secrecy Law his government passed, and does not share his eagerness to revise Japan's constitution to allow it to more readily use its military, even if in the service of the U.S.-Japan alliance, as the Prime Minister and his team insist they intend. And for all the talk of Japan's turn to the right -- Abe is a conservative nationalist -- the Prime Minister is not representative of his country or his party. The Japanese public is reluctant to unshackle its military and is wary of the high-profile security role Abe seeks. The LDP contains a spectrum of political positions, and if the party has a center, it is left of the current government's views. Yet opinion polls show the LDP increasing its share of seats in the parliament, despite dropping approval ratings for the Cabinet and Abe. Why? The anomaly is best explained by the state and structure of Japanese politics. The LDP returned to power after three years of a Democratic Party of Japan administration, a party voted into office in 2009 by a public that had lost hope in the LDP after it had governed Japan for nearly half a century. Those hopes were dashed: The DPJ proved incapable and incompetent, although the LDP helped with intractable opposition to every DPJ policy. Not surprisingly, support for the DPJ, still the largest opposition party, today hovers around 10%; 37% of voters say they will back the LDP in this month's vote. Most of the rest remain undecided. As a result, turnout may prove to be the lowest since World War II. The structure of the voting system magnifies the impact of this disaffection. There are significant population differences among districts (sufficient in fact for the Japanese Supreme Court to rule them unconstitutional; the court hasn't overturned an election result, however). Parties that are strong in sparsely populated districts get disproportionate seats from an election win. The LDP is such a party. This is how Abe and company, despite increasing unpopularity, increase seats in an election. The Prime Minister knows the math and that is why he called an election. Snap elections are usually the result of a loss of support within the legislature: a government loses its majority. That isn't even an option in Japan. In this case, the Abe government is threatened by the failure of its own policies, not a real opposition. While Abe claims to have called the vote to win a mandate for election reform, in reality, he aims to exploit a disorganized opposition and lock in his party's electoral majority for an extended period. The public knows that, too, and that is why cynicism is on the rise among voters. They also fear that Abe will instead focus on foreign policy and press the more controversial elements of his national security agenda. If he does, the Prime Minister will simply end up undermining whatever mandate he will claim after this week's ballot.","Japan holds a general election this Sunday .

"The debate over annual mammogram screenings continues this week, as follow-up data from a long-term study come under fire. Researchers with the Canadian National Breast Screening Study conducted a 25-year follow-up with their participants and concluded that ""annual mammography in women aged 40 to 59 does not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of physical examination or usual care when adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is freely available."" (Adjuvant therapy is treatment given after surgery; this can include chemotherapy, radiation or hormone treatments, according to the National Cancer Institute.) The results were published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal. But several professional associations and experts have questioned the study authors' conclusions. Results from this study have been reported periodically over the last two decades. The screening data were originally collected in six Canadian provinces between 1980 and 1985. Close to 90,000 women aged 40 to 59 were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received annual mammograms; the control group received none. The latest data show almost identical results from the two groups. Invasive breast cancers were diagnosed in 666 patients in the mammography group; 524 were diagnosed in the control group. In the mammography group, 180 patients died of breast cancer during the 25-year follow-up; 171 women died in the control group. There was a significant difference in survival rates for the two groups. The 25-year survival rate was 70.6% for women with breast cancer detected in the mammography group, but only 62.8% for women with cancers diagnosed in the control group. The researchers said this difference was due to ""lead time, length time bias, and over-diagnosis."" The researchers determined that overall, 22% of the invasive cancers detected during screening were overdiagnosed, meaning they would likely not have presented a danger to the women over their lifetime if they had been left alone. Approximately 38.7 million mammogram procedures are done in the United States each year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In one survey, nearly 75% of women over the age of 40 reported having a mammogram in the past two years. In a joint statement, the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging said this newly published study is ""an incredibly misleading analysis based on the deeply flawed and widely discredited Canadian National Breast Screening Study."" Experts have criticized the CNBSS for using low-quality imaging machines and untrained technicians to do the original screenings. The technology used in the study was a ""generation behind,"" says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, who noted that the randomization between the study's control and experimental groups was also flawed. As such, the professional organizations said in their statement, the results should not be used to create breast cancer screening policy, ""as this would place a great many women at increased risk of dying unnecessarily from breast cancer."" One problem with screening for any type of cancer is that sometimes the tests pick up cancerous cells that never would have caused a problem for the patient. Treating these cancers with chemotherapy, radiation or surgery can damage the body unnecessarily. Prostate cancer screening: Why can't doctors agree? Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, co-author of ""Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health,"" explains it using turtles, rabbits and birds. The goal, he writes, ""is not to let any of the animals escape the barnyard pen to become deadly. But the turtles aren't going anywhere anyway. They are the indolent, nonlethal cancers. The rabbits are ready to hop out at any time. They are the potentially lethal cancers, cancers that might be stopped by early detection and treatment. ""Then there are the birds. Quite simply, they are already gone. They are the most aggressive cancers, the ones that have already spread by the time they are detectable, the ones that are beyond cure."" National Health Services in the United Kingdom says that for every one woman who has her life saved by a mammogram, three are diagnosed with a cancer that never would have become life-threatening. Currently the American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at age 40, and clinical breast exams every three years for women over the age of 20. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends mammography screening every two years for women between the ages of 50 and 75. Anyone under 50 should talk to her doctor to assess her individual risk. Both organizations have indicated that they will be reviewing their guidelines this year, taking into account any research that has been published in recent years. The best approach to mammography screening is probably somewhere in the middle, says Brawley, a practicing oncologist. ""I believe there is a small benefit to screening,"" he says, but women should also be aware of mammography's limitations. ""Women have to make an informed decision."" Brawley: Most cancers are preventable .","Researchers publish 25-year follow-up to Canadian breast screening study .

"Conservative Republicans are painting Latino immigrants as Ebola carriers to fan the anti-immigration reform movement, but health experts say those fears are grossly overstated. Officials say there have been no reported cases of Ebola-infected migrants entering the United States through Mexico and border authorities reject claims that the border is not secure. Still many politicians continue to raise the alarm, seeking to derail immigration reform -- already delayed several times by Congress and the President. On Thursday, former Massachusetts senator and now New Hampshire Senate candidate Scott Brown said that he doesn't want undocumented immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border because they might be carrying Ebola. ""One of the reasons why I've been so adamant about closing our border, because if people are coming through normal channels -- can you imagine what they can do through our porous borders?"" Brown said in a radio interview. Republican candidate Thom Tillis, running for a Senate seat in North Carolina, said in a debate on Tuesday that the United States should seal its border with Mexico to prevent the spread of Ebola, while Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator and potential presidential candidate in 2016, said last week that the southern border is not secure enough to keep out Ebola. The countries most affected by the virus are Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in West Africa. According to Carl Meacham, director of the America's program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, the largest communities of West Africans in Latin America can be found in Brazil and the Caribbean -- not Central America, where the majority of immigrants who illegally cross the border are from. Julio Varela, founder of Latino Rebels, an opinionated Latino-issues website, questioned the motivation of such fears. ""I am starting to think that this is all some kind of mix-and-match game of fear,"" he said. ""You take the most extreme examples of xenophobic hysteria -- Mexicans, terrorists, ISIS, the border crisis and Ebola -- and mash them all together to create a new narrative of craziness,"" he added. The Ebolification of immigration reform has been going on for months. In July, Georgia Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey, a medical doctor, wrote a letter to Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, expressing his concern that the influx of families and unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border could pose a grave public health risk. ""Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning,"" he wrote. Unaccompanied migrant children posed a particular risk, he said, because they could spread the disease too quickly to be controlled, once in the United States. He urged the CDC to immediately assess the situation and notify the public of risks. During an August hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Africa, Frieden dismissed the possibility of Ebola reaching the United States via the southern border. ""That is not happening,"" he said. Other health officials agree with Frieden. They call threats, like the one Gingrey describes, as farfetched. There has never been an outbreak of Ebola in Latin America, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That makes it extremely unlikely for a child or adult entering the United States via Mexico to be infected with the disease. Unswayed by the medical community's assertions of safety, far-right  conservative politicians and their sympathizers have gone even further. Fox News host Chris Wallace suggested that an Ebola infested terrorist could enter through the southern border and wage biological warfare. Meanwhile, Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, currently running for Senate, said that terror groups are collaborating with drug cartels in Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson denied these allegations Thursday and warned against creating fear and anxiety in the public by passing on speculation and rumor. Some Latino Republicans have tried to distance themselves from the Ebola and ISIS border fears. ""I am saddened to see some conservatives use fear of deadly diseases to push an immigration restriction agenda. Their claims are generally vastly overblown and I am especially disappointed in Rep. Phil Gingrey, who is a medical doctor and should know better,"" said Bob Quasius, president of Café Con Leche Republicans.","Conservatives claim Latino immigrants can carry Ebola .

"Lee rubs his chin with his forefinger; his face obscured by a blue baseball cap. We sit together in the back of a taxi beside a frigid river near China's bleak northeastern border with North Korea. He's traveling with Chinese smuggling gangs or ""snakeheads."" They fed and clothed him when he escaped. Lee speaks in staccato sentences. ""I was a soldier,"" he says, ""I did something on the base and I had to flee."" Lee won't say what he did and we can't give his real name for his own safety. He wants to protect his wife and child in North Korea. Whatever the reason, it compelled him to flee like thousands before him. United Nations officials, human rights activists and smugglers say North Korean refugees face a daunting journey to reach asylum in South Korea. And crossing into China is often the easiest part of the whole process. ""We all know how to escape to China. A lot people in North Korea know how to do it,"" says Lee. Underground network . For years, an established underground network got refugees like Lee out. Charities and South Korean evangelical groups ran a kind of underground railroad for North Koreans out of Dandong, a booming border city in China. But in recent years, the Chinese government has tightened border controls and clamped down on these groups. Now refugees must depend on snakeheads. ""They have to operate in the shadows,"" says Jeremy Douglas, the Regional Representative of the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), ""Because if they come out of North Korea and get noticed, they will be sent home."" China has a uniform policy of sending refugees back to the autocratic regime they fled. In fact, China doesn't refer to fleeing North Koreans as refugees at all. They call them ""illegal economic migrants."" Last month Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, reported that 11 North Korean defectors were arrested by Chinese police as they tried to enter Myanmar, which borders southern China. One was just seven years old. If the North Koreans are caught and sent back, experts say, they face a litany of human rights abuses. ""Persons who are forcibly repatriated from China are commonly subjected to torture, arbitrary detention, summary execution, forced abortion and other forms of sexual violence,"" states a damning U.N. report on the Human Rights situation in North Korea. The report calls on China to give the U.N. Refugee agency (UNHCR) access to fleeing North Koreans, something that China currently doesn't allow. ""China is, frankly, shamelessly violating its international obligations,"" says Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch, ""China has ratified the refugee convention and should be treating these people who are fleeing from North Korea as refugees."" Fear of North Korean influx . In a written submission to the U.N., China rejected the ""unfounded allegations"" relating to China in the U.N. Commission of Inquiry's report into North Korea, and hinted that the research was politicized. China did not allow the U.N. commission to investigate the situation inside China. Robertson says China fears an influx of North Koreans into the country if it eases its rules for defectors. The Communist Party fears any instability in North Korea or within its own borders, so the argument holds weight. Because of China's policy, the passage to Seoul is a daunting one. ""From North Korea, people have to take advantage of smuggling rings to get out. There are pre-established ways for safe passage,"" says Douglas of UNODC, ""a steady stream of people are making the journey."" He says that North Koreans will often try to travel in small groups. According to Human Rights Watch, North Koreans will switch cars regularly and make the journey by land from the border to Laos. Travel by rail or air is impossible because they have no paperwork. But last year, the Laotian government alarmed human rights groups when they sent back a group of young defectors to North Korea via China. If North Koreans make it through the border into China, and somehow manage to evade Chinese security authorities for thousands of miles, they must then sneak through Laotian territory, and make their way into Thailand. ""Thailand is the promised land,"" says Robertson, because North Koreans found there are deported to South Korea. ""Thailand considers that North Koreans can be sent to South Korea since the South Korean constitution sets out that all Koreans are citizens of the South,"" he says. Yet when they arrive in South Korea, Robertson says the story is not over. The smugglers have to be paid. South Korea's government provides ""start-up money"" for defectors, which as the name suggests, is cash to help them settle. But many end up using it to pay off their debts to smugglers and brokers. Robertson says if they can't pay, the smuggling can turn into human trafficking. But Lee is only at the very start of this long journey. He says the Chinese smugglers have clothed and fed him and he hopes to meet us in Seoul one day. Despite all of the risks he's determined to make it. ""If there is a time in the future, let's meet and talk,"" he says.

"(CNN)When Evonne Goolagong Cawley first picked up an apple crate board to hit a ball against any flat surface she could find, Wimbledon was always the dream. The tennis-obsessed youngster would play for hours on end against a wall or a water tank, at the time thinking the tournament was merely the stuff of fairy tales. ""I read this princess magazine story,"" recalls the 63-year-old seven-time Grand Slam singles winner in an interview with CNN Open Court at the Australian Open. ""One story was about this girl who trained and was taken to this place called Wimbledon where she won on this magical court. ""I didn't know it was for real but she said 'yes, this place exists in England'."" From that moment henceforth, the wall or water tank was the net at the All England Club, the concrete under her feet the hallowed grass turf graced by so many past champions. ""Every time I went to sleep at night, I would dream about playing at that magical center court and every time I hit the wall I would pretend I was there."" Goolagong Cawley's fairy tale came true. Nicknamed the 'Sunshine super girl' early in her career, Goolagong Cawley achieved exactly that feat in 1971, winning the first of Grand Slam titles. She is 12th on the list of all-time singles grand slam winners level with Venus Williams and ended her career with 19 single titles in all. As well as two Wimbledon titles, Goolagong Cawley also won the Australian Open four times, the French Open, three Fed Cup titles and reached world No.1 in 1976. If the fairy tale came true, there were also many times when the clock struck midnight, with her story marked by episodes where -- as with so many Aborigines -- she was often treated as a second-class citizen. There was a regular fear of being taken away from her parents. Many Australians thought the best practice was for Aboriginal children to be removed from their families to be given a life away from poverty and an education in white Australian society. ""Whenever a car would come down the road, my mum would tell us to hide 'or else the welfare man would take you away,'"" she recalls. Even as an adult she was acutely aware of how Aborigines could be excluded from everyday life -- even after winning Wimbledon. ""Before I started traveling overseas and I was with a friend and in those days I loved music and I loved disco dancing so she took me out but I wasn't allowed in. ""That happened again in Brisbane and I was with two Aboriginal friends and this was just after I won Wimbledon. I said 'don't worry we'll go somewhere else'. I think it hurt my friends more than me."" The Goolagong family were the only Aborigines in the small town of Barellan in New South Wales. Her father Kenny was a hard-working sheep shearer, who gained notoriety for being able to shear 100 animals in a day. The tennis star was the third of Kenny and Melindra's eight children. In her town, Goolagong Cawley became renowned for her tennis and was first invited to play on a court when a neighbor, Bill Kurtzman, caught her peering through the fence. Following encouragement from locals, tennis coach Vic Edwards traveled up from Sydney to see the then 10-year-old play. He persuaded her parents to let him bring her to the metropolis, enrolled her in school, coached her and, for a time, had her live with him. She arrived in the big city with her first tennis dress, made for her by her mother from sheets and with equipment paid for by the people of her home town. There was no pressure on her to play the sport by her parents and her mother would never ask on her return after a match if she had won, merely if she had had fun. Encountering racism in tennis . Sydney was to provide no respite from the racism Goolagong Cawley had to face. She especially remembers an incident while playing with Edwards' daughter against two older ladies. ""One of the older ladies didn't like the idea of two youngsters beating up on them. We won pretty easily. When it was time to shake hands. ""And she said; 'This is the first time I've had the pleasure of playing a Nigger' and I've never heard that before and I started to get really upset."" As her mentor Edwards did his best to shield her from such prejudice. ""He taught me not to believe in what you read, believe in yourself so I never read anything. I realize now he was blocking me from a lot of things. ""I always just thought of myself as a tennis player. I was protected from a lot of publicity and politics of life."" But her tennis success helped Goolagong Cawley break down barriers, becoming the first non-white to play in apartheid South Africa in a tournament in 1972. Even today, she is helping indigenous people in Australia with the foundation she has set up with her husband, the former British tennis player Roger Cawley. Her motto for it -- as it was during her playing days -- is ""dream, believe, learn, achieve."" The program encourages the children to play tennis but also to stay in school as they do so. ""The reason why I'm doing this is because I wouldn't be here unless I had the initial support of the townspeople of Barellan. That's why I am doing what I am doing today, trying to help young indigenous kids find their dream."" By the time she arrived as a player at her dream location of Wimbledon, the then 18-year-old, also known as 'La Belle Evonne,' was already well known to the British press. She was put on the show courts, unheard of back then for an unheralded young player. ""I didn't realize they were writing about me before I got there,"" she recalls. ""They didn't normally put a young person first time at Wimbledon on center court but they did with me. ""It really scared the hell out of me and I wanted to get off the court as quickly as possible and I did."" On her return the following year in 1971, she beat the great Margaret Court and fellow Australian in the final, although graciously insists that was only because her opponent was pregnant and not moving to the best of her ability. However, Goolagong Cawley repeated the feat on the same hallowed turf in 1980 with a three-year-old daughter in tow. In so doing, she was the first mother to be crowned Wimbledon champion since before the outset of World War I. 'Super girl' had become 'super mum.' But for all the monikers, titles and accolades, ""having fun"" was the key motivation. ""I believe that's what life is all about. I certainly had a lot of fun during my career playing tennis, doing the thing I wanted to do and to do it well.""","Evonne Goolagong Cawley's tennis play began with an apple crate board .

"(CNN) -- Since conflict broke out in Syria in 2011, the fighting between rebels and soldiers loyal to Bashar al Assad has torn countless families apart with more than a million children now refugees, the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, says.

"A judge in the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez handed his defense pretrial legal victories Friday, throwing out as evidence text messages sent by the homicide victim the night he died and ruling that prosecutors may not tell jurors about two other slayings allegedly committed by the former New England Patriot. Hernandez, wearing a dark suit, sat with his lawyers during the Massachusetts hearing, at times smiling and scribbling notes to his defense team. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the texts that murder victim Odin Lloyd sent his sister shortly before his death. In the texts, Lloyd said that he was with Hernandez, whose trial is scheduled to start next month. Lloyd was dating a sister of Hernandez's fiancee. ""U see who I'm with?"" Lloyd, who was shot and killed on June 17, 2013, wrote in a text. ""NFL,"" he wrote, referring to Hernandez, ""just so you know."" Prosecutor William McCauley said the messages demonstrated Lloyd feared for his life. But defense attorney James Sultan said the texts ""do not suggest fear. They do not suggest knowledge of impending death. They are totally innocuous on their face."" Garsh said the victim's ""state of mind is relevant to motive only if there is reason to believe the defendant knew of it."" Lloyd's texts were not a ""dying declaration,"" the judge said, adding that prosecutors ""do not provide a basis to infer that he was under the belief of imminent death."" Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, left court in tears after the ruling. She later returned. The decision could hurt the case, said Michael McCann, a legal analyst and Sports Illustrated writer. ""The prosecution now has a more difficult case in convincing a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Aaron Hernandez murdered Odin Lloyd,"" he said. ""While there remains incriminating evidence, such as video of Hernandez the night of the murder and an inexplicable use of a cleaning service at Hernandez's home, the loss of Odin Lloyd's text messages is a significant blow to the prosecution."" Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park. Surveillance cameras at the time captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people at the time. Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player himself, was not among them. In another defense victory, Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not tell jurors about a separate homicide case involving Hernandez: the July 2012 killings of two men in Boston. In May, Hernandez was charged in the shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who prosecutors say were ambushed and executed as they drove home in Boston's South End on July 16, 2012. In addition to the two counts of first-degree murder, Hernandez also has been charged with three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, prosecutors said. The latter four counts reflect shots fired at three people, one of whom was wounded, inside the car that de Abreu and Furtado were in, according to prosecutors. The prosecution has said that Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the place where the double homicide allegedly took place, giving the former player a possible motive for killing Lloyd. The defense called the theory ""incredible."" Garsh ruled there was no link between the two crimes. She dismissed the theory as ""clearly in the realm of speculation"" and said it ""does not comport with common sense."" The judge also ruled out testimony about Hernandez's February 2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley, a former friend who was allegedly with Hernandez on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. Bradley, who was shot in the face, is suing Hernandez in federal court.","A judge throws out as evidence text messages sent by the homicide victim .

"With so many developing destinations fighting it out for international tourists, it's not surprising that some travelers make a point of avoiding the ones with weak human rights and environmental records. This can make it challenging to figure out which up-and-coming countries are actually worthy of your tourist coin. Once again, help comes via nonprofit Ethical Traveler, which this week released its annual list of the countries that are doing the most to promote human rights, preserve their environments and support social welfare -- all while fostering a lively, community-based tourism industry. Every year, the California-based organization reviews policies and practices in the developing world to select its top 10. ""By visiting these countries, we can use our economic leverage to reward good works and support best practices,"" says the report. In alphabetical order, the 2015 top 10 are: . 1. Cape Verde . 2. Chile . 3. Dominica . 4. Lithuania . 5. Mauritius . 6. Palau . 7. Samoa . 8. Tonga . 9. Uruguay . 10. Vanuatu . Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga are this year's new entries to the list. Seven of this year's 10 countries are island nations, ""indicating a trend in our winners' circle,"" says the report. ""Climate change affects islands dramatically, so they tend to be very aware of the importance of effective environmental policies."" As in 2014, no developing Asian country qualified this year. ""All betrayed too many human rights abuses, and showed too little movement toward sustainability,"" says the report. Choosing the top 10 . Ethical Traveler's research focuses on four categories: environmental protection, social welfare, human rights and animal welfare. ""For each of these categories we look at information past and present so that we understand not only the current state of a country, but how it has changed over time,"" says Ethical Traveler. ""This helps us select nations that are actively improving the state of their people, government and environment."" Information sources include Freedom House, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Reporters Without Borders, UNICEF, LGBT resources and the World Bank. ""After identifying about two dozen 'short list' performers, we turn to detailed case research, focusing on actions these governments have taken over the year to improve (or in some cases, weaken) practices and circumstances in the countries,"" says the report. The chosen destinations also have to have something to offer tourists. Each ""best ethical destination"" offers opportunities to check out incredible natural beauty, enjoy great outdoor activities and have interactions with local people and cultures in a meaningful, mutually enriching way, says Ethical Traveler. Researchers stress that just because these destinations made the list, none scored perfect marks.

"After days of descending on cities coast to coast, protesters demanding an end to police brutality are expected to get loud again Saturday. In recent weeks, throngs have taken to the streets nationwide after grand juries decided not to indict white police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown near St. Louis and Eric Garner in New York City. Saturday will culminate what organizers are calling a ""Week of Outrage,"" with large demonstrations planned in major cities. ""Our message is very simple,"" wrote Carl Dix, founder of the Stop Mass Incarceration Network, one of the main organizers of the protests. ""Since the 'normal routine' of America has always included murder of black and Latino people by law enforcement, this week, that 'normal routine must be disrupted.'"" The protests started Friday at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and outside City Hall in St. Louis. A St. Louis police officer will be disciplined because he showed up at City Hall with a ""Wilson"" badge on his right arm, police spokesman Schron Jackson said. The badge apparently referred to Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown in August. Jackson said the badge violated a department rule about prohibited insignia. Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis Police Officers Association fired back, saying, ""The U.S. Department of Justice has consistently described demonstrations where police officers were shot at and police had Molotov cocktails thrown at them as constitutional, protected free speech, but police officers are apparently not allowed to exercise their constitutional rights to express their support for a fellow police officer exonerated of wrong doing."" Protesters in major cities, including New York City and Washington D.C., plan marches for Saturday afternoon. Eric Garner Jr., the son of the man who died after a New York police officer held him in what appeared to be a chokehold, said he was proud of the protests. ""It's amazing how everybody (is) doing this. My father and I appreciate it,"" the son told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Some peaceful protests across the country this week have been marred by bouts of violence and crowds that disrupted thousands of motorists by shutting down freeways. But despite those instances, protests have continued to draw some notable names. More join chorus for change . In Washington, minority congressional staffers walked off their jobs and gathered on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday with their hands raised to show support for the families of Brown and Garner. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, who fought to end segregation and racial discrimination in the South in the 1960s, also joined the group. And the support is not limited to political figures. The Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James is one of the big names speaking out. Before the team faced the Brooklyn Nets on the basketball court Monday night, James wore a T-shirt that said ""I can't breathe"" -- Eric Garner's last words, which have become a rallying cry for protesters. ""It was a message to the family. I'm sorry for their loss,"" the four-time league MVP said. ""As a society, we know we need to get better, but it's not going to be done in one day. Rome wasn't built in a day."" Obama weighs in . But police are pushing back. In New York City, the Patrolman's Benevolent Association sent a form for members to sign and return to their PBA delegate requesting the mayor not attend their funeral if the officer is killed in the line of duty because of the mayor's ""consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve."" The city replied with a statement, saying: ""This is deeply disappointing. Incendiary rhetoric like this serves only to divide the city, and New Yorkers reject these tactics. The mayor and the speaker both know better than to think this inappropriate stunt represents the views of the majority of police officers and their families."" President Barack Obama spoke about the future of race relations in America to a network that reaches a predominantly young African-American audience. ""What I told the young people who I met with -- we're going to have more conversations over the coming months -- is, 'This isn't something that is going to be solved overnight,' Obama said on BET. "" 'This is something that is deeply rooted in our society. It's deeply rooted in our history.' "" In his interview, the President said African-American youths need to be both persistent and patient in order to make progress on the issue of racial tensions in America. Officers involved . Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer seen on video choking Garner, spoke with internal affairs investigators this week. A New York grand jury decided last week not to indict Pantaleo in Garner's death. ""He indicated he never used a chokehold,"" said Stuart London, his attorney. ""He used a takedown technique he was taught in the academy. He said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure Mr. Garner."" In Missouri, Officer Darren Wilson, who maintains he shot Brown in August out of fear for his life, resigned from the Ferguson Police Department last month.","A St. Louis officer will be disciplined for wearing a ""Wilson"" badge, police say .

"Nine men were jailed in London Thursday on terror charges, four of them over ""an al Qaeda-inspired plot"" to bomb the London Stock Exchange, UK police said. Abdul Malik Miah, Gurukanth Desai, Shah Mohammed Lutfar Rahman and Mohammed Moksudur Rahman Chowdhury had pleaded guilty last week to the London Stock Exchange plot, police said. Five others, Abdul Bosher Mohammed Shahjahan, Mohibur Rahman, Nazam Hussain, Omar Sharif Latif and Usman Khan, also admitted terror offenses, police said. All nine were sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court Thursday to terms ranging from five to nearly 17 years, with some given indeterminate sentences with at least eight years to serve. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism, issued a statement saying: ""This was one of the most significant and complex counter terrorism operations of recent years. ""We had a network of highly dangerous men based in three cities who were working together to plan terrorist attacks in the UK. ""Had we not taken action to disrupt this network, their actions could have resulted in serious casualties or fatalities."" Miah, who had previous convictions, was sentenced to 16 years and 10 months in jail, while Desai was jailed for 12 years, and Latif for 10 years and four months. Shahjahan, Khan and Hussain were each handed an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum of eight years to serve. Mohibur Rahman was jailed for five years. Chowdhury was sentenced to 13 years and eight months, and Shah Rahman to 12 years. Osborne said a major covert operation had been put in place to monitor the suspects, who were based in London and Stoke-on-Trent in England and Cardiff in Wales. At the height of the operation, over the 2010 Christmas period, nearly 1,000 police officers and staff were involved, he said in an online statement posted by West Midlands Police. ""These men were arrested when the balance between public safety and gathering evidence meant that we could not run the operation longer,"" Osborne said. ""This plot clearly demonstrates that there are still people living in our communities who are intent on doing us harm. If we are to find them and we are to stop them we must all remain vigilant and aware."" The investigation, which was coordinated by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, also involved police forces in London, Wales and Staffordshire, and national counterterrorism and security services.","Nine men are jailed in London after admitting a string of terror offenses .

"Greece may be in the midst of an economic crisis but one company continues to sleep easy. Coco-Mat, a family business which makes beds and mattresses out of natural materials, is expanding despite the country's economic crisis. The company, which has a workforce of 220 and last year raked in over $75 million, is based in the picturesque mountains in north-eastern Greece. But it is now increasing its retail outlets across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the U.S. Coco-Mat specializes in manufacturing sustainable mattresses and bed products made of coco fibre, natural rubber, wool, cotton, goose down, horsehair, silk, linen, wood and even seaweed. ""Socrates, Plato, Aristotle: they used to sleep on mattresses made out of cotton, made out of seaweed, made out of aroma therapy. So the principle is the same,"" said Coco-Mat's co-founder Pavlos Eymorfidis. ""We follow the tradition of all these wise people, and nowadays we produce non-metal beds and mattresses,"" he added. The design and philosophy behind Coco-Mat has contributed to making it a commercial success both at home and abroad. It also has a very different approach to the ""try before you buy"" policy. In Amsterdam and New York the company offers potential buyers the chance to test drive its mattresses in a no-strings-attached napping arrangement. Shoppers looking to find their dream bed are given complimentary food, drink, slippers, a robe and access to private rooms equipped with showers and comfy big beds in which they will hopefully fall asleep for a few hours at a time. The idea of giving customers such a different shopping experience adheres to the company's philosophy that it takes more than five minutes to determine what type of bed you would want for the next 20 years. According to Eymorfidis, Greeks should take this more natural approach as they seek change. ""I believe Greeks like me should listen to the birds, they should listen to trees, to the sea, and not to computers, to solutions in Syntagma Square to see what's going on. I really mean it, because nature is waiting for us with a lot of chances, with a lot possibilities, a lot of solutions.""","Greek bedding company Coco-Mat has a global turnover of more than $75 million .

"Its all change for the world's top sporting event -- the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made 40 new recommendations in an attempt to make hosting the Games more affordable. The 2014 Winter Games cost Russia an estimated $50 billion and IOC members believe such an exorbitant cost has put off potential future bidders. In September, Norway withdrew its candidature to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, while Stockholm, Krakow and Lviv also pulled out of the running. That left just two cities -- Beijing in China and Kazakhstan's Almaty -- vying to host the 2022 Games. ""We have to look into the future and try to address the challenges which may arise in the future and the challenges we have already now,"" International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach told reporters. ""We want to show with this procedure that the IOC is opening up, that we are opening a window and we want to have fresh wind coming in,"" According to the new reforms announced on Tuesday, bidding costs will be reduced while there will also be a ""significant financial contribution from the IOC."" The new rules will permit the organization of events outside of the host city, as at London 2012, while in exceptional circumstances, even taken outside the host country. The IOC has also announced that it will include the non-discrimination on sexual orientation in the Olympic charter following the controversy surrounding the Sochi Games and Russia's political laws on homosexuality. ""Over the past year many people have asked me why there is a desire to make changes. After all, they say, the Olympic Games, the IOC, and the Olympic Movement have enjoyed many successes and we are in a very good position,"" said President Bach. ""My answer is that we are now in the position to drive change ourselves rather than being driven. ""We have to take leadership with Olympic Agenda 2020. We have the opportunity, and we must seize the moment -- now is the time for change."" Also amongst the recommendations are plans to cap the number of athletes and coaches while the IOC wants women to make up 50% of those competing. A vote on the IOC's proposals will be held at a meeting in Monaco on 8 and 9 December. Bach has also confirmed that sports will not have to wait seven years to be approved for a place at the Olympics, insisting the IOC can propose new events. ""Now the door is open (for sports). The IOC by itself can also take a decision that we are adding this or that event,"" Bach said. ""It only has to happen before the city is elected so that candidates know what they have to deal with. Any changes after can happen in agreement with the host city."" The Tokyo Games, which will be held in 2020, is pushing for the inclusion of baseball and softball following their exclusion from the 2008. The next Winter Games takes place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, while Rio de Janeiro will host the Summer Olympics in two years time.","International Olympic Committee reveals new plans .

"Amid the twinkling holiday lights adorning homes around the world, a natural light show is set to take center stage over the weekend. The Geminid meteor shower has been visible in the night sky this week, with the best opportunities for viewing to come on Saturday night. Geminids are debris from an extinct comet called 3200 Phaethon, which was previously believed to be an asteroid, according to NASA. ""Basically it is the rocky skeleton of a comet that lost its ice after too many close encounters with the sun,"" NASA said on its website. The light show comes around annually in mid-December, when the Earth encounters detrius from 3200 Phaethon, ""causing meteors to fly from the constellation Gemini."" Space enthusiasts consider the light show to be one of the clearest and best to watch. ""Though the moon was nearly full, the Geminid meteor shower is known for having some very bright and slow moving meteors which are visible against the star trails taken near Joshua Tree National Park,"" iReporter Jason Hullinger wrote last year after photographing the phenomenon with a time-lapse camera. The meteor shower can be seen most easily in the Northern Hemisphere in areas with dark skies, away from city lights. ""The Geminids are expected to peak just before dawn on Dec. 14,"" NASA said, ""with a predicted peak rate of 100 to 120 meteors per hour."" NASA is hosting a Web chat about Geminid on Saturday evening from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. CDT.

"A two-shot swing on the final hole of the final women's major of the season saw South Korean teenager Hyo-Joo Kim clinch a remarkable victory in the Evian Championship at the expense of Karrie Webb of Australia Sunday. Webb chasing an eighth career major, but first since 2006, was one ahead going into the 18th hole, but took three shots from the edge of the green for a bogey five, missing her final effort from 12 feet. By contrast, the 19-year-old Kim, playing her first major, showed no sign of nerves as he rolled home a 15-foot birdie putt to finish on 11-under 273. It left her a shot clear and the third youngest winner of a major behind U.S. pair Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson. Speaking through an interpreter, Kim admitted: ""I was flying like a bird."" Webb, who would have become the first player to win six different majors, with the Evian Championship a recent addition to the roster, said she had misjudged her first effort from the edge of the green. ""It was a rush of adrenaline with the belly wedge and the putt was faster than I thought. It was a very poor putt and I knew I had to make it for a play-off. ""I had a lot of good shots and hit every green bar the second hole and it's obviously disappointing, but I gave myself a good chance."" Kim, who stunned the golf world with her opening 10-under 61 in France, closed with a final round of 68 to clinch the 350,000-euro first prize ($487,500). She has the added bonus of winning her full playing rights to next season's LPGA Tour without having to qualify. Webb also shot a 68 for 10-under with two more South Koreans, Jang Ha-Na (66) and Hur Mi Jung (68) tied for third on nine-under. To complete its domination, another Korean Choi Na Yeon, was fifth on eight-under after a fine closing 67. Kim first came to attention at the 2012 Evian Masters -- the last event before it became a major --  finishing fourth as an amateur that year. In 2013 she was Rookie of the Year on the Korean Tour and has already won three times this season. U.S. star Michelle Wie had to pull out of the first round with a hand injury, but had some consolation by sealing the inaugural Annika (Sorenstam) Major Award. It is for the player who has won at least one major and has the best overall record. Wie claimed her first major at the U.S.Women's Open champion and was runner-up to Thompson in the Kraft Nabisco Championship.","Teenager Hyo-Joo Kim wins Evian Championship .

"A doctor who has devoted years to aiding gang-rape victims in the conflict-torn Democratic Republic of Congo has been given Europe's top human rights award, the Sakharov Prize. Denis Mukwege has dedicated years to providing a rare sanctuary for rape survivors in Bukavu, in the east of his homeland. Many travel hundreds of miles to have their physical and psychological wounds healed at the Panzi Hospital he founded. Rape is used as a weapon of war in the region, making his services crucial. The gynecologist is thought to have operated on more than 40,000 women since setting up his hospital during the 1998 war in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. During the worst periods of the conflict, it was estimated that one woman was raped every minute in the country, a European Union news release announcing the award said. The conflict in his country may officially be over, but the armed conflict in eastern DRC continues, and instances of gang rape are all too common. The prestigious Sakharov Prize is awarded by the European Parliament, a directly elected body that represents some 550 million people across the continent. It includes prize money of 50,000 euros (about $63,500). Mukwege: 'Abhorrent barbarism' In a statement posted on the website of the Panzi Foundation USA, Mukwege said that he had received the news of the award ""with humility"" and that his thoughts were with the victims and survivors of sexual violence around the world, particularly in his own country. He thanked the European Parliament for shining a spotlight on the ""horrific and abhorrent barbarism"" that plagues eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and called for united action to bring peace, justice and democracy to the troubled region. ""We think about those who fight against stigma and social exclusion, those who fight for justice, and for their rights,"" he said. ""The Sakharov Prize is a strong signal, telling the women they have not been abandoned to the barbaric fate. It tells them that the world listens to them. It is a message of encouragement and hope for all those who struggle for their human rights, for peace and democracy in the DRC and all over the world."" European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the body's leaders had decided unanimously to grant the prize to Mukwege ""for his fight for protection especially of women."" Mukwege continues to perform surgery two days a week as well as managing the hospital and traveling overseas to advocate for women's rights, the EU said. 'Worse than leprosy' At the Panzi Hospital, many women are treated for vaginal fistula -- a muscular tear caused by violent rape -- and are also given counseling and treatment for the psychological repercussions of their experiences. Mukwege thinks that fistula, which causes incontinence, is one of the worst conditions a woman can experience. ""A fistula is dramatic for a woman,"" he told CNN in a 2009 interview. ""Everywhere she goes, people don't want to be around her and reject her, so it's a disease that is worse than leprosy."" The women at Panzi Hospital view Mukwege as a father. ""I may be the only one to whom they can express what they feel,"" he said. ""Sometimes it's important to help them heal psychologically and tell them: 'You are not destroyed. They wanted to destroy you, but you are still a woman. You are a woman, and you need to be strong.' "" In February of this year, Mukwege was awarded the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security. He was also seen as a contender for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. It was in fact awarded to children's education campaigners Malala Yousafzai, who won the Sakharov Prize last year, and Kailash Satyarthi.","Denis Mukwege thanks European Parliament for spotlighting sexual violence .

"(CNN) -- Forget about trying to give England a hand. Italy must now worry about themselves after a 1-0 loss to outsider Costa Rica left the Azzurri in danger of being eliminated from the group stage for the second consecutive World Cup. A goal from Bryan Ruiz in the first half gave Costa Rica the shock victory in Recife, officially sending England home a day after it lost 2-1 to Uruguay. Luis Suarez, who plays his football for Liverpool, tormented the Three Lions and Ruiz -- a former Fulham forward -- was the man who broke English and Italian hearts Friday. The improbable victory moved Costa Rica into the second round for the first time since Italia '90 -- as well as add to the upsets in Brazil. ""We're delighted with the win ... but we don't want to stop there,"" Costa Rica manager Jorge Luis Pinto told reporters. ""It's only the start. ""It's not easy to play against a team like Italy, given their history and the individual talents they have. ""We tried to contain their play by restricting (midfielder) Andrea Pirlo. But we were also solid in defense."" Mario Balotelli joked that he'd want to kiss the Queen if he bailed out England but the ex Manchester City striker missed two good chances for Italy in the opening 45 minutes. England had to hope -- at the least -- that Italy would beat both Costa Rica and Uruguay to have any chance of going through from Group D. After Costa Rica had a penalty appeal waved away when Joel Campbell appeared to be fouled by Italian hard-man Giorgio Chiellini, Costa Rica netted the lone goal when Ruiz converted a close-range header in the 44th minute past the fit again Gianluigi Buffon. A toothless Italy appeared to wilt in the second half and barely threatened the Costa Rica goal, unable to break the offside trap, with Randall Brenes almost doubling Costa Rica's advantage in injury time. ""It was a defeat where Costa Rica were much more aggressive and played with passion,"" Italy manager Cesare Prandelli told RAI Sport in quotes carried by the Football Italia website. Italy and Uruguay will now face off Tuesday for the right to join Costa Rica in the knockout stage. Italy needs a draw to advance by virtue of a better goal difference. ""We already knew this was a particularly tough group and that we'd have to gamble our qualification in the last game with Uruguay,"" said Prandelli. ""Are we afraid? No. We just need to recover our energy."" England becomes the second high-profile European nation to exit the World Cup after defending champion Spain was ousted on Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Never bet against Germany. In a world where so much can change so quickly, perhaps it is reassuring that there is one constant which remains. The nation which had ripped Brazil's dreams to shreds in the semifinals, won its fourth World Cup after a tense 1-0 victory over Argentina Sunday. Mario Gotze's strike, seven minutes from the end of extra time, ensured Germany ended its 24-year wait for glory at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium. For all the doubters who said that no European side would or could ever win the World Cup on South American soil, there was one team which refused to listen. Lazy stereotypes often abound when describing German football. The words 'organized', 'ruthless' or 'machine' are bandied about along with that other clichÃ©, 'efficient.' To use those words to describe this German side would not only do it a disservice -- it would ignore the wonderful talent which passes through the veins of each and every player. Germany has long threatened to rule the world. In 2006, it came close, bowing out at the semifinal stage after a painful defeat by Italy in a tournament held in its own country. Two years later, it was beaten in the final of the European Championships by Spain before the same opposition ended its World Cup dream in South Africa. Bizarre moments from the World Cup final . At Euro 2012, Italy once again was its nemesis as Germany fell at the semifinal stage of Euro 2012. Nobody doubted Germany's talent -- but critics said it did not have the ability to get over the winning line. The sight of Bastian Schweinsteiger, bloodied and bruised, provided all the insight you needed into the psyche of this German team. It can do ugly -- but it can do beautiful too. That beauty was there for all to see when Gotze took Andre Schurrle's cross on his chest and volleyed the ball past the Sergio Romero's despairing dive. But in Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, it has steel, in Schweinsteiger it has a warrior and in Thomas Muller it has a man who can do everything. Few could begrudge Germany this success -- it has been the team of the 2014 World Cup. Germany has thrilled in this tournament. Its 4-0 victory over Portugal was sublime; its 7-1 thrashing of Brazil was mesmerizing. But this win, secured through guts, fight and a moment of magic from one of its bright new stars showed that Germany overcame the most difficult hurdle of all. With the game deadlocked at 0-0 after 90 minutes, substitute Gotze provided the game's defining moment with a touch of magic. The Bayern Munich star took Schurrle's pass on his chest before displaying exquisite technique to volley the ball past Sergio Romero. Argentina, which was beaten by West Germany 1-0 at the 1990 World Cup, rallied briefly but failed to find an equalizer. Even with the mercurial Lionel Messi in attack, Argentina were unable to take the game to penalties -- not that it deserved to. For all the talk of Messi, it was left to another wonderful talent and his left foot to steal the headlines with the decisive goal. At least Brazil could smile once again -- there is not enough beer in the entire country to distract from the prospect of an Argentine party on the Copacabana. Argentina failed to muster a single shot on target during the contest -- and yet it will walk away ruing three wonderful chances to have won the tie. With 20 minutes played, Toni Kroos, so impressive throughout the tournament, inexplicably headed the ball over his own defense for Gonzalo Higuain to run through on goal. The Napoli striker did everything right. He took a touch, allowed the ball to move slightly in front of him and with just Manuel Neuer to beat, then somehow shanked his effort horribly wide. As Higuain stood still in disbelief and his teammates held their heads in their hands, Germany breathed again. For a side so assured in its 7-1 victory over Brazil, Germany were rattled by a couple of team changes -- just before the final and soon after the game had started. Deprived of Sami Khedira through injury after the midfielder suffered an injury just before kickoff, Germany's shape was disrupted further when replacement Christoph Kramer was forced off following a heavy clash with Ezequiel Garay. As Germany regrouped the South American side constantly looked to use the flanks to exploit a lack of pace in their opponents' defense. It was from the right flank which Argentina created the move it thought had provided the crucial breakthrough. Ezequiel Lavezzi found space on the right before delivering the perfect cross for Higuain to fire home from close range. As Higuain wheeled away to celebrate and those draped in blue and white danced with joy, the flag of the assistant referee was held aloft after the forward was correctly adjudged to be offside. Germany, having scored seven in its previous game against Brazil, began to wake from its slumber and only a fine save from Romero prevented Kroos' fierce drive from nestling in the corner. But with just a minute of the first half remaining, Romero was forced to thank the woodwork as Argentina got out of jail in dramatic circumstances. Kroos' corner dissected the Argentine defense and Benedikt Howedes flew through the air before sending a thunderous header against the post. Forced to play 120 minutes during its semifinal against the Netherlands, Argentina showed little signs of tiredness and made a rapid start to the second half. Once again it was Messi causing problems, this time latching onto Lucas Biglia's through ball before running clear of the German defense. This was it. This was his moment. The boy from Rosario, the boy who left home at 13 and moved halfway across the world to Barcelona to become the world's greatest. Destiny beckoned. He'd been here so many times before. The ball was in his stride, the goalkeeper was advancing, the net was supposed to bulge. But it didn't. Messi dragged his shot wide. Argentine hearts sank, Germans stood relieved, almost open mouthed. Messi looked bewildered. Proof that the world's best player is human after all. Having seen Argentina contrive to miss two wonderful opportunities, perhaps those in German shirts believed this would be their night. It certainly had chances to win the contest before the end of 90 minutes with Kroos firing wide from 20-yards, while Schurrle failed to control the ball after moving in on goal. With an extra day's rest following its semifnal victory over Brazil, Schurrle brought out a sharp save from Romero as Germany picked up the tempo. But Argentina remained a threat on the counter attack and substitute Rodrigo Palacio should have done better than hook his effort high and wide after being played through on goal. With tired limbs and minds beginning to show, the pace of the contest slowed with both sets of players struggling to create any kind of chance. Challenges began to fly in with Javier Mascherano fortunate to escape a second yellow card, while Schweinsteiger was left with a blood pouring from his face after a clash with Sergio Aguero. Penalties seemed inevitable. And then it happened. Schurrle, found space down the left and his cross picked out Gotze, who took the ball on his chest before volleying the ball past Romero and into the far corner. It was a goal worthy of winning any World Cup -- a wonderful strike which came with just seven minutes of the contest remaining. Argentina tried to respond but while minds were willing, bodies were not. Messi was anonymous, his final effort from a free kick sailing high into the stand. Those in white turned towards the center circle, the sight of gleaming gold trophy was there for all to see. A campaign which began with the thrashing with Portugal ended with victory over the team which so many had tipped for victory. Perhaps Argentina should have known. Never bet against Germany.","Germany defeats Argentina 1-0 in World Cup final .

"Can animals go to heaven? Some people all over the world have been excited in recent days about reports by news agencies worldwide -- including one from CNN -- declaring that Pope Francis apparently believes they can. It turns out it's unclear what he believes about this. A previous pope, Paul VI, had no doubts.  ""One day we will again see our animals in the eternity of Christ,"" Paul once told a boy grieving the loss of his pet. That quote, from the pontiff who reigned from 1963 until his death in 1978, was inaccurately attributed to Francis. The confusion may have begun when Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera referred to Paul's quote in a story that carried the headline, ""The pope and animals: 'Heaven is open to all creatures.'"" The story itself does not indicate Francis said that.  Instead, it refers back to Paul VI. The writer for the newspaper pointed to something Francis actually did say: ""Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of God."" That remark, the writer suggested, ""widened the hope of salvation"" to animals and all of creation. The headline on the article quoted Francis as saying, ""Heaven is open to all creatures.""  But there's no sign Francis said that. A search through the current Pope's writings and remarks showed no immediate sign that he has taken a clear position on the question. Pope Francis to visit United States for first time next fall . While Catholic teachings neither reject nor reaffirm the notion that animals have souls. There is no hard-and-fast answer in Catholicism to this question. Drugs, capitalism, homosexuality -- little is off limits for outspoken Pope . It's an emotional question for many people.

"This week it was reported that Steve Jobs, the CEO and cofounder of Apple, underwent a liver transplant two months ago. One detail concerning Jobs's transplant seemed odd: The surgery took place at a hospital in Tennessee, some 2,000 miles from Jobs' home in northern California. Why Tennessee? Steve Jobs (pictured in October 2008) has been on a health-related leave of absence since January 2009. The answer sheds light on the intricacies of the organ transplant system, as well as why it's sometimes easier for people with significant financial resources to get an organ transplant. (Jobs' estimated net worth: $5.7 billion.) Livers are a scarce resource. In any given year, only about one-third of the people on the national transplant waiting list receive one, and as of late June, more than 16,000 people were on the list. Yet it sometimes seems that celebrities in need end up at the front of the line when they need a transplant, and people often assume they get preferential treatment. (Rumors about special treatment circulated after baseball player Mickey Mantle's liver transplant in 1995, for example.) Health.com: The real gift of life: How medical donations help . The truth is more complicated. No one can actually buy an organ in the United States (legally, that is). But getting a liver transplant, it turns out, is a lot like getting into college. Once you're on the waiting list, your chances of getting off it depend largely on your personal circumstances -- how sick you are and whether you are a good donor match. But getting on the list in the first place -- or on more than one list, as the case may be -- requires resources and know-how that most people don't have. Can some people 'cut the line'? There are 127 centers in the U.S. that perform liver transplants. If you need an organ transplant, your doctor will refer you to one of these centers, where you will be evaluated, given a score based on the severity of illness, and placed on the center's waiting list, if you are indeed a candidate for transplant. The center's waiting list feeds into a national database managed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a nonprofit organization that contracts with the federal government to manage the nation's organ transplant system. UNOS works with 58 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) that coordinate organ distribution in their region of the country. When an organ becomes available, the OPO in that region searches the UNOS database for a local match using blood type (and other biological considerations), the patient's severity score, and the time spent on the waiting list. If a match can't be made within that region, the organization expands its search to neighboring regions. The problem -- or the advantage for some patients -- is that not all OPOs are created equal. Some regions contain nearly 15 times as many people as others, and their waiting list times vary widely. Patients in the smaller OPOs tend to be less sick and experience shorter wait times before getting an organ. In the Tennessee OPO where Jobs received his transplant, the median wait for a liver between 2002 and 2007 was just over four months. The national average was just over a year, and in some OPOs it was more than three years. Though there is always the possibility of preferential treatment once a patient is on a waiting list -- UNOS conducts periodic audits of transplant centers for exactly this reason -- it is unlikely that someone like Steve Jobs can ""cut the line"" of the transplant waiting list. Health.com: Three sisters find kidney donor for dad using craigslist . The reason that some people might be able to get transplants more quickly is that they're standing in more lines. Nothing prevents someone from being evaluated and listed at multiple transplant centers. As long as a patient has the wherewithal to fly around the country -- and be available at the drop of a hat if a liver becomes available (this is where the private jet comes in handy) -- a patient can, in theory, be evaluated by all the transplant centers in the country. ""The system works at two levels,"" explains Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., the chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""One, who gets in to a center. Two, who gets transplanted off a particular center's list when an organ becomes available. Most of the attention goes to stage two, but the biggest ethical challenges are really at stage one."" Jobs underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004. (He reportedly had a type that grows more slowly -- and has a better prognosis -- than others.) He was said to have recovered, but last year he appeared in public looking thin and sick. He took a leave of absence in January and underwent a liver transplant a few months later. However, it's not clear how long he was on the transplant waiting list, or whether he was on the waiting list for a center other than the one in Tennessee. Insurance matters too . Since 2003, UNOS has required that transplant centers inform all candidates that they can be evaluated and listed at more than one center, and that they can also transfer their care from one center to another without losing the time they have accrued on the waiting list. However, not everyone can afford to fly around the country and be evaluated at more than one transplant center. In fact, many people can't afford a liver transplant, period. According to the most recent estimates, the cost of a liver transplant is $519,600 -- a price tag that excludes roughly one-third of Americans because they don't have sufficient insurance (or any insurance), Caplan estimates. According to data collected for UNOS, only about 5 percent of liver transplants are paid for out of pocket. Health.com: Where the money goes: A breast cancer donation guide . ""What your insurance covers is very different from everyone else's,"" says Anne Paschke, a spokesperson for UNOS. Some insurance companies won't cover evaluations at multiple transplant centers, Paschke explains, and in at least one case, an insurance company has restricted its coverage to a single transplant center that the company itself owned. Moreover, your insurance continues to be important during the evaluation process. The decision to accept a transplant candidate takes place before UNOS enters the picture, and the committees that determine whether a patient is added to the transplant center's waiting list have access to a patient's full medical and financial history. ""There's a huge triage involved in getting in,"" says Caplan. ""If you're a homeless alcoholic sleeping on the streets of L.A., and you're going toe-to-toe with Steve Jobs, you're going to lose."" For most people, the ability to pay is a precondition for acceptance at more than one transplant center. Wealthy people who are, in effect, financially ""pre-approved"" for a liver transplant, can shop around and identify the transplant centers that will give them the best chance of receiving a new organ. Reforming the system . Despite the apparent problems with the transplant system, past efforts at reform have generally failed. Health.com: Could painkillers be hurting your heart? In the late 1990s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that would have given priority to the sickest patients, regardless of region. This would have eliminated the geographic disparities that make approval at multiple transplant centers advantageous, but Congress blocked the regulations and instead asked the Institute of Medicine, an advisory organization that belongs to the National Academy of Sciences, to consider the issue. The IOM's proposal was less far-reaching, but it did recommend standardizing the size of the organ donor pool for the sickest patients. Congress failed to implement this measure as well, however. Some transplant centers advocated the shift away from the OPO system, but others vigorously lobbied Congress to oppose the new policy. The smaller transplant centers were concerned that in a national organ allocation system, they would receive fewer transplants and be driven out of business. The larger transplant centers, meanwhile, wanted to maintain the size and geographical reach of the OPOs in their areas. ""There was a huge split in the transplant community,"" says Paschke. ""It was very territorial at the time, and there was a lot of maneuvering going on. There were a lot of business interests on the part of the transplant centers."" UNOS itself has been split on the issue of multiple listing. The organization's board of directors has voted on whether to restrict multiple listing three times in the past 15 years; the first vote resulted in a tie, and in the others the proposal was rejected by a divided vote. The inequity revealed in the liver transplant process is symptomatic of the larger inequalities in the American health-care system, says Caplan, who also cochairs a United Nations task force on organ trafficking. In countries such as Canada or Switzerland that have national health-care systems, a patient's finances don't influence access to organs to the same extent, he says. ""Money doesn't play such a big role in entry into the system,"" he says. ""Steve Jobs' transplant is relevant to why we need some health reform.""

"As laws across the country become less restrictive, more Americans are reporting using marijuana regularly than ever before, according to a new survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health -- the largest of its kind -- is done annually. Results from the past five years have shown a steady increase in weed use. Last year was no exception. In 2012, about 7.3% of Americans ages 12 or older reported regularly using marijuana. That's up from 7% of Americans in 2011. Although it's only a slight increase, the real contrast exists between 2012 and 2007, when 5.8% of Americans said they regularly used weed. These numbers could represent an increase in use among Americans, or simply an increase in the number of people who felt OK reporting use of the drug on a national survey. There has been a lot of attention given to marijuana in the last few years. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the federal government would no longer prosecute people who used the drug in states where it was legal -- as long as there were state laws in place to keep the drug away from children. Until that announcement, people could be brought up on federal charges even if they were within the law in their state. How to regulate pot when it's legal . Washington and Colorado have both legalized recreational marijuana use. Some 20 other states allow people to purchase it for medical reasons. The survey, which looks at all drug and alcohol use, showed some other interesting trends as well. Prescription drug abuse, which has been increasing in the past few years, has leveled off. But heroin use is on the rise; the number of people using heroin is up some 80% since 2007. Nearly 24 million Americans -- that's 9.2% of the population -- say they use illicit drugs, according to the survey.

"The admitted mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks has issued a rambling defense of Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, on trial in New York for allegedly being al Qaeda's propagandist in the wake of the attacks. In a rare statement made public, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said Sulaiman abu Ghaith -- an Islamic preacher whom the United States has charged with conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and providing material support to terrorists -- is falsely accused of being involved in al Qaeda's military activities. Mohammed said abu Ghaith was more of a visiting celebrity who preached the Quran to al Qaeda recruits. Mohammed's 14-page statement was in response to questions from abu Ghaith's attorney and was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Sunday night. Abu Ghaith was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged al Qaeda operatives sheltered in Iran. He was arrested in Turkey and deported to Kuwait via Jordan, which helped U.S. agents capture him. The New York trial, blocks from the site of the former World Trade Center destroyed in the 9/11 attacks, has already featured testimony about previous al Qaeda operations, including the 2001 shoe bomb attempt, which U.S. authorities say abu Ghaith knew about beforehand. Mohammed, the most senior al Qaeda leader in U.S. custody, used the statement to lecture the United States about its errors in supporting jihadists in their fight during the 1980s against the Soviet Union's forces in Afghanistan, realizing too late the level of training ongoing in mujahedeen camps. ""Uncle Sam destroyed his own country by his own hand with his stupid foreign policy,"" Mohammed said in his statement. Mohammed has taken full or partial credit for planning multiple operations beyond 9/11, from the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa to the post-9/11 shoe bombing and the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Abu Ghaith, Mohammed said, was a ""pious man"" and among many scholars drawn to Afghanistan when the Taliban took control of the country in the mid-1990s. He describes Afghanistan during those years as something of a paradise, with strict Islamic laws making the country safe from crime. He said he doesn't recall meeting abu Ghaith and that, as a scholar and preacher, abu Ghaith wouldn't have known about military operations, in part because al Qaeda was careful to restrict access to such information. ""He did not play any military role and to the best of my knowledge he did not receive any military training at any of the training camps for the mujahedeen in Afghanistan,"" Mohammed said. ""I personally never spoke with Sheikh Sulaiman abu Ghaith about the shoe bomb operation,"" he said, adding that U.S. claims about abu Ghaith's role of issuing public sermons and statements after 9/11 don't indicate involvement in planning al Qaeda attacks. ""Those tasked with giving statements to the media do not necessarily know all the details of an operation and are sometimes even unaware of the very existence of the operation."" Mohammed also tried to undermine U.S. allegations that abu Ghaith took an oath of allegiance, or swore ""bayat,"" to bin Laden. He said that swearing such an oath doesn't mean a person is to carry out an operation. ""To tell the truth, I do not even know if (abu Ghaith) personally swore bayat to (bin Laden) or not,"" he said. Abu Ghaith's attorney said in his court filing that Mohammed's statement is a piece of important exculpatory evidence. He had requested Mohammed to testify via video, but U.S. restrictions and Mohammed's own refusal to personally testify prompted the written questions and response.

"China has around two million people policing public opinion online, according to a state media report that sheds light on the country's secretive internet surveillance operations. Dubbed ""public opinion analysts,"" they work for the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda department, major Chinese news websites and commercial corporations, according to The Beijing News. Using keyword searches, their job is to sift the millions of messages being posted on popular social media and microblogging sites such as Sina Weibo, regarded as China's equivalent to Twitter. They then compile reports for decision makers, the report said. The number of people monitoring internet activity to prevent criticism of the government and social unrest has been a subject of discussion for years, said David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project. ""Two million sounds like a big number,"" he said. ""But I think it's clear that the government will do what it takes to monitor any potential collective action on social media."" The ranks of online censors outnumber China's active armed forces, which total 1.5 million, according to the Ministry of National Defense. Bandurski said that the resources China has invested in internet surveillance have increased rapidly since Sina Weibo's emergence in 2010. It now has 500 million account holders although a recent crackdown on internet rumors has deterred some users. Posts run a range of topics from celebrity gossip to politically sensitive issues like official corruption. ""China's biggest engineering project is not the Three Gorges dam but public opinion and Weibo has completely changed the game,"" Bandurski said. The Beijing News described the work of Tang Xiaotao, who has been employed as a monitor for less than six months by a company that works on government projects. Using a software application that cost $3 million yuan ($490,000), Tang searches for key words specified by his company's clients, monitors negative opinions and then compiles a report. The software also tracks how widely a topic is being discussed by counting the number of comments and shares. When the score reaches 40 out of 100, the system will send an alert. A final decision on what action to take is decided by the clients, which include government officials, Tang told the newspaper. Online analysts like Tang will be offered specialist training later this month, the newspaper said. The course,  run by the People's Daily online operations, covers judging and analyzing online posts and dealing with crisis situations. Those who pass will get a certificate, formally recognizing them as ""public opinion analysts.""","China has around two million people policing public opinion online .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A dam burst in the northeastern village of Cocal left a 12-year-old girl dead and three people missing, fire department officials said Thursday, according to Brazil's state news agency. Steady rain has flooded communities across 10 states in Brazil since early April. The break occurred late Wednesday afternoon and was blamed on heavy rains in the state of Ceara, the state-run Agencia Brasil reported. Concern over the dam's integrity led officials to order residents to evacuate Cocal for 15 days. But they were allowed to return this week after the dam was deemed safe, it said. Fire officials said 800 to 2,000 homes located near the dam were inundated, but civil defense officials estimated 500 families -- some 2,500 people -- were affected. Steady rain has flooded communities across 10 states since early April, killing dozens of people and forcing nearly 800,000 from their homes, according to the Brazilian civil defense agency. Meteorologists and other weather specialists are divided over the cause of the downpours, particularly in the normally dry northeastern section of the nation. Some say ocean temperatures are to blame, while others say deforestation has led to the climate change. Brazil has been devastated by rain-swollen rivers for months. Flooding in the southern part of the nation in November and December killed more than 120 people and left about another 30 missing.","Break occurred late Wednesday afternoon blamed on heavy rains in state of Ceara .

"Spitting. Littering. Cutting in lines. Defacing historic treasures. These are some of the behaviors the Chinese government is hoping to eradicate with a set of official conventions to be followed by Chinese citizens when traveling. The guidelines were posted Tuesday on the Chinese central government's website. According to state news agency Xinhua, the regulations also prohibit climbing on or touching ancient relics or carving into them. ""Being a civilized tourist is the obligation of each citizen,"" according to the government post, which lays out a long list of guidelines issued by the National Tourism Administration. The call for ""civilized"" conduct comes in the wake of a firestorm of anger and outrage unleashed in Egypt, China and around the world this week when a 15-year-old Chinese tourist carved his name in Chinese characters into the 3,500-year-old stone at Egypt's Luxor Temple. The biggest backlash came from within China with netizens exposing and criticizing the teenager. The netizen reaction shows the incident in Egypt should not be used to generalize the behavior of Chinese travelers, says Mei Zhang, founder and CEO of travel agency WildChina, which handles both inbound and outbound tourists. ""This kind of behavior is difficult to label as bad Chinese tourist behavior because the outreach you've seen on Chinese social media like Sina Weibo is, 'How can this be possible?'"" Zhang told CNN. ""It's almost like the behavior of this young man in Egypt is one piece of [Chairman] Mao's dropping that spoils the whole pot of soup. This is what Chinese are saying."" Outrage after Chinese tourist defaces Egyptian temple . The government regulations also call on travelers to follow public orders, protect ecology, public infrastructure and utilities, maintain a clean environment, respect the rights of others and show them courtesy, Xinhua reported. Travelers should also seek appropriate entertainment, according to the guidelines. Outbound Chinese tourism has expanded rapidly in recent years. In 2012, Chinese overtook Americans and Germans as the world's top international tourism spenders, with 83 million people spending a record $102 billion on international tourism. That growth has brought with it a backlash in some industry sectors. (See our report on Chinese tourism: The good, the bad and the backlash). WildChina's Zhang said there have been similar issues in the past as Chinese citizens begin to travel internationally. ""It's a natural process that Chinese travelers are going through, as travelers around the world have also gone through. It's a gradual process of China's coming out, of China's travelers being exposed to more of the international world. It's a natural adjustment stage,"" she told CNN. Earlier this month, Beijing called on its nation's tourists to improve their behavior, with Vice Premier Wang Yang stating it was important to project a good image of Chinese tourists.

"In North Korea's utopian society, the very words ""human rights"" do not need to exist -- because it's so perfect, the regime maintains. The North Korean regime controls and monitors the usage of the very words. The concept is not even taught. I had never even heard of the term ""human rights"" when I was in North Korea. It also strongly denies the existence of the political prison camp system throughout the country. It maintains this position even though I was born in the most infamous, political prison camp in North Korea: Camp 14. Even now, there are people who are born into a life of an inmate in a political prison camp. North Korea also denies committing human rights violations, threatens and intimidates defector activists working to raise awareness of human rights issues, and attacking and criticizing those who have testified during the United Nations Commission of Inquiry's investigation, calling these defectors ""human scum."" North Korea has also launched personal attacks on me, labeling me ""human scum"" and releasing a statement that my testimony is all based on lies. The dictatorship in North Korea has never been honest or truthful for more than six decades it has been in existence. Could North Korea change? The North Korean dictatorial regime should not just emptily deny that these political prison camps exist. If they are truly honorable and fair they should immediately allow an international inspection delegation, comprised of myself and organizations such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch, or the United Nations, to be able to conduct on-the-ground visitations to the political prison camps. These delegations must include political prison survivors like myself and other defectors. Only recently did they concede that ""labor detention centers"" exist, but solely for the incarcerated to have their lives improved ""through their mentality and to look on their wrongdoings."" Earlier this year, the UN published a report on the human rights situation in North Korea, through the Commission of Inquiry that was established last year. It was followed by a special North Korean human rights side event during the recent UN General Assembly in New York in which U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, and the Foreign Ministers of Japan and South Korea demanded improvements in North Korea's human rights record. To counter this, and perhaps fearing a challenge to its stability and of losing the initiative, the regime adamantly opposed and obstructed any discussions at the UN of a resolution regarding its rights record, as well as the issue being brought up at the Security Council. I believe ultimately the regime is using diplomatic tactics to deflect pressures from the international community regarding its nuclear ambitions, missile tests and human rights violations. Regime travels freely as North Koreans starve . Some say that the most recent actions and conciliatory gestures on the part of the North Korean regime can lead to the revival of six-party talks and progress on the nuclear issue. But these talks have happened many times before, and the regime still goes ahead and conducts nuclear tests in a bid to become a nuclear power. This has showed the abject failure of the objectives of the six-party talks to denuclearize the peninsula. Even if negotiations were to be restarted, the attitude of the regime must change first -- most importantly by ceasing its provocative behavior. PHOTOS: The scale of North's camp system . However, though there may be a temporary détente in tensions if the regime were to participate in restarted talks, it would be difficult to expect a fundamental change in attitude on the part of the North Korean regime. Also, the human rights issue must be on the same level as the nuclear issue and dealt with together, and for this to happen, the human rights issue must be included as an integral part of six-party talks. The international community must show continued interest and become actively involved. The dictator's family travel freely, while ordinary North Koreans cannot enjoy any freedom of travel. People are dying of hunger while the North Korean dictator wastes money on building a useless golf course and earns money from Western tourism, which both angers and saddens me. The dictatorship in Pyongyang says its citizens chose the system in North Korea through their own will and that they are happy. But there is no place, no country on this Earth where the people would knowingly choose a system that starves and kills its own citizens and be happy. Footnote: . The North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri released videos about Shin Dong-hyuk this week, calling his testimonies lies. The video featured a man, Sin Kyong Sop, whom Shin recognized to be his father. In the video, which has English subtitles, Sin denies they lived at a prison camp. In response, Shin Dong-hyuk released this statement: . ""My only 'sin' against the North Korean dictator is that I told the entire world about the suffering of the political prison inmates in the political prison camps. My only 'crime' against the dictator is that I escaped from the political prison camp. I love my father. Through this, I seek my father's forgiveness. The dictator is holding my father hostage.

"The heat inside the small medical clinic is stifling. An occasional breeze from an open window provides the only relief. A dozen lethargic children, their ribs exposed and twig-like arms outstretched, lay on beds covered by mosquito nets. I accompany Keita Cheick Oumar, a doctor with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), as he checks on patients in a health clinic located in the densely populated Kati district, near the Malian capital of Bamako. Kati district has been hard hit by Mali's deepening hunger crisis and as elsewhere in the country the crisis is having an especially devastating impact on children. Dr. Oumar kneels in front of Jabadjie, a ghost of a child whose loose skin sags over a skeletal frame. She is 16 months old and weighs only a little over 9 pounds (4 kg). In addition to being severely malnourished, Jabadjie is suffering from pneumonia and anemia that have ravaged her weakened immune system. Jabadjie was rushed to the clinic after she was found by IRC volunteers who travel throughout Kati district to identify malnourished children and inform villagers about the help available at the health clinic. ""If she had stayed in the village, she would have died for sure,"" Dr. Oumar says. He instructs Jabadjie's mother, who has come to the clinic with her daughter, on how to feed the girl nutritionally fortified peanut paste. Although malnutrition is not unknown in Mali -- in the past decade, the country has faced three droughts which all led to major food shortages -- this year the country has struggled to cope with a prolonged drought and food crisis that is affecting large areas of the Sahel region of West Africa. The crisis has been made worse by a spreading internal conflict. Islamist militant groups with ties to Al Qaeda control about two-thirds of Mali after hijacking a secular rebellion by Turaeg nomads in the north at the start of this year and seizing more territory in the wake of a March 22 military coup, which toppled the president based in Bamako. Read related: U.N. Security Council seeks detailed Mali military intervention plan . More than 320,000 Malians have fled the north in search of food or safety, 200,000 of them seeking sanctuary in neighboring Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. The remaining 120,000 are internally displaced. Jabadjie's mother, Masaran Diarra, explains that food in her village ran out months ago. ""We are farmers and normally grow peanuts and millet, but we have nothing to eat now,"" she says. ""I have five children to feed and one more on the way."" Two weeks after being admitted to the clinic, Jabadjie seems to be out of danger. Although still shockingly thin, her protein levels are up and the edema, a swelling caused by the build-up of fluid beneath the skin, has disappeared. Impact Your World: Find out how you can help . An hour's drive south of the Bamako, in the village of Diallakoroba, I meet a group of farmers. They take me to a small hut used to store grain. Lamine Samaké, a 50-year-old father of eight, shines a flashlight through a small window. The hut is empty. ""This time last year it was almost full with millet,"" he tells me. ""We have used up all of our reserves and won't have any millet until the next harvest in January or February."" In the meantime, Samaké says, three families comprising some 30 people will have to survive on a small quantity of corn and, money permitting, the occasional serving of fried fish. ""It won't be enough,"" he adds, shaking his head. ""The months ahead will be very hard."" Despite the vast need, international aid efforts in Mali have been hampered by political chaos and uncertainty, and in the conflict-ridden north, by Islamic extremists who have prevented outsiders from operating in the region.

"(CNN) -- Swiss super-combined world skiing champion Daniel Albrecht was airlifted to hospital after a sickening crash on Kitzbuehel's Streif course on Thursday. Albrecht nose-dives down Kitzbuehel's Streif course after crashing during training for a World Cup downhill. Albrecht, who was said to have suffered concussion and bruising to a lung, was in training for the weekend's World Cup downhill at the Austrian venue when he lost control approaching the bottom of the run. The 25-year-old received lengthy treatment on the slopes before being flown to hospital at St. Johann, where he regained consciouness before being put in an induced coma. An induced coma puts the brain in hibernation so it can recuperate and allows swelling in the brain to ease. Helmuth Obermoser, the official race doctor, said in a brief statement that Albrecht had bleeding on the brain and a lung contusion. Albrecht took the season's opening giant slalom at Solden in October and scored a second victory and fourth of his career two months later in Alta Badia, Italy, where he became the first Swiss winner in 10 years. Thursday's fall came on a similar section at Kitzbuehel that saw American Scott Macartney suffer head injuries in a crash last season -- an episode that led officials to make changes to the course.","Daniel Albrecht is airlifted to hospital after a sickening accident at Kitzbuehel .

"Improving views of the economy have helped hike President Barack Obama's approval rating to a 20-month high, a new CNN/ORC poll showed Tuesday, as markets climbed to record levels at news of an economy in overdrive. More Americans still disapprove of the job Obama is doing as President. But at 48%, Obama's approval rating is at its highest point in CNN polling since May 2013. The gains were driven by newfound backing among women, independents and millennials — groups where Obama's approval numbers jumped 10 percentage points from a month ago. RELATED: Read the entire CNN/ORC poll . Meanwhile, Obama's approval numbers ticked down among men, Republicans and Americans between 35 and 49 years old. The approval jump follows a late-quarter jolt in Obama's governing agenda, which gained momentum after unilateral actions on immigration and relations with Cuba. Separate surveys have showed those moves popular among the American people. It all amounts to some welcome good news for Obama, whose unpopularity — despite consistently improving economic conditions — led to widespread losses for his party in November's midterm elections. Tuesday's poll still reflected pervasive disaffection for Obama: 56% of respondents said the President has fallen short of their expectations, and 49% said his policies would take the country in the wrong direction. The steady economic recovery has posed a conundrum for the White House, which wants some credit for decisions that helped pull the country from last decade's recession. To the frustration of Obama and his aides, polls until recently showed Americans largely pessimistic about the country's financial state, despite solid job growth and a bull market on Wall Street. In public remarks — even those unrelated to the economy — Obama has touted the latest positive economic sign. But even as the unemployment rate dipped below 6%, a large portion of Americans were still gloomy about the economy. That's because of how people felt about their own economic standing, which for many still includes stagnant wages or jobs in low-paying service fields. But as the recovery powers on, and the days of the downturn fade further into the past, Americans appear to have turned the page in their views of the economy. Tuesday's CNN/ORC poll showed for the first time in seven years, a majority of Americans — 51% — have a positive view of the economy, a sharp increase from the 38% who felt that way in October. The jump was present in every demographic group — men, women, whites, non-whites, urban, rural — and was largest among Americans who earn less than $50,000 annually. Americans' increasingly positive economic views parallel a drop in gas prices — a phenomenon most experts say a President has little control over. And they come as new data show the American economy growing at a surging rate. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that gross domestic product grew at 5% in the third quarter — its fastest pace in more than a decade. Stocks rose sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 18,000 for the first time ever and the S&P 500 also reaching new heights.

"Pope Francis made his strongest condemnation yet of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy on Friday, asking for forgiveness and pledging to impose penalties on ""men of the church"" who harm children. ""I feel compelled to personally take on all the evil which some priests -- quite a few in number, obviously not compared to the number of all the priests -- to personally ask for forgiveness for the damage they have done for having sexually abused children,"" the Pope said in remarks quoted by Vatican Radio. ""The church is aware of this damage, it is personal, moral damage carried out by men of the church, and we will not take one step backward with regards to how we will deal with this problem, and the sanctions that must be imposed,"" Francis continued. ""On the contrary, we have to be even stronger. Because you cannot interfere with children."" The U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests said it may be the first time a pope has spoken of sanctioning ""complicit bishops."" ""But that is all it is: talk,"" said Barbara Dorris, SNAP's outreach director. ""We beg the world's Catholics: Be impressed by deeds, not words. Until the Pope takes decisive action that protects kids, be skeptical and vigilant."" The Pope's new comments, made Friday to members of a Catholic nongovernmental organization, the International Catholic Child Bureau, represent a shift from his previous statements on sexual abuse. In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra in March, Francis struck a defensive tone, saying, ""The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility. No one has done more. And yet the church is the only one that has been attacked."" Advocates for victims of sexual abuse had slammed those remarks, calling them another example of the church prioritizing its reputation over the protection of children. 'Highest priority' Early this year, a United Nations panel slammed the Vatican's handling of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church and accused the church of protecting itself rather than the victims. The Vatican said in February that it would study the report, which claimed clerics were involved in the sexual abuse of ""tens of thousands"" of children. And in late March, Francis appointed an eight-member committee -- a mix of clergy and laypeople, including a sexual abuse survivor -- to advise the church on how to protect children, punish abusers and train church staff. ""Pope Francis has made it clear that the church must uphold the protection of minors amongst her highest priorities,"" Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said in a statement announcing the committee members. However, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests dismissed the new panel, saying it was ""based on a deceptive premise"" and perpetuated the ""self-serving myth that  Catholic officials need more information about abuse and coverups."" Rocked by scandal . Pope Francis took over the helm of the Catholic Church just over a year ago from Benedict XVI, whose papacy was marked by the emergence of repeated allegations of sexual abuse by priests. Benedict said many times that abusers should be prosecuted, but victims' groups again said he did too little. Benedict spoke with some victims of sexual abuse by priests on papal visits to countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, where he expressed his ""deep sorrow"" about the scandal. The Vatican selected those he met. In April 2013, a month after taking office, Francis recommended that the church's doctrinal office ""act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse,"" the Vatican said at the time. This would be ""by promoting measures for the protection of minors, as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse, carrying out due proceedings against the guilty,"" it said. Kick out those who sexually abuse children, U.N. panel tells Vatican .","Pope Francis says he feels compelled to ""personally ask for forgiveness"" for priest abuse .

"Who could have believed that a Hollywood movie directed by an African-American that examines more than 60 years of socio-political history through the life of an African-American White House butler would have happened, much less been released toward summer's end? And that it would become the talk of the nation as both ""Oscar bait"" and cultural signifier? Oh... and make more money in its opening weekend than anybody, including its producers, expected? Even before it opened nationwide Friday, ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" seemed far more than just another Hollywood period melodrama. In a summer where racial reckoning manifested itself in major and minor events (the George Zimmerman verdict and  the Paula Deen sideshow), the movie promised to be a kind of cultural signpost, an occasion for still more soul-searching and commemoration leading to this month's 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. It even became grist for a rare front-page essay last week in the Washington Post written by  film critic Ann Hornaday, who declared the movie a groundbreaker for being the ""first major feature film to capture the full sweep and scope of the civil rights movement."" 'The Butler' reflects America's racial conversations . The movie's thoroughgoing publicity campaign made it an unavoidable fact of life, thanks largely to its female lead, Oprah Winfrey, who through boisterous appearances on almost every nationally-televised talk show made herself as unavoidable a fact of life as she was when she had her own nationally-televised talk show between 1986 and 2011 -- which somehow seems a lot longer ago than it actually is. Oprah's hard work likely wasn't targeted at movie critics -- though if you go by the Rotten Tomatoes website that assesses critical consensus, ""The Butler"" has reaped a 73 percent ""ripe""(as in positive) score -- though it's also true that even some of those positive reviews are mixed in nature. While even some of the negative reviews have good things to say about the acting, especially from Forest Whitaker in the title role of circumspect presidential servant Cecil Gaines and Winfrey as his saucy, unsettled easy spouse Gloria, even some of the positive reviews take to task some of the heavy-handed melodramatic flourishes applied to the story by Daniels, whose previous work, 2008's ""Precious"" and last year's ""The Paperboy"",  drew critical wrath for what were viewed as wretched, maudlin excesses. ""The Butler"" itself may not have been every critic's idea of a masterpiece. But its advance hype (did I mention all the Sunday supplement covers?) was certainly some kind of masterly work of art; the kind whose only precedent for an African-American-made commercial film was the buildup orchestrated in large part by Spike Lee for his 1994 biopic, ""Malcolm X."" Did it work? Put it this way: The most optimistic forecast for ""Butler's"" opening weekend was $15 million. It has so far earned more than $25 million, easily outdistancing such late-season action franchises as ""Kick Ass 2"" ($13.5 million). Though no industry pundit expects it to pass the magic blockbuster borderline of $100 million, ""The Butler"" has already achieved enough capital, in money and buzz, to make people wonder whether it heralds yet another surge in serious commercial films about African-American life, past and present. 10 secrets of 'The Butler' We've been down this road before; several times, in fact, since the early 1990s when the emergence of Lee, John Singleton (""Boyz n The Hood"") and other young filmmakers-of-color heralded a renaissance of minority movies. What's happened since those days has been at best a static, fitful process of advancement for black Americans in film with many in Hollywood convinced that movies with black-related themes are at best niche-market items with little if any staying power in a global movie bazaar where generic action movies and romantic comedies allegedly deliver bigger bangs for the buck. We will, as always, see. Whatever the future holds for ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"", one groundbreaking fact remains: Somehow, someway, a commercial feature film about the civil rights era was made by a black director with a predominantly black cast without a major white character being the focus of the narrative. So far, it's working. And that means that, for the moment, anything's possible.","Gene Seymour: Opening weekend success of 'The Butler' surprising .
He says it comes at a time of national reckoning on race, with Zimmerman, Deen .

"Easton, Maryland (CNN) -- New appliances and vacation packages aren't unusual giveaways in the housing slump, but one woman is taking the unorthodox step of throwing in a car with the purchase of her home. Catherine Poe is throwing in a Toyota Prius hybrid with the sale of her renovated Maryland house. ""My daughter came up with the idea,"" Catherine Poe said. ""We're losing money on the house, and the Prius only adds to losing money, but we also realize it's time we really got to sell the house."" Poe and her daughter bought the 1907 three-bedroom colonial in Easton, Maryland, in 2005 as an investment property. In the past, the pair has bought two historic homes within minutes of Maryland's shoreline, renovated and resold them during a red-hot housing market. Poe said she and her daughter bought this house for $335,000, spent $300,000 restoring it and were hoping for a $40,000 profit when they first put it on the market. But after more than a year of trying to sell it, taking it off the market and putting it back on, they say they're ready to cut their losses. With gas prices hovering about $4 a gallon in most states, they hope the fuel-efficient Toyota Prius hybrid, which costs about $23,000 for a new model, will sweeten the pot even more. Poe's real estate agent said he is optimistic about the giveaway, saying that an incentive of that magnitude was a first for one of his clients. ""You have to be creative. You have to learn how to do different things, and if we learn anything from this, certainly, we will replicate it,"" said Chuck Mangold, who has put an ad for the Prius in the local newspaper. But Elizabeth Blakeslee of the National Association of Realtors cautions buyers about ""gimmicks"" to draw attention to a house. ""In my 18 years as a Realtor, I have never known anyone who has actually received whatever it was, the trip or the car,"" said Blakeslee, a regional vice president for the NAR. ""It's generally negotiated away during the process of the buying or selling negotiations."" She added that a competitive selling price is a better way to get buyers interested and generate a sale. According to the NAR, existing home sales remain 14 percent below a year ago. Even with a projected small uptick in 2009, analysts are predicting a slow recovery. Poe said she is motivated by a love for old homes. ""It's not flipping, so much as coming back and renovating and presenting it to the person who appreciates that,"" she said. ""It's not like coming and going 'Wham, bam, here's a house for you,' just jack up the price $100,000. ""The love affair with historic houses is still there. We're having to be realistic also."" The house is selling for $595,000, and Poe says she is willing to reduce the price if a potential buyer doesn't want the Prius. She just hopes the car gets them through the door, because a straight price cut apparently just doesn't cut it anymore.","Catherine Poe hopes the incentive of a Toyota Prius will draw buyers .

"Consumers left angry and confused after the botched Obamacare rollout now have something else to worry about: misleading letters from insurance companies. In Colorado, Kentucky and Washington, state insurance commissioners have come down on insurance companies for sending thousands of consumers letters that were either threatening, incorrect or omitted crucial information about the Affordable Care Act. The biggest offender: Humana, a Fortune 100 insurance company. Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark fined the Louisville-based company more than $65,000 after it sent more than 6,500 customers a letter Clark found ""misleading."" The August letter said that customers had to choose one of two options within 30 days: Either legally extend their current policy through next year or choose a new, more expensive policy that complies with Obamacare. The letter never mentioned buying insurance through the new exchange. And the 30-day window expired before the new state insurance exchange opened October 1, meaning that customers had to decide whether to take Humana's coverage before seeing what options would be available on the exchange. Obamacare fix could add millions in government costs . A 63-year-old retired man in Kentucky who received the letter said he felt like Humana had put a gun to his head. He either had to renew his current coverage through the end of 2014 for about $280 a month or see his monthly premium more than double, to about $620. ""What they were telling me was I had to accept their choice to continue with no protection from preexisting conditions, to basically take their choices and go ahead before I knew the other options that were available through the exchange,"" said the man, who asked for anonymity to share personal information and speak candidly about a politically charged issue. Clark called the letter ""high pressure. When you're told you gotta do something in 30 days and if you don't do it we're going to make the choice for you, that's disconcerting."" But the letter was more than troubling, it was also illegal. Clark said Humana broke the law when it included a form with the letter that had not gotten the required approval from her office. She said Humana officials worded the letter the way they did because ""they were interested in keeping those policyholders. Also, I think, again, it was a lack of understanding of Kentucky law."" In addition to the fine, Clark required Humana to send customers a correction with a full range of options that included buying insurance from the exchange, working with a broker or even keeping their current coverage until it expires. Clark said she fined the company a relatively low $10 per letter -- she could have gone as high as $1,000 per letter -- because she was trying to send a message. ""While that doesn't really seem like a very significant amount of money, that action the department took goes into a national database and it informs all the other states of a fine and an order that Kentucky took against Humana,"" she said. ""So that alerts all the other states that their could be some problems."" More questions swirl around Sebelius . And she worried that if she levied a bigger fine, Humana would just pass the cost along to their customers in the form of higher premiums. In Colorado, Humana sent a similar letter that received an rebuke from state Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar. That letter told 3,400 Humana policyholders in Colorado that they had to make a decision within 30 days or risk losing their coverage. And just like in Kentucky, the 30-day window ended before the state exchange opened. ""I was disappointed to see a letter that appeared threatening and incorrect going out to consumers. The last thing we need is more confusion,"" Salazar said of the letter. Her office required Humana to retract and resend the letter and to apologize to its policyholders. And in Missouri, the state insurance department is looking into whether similar Humana letters there broke any laws. ""The department is aware of written correspondence between Humana and policyholders and is looking into the matter,"" said Chris Cline, the department spokesman. Humana declined multiple interview requests, but in a statement said, ""Humana has been reaching out to our individual insurance policyholders to let them know of their full range of coverage options beginning January 1, 2014 (when the Affordable Care Act's new insurance laws become effective)."" Obamacare: Now what? But Humana is not the only company to come under fire. In Washington, LifeWise Health Plan drew the ire of regulators when it sent out a letter that made no mention of the state's healthcare exchange. In response to the misleading letter, the Washington insurance commissioner sent out a consumer alert to make sure people knew their options, said department spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis. LifeWise spokesman Eric Earling said the complexity of health insurance reform means that they are unable to communicate all the details in a single letter. ""The first goal is, you're a customer of ours, here's what your options are with us, as one would expect,"" he said. ""Our experience is our consumers are well aware there are other options for their business.""","Commissioners in 3 states have taken action against insurance companies .

"Why would you ever leave vacation days on the table? When it comes to taking enough time off from work to have a real vacation, workers in the United States and Asia Pacific countries still need work channeling their inner Griswold. Given about 15 vacation days in the past year, U.S. workers took 14 and left one day unused, according to Expedia.com's 2014 Vacation Deprivation study, released Thursday. That's actually better than last year's results, when U.S. workers used only 12 of their 14 allotted days. Workers blame their work schedules (19%), a desire to use the days in the following year (18%), finances (18%) and difficulty coordinating the time off (16%). The annual study of vacation habits of more than 7,800 employed adults across 24 countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America found significant differences in the ways residents of different countries handle their vacation time. Many residents of Asian countries are truly committed to work over vacation. They earned an average of 19 days off, and took only 14. Thai workers got a measly 11 vacation days but only took 10. But South Korean workers left more than half of their vacation days on the table, taking only 7 of 15 available days off in the past year. The United Arab Emirates was the outlier, with its workers earning and taking an average of 30 days off annually. Americans taking fewest vacation days in four decades . Europeans certainly have more opportunities to go on vacation, the survey shows. Europeans get 28 days per year on average, nearly double the vacation time of their holiday-deprived peers in North America and the Asia Pacific region. (Residents of Denmark, France, Germany, and Spain get 30 days, and they use them all. Lucky folks.) Having the most vacation days earned and used did not lead to a more peaceful state of mind, however. Those UAE workers with an entire month off?  Some 73% of UAE respondents report feeling ""very or somewhat vacation deprived,"" the highest percentage in the survey. Some 75% of workers in the United Kingdom reported feeling deprived because they don't get enough vacation (26 days). In contrast, only 38% of Mexican workers—with half the number of days off--reported feeling ""very or somewhat"" deprived. And they don't get a European-sized bundle of vacation: Mexicans received an average of about 15 days off but only took 12 days. This study was conducted on behalf of Expedia by Northstar, a global consulting firm.","Many U.S. and Asian workers don't use all their vacation days .

Even workers with a lot of vacation think they need more vacation ."
"Barcelona may have made the headlines for Lionel Messi's record breaking exploits over the course of the last week, but the Catalan club's arch rivals responded by making their own little piece of history Saturday. Real Madrid notched up a club record 16th consecutive victory in all competitions -- a run that stretches all the way back to the middle of September -- by overcoming a gallant Malaga 2-1 away from home despite having midfield-star Isco sent off late on. Karim Benzema stretched to tuck home Cristiano Ronaldo's cut-back after 18 minutes to put the reigning European champions on their way. Gareth Bale sealed the points late in the second half by racing clear of the Malaga defense and lofting the ball beyond Carlos Kameni. Isco was then sent for an early bath after earning a second booking for tripping up Samu Castillejo before Roque Santa Criz grabbed an injury-time consolation for Malaga with a looping header. The result stretches Real's lead atop of the La Liga table to five points, although Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia will be looking to reduce that deficit when they play tomorrow. All the focus after the game, however, was on the new club record. ""We have achieved a record that demonstrates the work we have been doing,"" said midfielder Marcello in comments carried by the Real Madrid website. ""But the goal we set ourselves is to win every game with humility, work and struggle."" Real will now look to extend the record when they face U.E. Cornella in the Copa Del Rey on Tuesday. In the day's early La Liga fixtures, Athletic Bilbao ran out 2-1 winners away to mid-table Getafe while Espanyol had too much for Levante, running out 2-1 winners. Bundesliga . Bayern Munich's seemingly unstoppable march to a third straight Bundesliga title continued apace Saturday with a 1-0 victory away to Hertha Berlin. Arjen Robben's first half goal was enough to stretch Pep Guardiola's men lead atop the table to 10 points, although that could be reduced back to seven if second place Wolfsburg overcome Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to third with a 5-1 hammering of FC Cologne while unfancied Augsburg rose to fourth by overcoming struggling giants Hamburg 3-1. Fifth placed Schalke made up for their humiliating midweek loss to Chelsea by defeating Mainz 4-1 in Gelsenkirchen. In what was perhaps the game of the day in Germany, though, Hoffenheim edged out Hannover 4-3 in a seven-goal thriller. Ligue 1 . Zlatan Ibrahimovic struck early on at the Parc de Princes to give Paris Saint Germain a narrow 1-0 win over mid-table Nice. The Swedish striker lashed home from the penalty spot after 15 minutes and despite coming under pressure in the second half the Parisians held on for the win. The hard-earned result means reigning French champions have closed the gap on league leaders Marseille to a single point. Elsewhere in France Saturday, Monaco's stuttering start to the season continued with a 2-0 loss away to fourth placed Rennes. Goals from Aymen Abdennour and Ola Toivanen were enough to ensure Leonardo Jardim's side couldn't follow up their impressive Champions League victory over Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the week. Further down the table Lens defeated Metz 2-0 while Caen and Montpellier drew 1-1.","Real Madrid set new club record of 16 consecutive victories .
