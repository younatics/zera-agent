"Carefully cradling her newborn to her chest, these heartwarming new photographs show a gorilla's sweet maternal side. Mary, who lives at the Busch Gardens wildlife park in Tampa, Florida, gave birth to a little girl on February 6 at 8:30pm. Images of the 27-year-old new mother capture her feeding her one-week-old daughter and admiringly looking at her in her arms. Scroll down for video . Heartwarming: Mary, who lives at the Busch Gardens wildlife park in Tampa, Florida, gave birth to a little girl on February 6 at 8:30pm . A video also sees her protectively carrying the infant around as it clutches the fur on her stomach. Jeff Andrews, vice president of zoological operations for Busch Gardens, explained that the first month will be the critical period as Mary and the infant begin to integrate into the current gorilla troop. A dedicated  animal care team will monitor their progress closely to ensure they settle in well. Mother gorillas spend a lot of time tending to their newborns, which are tiny compared to powerful adults and weigh just four pounds. The babies cling to their mother’s fur to keep warm and ride on their backs from the age of four months. They do this for almost three years when they are considerably larger. Stay back, I'm armed: Images of the 27-year-old new mother capture her feeding her one-week-old daughter and admiringly looking at her in her arms . The new baby gorilla at Busch Gardens is yet to be named. Her arrival marks the third successful gorilla birth at the zoo. Bolingo, the suspected sire, was the park’s first gorilla birth in 2005. The mother, Mary, came to Busch Gardens in February 2010 from Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, with her first daughter Pele, who just gave birth this past December to baby Enzi. There are now seven gorillas in Busch Gardens' troop. Guests will be able to see the recently expanded clan on the Myombe Reserve habitat over the coming days. The new addition is part of Busch Gardens’ participation in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP). Caught on camera: The new baby gorilla at Busch Gardens is yet to be named . The mission of the SSP is to cooperatively manage specific, and typically threatened or endangered, species populations such as lowland gorillas. The size of the wild gorilla’s population is unknown, but the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) believes that the Western lowland gorilla’s numbers have declined by more than 60 per cent over the last 20 to 25 years, leaving them critically endangered. As well as being threatened by human behaviour such as illegal hunting for their skins and meat and deforestation, female Western lowland gorillas do not produce many offspring. This is because they do not reach sexual maturity until the age of eight or nine and look after their dependent young for up to five years.","Mary, who lives at the Busch Gardens wildlife park in Tampa, Florida, gave birth to a little girl on February 6 at 8.30pm .

"When the Apple Watch was first envisioned, designers imagined a device packed full of sensors that could measure heart rate, stress levels, blood pressure and more. But a report now claims that, one-by-one, many of these sensors were dropped because they were unreliable or erratic. Sources told The Wall Street Journal that the watch even became dubbed 'black hole' internally because it continued to suck in resources for four years. According to reports, the Californian firm experimented with sensors for its Apple Watch (range pictured) that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but ‘these features didn’t perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin’ The report added that Apple also struggled to find a purpose for the watch after the sensors were ditched, and were left 'wrestling with why a consumer would need or want such a device.' Apple has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Apple is expected to launch the smartwatch in March with prices starting at $349, although a high-end 18-karat gold model could cost thousands of dollars. According to reports, Apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but 'these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin'. The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has previously been critical of smartwatches but in an interview with the BBC he has said the Apple Watch's display is 'like a little piece of art.' He believes people in 'hip, camp areas' will want it instantly, as will Apple's existing customers, meaning 'millions of people will buy this watch from the start and that helps get the critical mass going.' Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs during the 1970s, and was responsible for designing the Apple I computer. He left the company in 1987. He recently said that no company has yet been able to create a 'compelling' smartwatch, and he had been disappointed with early models of the technology. 'Like Apple did with smartphones, one company may point the right way to a smart and useful watch, but it shouldn't be a replacement for what the phone does,' continued Mr Wozniak. Other sensors, such as detecting blood pressure and oxygen, were inconsistent and too complex and would have needed regulator approval. However, Apple didn't remove all the sensors. On the back of the case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lens covers a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect heart rate. Apple Watch will use this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi‑Fi in a paired iPhone, to measure  physical movement. This will work with the Watch's Activity app that can set Move goals, track exercise and make sure the wearer doesn't sit down for too long. There will additionally be a Workout app to motivate wearers. Plus, developers will be able to create new apps with Apple's WatchKit. The more complex features may also be included in future models, said 'people familiar with the matter'. Apple has asked its Asian suppliers to make 5-6 million units of its three Apple Watch models for the first-quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Taiwan-based Quanta Computer Inc, the sole assembler of the Apple Watch, started mass production earlier this year to get ready for an April launch, the Journal said. Thousands will work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta's factory in Changshu, China, the newspaper reported, quoting one person. Analysts predicts sales of wearables will grow from 29 million in 2014 to 172 million in 2018, with a spike in 2015. CCS Insight's latest forecast believes the most popular devices will be smartwatches and fitness trackers. Ben Wood, CCS Insight's Chief of Research said: 'The Apple Watch will be instrumental in taking the wearables market to the next level of growth. If successful, it'll create a rising tide that will lift the whole market.' 'If the Apple Watch performs as well as expected, its halo effect will result in a sales bonanza in the second half of 2015, with record-breaking shipments in the important fourth quarter.' Last month, reports emerged that even without all these sensors, Apple's Watch will only last 19 hours on a full charge. The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch (pictured) was being worn. Other sensors, such as detecting blood pressure and oxygen, were inconsistent and too complex, and would have needed regulator approval. The report added that Apple also struggled to find a purpose for the watch . Apple didn't remove all the sensors. On the back of the case is a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect heart rate . Apple fan site 9to5Mac said: 'For the first time, people with knowledge of the Apple Watch's development have provided us with the specific performance targets Apple wants to achieve for the Apple Watch battery, but the actual numbers may fall short of those targets. 'According to our sources, Apple opted to use a relatively powerful processor and high-quality screen for the Apple Watch, both of which contribute to significant power drain.' It said Apple wanted the Watch to provide roughly 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use versus 19 hours of combined active/passive use, three days of standby time, or four days if left in a sleeping mode. But, the site's sources said Apple will only likely achieve approximately two to three days in either the standby or low-power modes. Last year, designers created an online demo of how apps may work on the Apple Watch. Created by Pipes, the interactive watch is modelled on official images released by Apple, and lets people see how their messages, emails and homescreen will look and work. The demo also shows how push notifications will appear, and lets users control music on the virtual watch. Apple Watch will use this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi‑Fi in a paired iPhone (pictured with boss Tim Cook), to measure physical movement. The more complex features may also be included in future models, said 'people familiar with the matter' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. In December, reports said Apple is 'finishing up' work on the watch's software and it could go on sale in March . So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' It was previously claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors. Unveiled on 9 September at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's first foray into wearables. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri is also built into the Apple Watch. Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its timepiece. Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches, and Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015.

"If recent rumours are to be believed, Apple is branching out into self-driving cars, search engines and now virtual reality. Another patent has been awarded to the Californian firm that details a head-mounted iPhone virtual display. It follows a similar patent awarded in December 2013, and a job listing posted in November advertising for an virtual reality engineer. The patent is called 'Head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display' and was filed in September 2008. Its description reads: 'The portable electronic may be physically coupled to the head-mounted device such that [it] can be worn on the user's head' Virtual reality is here: The Samsung Gear VR use a Note 3 tablet inside a $200 headset to provide the screen - and looks a lot like Apple's patent . The patent is called 'Head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display' and was filed in September 2008. Its description reads: 'The portable electronic may be physically coupled to the head-mounted device such that [it] can be worn on the user's head. 'Each device may be allowed to extend its features and/or services to the other device for the purpose of enhancing, increasing and/or eliminating redundant functions between the head-mounted device and the portable electronic device.' Following the release of Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the firm  achieved a record high for app downloads. According to Fiksu’s  App Store Competitive Index, downloads in October were up 42 per cent cpmpared to September. This was up 39 per cent year-on-year. More than 7.8 million downloads, across the top 200 free iOS apps, were recorded last month. Images in the patent show a head-mounted headset into which an iPhone can be placed and used as a display. One image in particular shows the device being controlled by a remote. The patent doesn't use the words 'virtual reality', but the headset's similarity to Samsung's Gear VR headset and Google's Cardboard headset suggests that the device would be used in a similar way. Apple's patent predates these announcements and subsequently has the potential to cause patent disputes with these companies. Hints that Apple was looking to expand into virtual reality appeared in December when it was awarded a patent simply called 'Head-mounted display.' The patent was filed in May 2007 and details a ‘goggle system for providing a personal media viewing experience to a user.’ Images in the patent show a head-mounted headset into which an iPhone can be placed and used as a display.

Apple's patent predates this announcement and subsequently has the potential to cause patent disputes with its rival . Apple explained that the goggle system may resemble ski or motorcycle goggles, and to ‘enhance the user's comfort, the goggle system may include breathable components’, including breathable foam that rests against the user's face. In November rumours surfaced again when the firm posted a job listing  for an engineer to create 'apps that integrate virtual reality systems.' It said: ‘We are looking for a software engineer to develop UI and applications to create next generation software experiences. If Apple is looking to expand into the virtual reality market, it would follow rivals Google, Samsung and Oculus Rift - despite filing its patent before these firms released their headsets. Google Cardboard (pictured) is made from cardboard folded to form an enclosure, in which a phone is then slotted in to act as a display . ‘This engineer will create high performance apps that integrate with virtual reality systems for prototyping and user testing.’ The candidate will work with the team in the firm’s Santa Clara Valley office. It is not known whether the firm is looking to develop hardware, as well as software, but an Apple headset would rival the likes of Oculus Rift and Samsung's Gear VR.

"The former teacher of a 19-year-old track star who killed herself because she could not deal with the pressures of college life is a step closer in his push for new  laws to help potentially suicidal students. Edward Modica, 64, who taught Madison Holleran  in the fifth grade, launched an online petition for change after his former student jumped to her death from a parking garage in January 2014. Madison, who was a popular and talented runner on the University of Pennsylvania's track team, had sought help for depression just weeks before her death in Spruce Street, Philadelphia. In his petition, launched last March, Mr Modica urged universities to take action to prevent other undergraduates from killing themselves to escape the 'pressures of college expectations'. Call for action: Edward Modica (right), 64, who taught Madison Holleran (left) in the fifth grade, launched an online petition for change after his former student jumped to her death from a parking garage last January . Tragic: Madison, who was a talented runner on the University of Pennsylvania's track team, had sought help for depression just weeks before her death in Spruce Street, Philadelphia. Above, Madison and mother Stacy . 'Rigorous demands': In his petition, launched last March, Mr Modica urged universities to take action to prevent other undergraduates from killing themselves to escape the 'pressures of college expectations' He proposed the Madison Holleran Law, which has two provisions. Firstly, that colleges be required to 'publicly list the number suicides and attempted suicides on their campuses annually'. Secondly, that colleges be ordered to have certified suicide prevention counselors 'to help potential victims, address their needs and allay their fears about the rigorous demands of college life.' The petition, which stated that the freshman's death 'left a void in the hearts of so many people across the United States', quickly spread online. A year on, it has gained nearly 8,500 signatures. And now, it is closer to influencing the passage of new state laws after Mr Modica, who taught Madison at Brookside School in Allendale, New Jersey, turned to a politically active friend. The retired teacher approached Pamela Philipp, who worked for many years in politics and helped push another law regarding fatal genetic diseases in children through the state legislature. He told her of Madison Holleran Law and the lives he believed it could save. Philipp offered to help, telling him that the proposal would likely be divided into two separate bills based on its provisions. Victim: He proposed the Madison Holleran Law, which has two provisions relating to how universities deal with potentially suicidal students. Above, Madison (left) with her father James and (right) smiling with a friend . School: Mr Modica taught Madison in the fifth grade at Brookside School (pictured) in Allendale, New Jersey . Final moments: The freshman posted this shot of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death . She then set up a meeting at the Wayne offices of Sen. Kevin O'Toole and Assemblyman Scott Rumana. The pair represent the 40th legislative district, including Madison's hometown of Allendale. O'Toole and Rumana's office told NJ.com that the bills are currently being drafted. Philipp believes that the second of the two bills - relating to on-site counselors - will be an easier sell. 'As long as something is passed in her honor to help other young adults then I'm pleased,' Mr Modica told the news site, adding that Madison's grief-stricken family support his efforts. According to the Suicide Prevention Center, about seven per cent of undergraduates in America seriously consider suicide as a way to escape their academic demands and other issues. 'It seems, unfortunately, that suicides have become a regular occurrence on campuses,' Mr Modica, who also taught Madison's two sisters, told the New York Daily News last year. 'This would allow parents to know what's going on and the parents could delve into those issues before school begins.' Madison's suicide last year rocked the UPenn community and sent shock waves through Allendale. Before her death, the teenager had told her parents she was seeing a therapist for depression. Embrace: James Holleran (center) is comforted by a mourner ahead of the funeral of his  daughter last year . Heartbreaking: Mourners, including Mr Holleran (center) leave a memorial mass for 19-year-old Madison . 'We knew she needed help,' her father, James Holleran, told the New York Post. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost confidence in academics and  in her track abilities.' Speaking through tears, he added: 'There was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn. She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and stress.' Although he and his wife Stacy had encouraged their daughter to stay home or transfer to a different college, the determined teen had insisted on staying at school, he said. On the day that Madison jumped to her death, her father texted her encouraging her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she would. Scene: Madison Holleran jumped to her death from this Spruce St, Philadelphia parking garage last January . But just hours later, she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family on top of the parking garage before she jumped. She finished the note: 'I love you all... I'm sorry, I love you.' Madison's family have launched a foundation in her name to help prevent suicides. This year, they are also awarding a scholarship to students at her high school, Northern Highlands, in her name.","Edward Modica began petition after Madison Holleran committed suicide .

"An eccentric Puerto Rican man known for his Green Lantern costume ended up wearing it even when he was dead, after being embalmed and dressed in the outfit to welcome guests to his own funeral. Renato Garcia, 55, had found the costume in a box next to be a bin in the city of San Juan, in the north-eastern Puerto Rico and was known for wearing it around his local area. When he died last week after suffering a severe asthma attack, his family decided it was appropriate that he was also buried in it. So after he was embalmed, his body was then propped up in the corner of the hall where the funeral took place under the instructions of his sister Milagros Garcia, 51, who said: 'It is what he would have wanted.' Scroll down for video . When Renato Garcia, 55, died last week his family decided that it would be appropriate if he was buried in a Green Lantern costume that he loved. He's pictured here in the outfit at his own funeral . Garcia had found the costume in a box next to be a bin in the city of San Juan . The Green Lantern was brought to the big screen in 2011, with Ryan Reynolds playing the superhero . She said that she remembered Renato had loved reading comic books as a boy and he was a great joker, and loved walking around town in his costume after he found it lying next to a rubbish bin. The man's corpse was not only upright but was surrounded by flowers as he stood in the suit complete with the Green Lantern power ring. She said: 'He did have really bad asthma and was regularly getting oxygen in the local hospital. He used to turn up there as well with his Green Lantern costume. 'When he died it was the thing everybody was talking about, and so we thought it was obviously so much a part of him that we decided to bury him with it.' She added: 'In keeping with the Puerto Rican tradition of embalming bodies for funerals, there was no point in burying him in the suit if nobody saw that he was wearing it, and therefore he was put on display in the funeral hall.' The Green Lantern was brought to the big screen in 2011, with Ryan Reynolds playing the superhero. Renato's is just the latest in a number of bizarre funerals in Puerto Rico. Last June, the body of a builder was taken to the funeral in the shovel of a bulldozer. Shortly before, a Puerto Rican octogenarian woman, Georgina Chervony, had a wake dressed in her wedding dress and sitting on her favourite rocking chair. Renato's is just the latest in a number of bizarre funerals in Puerto Rico . Even Renato's dog paid homage to the green-themed superhero . Then there was the boxer who had asked to be dressed in his boxing attire and placed on his feet in the corner of a boxing ring - and the 22-year-old man who wanted to have his wake held with him riding on the motorcycle he used to ride. Other cases have included the man who was embalmed and driven around town in one of the ambulances he owned and the man who asked to be dressed as Cuban guerrilla icon 'Che' Guevara, whom he had admired. These odd wakes are taken very seriously by the families of the deceased, who say they are attempting to pay tribute in a special way to their loved ones, although local authorities have been trying fruitlessly to find legal ways to prohibit them. Meanwhile, the practice, which is thought to have originated in Puerto Rico in 2008, seems to be spreading to the continental United States and last year The New York Times reported that similar wakes had been held in New Orleans and Ohio.","Renato Garcia, 55, wore a Green Lantern costume to his own funeral .

"A woman lies face down on a bed, blood stains are splattered up the white bathroom walls and furniture is strewn across the living room - but this isn't an episode of CSI. Behind the walls of this regular-looking four-bedroomed semi-detached house in Derby, East Midlands, is actually a training facility for the next generation of forensic investigators. Mocked up to look like any other house on a suburban street, the £410,000 provision has been purpose built at the University of Derby and comes complete with an array of mysteries. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: Student Sarah-Jane Smith analyses the mock murder scene after finding a 'body' face down on the bed at the forensic training facility at the University of Derby . The facility is purpose-built inside a former four-bedroom family home opposite the campus and comes with seven replica crime scenes, including a living room (pictured) Student are closely monitored via CCTV cameras by their tutors as they analyse clues scattered around what was previously a family home, close to the campus. Their task is to gather as much information from the scene as possible, without disturbing or contaminating vital evidence, that can be later used in a court trial. Senior tutor, Jon Wright, who previously worked for the Metropolitan Police, said the rules of forensics are ABC - 'Assume Nothing, Believe No One and Challenge Everything'. 'The first rule is safety. You must make sure that you're safe and it is safe to enter. The second rule is to make sure that it is secure by checking the entry and protecting any other exit,' he said. 'The ABC rules should be going through your head as well as the six Ws - who, what, where, when, why and how. 'A crime scene is not a sterile environment and you need to remember you can change the environment from the minute you walk in. 'As the first forensic scientist to examine the scene, you are seeing something that can never be repeated, and which you have to make the most of,' he said. A student takes a swab of blood from the 'murder weapon' in the bathroom at the training facility for forensic science undergraduates . The house also comes with a chemist shop in one room and students are advised to look for evidence that may be out of context, while trying to disturb any potential clues . The three-year course is more than just poking around a four-bedroom house in white overalls. As well as practical lessons in the laboratory and field, there are also more traditional theory-based lectures in areas including biology, chemistry and law. Students cover key forensic practices such as crime scene investigations, human tissue analysis and fingerprint analysis. Lessons in blood pattern analysis, firearms and fire investigation and how entomology and tissue decay can help the forensic scientist is also taught. The University of Derby offers its students the practical scenarios at its house (featured) and also a crime scene car, before presenting the findings in its mock courtroom. Not all students go on to work as crime scene investigators but the qualification opens up doors for those hoping to work in the criminal justice system, for local constabularies or for forensic science providers like Rolls Royce and AstraZeneca. Alternatively, people may choose to go on and work for law firms, private forensic laboratories or insurance companies. The emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology also opens opportunities for studying medicine. He continued: 'Every crime scene is different, so we set up the scenes to mimic ones we have seen in the past in our work or completely new ones and see how the students would handle it. 'It's a normal house so it's really flexible in how we set it up - there's also a small shop which we can adapt and distribute evidence.' Mr Wright said that the most important thing for any crime scene investigator is to be aware of their attention to detail. 'Everything is potential forensic evidence and while you are looking for things that are there, you must also be looking for things that aren't, which can be taken back to the lab and examined. 'Looking for things out of context, like a mark on the wall or an item that might be missing, it's those things that could be crucial.' All the trainees wear proper overalls and gloves so as not to contaminate any evidence, which is put in clear bags (left) and they also properly measure blood splatters to give them more clues on what happened . They are closely monitored by their tutors using CCTV, so that they can work on the scene independantly . He also said that students are looking for less obvious things such as a biro that could have fingerprints or a blank piece of paper that could bear an imprint. Mr Wright added: 'You only get one chance to do a crime scene so anything that could be potential evidence must be gathered.' Within the house, which was completed last month, are seven replica crime scenes - a bedroom, bathroom, office, shop, garage and living room, as well as a 'blood pattern analysis room'. Mr Wright added that the blood is actually sterile horse blood, which has the 'same appearance and reacts similarly to human blood'. Once the evidence has been gathered, students are then encouraged to present their findings in the on-campus mock 'courtroom', to further mimic the real-life procedure. They are given training in law, criminology and the criminal justice system, and the facility is also open to law and criminology students. Along with 180 undergraduates currently on the BSc Forensic Science course, the facility is also used by emergency service teams and Derbyshire Constabulary for staff training. Students previously shared a unit with the police but now they have their own purpose-built facility, which Mr Wright described as 'perhaps one of the best in the country'. One student, Sarah-Jane Smith, 34, joined the course after spending 10 years as a special needs teacher. 'I thought it sounded an interesting job, but when I came here on an Open Day, I found to my surprise that I just couldn't tear myself away from the forensic department stand. And here I am,' she told the paper. Television programmes like CSI and Silent Witness fuelled a surge in the number of people taking up a forensic science degree, research has previously found. The next generation of crime scene investigators undertake practical assessments at the crime scene . The facility cost £410,000 and was opened last month. It may look like a regular house from the outside but inside it is littered with potential evidence from a murder . Students are taught the ABC rules of forensics - 'Assume Nothing, Believe No One and Challenge Everything' Along with 180 undergraduates currently on the BSc Forensic Science course, the facility is also used by emergency service teams for staff training . A report in 2009 revealed that the number of universities offering the degree had risen from two in 1990 to 285. The report cited the TV detective programmes as the reason for the escalation in popularity. Dr. Ian Turner, head of forensic science, said: 'Having this resource onsite allows us to give our students the skills needed to develop a career in forensic science because they are learning in a real life context, with the same equipment and facilities used by professionals' 'The staff on the teaching team are also a major asset. The academics leading the project have nearly 30 years of commercial forensic experience between them in addition to their academic expertise, and can share their skills and knowledge with the students.' University of Derby Online Learning, which allows students from all over the world to gain a degree from home, has also used the facility to film a 360 degree virtual crime scene. Students can navigate the scene remotely, collecting and analysing evidence then write and prepare a statement of evidence for a court of law. Forensic science students at the University of Derby also have access to a forensic car, which is treated like a crime scene in a similar way .

"A personal trainer was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer after doctors mistook a lump on his right knee for a pulled muscle. Stuart Brookes has now been told he has just 18 months to live after the disease returned for a second time in  two years. He was first diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma - a rare soft tissue cancer - in November 2012. Despite initially being told the disease was completely curable, tests just months later revealed it had spread throughout his body. Now the 30-year-old is trying to raise £150,000 to travel to the US to take part in a potentially life-saving clinical trial. Stuart Brookes, pictured with his girlfriend Alina Ispavskaya,  was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of soft tissue cancer, metastatic myxoid liposarcoma in November 2012 . When Mr Brookes, pictured with Miss Ispavaskaya left, and his nephew William, right, first went to see a GP, complaining of a lump behind his right knee, the doctor mistook the tumour for a pulled muscle . With no cure available for him in the UK, Mr Brookes believes travelling to Washington state to receive a unique treatment could be his last hope. Patients at a hospital there are taking part in a trial where cancer patients are given a vaccine. The theory is the body will recognise the cancer as a disease and will fight it itself. Mr Brookes, who is originally from Birmingham but now lives in London, visited his GP in the summer of 2012 after finding a lump behind his right knee. 'It took a while for me to go to the doctors, as it didn't hurt,' Mr Brookes said. 'The doctor said I had pulled a muscle, but I wasn't convinced. 'I was in the process of moving down to London at the time, so it was another three months before my missus forced me to do something about it. 'In the end the lump was almost the size of my fist.' After visiting another GP in London, he was sent for an MRI scan and a biopsy at Kingston Hospital. The tests revealed the lump was cancerous and he was diagnosed with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma. It is a very rare form of sarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue - and affects the connective tissues. The disease usually presents as a painless slow-growing lump, and can often by misdiagnosed as a result. The tumours are usually confined to the extremities, particularly the thigh. 'I was told it was completely curable,' said Mr Brookes. 'It was a bit worrying as I was going into the unknown. Over the course of the next three months the lump continued to grow, until it reached the size of a fist. He returned to see another GP, this time in London after moving, and was referred for a biopsy and MRI scan. The tests revealed the lump was cancerous and Mr Brookes began treatment immediately . In March 2013, surgeons a the Royal Marsden Hospital, removed the lump. Mr Brookes also faced rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try and treat the cancer . 'But I was mainly concerned about how it would affect my leg, and my job as a personal trainer. 'To be honest, I was worried if there would be scar tissue, and whether I would be crippled afterwards.' Once he had received his diagnosis, Mr Brookes started a five-week course of radiotherapy. He then had surgery at the Royal Marsden Hospital to remove the tumour in March 2013. Surgeons cut through the back of his leg and lifted up parts of his hamstring to remove the tumour. He said: 'The operation went really well, they removed everything. I was able to do a lot of the rehabilitation myself.' For the next nine months Mr Brookes worked on his recovery, and underwent regular check ups to monitor the cancer with CT scans and to drain fluid from his leg. But it was then that he noticed lumps on his left leg and upper back. Mr Brookes has been diagnosed with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma. It is a very rare form of sarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue - and affects the connective tissues. It typically affects adults aged 40 to 60 years old. The disease usually presents as a painless slow-growing lump, and can often by misdiagnosed as a result. The tumours are usually confined to the extremities, particularly the thigh. The size of the tumour and where it is, affects a patient's prognosis, with tumours smaller than 10 to 15cm having a better survival rate. In around half of cases, the disease spreads to other parts of the body, commonly to the lungs. 'When I went back to my doctors they weren't very optimistic, and I could tell it wasn't going to be good news,' he said. 'They looked very worried.' Mr Brookes, who lives with girlfriend Alina and her 12-year-old son Max, was sent for more tests which revealed his cancer was back. An MRI scan showed the stage 4 cancer had spread to his hip, spine and pelvis, and doctors told him he had around 18 months to live. 'It felt as thought two or three people were trying to prepare me to die,' he said. 'One said, ""we can make you feel as good as we can for as long as possible"". 'My GP asked me what I wanted to do with my time. I didn't want to sit and make a bucket list. 'They didn't even give me any advice about diet - they told me I could eat whatever I wanted. Even for a healthy person, that isn't good advice. 'I didn't want to sit and dwell, I want to fight it, so I asked for a new team.' Mr Brookes, who loves football, surfing and running, was finding it difficult to walk due to the pain in his hip. With a new specialist team he started another, more intense round of radiotherapy, this time for two weeks. In the meantime he started doing his own research into clinical trials available both in France and in America, as well as changing to a special low-sugar diet to try and starve the cancer cells. He also started practising yoga and meditation to give him a positive and healthy mentality. 'I had been told that radiotherapy and chemotherapy wouldn't cure me,' said Mr Brookes. For nine months, Mr Brookes worked on his recovery. But he then noticed more lumps that had appeared on his left leg and upper back. Tests confirmed the cancer had returned. Doctors told him the disease had spread to his hip, spine and pelvis and gave him just 18 months to live . Determined not to give up, Mr Brookes, pictured with (from L to R) his mother Lesley, twin sister Sarah and nan Eileen, began to research clinical trials in the US . 'But I wanted to talk to someone detached from the medical profession, like a research professor. 'In the UK there are clinical trials available, but I had to have chemotherapy, and that is not something I want to put my body through.' Eventually he tracked down Robin Jones, a professor at the division of medical oncology at the University of Washington in Seattle, who explained to him the current trials being carried out in the US. But because Mr Brookes isn't a US citizen, if he wants to qualify for the trials he will have to pay for the treatment himself, at a cost of up to £150,000. 'It felt great to talk to him,' he said. 'He was the first person not to just pooh-pooh everything. 'He has since moved over to England, and we were able to sit down and talk it through. 'He told me about Dr Seth Pollack who is running a trial where you are given a vaccine, as though you had mumps or measles, and your body will recognise the cancer as a disease and will fight it itself.' Now friends and family are determined to get Mr Brookes over to America for the potentially life-saving trial, and they are on a fundraising mission to raise the money in the next few months. Friend Richard Burton has set up a website, and friends and even strangers have started to donate to the urgent cause. 'I guess my friends just haven't had enough of me yet,' added Mr Brookes. 'They may regret it when I'm well again. 'Friends who I haven't spoken to for years have got in touch and donated. There is not really a way I can thank them. 'It can often be more difficult for the people closest to me, than for me. 'But I am writing it all down in a blog at the moment, and maybe that could be one way to give back when I publish it.' Family and friends are now trying to raise more than £150,000 to fund Mr Brookes's trip to the US, to Washington State where he hopes to enrol on a clinical trial that is testing a new vaccine-like drug for cancer . Mr Brookes, who is a personal trainer, said: 'This is an opportunity without which, I don't really have any kind of hope' Mr Brookes hopes to travel out to the US at the end of the month for some holistic treatments, and to talk to Dr Pollock and hopefully put plans in place to start treatment. He said: 'They can't tell me whether the trial will work. 'But this is an opportunity without which, I don't really have any kind of hope.' Kayleigh Smith, who has known Stuart for 13 years, urged people to donate to his treatment. She said: 'Stu is just a great all round guy really. He can brighten up any situation with his unique sense of humour. 'He's always been willing to help out friends when they needed it. 'Despite going through treatments, Stu goes out of his way to help any of his friends, no matter what. 'During his time as a personal trainer he has helped so many people change their lives, so please help us return the favour.'

"Two fugitives - one of whom is actor Russel Crowe's former helicopter pilot - have finally been caught after years on the run when the yacht they stole in New Zealand was spotted off the coast of Australia by a sailing website who had been trying to find it for the owners. Sailing website Live Sail Die had been keeping an eye out for the stolen yacht 'Harlech'. After identifying it by taking photographs taken through a pair of binoculars, they alerted police. The two fugitives - one an unlicensed helicopter pilot who frequently flew Hollywood star Russell Crowe from Sydney to his outback Australian home - were arrested as they drifted into Broken Bay near Palm Beach, Sydney, on Monday night. Crowe's former helicopter pilot Paul James Bennett and partner Simone Anne Wright are accused of fraud, theft and sexual assault on a teenage girl. Simone Anne Wright and Paul James Bennett allegedly sailed a stolen yacht from New Zealand to Sydney . A member of sailing website Live Sail Die identified the stolen yacht by taking photographs taken through a pair of binoculars . Australian actor Russell Crowe employed Bennett as his helicopter pilot in 2000, but was not aware that Bennett did not even have a helicopter licence . The Daily Telegraph reported that the yacht was taken from the Bay of Islands in New Zealand two weeks ago. Bennett, 52, and Wright, 38, are in a long-term relationship, and are wanted in connection with an alleged AU$240,000 fraud of HeliPower, a Canterbury-based helicopter company. They are also wanted in connection of a suspected sex attack on a teenage girl in the late 2000s. Both were detained on the yacht at 9.30pm on Monday night and are assisting police with their enquiries. 'I am extremely pleased with the efforts of our enthusiastic followers which assisted greatly with the capture of two wanted fugitives who stole the yacht Harlech,' Live Sail Die CEO Suellen Hurling said in a statement. 'When the news came about that the boat had been stolen, LSD team member Darren McManaway was assigned the role to manage the updates and communications and to ensure that we kept the momentum going so that the story wasn’t forgotten, or lost in a sea of updates. 'Darren, who also works as a commercial skipper, was tipped off on Monday evening February 17 from one of our young Kiwi readers Felix Fielding, with details that he believed he had spotted the yacht in Sydney. 'Communications between the two, including photos taken through a pair of binoculars, confirmed that the yacht he could see was in fact the stolen boat. The owners were ecstatic with the find.' A reported fantasist who once told a court in Britain in the early 1990s that he had been kidnapped while working as a helicopter pilot for the CIA in South Africa, Bennett's work with Russell Crowe was all too real for the Oscar-winning actor. The two fugitives were arrested on board the stolen yacht at Broken Bay near Palm Beach, Sydney, on Monday night . Crowe has told police that he hired Bennett after the New Zealander landed a helicopter unannounced on his farm in northern New South Wales in 2000 and asked for a job. The actor was not aware that Bennett did not even have a helicopter licence, but agreed that the New Zealander could fly him to and from Sydney.

Police in Sydney had fraud charges listed against Bennett in 2003 as a result of his work as a pilot for Russell Crowe but he disappeared and the case never came to court. Three years earlier, he touched down on Crowe's 240-hectare property at Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, and impressed the actor with his 'cheek' so much that he was hired to fly Crowe around. But Bennett was eventually dismissed after he turned a Christmas party organised by Crowe into a media circus after leaking a rumour that the actor planned to wed movie star Meg Ryan. He also used a photograph of him and Crowe in a chopper cabin to obtain loans from companies.

"Sporting sunglasses and summer dresses, Britons flocked to the beach to bask in the first signs of spring sunshine as temperatures hit 11C in parts of the UK today. Elsewhere, volunteers and excited schoolchildren on half-term holiday made the most of the mild weather by taking part in Pancake Day races to mark the start of Lent. Meanwhile, spring flowers are blooming early as a result of the warmer, less wet winter, with fields of snowdrops in Shaftesbury, Dorset, attracting crowds of visitors. Basking in Brighton: Sun-seekers made the most of the first signs of spring sunshine on the seafront today .

Half-term fun: Six-year-old Genevieve Leishman squeals with delight as she runs across the sand on Great Yarmouth beach, Norfolk (left) and another young girl dips her toes into the shallows at Herne Bay, Kent . Clear skies brought a bright and crisp start to the day in southern and eastern areas of England - with a similar start expected for many tomorrow. The warm front meant temperatures hovered between 8C and 9C for much of southern England. A high of 11.1C was recorded in Plymouth, Devon, while Exeter reached 10.7C. In Brighton, where temperatures reached a high of 8.8C today, sun-seekers were pictured on the shorefront as they enjoyed the warm weather. Similar temperatures are expected for the seaside town tomorrow, but those hoping for another day of blue skies may be left disappointed as forecasters expect clouds to gather over the course of the day. Meanwhile, one brave six-year-old schoolgirl squealed with delight as she ran across the sand at Great Yarmouth Beach, Norfolk, where temperatures hit 8.3C. The warmer weather in London brought out the first ice creams of the year. In St James's Park, temperatures reached 9.8C.

Crisp: A family walks towards Wells Cathedral, Somerset, which saw clear blue skies for most of the day . Tomorrow morning, clear skies overnight will mean plenty of morning sunshine for southern and eastern England, which will continue to see the best of the weather for much of the day. However, the conditions are also likely to bring patches of frost. Further north, cloud will start to thicken and move further south into the Midlands - pushing the warm front further south. Clouds will start to thicken in Wales, north west England, Northern Ireland and north west Scotland and parts of the north will be very blustery - particularly to the east of the Pennines and eastern Scotland. Beautiful: Beach-goers enjoyed a sunny day at Porthcurno, Cornwall, with some dipping their toes in the sea .

Morning sunshine: A group of cyclists heads out on one of the many picturesque routes through Cambridge . Despite the cloudy conditions, there will be little rain, with outbreaks expected to remain confined to west Scotland. More areas of the UK will see temperatures reaching double figures tomorrow. The warmest weather is expected in Scotland tomorrow, with forecasters predicting highs between 14C and 15C in the north east of the country - very mild for this time of the year. On Wednesday night into Thursday, the wet weather will push into southern England, leaving brighter weather in Scotland and Northern Ireland. But there will be some snow on hills and feel a little colder. Tradition: The ball breaks from the hug during the annual Shrovetide football match in Ashbourne, Derbyshire . Popular: Crowds gather as the annual Atherstone Ball Game gets underway in Atherstone, Warwckshire . Historic: Shrovetide football has been played in Alnwick, Northumberland, pictured, for at least 250 years . On Friday the weather will be greyer and wetter for much of the UK, but sunnier weather is expected to return in time for the weekend. The warmer weather over winter has meant spring flowers are blooming earlier than usual, according to the National Trust. Gardeners and volunteers recorded blooms at National Trust properties across the South West, where spring tends to arrive earliest. They counted 1,345 flowers at 18 gardens in Devon and Cornwall, compared with 1,205 in 2014 – but still far below the record of 3,335 in 2008.

Pancake Day race: Schoolchildren compete at an event in Olney, Buckinghamshire to mark the start of Lent . Camellias have been in bloom in Cornwall since November and the warm weather last week has boosted snowdrops and aconites, the Trust said. In Shaftesbury, Dorset, private estates have opened their grounds to visitors as part of the Snowdrop Festival. Meanwhile, in Olney, Buckinghamshire, schoolchildren and charity fundraisers took part in a pancake race which has been run in the town since 1445 to mark the start of Lent. Races were also held in Windsor, Berkshire, Leeds and outside the Houses of Parliament, in London. Elsewhere in the country another traditional event was taking place to mark the start of Lent: Shrovetide football.

Close: Competitors take part in the annual pancake race through the streets of Olney, Buckinghamshire . Distinguished by its blood and thunder tackles, mud slides and an enjoyable lack of rules, the game has been held in Alnwick, Northumberland for at least 250 years. The goals, known as hales, are 440 yards apart and a lack of an offside rule meant there was no debate about players interfering with play. The pitch, dotted with molehills and reeds, did not lend itself to skilful dribbling, yet there was excitement a-plenty with hearty challenges flying in from players of both sexes and all ages. Final flip: BBC journalist Ben Wright, right, and Sir David Amess, left, cross the finish line in a fundraiser race organised by the Rehab disability charity to support the its work with disabled people in London . Fancy dress: A young boy in Ripon, North Yorkshire (left) and a woman in costume in Windsor, Berkshire . Taking a tumble: One young woman falls while taking part in a pancake race near Brick Lane in east London . Rival parishes St Paul's and St Michael's took each other on, with the latter side winning 2-0. That may have had something to do with them having more than double the number of players. The game only lasts a maximum of two goals, and umpire David Jackson blew his trumpet to signal the second hale. After competitors deemed to have played well were handed a shiny £2 coin and the winning goalscorer a crisp £20 note, the ball was hoofed into the adjacent River Aln. Whoever dives in and carries it out on the other side is allowed to keep the ball. Around 500 people cheered on the teams, whose numbers were boosted by a number of visiting American students.","Bright and sunny across much of southern and eastern England today .

The language you use on the social media site Twitter can provide an insight into your personality . According to a survey of 1,000 twitter users, around 72 per cent had one of these hidden personas. A third of those who took part were found to have a passionate persona while 26 per cent were materialistic and 16 per cent were subconsciously egotistic. Researchers have analysed exactly what makes a tweet get attention. Cornell researchers say a combination of language, positive and negative words and even asking people to retweet help. They say the results of the study, which was partly funded by Google, could not only improve your twitter performance, but also improve your chances in business meetings. The researchers found nine key features most likely to generate retweets: . Dr Sandra Scott, a psychiatrist who has advised on Big Brother and I'm a Celebrity, developed the tool for red wine firm Apothic Wine. She said: 'Most of us have some aspect of ourselves which we are not fully aware of, a sort of ‘hidden persona’.

'It’s worth noting that just because we are not fully aware of this aspect of ourselves does not necessarily mean that it is something to shy away from. 'Our 'hidden personas' can sometimes make us appreciate ourselves more and reveal qualities that we like.' The test has also shown that Glasgow is home to the most egotistical people - 27 per cent, while Edinburgh has the most passionate Twitter users - 42 per cent. Cardiff was found to be the least passionate and Brighton was the most materialistic.

"A father-of-two ordered enough ricin to 'kill hundreds' from an undercover FBI agent on the 'dark net' it is alleged. Mohammed Ammer Ali, 31, asked for the chemical to be delivered to his family home hidden in a toy car. Ali was said to have then searched the internet looking for local pet shops selling rabbits and chinchillas on which he could test the deadly poison. Hidden: Enough ricin to 'kill hundreds' was concealed in a toy car . He was arrested in an anti-terror raid at his home in Liverpool last week, accused of paying $500 (£325) for 500mg of ricin. Ali told the FBI agent, posing as a seller, that he would be a 'good repeat customer' and would 'need 500mg each month, for the next few months', according to investigators. He is said to have asked if the ricin would be packaged in 'Breaking Bad style' phials – referring to the hit US drama. Terror police, who raided his top-floor flat above a restaurant, also allegedly found a 'to-do list' saved on his computer which said 'pay ricin man' and 'get pet to murder'. The married IT worker appeared at a London court yesterday charged with attempting to obtain a chemical weapon. Speaking at the hearing in Westminster Magistrates' Court, prosecutor Mark Dawson said of the amount of ricin ordered: 'Whether inhaled or injected, the chemical would easily be enough to scientifically kill hundreds of people. 'He believed he was purchasing five fatal doses.' The poison is 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide. Ali was caught in an FBI sting, with the help of British counter-terrorism police, after he allegedly accessed online marketplaces in the so-called 'dark net' – the hard-to-access parts of the internet used by those engaging in criminal activity. According to investigators, the father had initiated contact with the 'seller' on January 11 asking for ricin to be sent to the UK. In court: Mohammed Ammer Ali, 31, of Liverpool, arrived in London and is accused of trying to buy $500 of ricin from a website in the United States using internet currency Bitcoins . When he was given the prices which the FBI said was $200 (£130) per lethal dose, the buyer, which the prosecutor says is Ali, replied: 'Could you do it a little cheaper if I bought more?' Before adding: 'How would one test if it is actually ricin, other than the obvious of course :)' Ali then allegedly asked for 500mg for $500 which needed to be split into 'multiple dosages' and would be 'used indoors'. 'I will be a very good repeat customer if you can make this possible and im (sic) happy with the results,' he added, according to a transcript. After the agent, who described his product as 'some really nasty sh*t', suggested Ali use a rodent to test a small amount of the ricin on, he allegedly replied: 'I like the rodent test … thanks for that.' Appearance: Ali, wearing a blue jumper and blue trousers in court, spoke in a strong Liverpudlian accent  to confirm his name and address. He did not enter plea/ . He is said to have revealed very little about his alleged targets but inquired about whether or not the ricin would still work if mixed in water or food. Excited about receiving the toxic chemical in tiny battery sized 100mg phials, he allegedly wrote to the undercover agent asking: 'Are we talking Breaking Bad style? Let's make this happen.' He is accused of buying the ricin in February using online currency Bitcoin. Ali, who has two children aged four and six, then allegedly arranged for it to be delivered to his home address in the name 'Dylan Harvey'. The FBI had concealed the five phials containing a harmless powder in the battery compartment of the yellow remote control car. Ali's wife, who is originally from Pakistan, is said to have accepted the delivery on February 10 before armed officers arrested him the following morning during raids of five properties in Liverpool – including his home, former home and a local IT firm. No pleas were taken during the hearing in London. Ali was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on March 13. Police have stressed officers have currently uncovered no plan or threat of an imminent attack.

"Ed Balls claimed £1,610 for cleaners without providing any receipts . Ed Balls and a string of Labour frontbenchers claimed expenses for cleaning and other odd jobs without submitting receipts, it has emerged. Mr Balls claimed £1,610 for cleaners and his wife Yvette Cooper claimed £2,640 for housework and gardening, out of a total of £37,881 claimed by 12 Labour MPs. But the shadow chancellor did not submit a single receipt for the work done – despite telling families they had a duty to record the personal details of gardeners, cleaners and handymen, no matter how small the job done. It also emerged that Mr Balls and his wife Yvette Cooper have never asked their window cleaner in Castleford, West Yorkshire, for a receipt despite employing him for nearly two decades. Pontefract Window Cleaning Services last night confirmed it had never been asked for a receipt by Mr Balls. The firm cleans the windows at the three-storey Balls family home once a month, charging £12 each time. Bur a spokesman for Mr Balls insisted his practice of demanding receipts applied only to jobs where he pays in cash. He pointed out that Mr Balls pays his window cleaner by cheque and receives handwritten invoices every few months. He also defended the cleaning claims. He said: 'Ed's cleaner was and continues to be employed on PAYE and paid by bank transfer. These claims were made fully in accordance with the Fees Office rules.' On Sunday Mr Balls said even someone who 'cuts your hedge for a tenner' should provide an invoice to discourage tax avoidance. Mr Balls said he had the 'name and address and a receipt' for every cash transaction because it was 'the right thing to do'. David Cameron this morning said he wanted Mr Balls 'to have more time to clean his own windows and cut his own hedge' – by defeating Labour at the next election. Yesterday he insisted that it was fine to pay for goods and services without asking for a receipt – because the onus was on the tradesman to pay his or her taxes. Mr Cameron said he had occasionally paid things in cash without getting a receipt, but insisted that he has never helped someone 'evade the taxes that they should pay'. John Durning (right) from Castleford, West Yorkshire, cleans Mr Balls's windows at his home in Castleford, West Yorkshire . A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The onus is on the trader who is responsible for paying the taxes that they owe.' Mr Cameron's intervention came after Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'. The Tories said Labour's suggestion that families should always get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs revealed a 'complete lack of understanding' about business. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'absurd'. He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do. 'But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.' Charlotte Leslie promised to hand back cash from a businessman accused of tax-avoidance . Conservative Party high command was accused of intervening to stop a Tory MP handing back a donation from a businessman accused of tax avoidance. Charlotte Leslie pledged on Monday to return £5,000 given by Hugh Sloane, the multimillionaire co-founder of an investment management company, Sloane Robinson. A tribunal had ruled that the firm had operated a tax avoidance scheme. The MP for Bristol North West originally told The Times: 'Nobody wants to take money that's not whiter than white.' But just hours later, she retracted the promise. A party source said: 'Charlotte realised she had made a mistake. She realised she had to change her position.' Last night a Labour MP wrote to Miss Leslie to ask her whether she had been pressurised into the U-turn following arm-twisting from Tory Central Office. Phil Wilson pointed out that Mr Sloane and his business associate had given the Conservative Party as a whole almost £1million. If Miss Leslie had handed her donation back, it would have put pressure on the whole party to do the same. The issue highlights the thorny issue of political donations. Labour say the Tories are too dependent on 'dodgy' financiers for funding, while the Conservatives say Labour are in hock to the unions. Miss Leslie received the personal donation from Mr Sloane in December. His company, Sloane Robinson, was ordered to pay £13million in unpaid tax and national insurance contributions to HM Revenue and Customs in 2012 after a tribunal ruled against a tax scheme it had since 2004. The Crown argued that the share scheme was 'nothing more than the mechanism for the delivery of bonuses' of £24million to Mr Sloane; George Robinson, the company's co-founder; and two other directors. The tribunal presiding on the case concluded that the structures under investigation were 'merely money-box companies serving an essentially mechanical purpose.' Mr Sloane has also given donations of £10,000 each to Angie Bray, the Tory MP for Ealing Central and Action; and Nicola Blackwood, Tory MP for Oxford West and Abingdon. The pair, who are both defending marginal seats, do not intend to return the money.","Labour shadow chancellor claimed £1,610 for cleaners without receipts .

"Jack White has spoken out following widespread criticism over the recently revealed concert rider that appears to show the guitarist's extreme dislike for bananas and love of guacamole. The former White Stripes front man's contends that not only was that guacamole recipe on the list of demands not his own, but someone in his band can't have bananas around due to an allergy. An exasperated White took to his website to clear up the matter once and for all with a letter he posted Sunday explaining the very particular demands. No diva: Jack White's (above) backstage demands for a performance at the University of Oklahoma were published by the student newspaper but on Sunday the musician tried to explain the controversy away . As for the bananas ban: 'did it occur to anyone someone on the tour might have an allergy to them?' asks White . 'First off, this is none of your business, but i have no specific demands in my dressing room. i know i could ask for lots of things but i actually don't ask for ANYTHING,' he writes. White says the guacamole recipe is an 'inside joke' between his tour manager and the local promoters to see 'who can make it the best.' He says the recipe could never be his because he 'can’t even make kool aid let alone cook any real food.' As for the banana ban, 'did it occur to anyone someone on the tour might have an allergy to them?' demands White. 'I know it’s a fun thing for people to try to turn me into a jerk and a diva, but in this case it’s pretty ridiculous,' he writes. The 'drama,' as White calls it, began when the much admired American musician made an appearance at University of Oklahoma this week and, after getting their hands on his contract for the evening, the  student newspaper decided to let the world know all of White's backstage demands. It turns out however, that White may be one of the easiest stars ever when it comes to demands, asking for little and even skipping out on alcohol all together, but stressing one thing above all - that his homemade guacamole recipe is made just how he likes it. That and that there be no bananas anywhere in the building. The artist (seen above at the Oklahoma performance) asked for very little, and no alcohol, but did demand his guacamole be made just how he likes it and wrote out the recipe . White's amazing guacamole recipe from his rider . The Oklahoma Daily seemed less interested in then guacamole than in White was being paid that evening though, writing; 'White in the contract is guaranteed $80,000 versus the right to receive 90 percent of the amount earned from ticket sales, which have a net potential of a little over $147,000.' They did however attach the contract, which breaks down how White's guacamole is made. It starts with 8 'large, ripe Haas avocados' which are cut in chunks and combined with four 'vine-ripened tomatoes' diced, half of a chopped yellow onion, a bunch of chopped cilantro, four Serrano peppers that are both 'de-veined and chopped' and some salt and pepper to taste. This then gets gently mixed, so as not to mush up the avocados, and then covered with the avocado pits and the juice of half of a lime so the mixture does not brown. White suggests that it be made early, but not too early, and tossed in the refrigerator. The rider also states this is a 'no banana tour,' and then adds; 'We don't want to see bananas anywhere in the building.' Speaking of White, he was none too happy to have his rider go public, and a member of his team let it be known in a letter on his website. It said: 'The most important function of a rider is that it lays out optimal technical specifications to ensure the audience has the best experience possible. For that, Jack hires a team of very qualified touring professionals who write the rider and attempt to execute a professional and pleasant experience for all involved.' The letter the said; 'Part of that is making sure that the tour personnel of about 30 people plus the local venue staff are fed. Contrary to what some believe, Jack doesn’t write the rider nor make demands about his favorite snacks that must be in his dressing room.' Most importantly however, this letter makes one thing clear above all else. 'We recommend you try Lalo’s guacamole recipe,' says the author. 'It’s delicious.'","Jack White's backstage demands for a performance at the University of Oklahoma were published by the student newspaper .

"Craig Stockham, 33, was jailed for 16 months after stealing £30,000 in just nine months from two non-profit leisure companies in Warrington, Cheshire . A finance boss has been jailed after stealing £30,000 in nine months to feed his £150-a-day cocaine habit. Craig Stockham earned £52,000 a year as director of two non-profit council leisure companies in Warrington, Cheshire, and was in charge of managing budgets and making payments. But the 33-year-old, from Flintshire, North Wales, was suspended on his last day of work after checks revealed irregularities in payments he had authorised. An earlier court hearing was told he stole thousands  from LiveWire and Culture Warrington between January and November last year before using it to fund his cocaine habit. He was able to disguise their true destination by creating fake invoice templates and using the names of legitimate companies to mask his deceit. Stockham had been working at the organisations since May 2012 and was later promoted to financial director in April 2014, a court heard. Alarm bells were raised when one of his colleagues carried out some checks after spotting a payment of £600 to Thompson FM in Flintshire on November 7. The company was not based in Flintshire and further investigations revealed that the sort code and account number matched those of Stockham's personal account. The police were alerted and he was arrested on November 12 where he was frank about his catalogue of stealing. Prosecuting at Warrington Crown Court, Paulinus Barnes, said: 'He admitted the theft straight away and said his offending had spiralled out of control due to his £150 a day coke habit.' Stockham, who pleaded guilty to the charges on December 30 at Halton Magistrates Court, also stated that he did not know how much he had taken, but was later revealed to be £29,169. In a victim impact statement, managing director, Jan Souness described Stockham as a once charismatic and popular member of staff but this changed in 2014. Stockham - who was one of the company's highest-paid earners - started to act erratic, his appearance became dishevelled and his work became disorganised, a court was told. This gave senior leaders no option other than to ask Stockham to leave the company on November 6 along with a severance payout of £18,000. But the next day his stealing spree was uncovered. Stockham (left) authorised fake invoices with the names of legitimate companies and used the money to fund his £150-a-day cocaine habit (file picture, right) Defending, Michael Davies, said he was remorseful for his actions and that he has offered to immediately pay back £10,000 after his parents agreed to loan him the money. But no order was made for Stockham to repay the money in full. The court also heard how Stockham had managed to secure a £200-a-week job selling credit cards following his arrest. His current employer, Matthew Stewart, said he had been 'open and honest about his offences'. He added that if he could continue with the company he was likely to see his earnings increase considerably. His previous boss, Gary Ferguson, also described his actions as 'out of character'. Sentencing at Warrington Crown Court yesterday, Recorder Paul O'Brien said his actions were a clear 'breach of trust' which only an immediate custodial sentence would suffice, and sentenced him to 16 months in prison. But he added: 'It is clear that you have demonstrated some remorse and offered to pay recompense.' Stockham, who was dressed smartly in a suit, hung his head in shame throughout the proceedings before he was led down to the cells to start his sentence. Stockham admitted theft at at an earlier hearing and he was sent to Warrington Crown Court (pictured) yesterday. A judge handed him a 16 month jail term but no order was made for him to pay the money back . Managing director of LiveWire and Culture Warrington Jan Souness said the 16 month sentence reflects the seriousness of his offence. It also takes into account the personal impact it has had on both the board members and staff working in LiveWire and Culture Warrington to provide services for the people of the town. She said: 'The team and I were devastated when his actions first came to light, however, we worked resiliently with our board, our bank, insurers and external auditors in order to gain full clarity of the situation. 'Thankfully this work revealed that our procedures and in-house processes are robust and that it was this, along with staff vigilance that led to the discovery of these issues in a timely manner. 'I can also confirm that we are insured against the theft that has occurred. 'We are a strong team and we have come together in managing this difficult situation, but it has been hard to come to terms with the discovery of the actions from of one of our most senior managers who was working in a job that required the highest level of integrity and trust. 'Both companies have continued to perform well during this difficult time with members and customers numbers increasing. 'We will of course continue to be diligent in terms of how we operate and at the same time look forward to the future with exciting projects on the way.'","Craig Stockham was director of two non-profit council leisure companies .

"A teacher at an Iowa elementary school allegedly drank alcohol at school last week and had cans of beer stashed in her own classroom - prompting police to  arrest her. Teacher: Kindergarten teacher Jennifer Rich resigned from her position after she allegedly drank alcohol at school . Kindergarten teacher Jennifer L. Rich was arrested Friday at East Elementary School in Ankeny, Iowa, the Ankeny Police Department said in a Monday news release. 'On Friday, Feb. 13, 2015, Ankeny police officers were called to East Elementary School, 710 SE 3rd St. at 2 p.m. on a report that a kindergarten teacher was observed with a can of beer in her classroom,' the release said. Authorities said that the 40-year-old West Des Moines resident took a preliminary breath test - and her result came back positive, leading to her arrest. Rich has been charged with public intoxication and child endangerment. The Ankeny Police Department also revealed that 'Police officers located a leather carry bag in her classroom with two empty cans of beer and four additional full cans of beer.' Rich had bloodshot and watery eyes as she spoke to police, according to the release. 'The event was reported to police by a concerned parent who was in the school to assist with a Valentine's Day party,' the release said. Ankeny police said that Rich is not being held in custody by authorities. WHO-TV reported that Rich resigned Monday, after she was placed on administrative leave Friday. Ankeny Schools Chief Human Resources Officer Jenifer Owenson told the NBC affiliate 'After the teacher was brought to the police station and we were made aware of that, we put her on administrative leave.' Owenson told the television station 'We are not aware that any students were put in any kind of unsafe situation or that really students had questions at all. 'Our principal did take this weekend and call every parent at East to assure them that their student had been safe at all times.' KCCI reported that Rich's resignation was accepted unanimously by the school board Monday night. The television station quoted Principal Julianne Taylor as telling parents at the event 'We thoroughly investigate any report that raises a concern about the conduct of a staff member. Our students are our first priority.' Per KCCI, Taylor also said at the meeting that a substitute has been found. Authorities continue to investigate, according to the CBS affiliate.

"Official data found full-time women earned more than their male colleagues in their 20s and early 30s . WOMEN now earn more than men until they turn 35, when the tables are turned, new figures show. Official data found full-time women earned more than their male colleagues in their 20s and early 30s. But at the age of 35, the trend is reversed and men then earn more money for the rest of their working life. The gender pay gap then widens in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, according to the Office for National Statistics. Experts said women were often punished for having children by finding themselves locked out of promotions and pay rises, despite returning full-time and to the same role. At the age of 30, UK women working full-time earn 81p an hour more than men on average. By 34, this has narrowed to 58p more, but just a year later, men are out-earning women by 9p an hour. By the time they reach 40, the average man is earning a shocking £1.64 an hour more. It is the first time the figures have been broken down year by year to show the exact age at which the gender pay gap switches. Ann Francke, of the Chartered Management Institute, said employers were still guilty of ‘unconscious bias’ and women were still overlooked for pay rises, bonuses and promotions. She added that companies were still dismissing mothers who returned to work as somehow less ambitious or capable, saying: ‘Employers must not assume that because someone has had a baby, they cannot be given a challenging role. ‘Companies should be flexible but also make sure that women are given the responsibility and a role where they can get results.’ The CMI said women over 40 are paid 35 per cent less than their male colleagues for doing the same role. Ms Francke said: ‘In the managerial sector, the gender pay gap appears between the age of 35 and 40 as women just slide off the pay scale. ‘Women generally perform better at school and are more likely to go to university, then out-earn men at the start of their careers. But at the age of 35, the trend is reversed and men then earn more money for the rest of their working life . ‘But as their careers progress, their pay begins to falter.’ She said male executives had a responsibility to try to close the gender pay gap, including tracking any differentials in pay among their own workers. Frances O’Grady, of the Trades Union Congress, also called for more to be done to tackle the gender pay gap. She said: ‘We all expect our wages to increase as our careers progress. ‘But women's wages start to stagnate as early as their mid-30s when many have young children to look after. ‘If we want to end this motherhood pay penalty, employers need to offer women more options for flexible working. ‘And we need to ensure that dads play a bigger role after their child is born by increasing paternity pay and introducing some father-only leave. ‘International evidence shows that mothers’ annual earnings increase if their partner takes longer parental leave.’ A new law was introduced last month which allows men to share up to 50 weeks of parental leave with their partners if their child is born or adopted after March 31 this year. It means that instead of taking just two weeks’ of statutory paternity leave, fathers can now take up to a year off to care for their newborn baby. Labour has also announced it would increase paid leave for new fathers from two to four weeks, as well as putting up statutory paternity pay by more than £120, to £260 a week. However, this plan has been attacked by small businesses who claim many firms would struggle to shoulder the extra expense. Minister for Women and Equalities Nicky Morgan said: ‘I am delighted that the gender pay gap is at its lowest ever level, and that for women under 40 in full time work it has disappeared. ‘However there is more to be done and we still need to get more women into the best-paid sectors. ‘To tackle the remaining gender pay gap for women over 40, we are working to remove the barriers that stop women entering senior leadership roles and supporting those women who wish to, to combine work with family life. ‘This includes introducing shared parental leave, extending the right to flexible working, and introducing tax-free childcare – which will benefit almost 2 million working families.’","Full-time women earn more than male colleagues in 20s and early 30s .

"NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been ordered to stay away from his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll, who he claimed was an 'assassin', after he allegedly grabbed her by the face and throat and slammed her head into the wall three times. Busch will not be allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition, must undergo evaluation for 'mental health problems related to anger control', and must stay 100 yards away from Driscoll - with the exception of NASCAR races and related events - for one year. A Delaware judge passed down the no-contact order on Monday after four days of testimony in December and January that featured a number headline-grabbing claims. Scroll down for video . NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been ordered to stay away from his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll, who he claimed was an 'assassin', after he allegedly  slammed her head into the wall three times . Busch and Driscoll attend court in December. For the length of a year, Busch will not be allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition and must stay 100 yards away from Driscoll . Driscoll,  37, testified that she and her son went to Busch's motorhome at the Dover International Speedway the night of the assault after receiving a slew of worrying texts from the racecar driver that seemed to indicate he was depressed. In one text, Driscoll said Busch, 36, told her that he was lying on the floor and crying, unsure 'which way was up'. In another he said he didn't 'love anything right now'. The couple had broken up a week before the alleged assault in September following a fight after one of Busch's races. Driscoll said after she entered the home, her ex-boyfriend accused her of 'having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him'. Then, she said in documents filed in November, he jumped up, grabbed her face and smashed her head three times against the wall next to the bed before she ran to a nearby bus to put an ice pack on her head and neck. Driscoll said she suffered severe pain, difficulty breathing and bruising on her neck following the assault. Busch testified that he was having a spiritual experience after watching Brad Pitt's 'Seven Years In Tibet' and was naked and sobbing on the floor when Driscoll showed up at his home. He said he repeatedly asked Driscoll to leave as she demanded that he tell her son 'to his face' that the couple were no longer together, according to CBS News. Busch said he only touched Driscoll when he cupped her cheeks with his hand so he could look her in the eye when he told her again to leave his home. Driscoll said her ex-boyfriend accused her of 'having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him' on the night of the assault . Busch said he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave his home and only touched her when he cupped her cheeks with his hand. A Dover police detective testified that Busch had said Driscoll's head then 'tapped' the wall . A Dover police detective testified that Busch had said Driscoll's head then 'tapped' the wall. In his testimony, Busch said he could never have laid a hand on Driscoll because she was a trained assassin and a 'badass' who told him she had killed people before. He told the court, 'I know that she could take me down at any moment', and said his former girlfriend had once shown him images of dead bodies with gunshot wounds, as well as a scar from a stab wound on her stomach. He also said Driscoll once came home in an evening gown covered in blood and had told him 'I take down foreign governments. I own Washington'. Driscoll, a narcotics and homeland security consultant for a defense consulting firm in Washington, D.C., called the allegations 'ludicrous' and said Busch had ripped them from a screenplay she wrote and asked him to read. Conflicting testimony came not only from the former couple, but from supposed witnesses who had seen Driscoll following the fight. One of Driscoll's neighbors testified that she saw marks on the woman's face and neck hours after the alleged assault. NASCAR chaplain Nick Terry said he and his wife saw Driscoll 'immediately after the alleged assault' and did not see any marks on her. In court Driscoll said that Terry was being threatened and bribed by Busch's attorneys, claims he denies. In addition to the protection order with family court, Driscoll also filed a criminal complaint to Dover police. The Delaware attorney general's office has not yet decided whether to prosecute Busch. Police submitted their findings from their investigation more than a month ago. NASCAR released a statement following the family court's ruling and said they 'fully recognize the serious nature of this specific situation and the broader issue of domestic violence' and will await the attorney general's decision to 'determine our course of action'. 'We are relying on authorities in Delaware and their collective experience to identify all the facts.' Busch's attorney said he plans to appeal the family court's decision. Known as 'the Outlaw' in racing circles, Busch has a reputation for his temper. Busch was fined $50,000 by NASCAR in 2011 after a fan filmed him verbally abusing an ESPN reporter and posted the video on YouTube, and was suspended again for a race in 2012 after verbally attacking another reporter.

"Peter Benstead, 72, is charged with orchestrating a £19.5million Ponzi scheme before using the cash to buy luxury homes and cruises for his family . A family who helped run a £19.5million Ponzi scheme which left 12,500 people out of pocket spent the money on luxury foreign homes and round the world cruises, a court has heard. Peter Benstead, 72, his wife Susan, 69, son Julian, 46, and son-in-law Roderick Schmidt, 45, all appeared at Southwark Crown Court today charged with fraud and theft offences. The jury heard that they persuaded innocent victims to had over huge sums of cash, including a retired Marine who lost his life savings of £210,000, before frittering it away on lavish items. Peter Benstead bought a luxury house with a pool in the Dordogne region of France, another home in Cornwall, and spent £36,000 sending his wife on a 49-day cruise, the prosecution said. Son Julian also bought 20kg of gold on behalf of one company with a promise to deliver it to clients, but only turned over half, the court was told. The other 11kg was never seen again, and the jury were told that the father and son stole it. The relatives are in the dock alongside Edward James, 75, the former Mayor of Glastonbury and company director, and accountant Stephen Matthews, 51. The alleged fraud, which stretches back to 2006, centres on three companies, all of which were controlled by Peter Benstead. Two of those, Crown Currency Exchange and Crown Holdings Ltd, were both foreign exchange companies, offering customers the chance to pre-order foreign currency up to a year in advance. The companies are alleged to have lured in investors by promising 'exchange rates that could never make a profit', the court heard. The jury was told that both firms were 'hopelessly insolvent' for two years before finally collapsing in October 2010, and were kept afloat by luring in new investors to pay off existing customers. The third, a goldbroker's called Mayfair and Grant, told customers it was using their money to buy precious metals which were stored at its secure headquarter. In fact this money was being used for nothing more than to prop up the other two companies, the court was told. Prosecutor Peter Grieves-Smith said the Crown businesses and its goldbroker arm Mayfair and Grant were all interlinked and out to 'make a quick buck'. Mr Grieves-Smith said: 'They (defendants) were robbing Peter, the new customer, to pay Paul, the old customers. 'It led to Crown going into greater and greater debt without any prospect of getting out.' One victim of the alleged Ponzi scheme was an ex-Royal Marine who had moved into the transport industry after serving his country. Mr Grieves-Smith added: 'Eventually he got to retirement age and in 2011 he sold his lorries, sold his home in Essex and had the idea of buying a property in Ireland. 'By September 2010 he had found somewhere suitable to buy and had a deposit down and then looked to find a foreign exchange company who he could trust for the £210,000 to Ireland. Benstead (left) sent his wife Sussan, 69 (right), on a 49-day cruise costing £36,000. She appeared alongside him in the dock of Southwark Crown Court, accused of profiting from the alleged crooked enterprise . 'He found various good reviews, he did checks with Companies House and checks with the FSA. 'Reassured by what he had read, he placed an order with them on 20 September 2010 for £210,000 in Euros. 'He was to collect them in effect in Ireland on the 2 November, so he transferred his money to the company and waited for that moment.' But Crown had gone into administration and all his money was lost with no protection from the FSA, the court heard. 'He ended up penniless, homeless and relying on the charity of others,' said Mr Grieves-Smith. In the case of Mayfair and Grant, run by Benstead's son Julian, customers believed they were investing in bars of gold - some as small as 20g. The customers were told these were being stored on the company's premises when, in fact, the firm had not bought anything with their money, the prosecutor said. It was only when the banks began asking questions about the companies' activities that the ruse began to unravel, the court heard. One Mayfair and Grant customer paid £83,000 for 4kg (8.8lb) of gold, it was said. The customer was told his investment would be kept in a company safe for one year but this was not the case. Instead, Benstead's son Julian made a trip to his suppliers in Birmingham to buy 20kg (44lb) of gold a week before the Crown businesses went into administration in October 2010. Some was delivered to customers but the rest - 11kg (24lb) - went missing, the court heard. Mr Grieves-Smith alleged that Julian and Peter Benstead decided to steal it, adding that the gold has not been seen since. He added: 'The Crown companies were run in such a way that they could never make a profit and they knew it. Edward James, 75 (left), the former Mayor of Glastonbury, was a director of the companies at the heart of the alleged fraud, while Julian Benstead, 46 (right), ran a firm involved in buying and selling gold . 'They could only keep going by having a larger and larger turnover, by offering more attractive exchange rates. 'The reality was the companies were going into administration. To hide that, false accounts had to be provided.' He said Peter Benstead's wife Susan was not involved in running the businesses, but she must have known about how her husband got the money for their new home. He said: 'She is an astute businesswoman, she was not simply sitting on the sidelines, ignorant.' The court heard that Peter Benstead also invented his own reality television show as part of his schemes to earn people's money back. The court was shown a brochure for Dream Island, Benstead's television company, which advertised public auditions for a new reality show on a luxury Caribbean island. Wannabes were told they would be 'treated like a celebrity' with a top prize of £100,000. Those interested in auditioning were told to pay £30, and Benstead had hoped to make more money by selling the concept to a larger television company. Mr Grieves-Smith said: 'Not surprisingly, people saw through this pretty quickly. The idea died a death and the fees people paid were returned to them.' He said the idea cost Peter Benstead £60,000, although the money actually came from Crown funds, the court heard. The prosecutor said Crown staff were also encouraged to gamble with customer money. But they were 'lacking in experience and knowledge', and lost the cash, Mr Grieves-Smith said. Julian Benstead (left) used clients' money to buy 20kg of gold just before his business went bankrupt, but only half was ever handed over, it was claimed. He was accused of helping to steal the other 11kg . James stood down as Tory chairman of Mendip District Council in the wake of the allegations. Peter Benstead, from Penzance, Cornwall, denies three counts of fraudulent trading, two counts of false accounting, four counts of theft and one count of converting criminal property. Susan Benstead, of the same address, denies a single count of converting criminal property. Julian Benstead, of  Ludgvan, Penzance, denies one charge of fraudulent trading and a further charge of theft. Schmidt, of Goldsithey, Penzance, denies two counts of fraudulent trading, three charges of false accounting and an additional charge of theft. James, of  Glastonbury, Somerset; and Matthews, of  The Strand, Newlyn, Penzance, both deny two counts of false accounting and two counts of fraudulent trading. The Southwark Crown Court trial, which is expected to last until May, continues. Crown Currency Exchange and Crown Holdings Ltd . Southwark Crown Court heard that both of these companies effectively operated as one, offering clients the ability to buy currency up to a year in advance at low exchange rates. The businesses are alleged to have operated as a Ponzi scheme - constantly attracting new waves of investors to pay off the previous customers, while the owners skim money for themselves off the top. One victim, a former Royal Marine, handed £210,000 to the company to buy Euros which would be used to purchase a home in Ireland for his retirement. In fact he never saw a penny back, and is now homeless and living via the charity of others, the court was told. Mayfair and Grant . Customers were told they were investing in gold bars, some as small as 20g, which were being held by the company at its secure headquarters. In fact, nothing was being bought with their money, and the cash was instead used to prop up the other failing business, the jury heard. Weeks before the company fell into insolvency, Julian Benstead is alleged to have used funds to buy 20kg of gold to hand over to investors. According to prosecutors, only half of this ever materialised, the other 11kg was never seen again. Southwark Crown Court was told that this gold was stolen by Julian Benstead and his father to help fund their lavish lives of foreign homes and luxury cruises.

They seem to see eye to eye: The 17-year-old Jenner with the 25-year-old Bubble B*** hit maker volunteering at the LA Mission in December . He did not comment on why it took him so long to clear up the rumours they were a romantic item which have been lingering since the summer of 2014. According to TMZ, the Bubble B*** hit maker is reacting to comments made by Kanye West's ex-girlfriend Amber Rose on the same program. Rose - who took pot shots at Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian on Monday claiming the E! star's father is OJ Simpson (and also calling Kim a wh***) - stated that Tyga and Kylie were a couple. Their last night on the town together: That is the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star in the front seat of Tyga's car leaving the House Of Blues in West Hollywood on February 7 .

"Lego has been voted the world's most powerful brand toppling car manufacturer Ferrari from the top spot and seeing off challenges from other heavyweight companies such as Rolex. The success of last year's Lego Movie, which was praised by critics and made almost half a billion dollars worldwide, helped to ease it into the number one spot. The stop-motion style of the film also helped spawn countless online Lego parodies of famous events, making the toy 'an artistic medium in its own right', according to analysts Brand Finance. Scroll down for video . Danish toy Lego has been voted the world's most powerful brand thanks in large part to the success of last year's Lego Movie, which was well received critically and made nearly half a billion dollars at the box office . Lego took the number one spot for its appeal to both genders, its ability to cross cultural boundaries, and its ability to inspire adults as well as children (pictured, Lego art on display in Brussels) The toy saw off competition from super-brands such as Red Bull, Coca Cola, Nike and Unilever - which owns companies such as Flora, PG Tips, Persil and Comfort. Brand Finance impressed with Lego's ability to appeal to both genders, cross cultural borders, and to inspire adults as well as children. 1) Lego . 2) PWC . 3) Red Bull . 4) Unilever . 5) McKinsey . 6) Burberry . 7) Rolex . 8) L’Oreal . 9) Coca-Cola . 10) Ferrari . 11) Nike . 12) Walt Disney . For the survey, each company was given a rating based on the health of their finances, how recognisable they were, and how customers felt about them. This data was then used to give each company a letter rating from AAA+ to D, with only 12 companies awarded the top accolade. Consumer brands such as L'Oreal, Burberry, and Walt Disney made up ten of the top 12. However business management firm PricewaterhouseCoopers took second, while consultancy company McKinsey came in fifth. Brand Finance CEO David Haigh said: 'Lego's appeal spans generations; as well as the creative freedom it gives children, the brand appeals to the nostalgia of adults. 'It generally avoids gendered marketing - by appealing to boys and girls equally Lego maximises the size of its target demographic. 'That approach also pleases parents, as concerns mount over the effect toys may have on the outlook and ambitions of children, and girls in particular. 'However this year's particularly strong performance is thanks to the Lego Movie. 'The film was both a critical and commercial success providing not just immediate revenue but also an unrivalled marketing tool. Ferrari slipped from the top spot into eight place after another Formula 1 season without a win, and following the departure of chairman Luca Di Montezemolo (pictured) Lego saw off competition from branding heavyweights such as Nike, Rolex, Coca-Cola and Unilever - which owns companies such as Flora and Persil . 'Amateur versions of the film's stop-motion technique have proliferated online to the extent that Lego could be described as an artistic medium in its own right.' He added that Ferrari had dropped from first place to eight after another Formula 1 season without a win, and due to the departure of chairman Luca di Montezemolo. The annual Brand Finance report also looked at the world's most valuable brands which is headed by Apple, as it was last year, along with Samsung, Google and Microsoft.","Danish toymaker took top spot from Ferrari - which dropped to eight place .

"If you’ve ever carried your laptop around a room, trying to pick up a Wi-Fi signal, then this device may help. Youtuber, Charles Lohr, has created a Wi-Fi radar system that he claims allows anyone to see invisible Wi-Fi signals around the home. The Maryland-based hacker built the device using a chip, LED light, software and a CNC milling machine. Scroll down for video . If you’ve ever carried your laptop around a room, trying to pick up a Wi-Fi signal, then this device may help.Youtuber, Charles Lohr, has created a Wi-Fi radar system that he claims allows anyone to see invisible Wi-Fi signals. This is a screenshot of his 3D software program. Blue shows where the signal is strongest . The system works with a battery-powered ESP8266 chip which pings a device and measures the signal - in a similar way to the process used by a Wi-Fi radar. By attaching a light to the hardware, the system changes colour depending on the quality of signal in a given location. 'There is an application on my computer that looks at the receiver power of those pings and sends a colour to the ESP8266,’ Mr Lohr says in his video. 'So as Adam moves around in the three dimensional space, you can see the relative strength changing.' The system works with a battery-powered ESP8266 chip which pings a device and measures the signal - in a similar way to the process used by a Wi-Fi radar. The images reveal just how much variation there is in Wi-Fi strength in just one area . By attaching a light to the hardware, the system changes colour depending on the quality of signal in a given location. This image was captured using a long exposure camera . The images reveal just how much variation there is in Wi-Fi strength in just one area, with most of the images appearing in a variety of colours. Wi-Fi signals use very low intensity radio waves. While similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of Wi-Fi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven. The type of radiation emitted by radio waves (Wi-Fi), visible light, microwaves and mobile phones has been shown to raise the temperature of tissue at very high levels of exposure - but that's much higher than what people are subjected to on a regular basis. This is called a thermal interaction, but researchers are divided as to whether the radiation we receive daily can cause damage. The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been monitoring the safety of Wi-Fi. It says people using Wi-Fi, or those in the proximity, are exposed to the radio signals it emits - and some of the transmitted energy in the signals is absorbed in their bodies. However, the signals are very low power. Sitting in a Wi-Fi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call. Mr Lohr then attempted to capture these colours using long-exposure on his camera. Blue in the images shows where the signal is at its strongest. ‘I thought, there must be a better way to do this,’ he said. Using just a Wi-Fi module and a CNC mill, Mr Lohr then captured the variability of the signal to create a 3D visualisation on his computer. ‘The mill follows a basic zig zag pattern, while I'm running the same software that determines the signal strength,’ he said. ‘As the mill goes back and forth, I record the position of the mill and the Wi-Fi signal at the same time.’ The data is then uploaded onto his computer, showing a 3D model of blackspots and areas with good signal strength. 'This absolutely surprised me,’ he said. ‘I did not expect to see this much detail...it just blew my mind.' A number of things can affect Wi-Fi signal, including competing Wi-Fi systems, household electronics and Bluetooth devices. Last year, Jason Cole at Imperial College London attempted to tackle the problem of improving Wi-Fi signals by mathematically working out the optimum position for a router. He studied how walls and reflections affected signal strength and concluded that, as common sense might suggest, the centre of the house, is the best place for a router.

"An investment banker was found dead after attempting to climb the Northeast's highest peak on Monday afternoon - 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked through 100 mph winds. Kate Matrosova, 32, arrived at the base of New Hampshire's 5,400ft Mount Madison at 5am on Sunday, dropped off by her husband Charlie Farhoodi, who is listed on LinkedIn as a Vice President at JP Morgan. Within hours, she activated an emergency beacon amid treacherous conditions but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard. Her body was found 24 hours later. It appears she died of exposure to the extreme temperatures overnight. Tragic: BNP Paribas credit trader Kate Matrosova, 32, was found dead 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked up Mount Madison . Married: Matrosova was dropped off at the range at 5am on Sunday by husband Charlie Farhoodi (left) who is listed on LinkedIn as the Vice President of JP Morgan. The couple shared a $1 million apartment in Manhattan . Emergency: A search team was unable to locate Matrosova (pictured in January) for 24 hours after her call . She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet . Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a $1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of  Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim. As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F. The BNP Paribas credit trader  sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon. However, it took the team almost 24 hours to locate her. After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back. 'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV. Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range. Grueling: Mt Madison (pictured, not with Matrosova) was hit by 100 mph winds and a blizzard on Sunday night . She was found between Mt Madison and Mt Adams (top right), believed to have died from exposure to the cold . Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own . Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002 . Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting . According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams. A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area. 'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.' It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006. Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser. In 2012, she attended Harvard University Extension School to study Numerical Analysis before obtaining a masters in financial engineering from the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 2013. Vice President: Widower Charlie Farhoodi's job on LinkedIn is listed as Vice President of JP Morgan . Tribute: This picture was posted on Facebook in tribute to Matrosova with a friend called her 'a vibrant spirit' After interning for a year at BNP Paribas, she accepted the role of Credit Trading Associate in August 2014. Based on Facebook pictures, she appeared to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. Her interests are listed on LinkedIn as mountain climbing, judo and scuba diving. Friends and relatives paid tribute to Matrosova online, posting pictures of the 32-year-old. One wrote: 'Rest in peace...' with a photograph of Matrosova hiking through sunlight snowy woodland. Another described her as 'a vibrant spirit'. A blizzard watch was issued for coastal New England over the weekend that touched on the edge of the White Mountain National Forest, which encompasses the Presidential Range. The region saw up to 14 inches of snow in some areas.","Kate Matrosova, 32, found dead in New Hampshire mountains on Monday .

"Sydney's 'Bondi hoarders' have held onto their home and the neighbours are less than happy about it. The Bobolas family managed to stump up the cash to settle a reported $180,000 debt just hours before the house was due to go under the hammer on Tuesday night. Neighbours had been looking forward to the sale of the property at 19 Boonara Avenue, which was due to be auctioned on Tuesday night by the NSW Sheriff's Office. The sale had been called to recover money owed for cleaning and legal fees owed to Waverley Council by the Bobolas family. 'This was going to be the second happiest day of my life,' said one neighbour, who did not wish to be named. 'This will never come to an end in my life time. It won't happen until 2045.' Scroll down for video . An auction of the infamous Bondi hoarder house was cancelled on Tuesday afternoon after the owners came up with the $180,000 . Earlier on Tuesday the NSW Sheriff's Office denied previous reports that the Bobolas family had come up with the cash to stop Tuesday's auction . The Bobolas family, consisting of Mary and her daughters Elena and Liana (pictured in April), were being forced to sell their home . The house was listed for sale by the state government in order to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on clearing the mountains of rubbish collected on the property over years . Despite rubbish being piled high, the home was still in a better condition than in previous years. 'What you look at now is actually good, it used to be on the roof,' the neighbour said. Once the Bobolas family settled the debt, a NSW Department of Justice official said they could continue to live in the home. Another neighbour came to the defence of the Bobolas family. 'If someone is in a wheelchair, you don't kick them. They have a mental illness, so they need help,' the neighbour said. 'They don't need punishment. Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news . Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about $2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family . After amassing an enormous debt to the local council, the notorious Bobolas family  are being forced to sell their garbage-strewn property . If this home wasn't in a wealthy area, no one would care, the neighbour said. Real estate agent Ric Serrao had expected the 546sqm property to receive bids of up of $1.8 million at auction. 'I'm glad there's been some resolution, but it would have been quite a spectacle from an agent's point of view,' he said. The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets' The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard . Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news the family are being evicted . If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house . The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data . A ginger cat has made a home for itself among the piles of cardboard boxes and old plastic container . More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property .

"Film critic Barry Norman has dismissed Sunday night's Oscars ceremony as 'little better than a crapshoot', and claimed Hollywood judges let their maids vote for them. Several British names, including Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Felicity Jones, Rosamund Pike and Keira Knightley, are in the running for Sunday's Academy Awards. But the veteran broadcaster, who presented the BBC's Film programme for 26 years, said the voting system is unfair - and that being nominated is just as worthy as taking home the famous statuette. Scroll down for video . Film critic Barry Norman (right) has dismissed Sunday night's Oscars ceremony as 'little better than a crapshoot', and predicts Michael Keaton (left) will win best actor for Birdman because he is 'local' 'It always seems to me that the Oscars are much more interesting at the nominations stage than in the final analysis', the 81-year-old told Radio Times magazine. 'Apart from best picture, for which everyone votes, all the nominees are chosen by their peers - actors by other actors, directors by other directors and so on. 'If people who were probably vying with you for the same job think you did some of the best work of the year, that's a true compliment.' British actor Eddie Redmayne has been hotly tipped to take home an Oscar for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything . Another Brit, Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for his role in The Imitation Game, where he played codebreaker Alan Turing . Norman predicted that Birdman actor Michael Keaton was more likely than The Theory Of Everything star Redmayne to scoop the best actor Oscar, simply because the 63-year-old is 'a local boy ... who has never won a major award'. 'Just being nominated for an Oscar is a victory in itself,' he said. 'It's only when it comes to picking the winners that everyone votes in every category and the whole thing becomes little better than a crapshoot.' British actress Rosamund Pike is also in the running for Best Actress, thanks to her role opposite Ben Affleck in Gone Girl (pictured) Both Felicity Jones and Redmayne have been nominated for their parts in The Theory Of Everything, which has also been nominated for Best Picture . Both Keira Knightley and Cumberbatch have been nominated for The Imitation Game . And Norman questioned whether members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences entitled to vote for the prestigious awards have even seen all of the films vying for the prizes. 'Personal likes and dislikes come into play. You might vote for someone simply because he or she was nice to you on the set,' he said. 'Then there's the question of whether all the voters actually saw all the films. It's not unknown for some, especially the elderly, to get their maids to watch them on DVD and deliver their opinions.' American Sniper, in which Bradley Cooper plays Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, is also among those nominated for Best Picture . The Grand Budapest Hotel is also up for the biggest prize on Oscar night, with the 87th Acadamy Awards ceremony taking place on Sunday . Selma - a biopic of Martin Luther King - is among the Best Picture nominations . Coming of age film Boyhood, which was filmed over the course of 12 years could win Best Picture .

"It might make frying an egg a bit more comfortable but perhaps isn't great value for money. This tiny flat, which has gone on the market for £804 a month in Ealing, west London, has a double bed in the middle of the kitchen. It is described by Northfields Estate Agents as having a 'good sized living area' and also features a furnished 'large kitchenette', shower room and wooden floors. Breakfast in bed: The tiny studio flat in Ealing, west London, measures just 19 sq m and has the bed placed in the middle of the kitchen . However the online advert, which has since been removed, doesn't mention that the first-floor flat's kitchen also doubles up as the bedroom. Instead it includes pictures of the flat, which measures 19 sq m, with a divan bed placed in the middle of the room - inches from work surfaces and the kitchen sink. A wardrobe has been squeezed into the far corner of the studio flat while the dining area is conveniently placed on the other side of the bed. According to the London Evening Standard, the advert read: 'Located moments from Ealing Common Station is this great sized self-contained studio apartment with all bills included. Cosy: The double divan is placed close to the worktops and kitchen sink, while a wardrobe has been squeezed into a gap in the corner . Tight squeeze: The kitchenette is described as 'large' by Northfields Estate Agents on their website - despite not even having a proper oven . 'Station Parade is conveniently located for all the shops and amenities of Ealing Common and Ealing Broadway.' It is one of hundreds of flats soaring in price in the capital - many of them costing more than entire homes in the north of England. Often grand Victorian or Edwardian townhouses are split into several shoebox dwellings on each floor, each with a tiny kitchen and shower. It is on the market for £804, but does come with a shower room (pictured), wooden floors and a 'good sized living area', according to the advert . The flat is situated above a shop on Station Parade in Ealing, west London, and is conveniently close to Ealing Common underground station . Britain has the smallest new flats in western Europe, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects, and some are now even smaller than a Tube carriage. Among some of them was a five ft square studio-flat in Islington, north London, which was marketed for £737-a-month and was snapped up in just 16 hours.But the council banned a landlord from letting it out after pictures emerged with the bed blocked a kitchen cupboard. Council officers investigated after the listing in Islington, north London, was plastered over social media and attracted the attention of the press, and found it could not be rented in its current state. Rabbit hutch Britain: This tiny flat was deemed too small by a London council after it was revealed the bed blocked a kitchen cupboard . Elsewhere a flat was advertised for £780 a month in the exclusive west London enclave of Chelsea last year - with two electric hobs squeezed onto a kitchen counter which ends about 1ft from the bed. Another flat in Harringey, north London, solves the issue of storage by having its occupant climb a ladder to reach their mattress. But its price - at £607 a month, comparatively low for the capital - is still more than an average three-bedroom flat in Liverpool. Last year a landlord also asked for £780 a month for a studio flat so small that occupants would have to stand on top of a fridge and climb a ladder to get into bed, and there was less than two feet of space between the top of the mattress and the ceiling.","The first-floor studio flat in Ealing, west London, is being marketed at £201 a week by Northfields Estate Agents .

He can handle it: The dog sets about yanking open the passenger door . Jaw-some: The powerful dog pulls the door shut using a rubber hoop attached to the inside . The officer then simply points to the car and the animal hurries over to it. It then immediately grabs the rear passenger door handle with its teeth and jumps in. Attached to the inside of the door is a large rubber hoop, which the dog then tugs on to shut the door. This is met with cries of delight from people watching behind the camera. The footage was filmed in 2009 but has since re-emerged on the internet and been viewed nearly a million times.

"He recently revealed that he calls Kris Jenner 'Mom,' and refers to Rob Kardashian as his, 'little brother'. It seems that over the years rapper and designer Kanye West has truly become one of the Kardashians. This  was made clear when Kris and Kendall were spotted front row at his fashion show in New York last week, signalling how close he really is to  the reality television family. Scroll down for video . In September Kanye sat front frow at the Givenchy fashion show with Kim, North and Kim's mother Kris . Kris Jenner and model Kendall sat front row at Kanye's fashion show in New York last week signalling just how close he has become to the family . He even had Kim's younger sister Kylie Jenner play a starring role in the presentation, her biggest modelling gig to date. But despite the fact that he has regularly been criticised for his relationship with Kim and her siblings his ingratiation into the clan has been no mistake. Indeed, Kanye has never hidden how even before he and Kim got together he long desired to be part of not only her life, but part of her family's. In an interview with Kris Jenner in 2013 she revealed how the rapper would draw himself into the annual Kardashian Christmas card before he and Kim started dating in 2012. She said: 'He would take the photo when he saw it online and would Photoshop himself into the card and then share it with Kim.' The matriarch of the family then revealed one of Kanye's altered images with him drawn in on paint in the background. Kanye jokes with Kris Jenner on her chat show in 2013 where he spoke about his love for Kim and her family . Before dating Kim, Kanye would draw himself into the Kardashian Christmas card (pictured, left) and send the picture over to the object of his affections . He also said of his now wife: 'There's times when I wasn't with [Kim], I wanted be with her so bad I thought about taking up sports,' joking about the fact that she used to only date sports players. Kanye even made a much-hyped appearance on Kourtney and Kim Take New York in 2011, hopelessly flirting with Kim and making efforts to befriend her sister. And when they finally made things official last year, tying the knot in a lavish Italian ceremony he praised the family in his wedding speech, calling them, 'an industry.' He and Kim have spent nearly two years living at Kris' house in California along with her sisters Kendall and Kylie while their home was renovated. Kanye said of the experience: 'When I'm out, I just want to get home early so I can be with my family,' although he did note that the house was particularly, 'noisy.' Kris herself admitted, 'We love each other a whole bunch.' Kanye looks happy as he poses with the Kardashian clan during an episode of the hit series . Tragedy struck in 2007 when Kanye lost his mother, Donda West, after she had complications during surgery . Kanye's desire to ingratiate himself into the Kardashian clan may also have something to do with the fact that his own family life has been marred with tragedy. In 2007 the rapper was left bereft and heartbroken at the loss of his mother Donda West who died aged just 58 due to complications during surgery. Kanye has since spoken of his deep depression following her passing. He's also spoken of his deep regret that Donda never got to meet his 19-month old daughter North. 'There's been some ups and downs. I made some mistakes and I've made some accomplishments. There's only one thing I regret,' he admitted. 'There's only one thing I wish I could change out of everything that's ever happened.' Kanye says he is happy now that he has wife Kim and his daughter North in his life . He said on Kris Jenner's show: 'After I lost my mother, there was times I felt like, I would put my life at risk. I felt like sometimes I didn't have something to live for. Now I have two really special people to live for.' In his most recent interview Kanye let slip that he calls Kris Mom when talking about making his way into the fashion world and being rejected because of his Kardashian connections. He said: 'Soon as we started dating, fashion people were really opposed to the idea of reality stars. And all the relationships, the somewhat friends that I had somewhat built up, completely turned their backs on her and me.'","Rapper  reveals he calls Kris Jenner 'Mom' after losing his own mother .

"Revelers bundled up in winter coats with the occasional glitzy costume filled the streets of New Orleans on Tuesday for the annual Mardi Gras bash, opening a day of partying, parades and good-natured jostling for beads and trinkets tossed from passing floats. Retired clarinetist Pete Fountain rode a mini float decked out as a streetcar as his Half-Fast Walking Club kicked off a day of parades on Fat Tuesday - historically the day when cooking fats would be used up before the austerities of Lent. The Reverend Byron Miller started Fountain's group on its way with a prayer, invoking 'the God of laughter and love' as marchers set out on a miles-long trek after early morning rain cleared out, leaving many buttoning up amid temperatures in the 30s and 40s early in the day.

The cast of the CBS crime drama 'NCIS: New Orleans' got an early taste of the season on Monday, riding in the parade of Orpheus and tossing beads to revelers lining city streets before heading to an overnight ball. Their Mardi Gras episode airs Tuesday night at 8pm CST. Other celebrities joining in this year's revelry were comedian Ron White and country music star Dierks Bentley. Al Johnson, singer of the catchy Mardi Gras tune Carnival Time, served as grand marshal of the Red Beans and Rice foot parade, another Monday prelude to the day. Johnson told The Associated Press his catchy song - now synonymous with the annual Carnival seasons - got its inspiration from the Lower 9th Ward, a New Orleans district devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

"Sarah Wilson is best known for her somewhat controversial 'I Quit Sugar' diet, and now she's suggesting something else be left out of people's lives - bicycle helmets. A photo posted to Instagram on Monday night purported to show what roads looked like before and after mandatory bicycle helmet laws were introduced in Australia, making the point that less people take to the roads on their bikes than they did decades ago. 'This is what happened when mandatory helmet laws were introduced into Australia,' the caption on the image read. Sarah Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar has spoken out against mandatory bicycle helmet laws . Wilson is known as an avid bike rider and is big on encouraging people to take up the extra physical activity along with a healthy lifestyle. And while this is not the first time the blogger has voiced her opinion on the matter saying she was against the laws, the debate was reignited, leaving many outraged. The backlash from fans was swift, with commenters deeming her opinion dangerous, ill-informed and irresponsible given her platform. 'This seems like an incredibly irresponsible statement to be making, Sarah,' one outraged woman posted. But she was met with fierce backlash online with people branding her opinion 'dangerous' Others were 'disappointed' with Wilson's 'irresponsible' approach to bike riding . Wilson has previously sparked the same debate through a series of blog post a few years back . 'For someone with an obvious interest in health and wellbeing you seem cavalier in your attitude towards the prevention of traumatic brain injuries and neurological deficits. Your opinion on this subject defies what I had perceived to be intelligence,' the comment continued. 'I'm a cyclist who was hit by a driver who didn't stop at a STOP sign,' another user wrote. 'I was wearing a helmet but still ended up in RPA's Emergency ward. I would have ended up in the morgue NOT wearing one. For those who don't think it's important to wear a helmet, you are plainly stupid and have never experienced actually being hit by a car. This woman questioned the author's attitude to helmets given her focus on healthy living . Others brought in statistics to back up their claims that bicycle helmets save lives . Mandatory helmet laws were brought into effect in Australia from 1990, and was the first to make it illegal not to wear a helmet . 'I'm really disappointed Sarah. I won't be following you any longer as people's lives are saved by wearing helmets whilst cycling when they are on the roads. This is even more imperative on Sydney roads as Sydney drivers are particularly aggressive towards cyclists,' the post concluded. In an earlier blog post Wilson addressed the issue saying that she was against the compulsory nature of the bike helmet laws not the laws themselves, but also claimed there was little scientific evidence to prove that helmets actually saved lives. The posts sits under subheadings such as 'Helmet laws make riding more dangerous' and 'There’s inconclusive proof helmets save lives or limit injuries'. This woman suggested she may boycott Wilson's healthy way of living . Others did agree with the author's unpopular opinion . ''Helmets deter people from riding' Wilson wrote in a blog post in 2010 . 'Helmets deter people from riding. But regular riders live longer because the health effects of cycling far outweigh the risk of death from crashing. There is ample data to back this,' Wilson wrote in 2010. Also on her blog she has admitted to struggling with the 'style' element of wearing a helmet. 'I promote riding unencumbered by style restraints. But helmets just ruin the whole flow, especially for a chick,' she revealed. Mandatory helmet laws were brought into effect in Australia from 1990, and was the first country to make it illegal not to wear a helmet.","Sarah Wilson is the author behind 'I Quit Sugar' cookbook and lifestyle .

"Earning welfare: Teens will be told to c ollect rubbish . Jobless youngsters will be forced to pick up litter or carry out other community work if they want to receive benefits, David Cameron will say today. In a major speech on Tory welfare plans, the Prime Minister will claim it is wrong for them to be allowed to go straight on to the dole. He will pledge that a future Tory government will introduce mandatory community work for unemployed youngsters in order to instil the ‘discipline of turning up for work each day’. Mr Cameron said last night that making young people work for their dole would help them ‘make something of their lives’ and ensure they gave something back to their community in return for ‘help’ from the government. The move is part of Tory plans to ‘abolish’ the scourge of long-term youth unemployment. Under original plans, claimants would only receive benefits for six months before being required to start an apprenticeship or carry out community work. But Tory sources said the scheme would now be ‘turbo-charged’ to require young people to carry out community work from the first day of their claim. Any young person who has not been in education, training or work during the previous six months will be asked to undertake daily volunteer work in order to qualify for their handouts. The plan will affect around 50,000 young people a year who currently go straight on to the dole. Mr Cameron said the plans were ‘not just about saving money’ but about breaking the cycle of welfare dependency. ‘Our welfare reforms are about changing lives and making this a country that rewards work and gives everyone the chance of a better future,’ he said. ‘We want to get rid of that well-worn path from the school gate, down to the Job Centre, and onto a life on benefits. ‘From day one they must realise that welfare is not a one-way street. Yes, we will help them, but there is no more something for nothing. They must give back to their community too.’ Mr Cameron said last night that making young people work for their dole would help them ‘make something of their lives’ The Tories have already pledged to abolish Jobseekers’ Allowance for those aged 18-21 and replace it with a time-limited Youth Allowance if they win power in May. The existing Community Work Programme, which can include making meals for older people or working for local charities, typically involves 30 hours a week for three months plus ten hours of job-seeking activity a week. Sources said community work placements have been shown to be more effective in getting claimants off benefits than just signing on. A pilot scheme in London requiring youngsters to do community work from the first day of their claim has proved even more effective. The plan is expected to cost about £20million a year to deliver. Sources said this would come from savings produced by the roll-out of the universal credit scheme.","He'll pledge that future Tory government will make unemployed teens work .

"Disgraced presenter Jonathan Ross has been invited to host a BBC primetime television show . Disgraced presenter Jonathan Ross has been invited to host a BBC primetime television show - prompting a barrage of criticism. The controversial TV host is lined up to present The Secrets of Pinewood, an hour-long programme about the famous film studios, which will air on BBC2 one Saturday night in the spring. One MP said he wanted to stop paying his licence fee in protest at the decision, whilst the wife of Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs spoke of her ‘disgust’ and ‘astonishment’. ‘If I could cancel my subscription to the BBC over this, I would,’ said John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley. ‘What Jonathan Ross did was really nasty and a very serious abuse of his position as a broadcaster. I wonder what someone would have to do on the BBC to disqualify them [from future appearances].’ Mr Ross was effectively exiled from the Corporation after he crudely mocked Mr Sachs, the Fawlty Towers actor, in 2008. However, the Corporation seems to be trying to reinstate him. The 54-year old was allowed to present a film awards show on BBC4 in 2010, and has since appeared as a guest on Celebrity Bake Off. He has also been allowed to stand in for Steve Wright as a host on BBC Radio 2 – the station which aired the original outrage. Earlier this month, 100 listeners complained about Mr Ross’ return to the BBC airwaves. many also complained on Twitter. One slammed the decision as ‘shameful’, whilst another said it was a ‘disgrace’ to ‘let this clown back on radio’. Mr Hemming said: ‘I wonder about the judgment of the BBC sometimes. They are supposed to have higher standards than other broadcaster’s…and yet their standards of behaviour are lower than the commercial sector’s.’ Mr Ross was effectively exiled from the BBC after he and Russell Brand mocked Andrew Sachs in 2008 . Mr Ross telephoned Mr Sachs live on air on BBC Radio 2, and left a lurid message on his answer machine explaining him that the comedian Russell Brand had slept with Mr Sachs’ granddaughter. Mr Brand, who was with Mr Ross at the time, joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Last night, Mr Sachs’ wife Melody said that Mr Ross still made her ‘cringe’ and accused executives of behaving insensitively. ‘I find it astonishing that the BBC now deems him worthy of presenting a documentary on BBC2. I cringe every time I see him on television and I know I’m not alone in doing so. ‘Whoever makes these decisions at the BBC obviously couldn’t care less for the feelings of my family. The irony is that when you look at what my husband has done at the BBC over many years, and then compare it to what Ross has done, there is no question as to who has made the more positive contribution.’ She added that she found it hardest to forgive Mr Ross, for the 2008 episode because he is a family man. ‘Both Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand disgust me because of what they did, but Ross more so because he is a father and a husband who should have known better.’ But the 54-year old was allowed to present a film awards show on BBC4 in 2010, and is set to appear on Celebrity Bake Off . The original incident provoked 42,000 complaints. Mr Brand later resigned and Mr Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks. He subsequently moved to ITV, while the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom for the shameful episode. The Secrets of Pinewood will be aired as one of a string of Saturday night arts specials, endorsed by director-general Tony Hall. Lord Hall said this morning that they were meant to ‘put arts centre stage’. ‘I strongly believe that arts should be for everyone with more prime time arts content on the BBC,’ he added. The Corporation defended its decision to have Mr Ross as host of the Pinewood programme. ‘Jonathan Ross is a widely respected film critic who presented BBC One’s Film programme for over a decade,’ a spokesman said. ‘Secrets of Pinewood will see Jonathan go behind the scenes of Britain’s most iconic studios, to explore its rich history and contribution to 80 years of British film. We hope viewers enjoy this special one-off celebration of British cinema.’","The controversial TV host is lined up to present The Secrets of Pinewood .

"Trial: Abid Naseer goes on trial today in New York after pleading not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway . Details of the oath of allegiance taken by new Al Qaeda recruits were laid bare yesterday. They pledged to obey Osama Bin Laden ‘for the establishment of the religion of God’ and help the terror chief wage jihad. The pledge emerged at the trial of an Al Qaeda suspect accused of plotting to blow up a Manchester shopping centre. It was among a haul of intelligence seized by US Navy Seal commandos during the mission to kill Bin Laden in his Pakistan compound. It is the first time any of this valuable information has been used in a prosecution. The oath, submitted in evidence to the New York trial of former Manchester student Abid Naseer, reads: ‘I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Osama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomever Sheikh Osama assigns to be my amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and to memorise the secrets of the group and to be where I am ordered to.’ Prosecutors said yesterday that Naseer, 28, led the Manchester cell of a three-pronged Al Qaeda plot in 2009 to ‘repeat the devastation of 9/11’. As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, the court heard. The trial was told Naseer, who was extradited to the US two years ago, was sent to the UK from Pakistan in 2008 with co-conspirators to ‘become westerners’, manufacture explosives and plant them at a target that would ‘bomb hundreds of innocent people and cause millions of dollars of damage’. Although he is not accused of being involved in the New York attack plan, US prosecutors say the three plots ‘were all connected and all part of one Al Qaeda conspiracy’. Jurors would be shown a letter from Al Qaeda’s head of western operations that proved the Manchester plot ‘went all the way to the top of Al Qaeda – to none other than Osama Bin Laden’, said prosecutor Celia Cohen. ‘You will see the chilling reminder in that letter to Osama Bin Laden that Al Qaeda’s goal was to attack the infidel in their home territory’, she said. 'Pledge of allegiance': Prosecutors say the trial will feature evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden, pictured, including an oath Naseer presumably took on joining Al Qaeda . Evidence: Eight more documents from Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad are to be revealed. In this file picture Pakistani policemen stand guard as workers demolish the house where the Al Qaeda chief died . The text of the Al Qaeda 'pledge of allegiance', which has been translated by prosecutors. We, of course, take the pledge of allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama bin Laden. We say in the wording something like: I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomsoever Sheikh Usama assigns to be my Amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and the rule of Islam that governs the law of God, and to memorise the secrets of the group, and to be where I am ordered to. (Source: New York Daily News) Naseer has denied charges of providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. He faces life imprisonment if convicted. The jury is set to hear evidence next week from six undercover MI5 agents who are being allowed to testify disguised by wigs and make-up in order to conceal their identities. The trial is also unusual as Naseer has decided to represent himself in court. Wearing an open-necked yellow shirt and bushy beard, Naseer read out his opening statement and later tried repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, to challenge the testimony of a confessed Al-Qaeda member, Najibullah Zazi, who is giving evidence against him. The court heard Naseer followed the terror training he received in Pakistan, communicating with his Al Qaeda handler by using the email names of women. He also used code, using women’s names for the types of explosive he was considering and referring to the actual bomb attack as a ‘marriage’ or ‘wedding’, said prosecutors. In court: Naseer, second from left, is pictured in a January 7 court sketch as he is arraigned in Brooklyn Federal Court. He pleaded not guilty through his attorney Steven Brounstein, centre . The New York Subway: Two government witnesses expected to testify against Naseer - Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay - have already pleaded guilty to a plot to bomb the transport network . When he told his Al Qaeda contact he was sorry he would ‘miss the party’, Naseer was referring to the hopefully devastating Arndale Centre explosion, the court heard. However, Naseer insisted he had been in the UK simply to look for a Muslim bride. The trial continues.","Abid Naseer pleaded not guilty to an alleged plot to bomb subway trains .

"For the first time ever, celebrities are being replaced with 'everyday heroes' to take part in a special series of Strictly Come Dancing. Six men and women from across the UK - including a Royal Marine who joked 'Well, there go my dancing days' after losing his leg in a blast in Afghanistan - will take a turn under the glitterball for the Comic Relief episodes. The first People's Strictly, from which any cash raised by public voting will go to charity, will air on BBC1 on February 25 at 9pm. The People's Strictly contestants are ready for their close up, (L-R) Michael Pattie, Anna Kennedy OBE, Cassidy Little, Heather Parsons, Phillip Barnett and Trishna Bharadia . The contestants - dubbed 'everyday heroes' - were chosen out of 11,000 hopefuls who all have inspirational stories. Viewers will be able to watch, and vote for, Canadian-born Lance Corporal Cassidy Little, a former Marine medic, who despite losing his right leg in an explosion in 2011 went on to help other Marines through rehab, performing with partner Natalie Lowe. Buckinghamshire resident Trishna Bharadia, who is dancing with Aljaz Scorjanec, suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and has campaigned tirelessly to help other people with the chronic illness. Cornish man Phil Barnett, who set up the children's youth theatre group Kidz R Us, which has helped more than 2,000 children in the area, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, will be dancing with Janette Manrara. Anna Kennedy OBE, who will be pairing with Robin Windsor, set up schools for those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders after discovering the lack of provisions for her two sons who suffer from ASDs. Heather Parsons who, after contracting a flesh eating bug whilst on a skiing holiday and nearly dying, set up a charity to help those in intensive care and their families dancing with Ian Waite. And Michael Pattie, from Dumfries, who after tragically losing his son to Meningitis has raised more than £300,000 for charities to help others who contract the disease. Michael will be dancing with Strictly favourite Aliona Vilani. There will be a four-part special show which will follow the contestants in their daily lives and then see them go behind the scenes at Strictly. In the fourth episode, the contestants will face a dance off in front of the public, and will be all vying to win the much coveted glitter ball trophy. The show will be presented by the regular hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman and the lucky contestants will get to travel around the UK and Europe learning the origins of their dances. Here's who to look out for... Marome Medic Cassidy looks smart in his uniform as he gears up to take part in The People's Strictly . Name: Cassidy Little . Age: 33 . From: Peterborough (born in Canada) Hero Qualities: Cassidy is a Marine Medic who helped other Marines through rehab, despite his own injuries . Dance Partner: Natalie Lowe . Lance Corporal Cassidy Little is a former Royal Marine medic, who lost his right leg below the knee during a tour of Afghanistan in the summer of 2011. An Improvised Explosive Device was triggered, resulting in three fatalities and five seriously injured Marines including Cassidy. Despite his own horrific injuries Cassidy selflessly attempted to tend to his colleagues on the ground after the attack. Following the incident, Cassidy spent a week in an induced coma, and two months in hospital. He then undertook intensive rehabilitation with his fellow injured Marines, who commented that it was Cassidy’s optimism and sense of humour that helped them through an incredibly tough time. Major Steve McCulley, who spent more than two years in rehab with Cassidy, stated: 'Every single seriously injured service person goes through very dark periods and were it not for Cassidy, those dark periods would have been far longer and far harder for many to deal with, me included.' And it wasn’t just Cassidy’s upbeat attitude that helped his colleagues – but his love of dance too. Previously an avid dancer - and with a degree in music and dance - Cassidy taught fellow Marine JJ Chalmers, how to Waltz whilst out in Afghanistan, so JJ could impress his fiancée at their first dance for their wedding. When Cassidy was being airlifted to Camp Bastian following the incident, JJ said Cassidy joked: 'There go my dancing days!' - But how wrong he was! Campaigner Trishna looks nervous at the prospect of dancing with her professional partner Aljaz Scorjanec . Name: Trishna Bharadia . Age: 35 . From: Buckinghamshire . Hero Qualities: Multiple Sclerosis and disability fundraiser and awareness campaigner . Dance Partner: Aljaz Scorjanec . Trishna was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008, at the age of 28. She has since worked tirelessly to help and support others with MS, putting aside her own health issues to help raise awareness and inspire others with the illness. She has worked particularly hard within the Asian community, where she feels that disability is often hidden away and discriminated against, as well as with young people who have been diagnosed with MS. Trishna volunteers with several MS charities, including the MS Society, Asian MS and the MS Trust and in 2013 she was named ‘Volunteer of the Year’ at the MS Society Awards. As well as fundraising, Trishna is also Editor of the Asian MS quarterly newsletter; writes for MS and disability-awareness magazines, blogs and speaks at both local events and large pharmaceutical conferences about MS – something which was initially very hard for her due to her shyness and fear of public speaking. She is keen to put a ‘face’ to MS, rather than being viewed as a statistic. Hailing from St Ives Phil set up a Youth Theatre Company called Kidz R Us . Name: Phil Barnett . Age: 54 . From: St Ives . Hero Qualities: Founder of Youth Theatre Company, Kidz R Us . Dance Partner: Janette Manrara . Twenty years ago, hairdresser and amateur-dramatics enthusiast Phil gathered a small group of local kids for a one-off concert in aid of charity Save The Children. Following its success, he decided to give up his full-time hairdressing business and set up ‘Kidz R Us’, a Youth Theatre Company for six to 24 year olds in St Ives. Through practical engagement in the performing arts, the company aims to build confidence in its young members, providing them with a hobby, a goal and a safe family environment. Since it started, Phil estimates that 2,000 children have been through its doors, half of those being from disadvantaged backgrounds. They have also raised more than £2m through their 50-plus shows and events. Anna's two sons were both diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorders as young children and were turned away from many mainstream schools . Name: Anna Kennedy OBE . Age: 54 . From: Uxbridge, London . Hero Qualities: Set up schools and support for people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders . Dance Partner: Robin Windsor . Anna’s two sons, Patrick, 24 and Angelo, 20, were both diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorders as young children. The severity of their condition meant that they were turned away from 26 local mainstream schools, as they couldn’t cater for their individual needs. Both boys were finally offered just five hours of home tuition per week. Anna decided something had to be done for her boys, and with the help of her husband Sean, took on the challenge of founding a school themselves. They relentlessly fundraised and re-mortgaged their home to raise the £627,000 needed, and in 1999 The Hillingdon Manor School finally opened its doors in their home town. It started out with just 19 pupils but has since grown to over 150, and is now the largest school of its kind for Autistic children in Europe. Anna has since set up another specialist school, an autism awareness charity and a respite home for adults. She provides training for the NSPCC and Childline and also runs various other fundraising and awareness events throughout the year. Heather Parsons is 53 and set up a charity to help support those in intensive care and their families . Name: Heather Parsons . Age: 53 . From: Southampton . Hero Qualities: Set up a charity to support intensive care patients and their families . Dance Partner: Ian Waite . In 2002, Heather was on a skiing holiday with her son Will, who was seven at the time, when she contracted Necrotising Fasciitis - a flesh-eating bug - that left her in intensive care. Her body’s immune system did not fight the infection and her organs began to fail. Her kidneys stopped working, she suffered a heart attack and her breathing had to be supported. She was in a coma for two weeks, hospitalised for six, and underwent 15 operations. At one point her family were told that her chance of survival was just 30%. When she woke from her coma, it was the thought of Will at home that helped Heather to pull through, but following her release from hospital, it wasn’t easy for her. Convinced that intensive care patients and their friends and families needed greater emotional support upon recovery, Heather left her job and re-mortgaged her house in order to set up the charity ‘Where There’s A Will’ to help to provide this support. Since then she has been volunteering her time daily at the Intensive Care Unit at Southampton General Hospital offering what she calls, 'TLC; tea, listening and compassion'. Heather and son Will recently also developed an app to help ICU patients who can’t speak to communicate with staff. This is now in medical use. After losing his son Dave to Meningitis Michael has tirelessly fundraised for the Meningitis Research Foundation . Name: Michael Pattie . Age: 57 . From: Dumfries . Hero Qualities: Meningitis Research Foundation fundraiser and awareness campaigner . Dance Partner: Aliona Vilani . In 1999 Michael tragically lost his 13-year-old son Dave to Meningitis. Since his death, Michael has been tirelessly fundraising for the Meningitis Research Foundation and has raised over £300,000 – some of which contributed towards the development of a ground-breaking new Meningitis B vaccine, available on the NHS. The majority of this £300,000 has been raised through an idea that came to Michael in front of the TV ten years ago: putting on local Strictly Come Dancing events. These fundraisers, called ‘Strictly for Charity’ have now been running for a decade and, as well as generating funds, have provided a vehicle for the Dumfries community to come together. Michael also leads outreach and awareness events; speaking at local schools and parent toddler groups to teach people the Meningitis symptoms to look out for. Michael’s contribution to the Meningitis Research Foundation has been praised by Scotland’s manager for MRF, Mary Millar, who says: 'Michael’s work has saved lives and he is the best fundraiser we have ever had in Scotland. We are incredibly grateful to him.' In 2013, Michael was named Scottish Charity Champion.","Six members of the public have been announced for The People's Strictly .

"A woman whose mum was raped and murdered by her own dad has told how she forgave him on his deathbed and even apologised to him for not visiting him in prison. Samantha Lawler was just 18 when she found her mother Suzanne strangled to death days after she told her husband she wanted to leave him. Leo Lawler admitted first-degree murder and rape and was sentenced to life. Samantha Lawler was just 18 when she found her mother Suzanne strangled to death days after she told her husband she wanted to leave him . Sam and her mum Suzanne at her High School Graduation. Suzanne was killed in December 1999 by her husband, a week after he'd threatened her . But, despite justice being done, Miss Lawler couldn't move on with her life until she decided to forgive her dad. The 33-year-old waitress from New York said: 'I lost both my parents when my dad killed my mum and I spent the next ten years unable to move on, blaming him for what he did. 'When I finally saw him 13 years after he killed Mum, I told him I loved him and I was sorry I hadn't visited. 'I forgave him and felt a huge weight lift from my shoulders. I got my dad back and my life back too. I could finally move on.' Miss Lawler recalls having a happy childhood with sister, Kim, before their mum's death. She said: 'They argued like anyone and sometimes Dad called Mum stupid. 'But otherwise I thought we were pretty normal. Dad was always trying to make us laugh.' But when Miss Lawler was 18, her mum confessed she wanted to leave her husband. 'I wanted Mum to be happy so I supported her, but Dad told her if she left he'd put her six feet under. 'He said things like that all the time when he was angry, we didn't think he was serious. It left her even more determined to get out though.' Miss Lawler was confident her mum, then aged 50, would cope on her own. 'She had plans to study teaching and was excited about getting her own place, but Dad wasn't adjusting. Leo Lawler admitted first-degree murder and rape and was sentenced to life . 'Mum hadn't even left and he stopped going to work and started drinking heavily.' In December 1999, a week after Mr Lawler had threatened his wife, the couple's daughter came home to find her mum lying on the sofa covered in a blanket. 'It wasn't like her to take naps in the day, but I assumed she was asleep so not wanting to disturb her, I went upstairs,' Miss Lawler explained. 'But two hours later I came down to find Mum hadn't moved. Then I noticed blue patches on her face and realised she wasn't breathing. 'I shook her body, moved the blanket and found her shirt pulled open. 'I started to resuscitate her but it was too late. She had already gone. I knew Dad had done it and I knew my life was never going to be the same again.' Mr Lawler went on the run but was arrested the next day hiding in a motel under a false name. The family decided they didn't want Mr Lawler to receive the death penalty. Miss Lawler said: 'I wanted him to suffer in prison and spend time thinking about what he'd done.' In November 2000 Mr Lawler, 57, of Northeast Second Street, Broward County, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and rape, at a Florida court. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. The next ten years passed in a blur for Miss Lawler, who struggled to cope with what had happened. Samantha, pictured here with her mum in 1985, had found her body under a blanket at the family home . She said: 'I'd look through family photos knowing Dad would never walk me down the aisle and my children – if I had a family – would never meet their grandparents.' In 2010, Kim Lawler visited their dad in prison. 'She told me he'd had a stroke and couldn't speak or move his right side, but I was still too angry with him to care.' It was another two years before she became curious about her father. In October 2012 she called the prison where Mr Lawler, 69, was being held. 'They told me they'd been trying to reach me as Dad was in hospital days from death. I wanted to ask why he'd killed Mum and I realised this could be my last chance. Visiting Mr Lawler in Jacksonville Hospital, his daughter said she barely recognised him. 'His limbs were curled up close to his body after he'd had multiple strokes,' Miss Lawler recalled. 'He had a machine breathing for him so he couldn't talk and couldn't move. 'He was handcuffed to the bed but really not in any state to hurt anyone. I felt sorry for him. 'For years I'd wanted him to suffer and now he was, I felt guilty that I'd wished it. 'I thanked him for being an incredible dad and realised he was a good person who'd done something wrong. 'I told him I loved him and I was sorry I hadn't visited. Then I said I forgave him.' After her visit, doctors told Miss Lawler that normally patients with his condition are allowed to choose between being treated or being allowed to die. But prisoners didn't have those same rights and would be treated regardless. 'They gave me the chance to end his suffering,' Miss Lawler said. 'I realised if Dad was treated he would remain handcuffed to a bed all his life and I didn't want him to be in any pain.' So two days later, doctors ceased treatment and Mr Lawler passed away. 'I was pleased I got to say goodbye,' Miss Lawler said. 'I would have never forgiven myself if I hadn't. 'People are amazed I forgave my dad. They don't think they could do the same. 'I thought the same once, but I realised hating him every day wasn't doing me any good.'","Samantha Lawler was 18 when she found the body of her mother, Suzanne .

"On trial: Matthew Dunford, pictured today, failed to attend court on February 2 because he had taken an overdoes the day before, the court heard . A fitness fanatic branded 'Britain's vainest man' took an overdose the day before he was convicted for setting up a fake website claiming his former girlfriend was a prostitute, a court heard. Matthew Dunford attempted to extort £5,000 from Brazilian model Amanda Branco, who once worked as a stripper. When she refused to pay, the 30-year-old, who claims he spends £10,000-a-year on his looks, then created the escort website profile and sent it to her mother and sister. He was then charged with stalking and was awaiting trial but he still went on to Facebook to repeat the false allegations that Ms Branco was a call girl and linked it to her employer's page. Dunford was found guilty of two counts of harassment in his absence on February 2 after he failed to appear at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court. Today, the court heard that he did not attend because he was being treated in hospital after taking an overdose the previous day. He suffered a seizure and was unable to talk because he had vigorously chewed the inside of his mouth during the convulsion. He was only discharged in the early hours of 2 February, where he returned to his parents’ house in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Leah Connolly, representing Dunford, said there were signs Dunford’s mental health is ‘deteriorating.’ ‘This is a gentleman who is quite unwell,’ Ms Connolly said. The court heard Dunford has been recovering with his father, who is a retired GP, and his mother, who is a nurse. Magistrate Greg Thomson refused an application to retry the case, given Dunford’s absence during the trial. He said: ‘It is common ground by both the prosecution and defence that the overriding test is what is in the interests of justice. ‘One of the things we are clear about is that the interests of justice cover not just you but the victim in this case.’ Mr Thomson added that he was ‘sympathetic’ towards Dunford’s plight. Reaction: Matthew Dunford, pictured, was treated in hospital after suffering a seizure and was unable to talk because he had vigorously chewed the inside of his mouth during the convulsion, the court heard today . Dunford had promised to get Ms Branco ‘deported back to Brazil’ and claimed he had Jade Goody widow Jack Tweed’s lawyers working for him. Dunford labelled Ms Branco ‘the most vile and fake’ person he had ever met, and maintained that he was going to do everything in his power to stop her ruining him, the court heard. Mr Thomson reassured Dunford that he would not be going to jail. Sentencing was later adjourned until 12 March while reports are prepared.

"Looted treasure: This gold-plated bronze figurine was stolen from a museum in Hama, western Syria . Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men. Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each. The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy  Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey. The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year. The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC. It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance. The primary trade routes out of Syria are through neighbouring Turkey and Lebanon, with the homes and private museums owned by wealthy Europeans the eventual destination. One 21-year-old smuggler originally from the Syrian capital Damascus but now plying his trade in Beirut says the usual method of getting the items over the border is simply to pay a taxi driver already well known to the border guards to carry it in his boot. Calling himself 'Mohammed', the smuggler says his group do their best to make money selling ancient items such as earrings, rings, small statues and stone heads that were stolen from one of Syria's many looted museums, most of them in and around Aleppo. However his three-man outfit are positively small time compared to the large organised crime groups dealing with antiquities worth millions of pounds. These groups have the financial clout and connections to smuggle their items to Europe without arousing the suspicions of the authorities who mete out severe punishments to smugglers. Security: A Syrian police officer patrols the ancient of Palmyra to protect its ruins from looters and smugglers . Once the antiquities are outside Syria, they are generally passed on to middle men with connections to art collectors, usually in Europe of Gulf states such as Qatar or Dubai. Ahmed, a Syrian operating as a go-between in southern Turkey, claims to have recently sold a single item for $1.1 million. 'It was a piece from the year 8500BC,' he told the BBC. The middle men usually agree prices with dealers who observe the stolen items on Skype or by photographs sent online. In another sign of the organised criminal element behind the trade, the dealers then send their own teams to inspect and collect the items before the money is paid. The dealers are then able to use their contacts among wealthy art lovers to ensure the ancient items are found a new home, many of them private collections and secret museums of Europeans. Less valuable items - often still over 1,000 years old - typically find their way in to the back rooms of tourist shops in Beirut and southern Turkey, where those in the know ask to see what's on offer. Smuggling the products out of the country is the purchasers responsibility however, and the choice is between paying extortionate fees to have the items posted to an anonymous address in the West, or otherwise risk imprisonment by carrying the items on to planes and buses on their person. Making them rich: The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year . ISIS is believed to generate a total of several million pounds a day, with approximately £400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil. A further £250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control, while ISIS also makes money from farming, water services and electricity production. Revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate, but the price for release is usually millions of pounds. Companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under ISIS' control - with lorries charged £500 per journey, plus a further £250 tax for electronic good and £200 for food parcels. However one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command. For example, one Iraqi intelligence official claimed that ISIS earned £23 million in early 2014 alone by selling 800 items stolen from the ancient city of Al-Nabk near Damascus.","ISIS are selling 10,000-year-old antiques for as much as $1 million each .

"Britain's most jealous woman who forces her husband to take a lie detector test to check he is being faithful is now having a gastric band operation on the NHS to ensure he does not stray. Debbi Wood, who weighs 21 stone, hit headlines last year after admitting that she forces her husband Steve to take the test whenever he goes out, in a bid to curb her extreme jealousy. The 43-year-old, from Leicester, also checks his phone, e-mail accounts and bank statements and even bans him from watching TV shows featuring Holly Willoughby and Anne Robinson, who she suspects he fancies. Scroll down for video . Controlling: Debbi Wood, 43, from Leicester, wants a gastric band operation paid for by the NHS so she can lose ten stone and reduce the risk of her husband Steve, 32, being unfaithful to her . The 43-year-old, from Leicester (lefts) checks Steve's (right) phone, e-mail accounts and bank statements and even bans him from watching TV shows featuring Holly Willoughby and Anne Robinson . Mrs Wood's jealousy is caused by Othello Syndrome, a psychiatric disorder which causes sufferers to believe their partners have been unfaithful, even without evidence. Now the size 24 mother-of-two wants the £2,500 taxpayer-funded operation so she can lose ten stone and be less anxious about her 32-year-old husband cheating. Mrs Wood, who does not work, said she would have paid for the operation herself, but cannot afford to have the surgery privately. She told The Sun: 'I think he will be less likely to run away with someone else if he has a slim and pretty wife at home.' Mr Wood, 32, is now a full-time carer for his wife, who is unable to work due to back pain associated with her weight. Together, the pair receive almost £1,500 per month in benefits, including income support, carer's allowance and disability and housing allowance. Mrs Wood said she cannot exercise because of her size but is 'really careful' about what she eats. She said the pair occasionally 'treat themselves at the chippy' but that she has not had a McDonald's Big Mac for five years. Paranoid: Mrs Wood suffers from a psychiatric disorder which causes sufferers to believe their partners have been unfaithful, even without evidence . The mother-of-two (left) is unable to work due to back pain associated with her weight and says she cannot afford to pay for the surgery herself. Mr Wood (pictured right with his wife) is now her full-time carer . True love: The couple met in 2011 over Facebook and got married in November last year . Yesterday, she posted on her Facebook page: 'All i got to say is mmm starbucks and burgerking, lol 2nd cheeseburger...in 5 years xx' Instead, Mrs Wood said she eats a healthy diet including chicken, fresh vegetables and fish and even bought a treadmill to try and lose some weight. But she is still continuing to gain weight and, despite being a size 14 when the pair first met, is now a  size 24. She said: 'I used to be thin - I had an attractive hourglass figure like Sophia Loren. I'd love to have my old body back.' Mrs Wood has already had the tests to see if she is eligible for the operation and hopes to be fitted with the band later this year. Happy ever after: The pair (pictured on their wedding day) hit the headlines last year after Mrs Wood admitted forcing husband to take a lie detector test whenever he returns home to prove that he has been faithful . And she has already said that, if she does lose weight and find a new lease of life, she would be willing to take a lie detector test herself, to prove to her husband that she has not been unfaithful. She said: 'I'm sure Steve is worried I'll slim down and leave him for someone else. Once I've slimmed down, if Steve wants me to take a lie detector test then I will.' Meanwhile, Mr Wood said he is looking forward to his wife having the operation and hopes that, by fixing her physical issues, it will help her mental health problems. The couple started dating in 2011 after they met through a friend. Mrs Wood had spent ten years living in the U.S. but moved back to Britain five years ago after another long-term relationship broke down. She was so heartbroken that she vowed to never get into another relationship - and experts believe the emotional trauma triggered her illness. Controlling: Debbi Wood, 43, is a size 24 but thinks if she lost ten stone that she would not be paranoid any longer . Testing times: Mrs Wood has even said that she is happy to take a lie detector test if her husband begins to feel paranoid about cheating when she loses weight . She had said: 'I think he’s gorgeous, but that’s not the issue - it’s about whether or not I can trust him not to look at other women while he is out on his own,' she had said. ‘I don’t want him thinking they’re hot. If you’re in a relationship and you’re happy with your partner, you should only have eyes for that person.’ Mrs Wood was living in her native Scotland when a mutual friend introduced her to Mr Wood on Facebook a year later. Suspicious: Othello, played here by actor Lenny Henry . Othello Syndrome is a psychiatric disorder where a person is convinced their partner is being unfaithful - but with very little, if any, proof to confirm their fears. The name is derived from Shakespeare’s Othello, who killed his wife Desdemona after suspecting her infidelity. The condition presents itself as jealous and controlling behaviour and sometimes violence - but the two main characteristics are delusions and obsessions. In men the jealousy tends to focus around sexual infidelity, whereas in women it may centre around emotional betrayal. Treatment includes antidepressant and antipsychotic medication and/or therapy. It is not known how common the syndrome is but one study suggests the average onset is at age 68 and with 62 per cent of sufferers male. After exchanging messages for several weeks, she travelled to London where the pair had their first date. She said at the time: ‘I knew we were meant to be a couple when we shared our first kiss under London Bridge. I didn’t mean to fall in love again after my last relationship but Steve stole my heart. ‘The only problem was that we lived so far apart. We started to get serious and made plans to move in together but I then discovered that Steve had been seeing another girl around the time we’d first met. ‘He claimed he didn’t think we were exclusive because of the distance and I forgave him but I started to doubt whether or not he could be faithful.’ Mrs Wood, who also suffers from bipolar and body dysmorphic disorders, added that her jealousy got worse when the pair moved in together as she tried to monitor Mr Wood’s every move. She installed child-proof filters on his laptop and mobile phone to stop him looking at explicit pictures of women and banned him from watching any television programmes featuring women, even programmes such as The Weakest Link. ‘One night, an advert for a women’s razor came on television and I felt panicky thinking that Steve was eyeing the model up,' she said. 'The only thing that could put my mind at rest was banning him from watching any programmes that have women in them. ‘Now, I won’t even let him watch The Weakest Link in case he fancies Anne Robinson but I’m scared he’ll have a sneaky look when I’m in another room. ‘That’s why I decided to order the lie detector online. It was my only way of knowing for sure if Steve’s eyes were wandering. In general, he’s quite truthful but I have caught him lying a few times about looking at other women.’ Mrs Wood was diagnosed with Othello Syndrome last September, with the condition affecting her so badly that she could barely leave the house. She was prescribed anti-anxiety medication and also underwent therapy to deal with her issues. The name of the condition is derived from the play by William Shakespeare, in which the character of Othello murders his wife Desdemona after suspecting infidelity.","Debbi Wood, 43, is paranoid her husband Steve, 32, will be unfaithful to her .

"London’s estate agents earned an astonishing £1.1billion in fees last year - up 23 per cent on the figure in 2013, a study revealed today. Sellers in the capital paid £9,384 on average in agent fees on each property sale in 2014 - with the largest amount earned by estate agents being the £73million in Kensington & Chelsea. This was up 16 per cent on the previous year, while the figure in second-placed Westminster was up 14 per cent to £70million, according to research by online estate agents HouseSimple. London market: Sellers in the capital paid out £9,384 on average in agent fees on each property sale in 2014 . Broken down by borough: London’s estate agents raked in an astonishing £1.1billion in fees last year . The biggest percentage rise in fees was observed in the home of the 2012 Olympics in Newham, up 55 per cent to £18million, while neighbouring Waltham Forest was up 49 per cent to £24million. Also performing well for estate agents were Greenwich, Barking & Dagenham and Tower Hamlets - up 50 per cent to £31million, 45 per cent to £12million and 42 per cent to £50million respectively. The figures were revealed as the ONS reported today that UK house prices climbed 10 per cent in 2014 to take the average to £272,000 - including a 13 per cent rise in London to £502,000, . Alex Gosling, chief executive of HouseSimple, said: ‘After their performance last year, you’d be hard pressed to find a high street estate agent without a Cheshire Cat-sized grin on their face.’ He told MailOnline: ‘Properties in desirable London boroughs were practically selling themselves, and yet high street agents stubbornly kept their fee levels high. ‘Many sellers were probably asking the same question: “Why am I paying tens of thousands of pounds in fees to you when the first person to view made an offer which I accepted?”’ He claimed that 2 per cent of home sales are currently done through online estate agents - but if 20 per cent of people had used them last year they would have saved £210million in fees. HouseSimple was founded by Mr Gosling and his wife Sophie in 2007, and it claims to have sold or let £1billion worth of property and saved UK homeowners a total of £13million in fees.","Fees figure for 2014 up 23% on 2013, according to HouseSimple study .

"The pimping case against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn looks to have collapsed, after the prosecutor called for all charges to be dropped. 'Neither the judicial enquiry nor the hearing' proved Strauss-Kahn was guilty of procuring prostitutes for sex parties he attended in Paris, Brussels and Washington, prosecutor Frederic Fevre said. He added DSK's 'notoriety shouldn't be in any way a presumption of guilt' and the decision to acquit was 'pure and simple'. Cleared: The French prosecutor has said former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn should be cleared of all charges against him . The former shoo-in as the socialist presidential candidate showed little reaction as the statements were made in the courtroom today. The announcement came after four prostitutes - the main prosecution witnesses in the trial in Lille, northern France, in which the 65-year-old is accused of aggravated pimping - dropped their accusations. DSK was accused of aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women between 2009 and 2011 in what prosecutors were claiming was an organised sex ring using prostitutes. He and 13 other defendants deny charges of pimping. DSK, who took the stand for three days last week, has consistently maintained he had no idea the women participating in sex parties were prostitutes, nor that he organised the parties himself - both of which would have had to have been proved in order to be convicted of pimping. DSK had particularly objected to a claim by one woman who said she cried and gestured that she did not want to perform a certain sex act with him, but that he smiled and went ahead anyway. A court sketch shows French businessman Fabrice Paszkowski,  Dominique Strauss-Kahn and ex-director of the BTP Eiffage construction group subsidiary David Roquet, all defendants in the 'Carlton Case' Case: The former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn leaves his hotel this morning to attend a session on the third week of the so-called 'Lille Carlton Hotel Case' trial . Protest: A topless Femen protester climbs on top of the car carrying former IMF chief Dominique Strauss Kahn to court last week . ‘It’s not my concept of sexuality to do it with a prostitute,’ DSK said, adding that he preferred the ‘party atmosphere’ of partner-swapping and swinging. DSK said despite the idea given in court papers of ‘frenetic activity’, the orgies were organised four times a year because he had been very busy ‘saving the world from catastrophe’ at the time of the financial crisis. In court, he also revealed he had had a 'complicated relationship' with his ex-wife, the art heiress Anne Sinclair. But yesterday, when the prostitutes who had made a series of allegations - including many alleging they had been powerless to stop him subjecting them to painful sex acts performed at orgies around the world - withdrew their complaints, the trial looked like it was on the verge of collapse. One of the women’s rights group that was supporting them also withdrew their complaint, leaving just one other organisation called Nid still maintaining the allegation. Today, the prosecutor asked the judge to acquit DSK - something the judge will have to consider. Fevre said: 'The 14 accused have already paid a strong price [by having their private lives dragged into the press]. 'This is not a mafia network, but a group of egotistical friends, of ambitions and sexual pleasures. 'They lost everything. I ask the court to take this into its consideration.' It is thought it will take a number of weeks to see if he is actually exonerated, according to French website L'Actualitie24. If found guilty, he would have faced up to ten years in prison and a fine of more than £1million. Despite a number of previous high-profile accusations against him, including being arrested on suspicion of the attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid in New York, the Lille case is the first time that DSK has faced trial.","Prosecutor says charges should be dropped against Dominic Strauss-Kahn .

"When three-year-old Cain Trainor disappeared on his first day at nursery, his distraught mother Gemma feared the worst. She dashed to the school to be met by tearful staff. Her panic grew, until a neighbour phoned to say Cain was safe – he was waiting for her on the doorstep after walking the one and a half miles home. Incredibly, although he hardly knew the way, he had completed the 40-minute journey alone along nine streets, a cycle path and woodland, crossing a stream on what is known locally as the Devil’s Bridge route. Scroll down for video . Cain Trainor (pictured with mother, Gemma) went missing from nursery and walked 1.5 miles home . He had remembered to cross the road – with a group of children – where there was a lollipop lady and had even popped into a supermarket to check if his mother was there buying milk. Mrs Trainor, 32, says she is not angry with her ‘lively little monkey’ and was reassured when he said he remembered her advice not to talk to strangers. She described how she experienced the ‘worst moment of my life’ hours after leaving her son on his first day at the Little Owls playgroup in Middlesbrough. Cain went missing at 3.20pm as he and his class were being transferred from the nursery to the after-school session on the same site at Newham Bridge Primary School. He walked the route dubbed 'Devil's Bridge', which is made up of cycle paths, woods and roads he barely knew (pictured, he re-walks the route) Three-year-old Cain disappeared at the end of the day as staff were taking him to the after-school club . Mrs Trainor, who works for a housing charity, said she had no reception on her phone at work. Once outside, she saw the school and Little Owls had tried several times to call her, so she rang them. ‘They started the conversation with something like, “I don’t want to worry you, but we seem to have lost Cain”,’ she said. ‘I felt sick – there aren’t words to describe that feeling of something terrible happening.’ She dashed to the school in ‘total panic’ and was met by distraught staff. ‘When I got there, they were all in tears. The headteacher came running over, saying they didn’t know what had happened. Cain walked the 1.5 mile route through woodland and roads he barely knew from his nursery on Cayton Drive to his home in Saltersgill, Middlesbrough . ‘Then within seconds, I got a phone call from my next-door neighbour saying Cain had arrived home. I burst into tears with relief. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I just kept thinking of what could have happened.’ Yesterday Cain explained his journey home, saying: ‘I walked past the lollipop lady and she went on to the road and stopped all the cars and then I went over the road and down an alley and came home.’ He was vaguely familiar with part of the route, having used it during summer bike rides with his father Ross, a maintenance engineer. His mother says that she will continue to send him to the nursery despite the incident, which made her 'feel sick' Little Owls playgroup has apologised and said it will be putting a tighter procedures in place and will work with Ofsted and Middlesbrough Council to ensure it has the 'best practices in place' Mrs Trainor said: ‘As far as Cain was concerned he had done everything right and been very safe and responsible. 'He didn’t realise that everyone around him was going frantic. In a funny way, I’m quite proud that he managed to find his way home.’ Cain will continue to attend Little Owls after his mother was reassured by its response to the drama, which unfolded a fortnight ago. Playgroup manager Kate Murphy said Cain’s family had been ‘understanding’. It is tightening its procedures.","Cain Trainor went missing from Little Owls playgroup in Middlesbrough .

"Backing return: Lynne Truss has called for the return of 1960s and 70s panel show Many a Slip as a gentle daily reminder of language laws . It entertained her as a teenager and taught her much of what she knows about grammar today. And now Lynne Truss has called for the return of 1960s and 70s panel show Many a Slip as a gentle daily reminder of language laws. Yesterday Miss Truss, 59, who is best known for her book Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation, said she thinks the programme was axed because pointing out mistakes have become associated with ‘mean-spiritedness, snobbishness and judgmentalism’. It means errors such as a misplaced apostrophe or forgotten comma – which can change the meaning of a sentence altogether – are allowed to go unmentioned. And as a result poor grammar has crept into acceptable use. Raising the call for the return of Ian Messiter’s Many a Slip, which ended its run in 1979, Miss Truss said: ‘I find it slightly odd that the excellent Just a Minute (similarly devised by Ian Messiter) has survived right through to the present day, while Many a Slip last appeared on the airwaves the year that Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister, Sid Vicious died, and President Carter was attacked by a killer rabbit. I wonder why it died? ‘What has happened since 1979, I suspect, is that the spotting of mistakes has become entirely associated with mean-spiritedness, snobbishness and judgmentalism. But if you listen to Many a Slip, you will find that the spotting of mistakes can be, on the contrary, funny and interesting, and surprisingly easy to join in with. ‘Besides, no one can argue that the world is now such an easy-going, forgiving sort of place, where no errors are ever drawn attention to. It’s quite the opposite, with social media permanently poised to jump on (and punish) the slightest slip-up of behaviour, or judgment, from celebrities.’ She added: ‘I really think they should bring it back. It could be wildly popular. But who’d chair it? Who would dare?’ Many a Slip, which aired for 14 years, was a game show that revolved around spotting errors in passages of text. They could be contradictions, errors of fact or grammar or repetition. And it involved light teasing between the two teams which both entertained and educated listeners. Miss Truss is best known for her book Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation . Reminiscing about the programme Miss Truss said: ‘This was such a gentle game. Since the mistakes were all intentional, no one was made to look stupid. The listeners were not only entertained but gently educated. As a teenaged listener, I was in awe at the cleverness of such regular contestants as Isobel Barnett and David Nixon. ‘They could hear a sentence such as, “He was mortally wounded so badly that he died” and buzz in with the objection, “Tautology!” I mention this because although spotting tautology isn’t the most important of all life skills, I do owe my own awareness of tautology’s existence entirely to Many a Slip.’ Miss Truss’ other books about punctuation include The Girl’s Like Spaghetti: Why, You Can’t Manage Without Apostrophes! And Twenty-Odd Ducks: Why, Every Punctuation Mark Counts!, . Writing in the Radio Times, she said: ‘The world is full of people who love to spot a mistake. Not only do they love to spot them, they enjoy pointing them out as well. I can say this with such confidence because ever since I wrote my book on grammar, I receive sightings of mistakes virtually every day, some of which are (unintentionally) rather brilliant. 'Outside a card shop, for example, it might say: “Spoil your loved one’s Valentine’s Day 14 February” – when the actual intention was to write: “Spoil your loved ones! Valentine’s Day, 14 February.” 'Similarly, there is (according to legend, anyway) a sign inside the door to a block of flats somewhere that says: “Residents refuse to go in the bins”. But who can blame those residents for refusing to go in the bins? If you lived there, I absolutely guarantee you would refuse to go in the bins as well.’ On Saturday Miss Truss will introduce her favourite programmes from the Radio 4 archive – including Many a Slip – in a three-hour Radio 4 Extra broadcast called Lynne Truss: Pick of the Archive.","Lynne Truss, 59, is best known for writing a book about punctuation .

"A devoted husband has completed seven of the world's toughest marathons in seven days for his childhood sweetheart. Ted Jackson, 42, from Surrey, has ran 182 miles through the icy blizzards and desert terrain for his wife, Sophie, 40, who suffers from multiple sclerosis - an incurable neurological disease. The father-of-four, has raised more than £160,000 from running the marathons in  seven continents, which  took more than 45 hours to complete. Ted Jackson from Surrey, pictured here crossing the finish line in Australia, competed in seven marathons in seven days for his wife Sophie who suffers from multiple sclerosis . Sophie was diagnosed in 2010 and has had the help of the charity Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis. By running the marathons Ted raised £160,000 for them . Ted's campaign will help the charity, Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis (OMS), that helps sufferers with the day to day challenges the condition brings. Ted said: 'I was determined to complete the seven marathons for my childhood sweetheart. 'She means the world to me, our family was left devastated when she was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.' He continued: 'It is such an awful disease that millions of people suffer from, but the charity changed our lives and that's why I became so adamant to raise so much money for them. 'There's no cure to MS and it has often felt like a death sentence but since being introduced to OMS, Sophie's life has changed dramatically. 'There used to be a cloud hanging over her head but the charity has really helped her so I wanted to do as much as I could to raise awareness. Ted took part in marathons around the world including Miami (left) and Chile (right) Ted poses in Australia after completing seven marathons in seven days, the Sydney Opera House can be seen behind him . Ted says he wasn't much of a runner before but the thought of his childhood sweetheart, Sophie, got him through . 'I signed myself up for the event without thinking - I'm not athletic at all, that's why I wanted to do it, to prove that if I can do it anyone can. 'I put myself in a position where failing wasn't an option, I often sign up to things without thinking but thankfully I'm stubborn and determined enough to power through.' Competitors had to complete each marathon in under eight hours and often only had time to sleep in airport lounges and on flights as they ran through marathons in Antarctica, Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco, Dubai, before finishing in Sydney. His fundraising on Iknowtedjackson.com drew attention from celebrities including Phillip Schofield, Clare Balding and Gary Linekar. Ted was surprised to complete the challenge with very little training for the events in some of the harshest of conditions. He said: 'For me there was 500 per cent more effort going into fundraising than training for the actual marathons, I knew I'd be able to do it - thinking of Sophie got me through. 'The Antarctic marathon was one the most interesting, getting there is so difficult because it's such a remote area, then you have the cold to deal with, by the end of the marathon there were icicles forming on my beard.' Ted relied on compression socks, and careful taping of his sore feet to get through the seven marathons . Joker Ted poses in very little clothing with one of his fellow marathon runners in Antarctica . Ted says that his hardest challenge came on the fifth day: 'Day five's marathon in Marrakesh was the toughest. Having done three marathons in the space of 37 hours I was extremely tired. 'In Dubai's marathon I took a break from the road to sing the song, Nessun Dorma, for a couple who were getting married on the beach. 'It must have been quite a surreal moment for them but I had time to spare on the run and thought it would be something special to make their day. 'They didn't speak English so I couldn't be sure but they seemed to enjoy it, I posed for a few pictures then went back to running.' At the final finish line in Sydney, Australia, Ted was greeted by Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis, Professor George Jelinek, who runs the charity that improved the quality of Sophie's life. The programme encourages MS patients to increase the amount of Vitamin D they intake and eat a meat-free low-saturated fat diet, which dramatically improved Sophie's life after she was diagnosed in 2010. Sophie and Ted met when they were 18 and she says they have been inseparable ever since . Ted looks please to see wife Sophie who says she kept constant track of his progress during his challenge . Sophie says she knew Ted would complete the challenge even though he's not naturally active . Sophie first noticed something noticed something was wrong when her words became slurred while in the bath. At the time she feared she'd had a stroke but brain scans revealed she had multiple sclerosis - a condition that affects more 100,000 people in the UK. Sophie said: 'I wasn't given a lot of hope when they told me I had MS, you can't help but think of a lifetime of wheelchairs and pain. 'Me and Ted have been inseparable since we were 18 and it seemed like a big axe hanging over us, I dreaded the way the disease would affect our family. 'But since the programme I feel a lot more positive about the disease, I'm healthier and am thinking a lot more about life beyond the disease. 'I'm amazed at Ted, he's not a runner or an athlete by any stretch of the imagination, and he knew that, that's why he choose the hardest one out there.' Sophie went to cheer her husband on at marathon number four in Madrid with daughter, Alabama, 17, taking a picture to mark the moment. She said: 'He didn't know I was coming so was just overwhelmed to see me. He looked absolutely exhausted but I knew he could do it. 'I kept in constant contact tracking his whereabouts and how he was getting on, with every marathon he completed I knew he was one step closer to home. 'When we went to pick him up from the airport it was amazing, there were around 50 kids from the boarding school where we work who came to welcome him home. 'The charity has really changed my life, it has given me a spring in my step again so knowing Ted's raised so much for this charity is astonishing, he truly is my hero.' When Ted arrived back home after his grueling challenge he was greeted by happy friends and family .","Devoted husband Ted Jackson took part in the World Marathon Challenge .

"Ever since they were discovered in 1873, scientists have been trying to find out the origin of the millions of potato-sized metal balls that carpet the world's oceans. Known as manganese nodules, these lumps contain valuable metals that scientists someday hope to harvest from the sea floor. Now German scientists could be closer to solving the mystery of their origin after stumbling on the largest patch of manganese nodules ever found in the Atlantic. Ever since they were discovered in 1873, scientists have been trying to find out the origin of potato-sized metal balls that carpet the world's oceans. Now German scientists could be closer to solving that mystery after stumbling on the largest patch of manganese nodules ever found in the Atlantic . The R/V Sonne, a research ship, was several hundred miles east of Barbados when a net meant to capture marine life instead captured manganese ore nodules. A remote camera later revealed that the seafloor was littered with these metal rocks ranging in size from golf balls to bowling balls. With growth rates of between one to five millimetres in a million years, some of the nodules could be 10 million years old, the researchers said. 'I was surprised, because this is generally not the place you think of for manganese nodules,' said Colin Devey, chief scientist for the expedition  at the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research told LiveScience. With growth rates of between one to five millimetres in a million years, some of the nodules could be 10 million years old, the researchers said. Pictured is a stock image of a manganese nodule . These metal balls consist of the manganese, iron and other coveted metals such as copper, cobalt or zinc . Manganese nodules have been found in every ocean, but are most common in the Pacific Ocean. Manganese nodules have been found in every ocean, but are most common in the Pacific Ocean. These particular nodules were found in waters roughly 16,400ft and 18,000ft (5,000 and 5,500 metres) deep. One theory as to how they came to be is that they were formed by chemical reactions in seawater that were boosted by microbes. Another suggests the nodules to form from precipitation of metals from seawater, especially from volcanic thermal vents.

These metal balls consist of the manganese and contain iron and other coveted metals such as copper, cobalt or zinc. Since the 1970s, they have been considered a possible source of raw materials. But due to the large water depths and the associated technical complexity and potential environmental damages, no commercial exploitation is currently in sight. At the same time, manganese nodules are scientifically of great interest since they can be used as climate and environmental archives. Manganese nodules grow like a pearl shell around a nucleus and as a result record information on the prevailing environmental conditions. Since the nodules grow very slowly, they provide a record of the world's early climate history. Scientists are now hoping to analyse the nodules in greater detail to understand exactly how they formed. They say greater analysis could also unlock the secrets to our planet's changing climate. Manganese nodules have been found in every ocean, but are most common in the Pacific Ocean. One theory as to how they came to be is that they were formed by chemical reactions in seawater boosted by microbes .

"Indicted: Nicole DuFault, 35, is charged with 40 counts of aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child for allegedly having trysts with 14- and 15-year-old boys . A female New Jersey high school teacher accused of having sex with six male students is now facing a 40-count indictment in New Jersey. Essex County authorities say 35-year-old Nicole DuFault, of Caldwell, is charged with aggravated sexual assault and child endangerment. Authorities say the victims were 14- and 15-year-old boys and the assaults occurred repeatedly in 2013 and 2014. They say some of the sex acts took place on school property and in DuFault's car. The indictment was made public Tuesday. DuFault, a divorced mother of two, was a language arts teacher at Columbia High School for several years before she was arrested in September. She remains free on $500,000 bail. Her attorney has said the charges 'run contrary to her commendable background and unblemished work performance.' The teacher is due back in court March 6. In investigating the allegations against DuFault, 34, authorities said they had discovered a video in her home that depicted the educator performing oral sex on one of the victims - along with a piece of clothing she was wearing at the time. DuFault is charged with several counts of aggravated sexual . assault and endangering the welfare of a child, NJ.com reported. At least one other victim is supposedly present in the video. DuFault has been a language arts teacher for nine years at Columbia High School (pictured) in Maplewood, New Jersey. Prosecutors say some of the assaults happened in her car and on school property and that they now have eyewitnesses to testify . Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Gina Iosim argued in September that DuFault had seen two prior complaints lodged against her at Columbia High School for 'lack of professionalism and her conduct.' She was accused of having 'inappropriate sexual conversations in the classroom,' in one complaint. Broken home: DuFault's two sons, ages 2 and 4, have been removed from her custody, and her husband left her last year . She was also accused of lying about her work experience on her resume, listing one former employer where she never actually worked. Prosecutors . in Essex County said after her arrest that DuFault, who taught language arts at Columbia . High School for nine years, assaulted the boys during the regular . academic year and summer school between 2013-2014. The . encounters allegedly took place in the teacher's car and the school's . campus in Maplewood, New Jersey, and included oral sex and intercourse, . authorities charge. She faces 12 separate charges. Each alleged victim was 14 or 15 at the time of the encounters. DuFault's two sons, ages 2 and 4, have been removed from her custody. Her husband left her last year, reported CBS New York. Beyond the videotape, the state evidence reportedly includes statements from at least five of the victims about their encounters with DuFault and witnesses that also 'witnessed her in sexual acts with others.' Ms DuFault was arrested at her home September 17, 2014. One neighbor, who's known the teacher for six years, was shocked to hear about the allegations. 'Seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work,' Maureen Messina told CBS New York. .","Nicole DuFault, 35, is charged with aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child .

"It might be one of London's smallest galleries but the Fan Museum in Greenwich does have a very good shop as the Duchess of Cornwall discovered today. Camilla was making her fourth visit to the museum, which opened in 1991, when one of the pieces on sale in the attached boutique caught her eye. Shopping, however, was not the reason for the Duchess' visit. Instead, she was there to inspect a new exhibition called Waterloo: Life and Times. New fan: The Duchess of Cornwall toured the Fan Museum in Greenwich this morning . Launched to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, the new exhibition features fans and fan leaves made to commemorate the Iron Duke's victory over Napoleon. Unsurprisingly, the Duke of Wellington himself features on many of the fans, most of which date from between 1800 and 1820, as does Nelson. The Duchess, 67, was businesslike in a tailored pinstriped suit for the visit and looked particularly taken with a delicate Spanish fan that boasted an intricate lacy pattern cut from white damask. Shown around by conservation expert Yuki Burt, Camilla stopped to inspect fans featuring the Duke of Wellington and Admiral Nelson, asking questions as she went. Afterwards, the Duchess was shown into the Museum's Orangery, where she was shown the new mural decorating the back wall and had the secrets of re-ribboning a brisé [broken] fan explained. Happy shopper: The Duchess of Cornwall left the museum clutching three white shopping bags . I'll take the lot! The Duchess of Cornwall appeared to enjoy having a look around the Museum shop . Hidden gem: Camilla was on her fourth visit to the Museum, which contains more than 5,000 antique fans . Speaking about the museum, which the Duchess is believed to consider 'a hidden gem', curator Jacob Moss said: 'We have a very quirky reputation and we're an oasis of calm where people can step back into another world. 'We have a really exciting programme of exhibitions this year which we hope offer something for everyone. 'I would definitely encourage people to come and see us and stop off for afternoon tea in the Orangery.' Her visit to the Fan Museum came after a morning spent visiting the  men and women being cared for at a community centre run by homelessness charity, Emmaus. Camilla was shown around the centre by Craig Dunstan, himself a former rough sleeper who lived on the streets for nine months before being rescued by the charity. New exhibition: The Duchess was at the museum to see new exhibition, Waterloo: Life and Times . Improvements: Fan conservation expert Yuki Burt (right) shows the Duchess how to fix a brisé fan . Favourite: The Duchess was particularly taken with a Portuguese fan featuring a picture of the Iron Duke . Fascinated: The Duchess spent much of the tour asking questions and apparently adores the Fan Museum . Top form: The Duchess was businesslike in a grey pinstripe suit for her visit to the museum . Elaborate: Most of the fans shown to the Duchess of Cornwall dated from between 1800 and 1820 . Quirky: Curator Jacob Moss says the museum is 'quirky' but has something for everyone . The Duchess, who has been patron of Emmaus since 2006, stopped for a cup of tea with some of the people living in the shelter before officially opening a new accommodation block with space for 27 extra beds. 'This just shows what can be done when charities work together to produce something as good as this,' said Camilla as she unveiled a plaque to mark the opening. 'I've visited a lot of Emmaus communities and I'm very, very proud to be part of it because I think it's an incredible homeless charity which gives people hope and positivity and gives them back their dignity to get into the system again and go back to work. 'Emmaus communities are springing up all over the country and each one I visit has this wonderful, positive feel. I hope we can get more people looked after and housed in the future.' People cared for by Emmaus are also given the chance to learn new skills, among them painting and decorating and basic plumbing, all of which are taught in a bid to help the formerly homeless get back into normal life. Busy day: The Duchess began her day with a cup of tea at a community centre in Kennington . Patron: The centre is run by homelessness charity Emmaus, of which she has been patron since 2006 . Unveiling: During the visit, Camilla unveiled a plaque to mark the opening of a new accommodation block . Meanwhile... Down-to-earth Princess Anne mingles with the crowds at Thame Market . While the Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a genteel visit to the Fan Museum in Greenwich, Princess Anne was in Oxfordshire to meet stallholders at Thame Market. The market is celebrating its 800th birthday and the Princess Royal joined locals to mark the occasion, and also unveiled a plaque. Tasty: Princess Anne is all smiles as a stallholder with a unique hairstyle explains her business . She's behind you! A lady packs away her purchase as Princess Anne passes behind her almost unnoticed . Thame's Tuesday market started life in 1183, although official recognition took another 20 years - eventually granted by King John in 1215. Held on behalf of the townspeople by Bishop Hugh Troteman, the original charter allowed the town to hold a market once a been and a 'three to four day' fair once a year. Renewed twice more, by Henry III in 1227 and Edward III in 1329, Thame's market charter is still in force today, although the cattle sales included in it have been moved to a different location away from the centre of town.

"A playground dealer was charged with supply class A drugs at an infant, junior or primary school in 2013, according for figures released as part of a Freedom of Information request . Drug dealers sold heroin and amphetamines outside an Essex primary school, it has been revealed. The dealer was charged with supplying the class A narcotic in 2013, according to figures released by Essex Police as part of a  Freedom of Information request. The figures come just weeks after it was revealed in parliament that one primary school age pupil  is suspended every week for being drunk or high on drugs. The figures released  last month showed that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs. The Department for Education said it included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse. There are 39 weeks in the average school year, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 is suspended every week. At secondary school the situation is even worse, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13. Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline:'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence.' As part of a Freedom of Information request Essex Police confirmed it had investigated a total of 122 drug offences at schools in the county since 2010. They also dished out a warning for possession of cannabis at a nursery or creche in 2012. In 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 was suspended every week during term-time . In each instance the school has not been identified and the force has been unable to say exactly who was involved. A total of 32 offences were committed by youths and all but 15 involved the possession of cannabis. More than half  were dealt with by a reprimand, caution or warning, while a further 25 received some form of community resolution. In 17 case someone was charged. At secondary schools, 6,500 pupils were temporarily excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse . Nick Alston, Police and Crime Commissioner for Essex, said: 'It is disturbing to see evidence of any drug-related activities taking place in educational establishments. 'However, it would be naive to believe this doesn't go on as, for many years, some young people have been tempted to experiment with drugs.' Ray Gooding, Essex county councillor for education, said: 'The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of the utmost importance. 'We work with schools throughout Essex, along with partner agencies, to educate pupils on drug misuse. 'However, we are not complacent and as these figures demonstrate, there is still work to be done.'","Police charged dealer with selling heroin outside Essex primary School .

"The thought of putting on weight fills most A-listers with dread - but that hasn't stopped Spanish artist David Lopera, 20, from digitally fattening them up. He then sells the altered images to men who like larger ladies - and is happy to take commissions that focus on a specific celebrity. Among the famous women fattened up at the request of the men he describes as 'chubby chasers' are Rita Ora, Iggy Azaelea, Kim Kardashian and even Frozen's Princess Elsa. Scroll down for video . It's Kim but not as you know her: One of Mr Lopera's requests was for a supersized Kim Kardashian . And business certainly seems to be booming, with Mr Lopera, who comes from Menorca, revealing that he has been inundated with requests. 'Men are always writing to me asking if I can make their celebrities crushes look a bit fatter,' he explains. 'Emma Watson, Jennifer Lawrence and Kim Kardashian are some of the most popular requests I get.' Mr Lopera, who is in a relationship with a 'plump' woman himself, says that he, like his clients, thinks the famous faces look better with extra weight. 'These women look much better when they're overweight,' he says. 'I prefer Elsa [of Frozen fame] when she's a fat princess - that's a real woman right there.' First go: Mr Lopera's first star was Katy Perry (left). Since then he has fattened up  Iggy Azalea among others . Popular: Mr Lopera says Mila Kunis is 'much sexier' with chunky thighs and a bulging belly . Now the 20-year-old is hoping to become internationally famous for his Photoshop work, all while showing the world that flab is better than abs. 'Look at my pictures and you will see that big is beautiful,' says Mr Lopera, who says plump is always more attractive than stick thin. 'For example, Mila Kunis is much sexier with chunky thighs and a bulging belly that hangs around her waist.' A computer technician by day, Mr Lopera has been amusing himself with Photoshop art since his school days. But he only began making money from his hobby after his altered image of an obese Katy Perry went viral after being published on Deviantart last year. Who's that girl? Rita Ora piles on the pounds in a photo altered by artist David Lopera . Time consuming: Each image takes up to two days to complete. Pictured: Cobbie Smulders gets a makeover . Cartoon: Mr Lopera is even asked to manipulate Disney characters such as The Little Mermaid's Ariel . David (pictured) hopes to make his photo-shopping a full time career in the future . 'I love Katy Perry but she would look much more sexy with a few extra pounds,' says Mr Lopera. 'So for my own pleasure, I manipulated her first album cover to make her look a bit chubby. 'I uploaded it online and soon, men were messaging me with requests to Photoshop other stars to look flabby.' In less than a year, Mr Lopera has received over 200 requests from men across the world, all of whom like to fantasise about celebrities with a bit of podge. Each work takes around two days - with four to six hours spent on each in total - to complete. 'Usually each manipulation takes a few days but there have been times when I've spent a whole week on just one,' he explains. Part of the reason for the lengthy production time is that clients have very specific ideas about how they want the final result to look. 'I know my clients want their fat celebs to look as realistic as possible,' he explains. 'Some even have an idea of how much they want them to weigh. I don't stop until they look perfectly plump. 'When I get requests to make Disney characters - like Elsa and Ariel - look fat, I have to make a digital drawing on a pen tablet. That can take a long time too.' Now Mr Lopera says he hopes to turn his part-time job into a full-time career. 'I would love to dedicate my life to this. 'The big women are beautiful but there are many people today who don't agree with that. However when they see my gorgeous, fat celebrities, I think they might realise how wrong they are.'","David Lopera, 20, digitally alters photos to make celebrities appear fatter .

"Amanda Knox was spotted in Seattle running errands on Valentine’s Day weekend for the first time since news of her engagement broke. The 27-year-old bride did a bit of shopping, while her musician fiancé Colin Sutherland went to work. Knox, who was not wearing an engagement ring, was seen walking through Chinatown on Valentine's Day before going for a curry with a female friend. During the first part of her outing, Knox was sporting a casual ensemble composed of a maxi red skirt paired with a black blouse, an olive-green parka lined with fur and lace-up ankle boots. Scroll down for videos . Lady in red: Amanda Knox was spotted in Seattle running errands solo on Valentine’s Day weekend . Taking a stroll: the 27-year-old bride-to-be was seen walking through Chinatown on Valentine's Day without her fiance . No bling: The newly betrothed 27-year-old was not wearing her engagement ring on her left hand . Engaged! Amanda Knox (right) is reportedly engaged to her childhood friend, musician Colin Sutherland (left) She later changed into a red sweater and a pair of black pants and headed to a restaurant. At one point, the 27-year-old bride-to-be appeared upset, wearing a concerned look on her face, blemished by what appeared to be a cold sore or a scratch over her lip. But the conversation with her mystery dinner companion apparently turned to a more pleasant topic later, because Knox turned animated and was seen smiling broadly and folding her hands over her chest, as if she was pretending to hug someone. The following day, Ms Knox headed to a Safeway supermarket for some food shopping. She emerged from the store sometime later laden with bulging grocery bags and sporting a pair of loose jeans, dark-colored clogs and the familiar parka coat. On Monday, the thrifty wife-to-be visited a Goodwill thrift store. New look: She later changed into a red sweater and a pair of black pants and headed to a restaurant . Anti-Valentine's Day: the newly engaged Ms Knox went for a curry with a female friend on Valentine's Day . Blushing bride: Knox appeared animated over dinner and was seen smiling broadly . At one point, the 27-year-old Knox seemed upset, wearing a concerned look on her face, blemished by what appeared to be a cold sore or a scratch . The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday. Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email but said nothing more. The pair were engaged last week. No date has been set for the nuptials. Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano. A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland once listed his name as Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence . Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing. She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald. Heavy burden: The following day, Ms Knox headed to a Safeway supermarket for some food shopping. Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again following an initial conviction, an overturning of that conviction followed by her reconviction along with Sollecito. It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the US, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009. The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology. Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007 . Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police. Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect. She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement. Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher. Home for good: While it's highly unlikely that Knox would be extradited no matter what happens in court in March, her ex Raffaele Sollecito must face the music in his home country . Still at risk: Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time.

"A woman is extremely lucky to be alive after her car drove off a rock wall of a car park into a New Zealand harbour and immediately began sinking at a frightening speed.

The petrified woman was squashed up against the rear window as the front end of the car was rapdily submerging into the Waitemata Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand, at 3pm on Tuesday . Fortunately witnesses called emergency services as quick-thinking policemen arrived and sprung straight into action by jumping into the water with one officer attempting to smash the window with a baton . Officers Paul Watts (left) and Simon Russell (right) then dragged the 63-year-old woman from the car to safety . The officers and a bystander couldn't open the doors so one officer attempted to smash the window with a baton with no luck. Once it became clear that it was not going to penetrate through the glass another officer was handed a rock and managed to shatter the rear window. The relieved woman was then pulled to safety by the two heroic policemen. The two officers who saved the woman's life - Paul Watts and Simon Russell  - have described the dangerous rescue, and revealed they believe she could have been less than a minute away from drowning. 'When we entered the water, I was talking to one of the (members of the public) who was trying to balance the vehicle and he said he was looking for a rock to try and smash the window,' Mr Russell told the New Zealand Herald. He said once his baton failed he successfully broke through the window with a rock, but by this time the car was sinking at a rapid rate. 'At that time the car actually started to move very fast into the water. I was trying to hold the car, slowing it down from entering the water,' Mr Russell said. Mr Watts and Mr Russell then managed to pull the woman from the car to safety, but said they got her out just in time. 'It was pretty close, probably 30 or 40 seconds after we managed to get the female out of the car, the car was already slipping further into the water,' Mr Watts said. 'I'd say she'd probably only had maximum probably another minute, minute-and-a-half if she hadn't got out,' he told the NZ Herald. Mr Watts described the dramatic rescue as 'pretty much part of a routine job being a police officer' in another interview, saying the whole operation only took about 40 seconds. The car was fully submerged just a minute after the woman was freed from it. The sunken BMW is frightening proof that the woman would not have made it without the help of the quick-thinking policemen . The woman is lucky to be alive after the frightening accident where her car careered into the harbour . A tow truck starts to pull the car out of Waitemata Harbour in Auckland as a police officer watches on .

Detective Sergeant Callum McNeill said police were still trying to work out how the bizarre incident occurred. He said the woman, who was naturally in shock, got away with just a 'few cuts and bruises and is lucky to be alive,' stuff.co.nz reported. Erwin Kampos saw the BMW go straight into the drink after driving over the Northcote Point Ferry Terminal's car park rock wall while he was fishing and immediately went into the water to attempt to smash the window. 'The two police officers smashed the back windscreen, I tried to smash the sides and they didn't want to break. We were running out of time because the vehicle was filling up,' he said. Another witness saw the car was 'filling up fast' and said the officers got to the woman 'just in the nick of time.'

"A British man accused of paying an 11-year-old girl for sex in Cambodia claimed he had only taken her to a cinema because she was poor and had been begging for money. Michael Glyn Jones, from South Wales, appeared in a court  this week accused of sexually abusing four girls, purchasing youngsters for child prostitution and committing indecent acts against a minor. The 55-year-old  has been photographed by police and a child protection group walking hand-in-hand with one young girl and sitting with a number of others, one of whom was on his lap. He was arrested in June after the children's mothers lodged complaints about the alleged abuse. Accused: British paedophile suspect Michael Glyn Jones walks hand in hand with an 11-year-old girl who is accused of having sex with in Cambodia. He claimed in court that he had only taken her to the cinema . The 55-year-old was photographed by police and a child protection group sitting with other young girls (above), one of whom was on his lap. He appeared in a court this week accused of sexually abusing four girls . Judge Ly Sokleng said Jones stood accused of having sex with an 11-year-old girl and then paying her and her mother £3. He was also accused of molesting three other girls aged between seven and nine. Jones denied the charges and claimed he had taken the younger girls, who had been begging for money, to eat ice cream, the Cambodian Daily reported today. Referring to the 11-year-old, he said he had taken her to a movie theatre. 'I just gave the girls one to two dollars when they asked me for it,' he told the court. 'I took them to have ice cream and then brought them back,' he added, referring to an area outside a casino. The Daily reported him as telling the court in Phnom Penh: 'I'm just a tourist.' In reference to giving money to the girls, he added: 'I wanted to be a good guy. I have money - they do not have money.' Jones was remanded in custody to appear in court again at a date to be arranged. Allegations: Jones has been accused of molesting three other girls aged between seven and nine . Outside the court, Mr Chhuon Sithann, a lawyer representing the four girls, said Jones had taken the three younger children to an area under a bridge where he molested them. The 11-year-old, he said, was assaulted in the cinema. When Jones was arrested, police and the child protection charity Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) released photos of him walking hand in hand with the 11-year-old and other pictures showing him with young children. He was said to have taken at least one underage girl to a rented room in the city on several occasions and was seen hugging and kissing her in public. Photos also showed him with half-dressed eight and nine-year-old girls and with a younger child nestled against his lap. The 11-year-old girl was said at the time to have told investigators that she was paid the equivalent of £3 for sex after being taken to a rented room three times by a man. According to APLE, Jones had been staying in a Phnom Penh hotel but had also been renting a separate room, to which he had returned on several occasions with the 11-year-old. The child protection group said that after being 'rescued' from Jones, one of the children was sent to a secure shelter while the other three remained on the street with their families. If convicted, Jones faces up to eight years in prison.","Michael Glyn Jones, 55, is accused of paying an 11-year-old girl £3 for sex .

"Pope Francis has opened a barber shop for homeless people in St Peter’s Square. The state-of-the-art facility offers free haircuts, shaves and showers to Rome’s down-and-outs. The salon service, paid for by donations and the sale of papal blessings, was the idea of the Pope’s chief alms-giver, Monsignor Konrad Krajewski. Pope Francis, pictured, has allowed a barber shop for the homeless of Rome to open  in St Peter's Square . He was moved to act after a homeless man turned down an invitation to dinner at the Vatican because he was embarrassed about his smell. Yesterday – the barber shop’s first day – more than 40 people turned up to have their locks trimmed by volunteer stylists. One of them, Arianna Corsi, said: ‘We don’t want to just go over them with clippers. ‘We want them to give them the full salon treatment.

"Callous: Tracie Nellis,44, was charged last summer with battery on a person age 65 or older . A Florida nurse has surrendered her  license after she was charged with pouring hot sauce into the mouths of two sleeping dementia patients in a nursing home. Tracie Nellis, 44, was charged last summer with battery on a person aged 65 or older and misdemeanor battery. She allegedly poured the hot sauce into the mouths of the dementia sufferers who were residents at the Williston Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Florida in March 2013. The state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigated the shocking incident and Nellis was arrested on January 13, 2014. She pleaded no contest to the battery charge and was sentenced to one year probation. Last week, the state Board of Nursing ruled she could give up her license to avoid disciplinary proceedings. Nellis, from Marion County, Florida, is accused of placing the hot sauce in the residents' mouths between March 18 and 19, 2013, according to state records. Another employee at the home, Vincent Murano was also arrested with her at the same time according to the State Attorney's Office for Levy County. But The Ocala Star reported that in July 2014, the charges against Murano were dropped. Williston Rehabilitation and Nursing Center has not commented on the incident.

"With record snowfalls and icy temperatures, ski resorts across North America are booming. But these haunting images show that while tourists may be flocking to some resorts, others can lay abandoned and in a few short years become overgrown as nature reclaims the mountain. The Talisman hotel, in Ontario, Canada, was once a booming holiday spot, but after going bankrupt four years ago, it has fallen victim to its surroundings. Scroll down for video . Spooky: It has taken just four years for nature to start reclaiming the Talisman hotel, near Toronto in Canada . Abandoned: The resort, which opened in the early 1960s, closed down in 2011 after going bankrupt, and has since been home to squatters . Ready: The hotel looks like it has been abandoned half way through the day - with tables seemingly set and ready to receive guests . Skiing: The resort did not just offer skiing, but had a golf course and multiple swimming pools for the guests . Located just 70 miles north-west of Toronto, the 200-acre resort once bustled with families and skiers taking to the slopes and enjoying drinks at apres-ski bars. The hotel had its own snow-making machines, multiple swimming pools, as well as a golf course and tennis facilities for those visiting in the warmer months. A 1984 advert for the Talisman, which was built in the 1960s, shows people enjoying the slopes, as well as taking a dip in the pool and dancing with friends after a hard day's skiing. 'More than a ski hill,' the voice over boasts. 'A resort.' All that seems a far cry away now: squatters and damp have taken their toll, and nature has crept back in. Urban explorer, known only as LeftAhead, has captured these eerie images, showing the abandoned site, where empty chair lifts swing above grassy slopes and restaurants remain set for a dinner that will never appear. The swimming pools are no longer filled with clear water, but plant life, dust covers every inch of the once-popular hotel and the only reminder of the 21st century comes from two abandoned chip and pin machines. But it may all change yet: it seems there was hope for new life at the Talisman. Overgrown: The pools which generations of visitors enjoyed jumping into are now home to the mountain's plant life . Broken: Windows across the building have been smashed, adding to the feeling of neglect which permeates the area . Dust covered: It seems no one even bothered to sell off the furniture when the hotel and ski resort closed in 2011 . Modern: The only hint the pictures give to its recent past are these two chip and pin machines, also abandoned at the Talisman . A group of developers has snapped up the property, announcing at the end of January it would get a new name: Talisman Mountain Springs Inn. Speaking to the Toronto Star last year, businessman Brian Ellis suggested the resort would need $5million to $7million (£2.525million to 3.675million) to bring it back to its former glory. The developers have penciled in an opening date of July 1 (Canada Day) for the new, revitalised resort - complete with yoga studio and spa, and rebuilt golf course. However, the ski slope is not going to be bought back as it was decided they were no longer financially viable. New life: But there is hope for the future of the Talisman: after years being left to rot, new developers have moved in to transform the site . Millions: The total cost of renovations to bring it up to scratch was somewhere between $5million and $7million . Hope: The developers are confident they can bring customers back to the resort - but it doesn't seem they will be reintroducing the ski lifts . Date: The developers are hoping to open up once more on July 1 - which is Canada Day, a public holiday in the North American country .","The Talisman hotel - a 1960s ski resort near Ontario, in Canada - closed it doors in 2011 after declaring bankruptcy .

"A racecourse has banned picnics on health and safety grounds saying picnickers’ chairs were a ‘potential trip hazard’. Newcastle Racecourse added that the move would leave more room for all. The venue’s management team said preventing racegoers from spreading out rugs and bringing their own lunch would ease movement and increase visitors’ enjoyment. Racegoers at Newcastle Racecourse last year. The venue has now decided to ban picnics saying chairs were a 'potential trip hazard' But racegoers accused the venue of profiteering by encouraging people to eat at its on-site facilities and of stripping the fun out of events at the course. The move was even criticised by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), a government watchdog, who said that there was no legislation to stop people from eating picnics at large gatherings. Bosses said that the ban, which will apply to all meetings at the venue excluding the Blaydon Races, arose from numerous problems at events last year. The racecourse attracts up to 20,000 on its busiest days, with bosses claiming that up to 5,000 people were blocking lawns around the venue at each event by bringing in chairs and picnic boxes. Executive director David Williamson denied that the decision was an attempt to force racegoers to eat at food concessions but said it was for the ‘comfort and safety’ of visitors. He said: ‘This is not a decision that has been made lightly and we hope that this change will allow us to continue to provide an enjoyable experience for all of our guests.’ He said that more seated areas and food outlets would be provided, while a designated picnic area would be set up in the Brandling Estate where the venue is located. Bosses said that the ban, which will apply to all meetings at the venue excluding the Blaydon Races. Pictured are racegoers at the track last year . The racecourse is one of 15 tracks owned by Arena Racing Company, the largest racing company in the UK. ‘The amount of people bringing in chairs, rugs, picnic boxes etc caused space to be limited for the number of people attending the race days due to picnickers spreading out,’ he said. ‘The added furniture was a potential trip hazard and a few people reported to first aid because of this. ‘People are under no obligation whatsoever to purchase food while in the racecourse grounds.’ ‘We are definitely not taking away people’s enjoyment and want people to have a better time compared to last year.’ But regular visitors said that the move could dampen interest in events at the course, while disabled visitors said the decision not to allow sitting on the grass could affect them. Sue Nicholson, who attends ladies day at the course with a group of friends every year, said they planned to boycott the venue. She said: ‘I am shocked. It’s been traditional for everyone to go to a meeting and have a picnic in the Grandstand area on the lawn. ‘It’s fun and it’s friendly. It’s a special occasion when you take your own picnic.’ Miss Nicholson, from Whitley Bay, added: ‘It’s profiteering and I think they will lose business. The racecourse attracts up to 20,000 on its busiest days, with bosses claiming that up to 5,000 people were blocking lawns around the venue at each event by bringing in chairs and picnic boxes . ‘They have taken the fun out of the event. It’s a short-sighted move and the racecourse will see it is a decision that will turn the public away.’ Craigy White posted on Facebook: ‘This has nothing to do with health and safety. It’s so you will pay top prices for their food at the course.’ Michelle Wright , who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME), said: ‘The decision is absurd. There is disabled parking but you cannot take your own seats in. ‘I cannot stand all day. It’s a shame, I won’t be going again. We’ve gone for a number of years, it’s disappointing.’ In a tongue and cheek message on its official Twitter page, the HSE said the excuse for banning picnics was a ‘non-runner’, adding ‘these silly h&s excuses have gone on furlong enough #bustedmyth’. A HSE spokesmen said: ‘We see these health and safety stories fairly regularly and they often result in the HSE getting a lot of grief when we have not even been involved, so we have decided to go on the offensive. ‘There is no health and safety legislation to stop people eating picnics at such a venue.’","Newcastle Racecourse has banned picnics from being brought to track .

"She is part of the house of Orange-Nassau and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands clearly finds her married name inspiring. The Argentina-born Dutch royal, 43, cut a patriotic figure in her orange top as she visited the Veenkoloniaal Museum in Veendam with husband Willem-Alexander yesterday. Maxima, who became Queen-Consort of the Netherlands in 2013, teamed her tangerine and grey Natan dress with matching orange suede court shoes and her favourite chunky jewellery. Glamorous: Maxima cut a patriotic figure in a tangerine and grey Natan dress during a visit to Veendam . The royal couple stopped to chat to well-wishers as they arrived at the museum, with Maxima handed a bouquet of equally patriotic tulips. Joined by Veendam mayor, Sipke Swierstra, the pair were shown around the exhibits, which combined, tell the story of the nearby Groningen peat district. One of the key early drivers of industry in the area, the Gronigen peat moors are more than 5,000 years old and helped to fuel trade between the Netherlands and its neigbours, as well as the UK. More pertinently for the museum, the peat also helped to preserve the thousands of artefacts dropped into it over the years, including, most impressively, the remains of a wagon wheel dating from 2,500 BC. Maxima, who was shown several paintings of the peat villages that once dotted the surrounding countryside, certainly appeared to enjoy her tour and asked questions of the curators as she went. Enjoying herself: Maxima teamed her dress with a charcoal hat and orange earrings for the visit . Helping out: Maxima met farmers and volunteers from the Gronigen area after touring the museum . Floral tribute: The Dutch royal was handed a bunch of equally patriotic tulips by well-wishers in the crowd . The Dutch royals were also shown into a nearby cultural centre, where they met local farmers and museum volunteers, some of whom were helping unpack boxes of maps. All eyes, however, were on Maxima who was on vibrant form as she strode through the crowds in her striking colour-block dress, which was on its second outing. As with much of her wardrobe, the dress was by Natan, a Belgian label that began life in a small Brussels atelier in 1930. After almost half a century of making very little headway, the brand was taken over by Edouard Vermeulen who transformed it into a fashion force to be reckoned with. The label, which created the dress worn by Belgium's Queen Mathilde for her 2001 wedding, was also behind the gown worn by Maxima for her engagement portrait in 2002. 11 years later, the royal wore a nude silk gown by the same label for her inaugural balcony appearance after becoming Queen Consort of the Netherlands. What's that? Maxima, who was escorted by Mayor Sipke Swierstra (left), grimaced at something in the crowd . Matching: Maxima ensured that all parts of her ensemble were either bright orange or grey .

"Artificial leaves have been shown to harness solar energy and turn it into hydrogen for use in fuel cells, for example. But cars and other vehicles still predominantly rely on liquid fuels. With this in mind, researchers have designed a bionic leaf that not only uses solar energy to produce oxygen and hydrogen, it feeds this hydrogen to bacteria that is then engineered to make isopropanol. Researchers have designed a leaf that uses solar energy to produce oxygen and hydrogen. This hydrogen is fed to a bacterium called Ralstonia eutropha. An enzyme takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons and combines them with carbon dioxide. This is then engineered to make isopropanol (illustrated) Isopropanol is an alcohol molecule that can be used as fuel, similar to ethanol or gasoline, and can be separated from water using salt. The technology was created by a team from Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. It builds on the work of Professor of Energy Daniel Nocera and his ‘artificial leaf’ first demonstrated in 2011. The technology was created by a team from Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. It builds on the work of Professor of Energy Daniel Nocera and his ‘artificial leaf’ first demonstrated in 2011. Professor Nocera’s ‘leaf’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side. The Harvard leaf produces oxygen and hydrogen in the same way as Professor Nocera’s, but the hydrogen is then channeled through a chamber filled with a bacterium called Ralstonia eutropha. An enzyme in this bacteria takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons, and these are combined with carbon dioxide within the same chamber. The researchers then extract this bacteria, with the protons, electrons and carbon dioxide and metabolically engineers it to make isopropanol. This engineering method was discovered by Anthony Sinskey, professor of microbiology and of health sciences and technology at MIT. Professor Nocera’s ‘leaf’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side. When placed in water and exposed to sunlight, the strip split the water molecules to release and oxygen and hydrogen. ‘This is a proof of concept that you can have a way of harvesting solar energy and storing it in the form of a liquid fuel,’ said researcher Pamela Silver. ‘[Professor Nocera’s] formidable discovery of the catalyst really set this off, and we had a mission of wanting to interface some kinds of organisms with the harvesting of solar energy. ‘It was a perfect match.’ The Harvard leaf produces oxygen and hydrogen in the same way as Professor Nocera’s, but the hydrogen is then channelled through a chamber filled with a bacterium called Ralstonia eutropha. An enzyme in this bacteria takes the hydrogen back to protons and electrons, and these are combined with carbon dioxide within the same chamber. The researchers then extract this bacteria, with the protons, electrons and carbon dioxide and metabolically engineers it to make isopropanol. This engineering method was discovered by Anthony Sinskey, professor of microbiology and of health sciences and technology at MIT. ‘The advantage of interfacing the inorganic catalyst with biology is you have an unprecedented platform for chemical synthesis that you don't have with inorganic catalysts alone,’ said Brendan Colón, a graduate student in systems biology and co-author of the paper. The Harvard technology builds on the work of Daniel Nocera and his ‘artificial leaf’ first (pictured). Professor Nocera’s ‘leaf’ was made from a silicon strip coated with catalysts on each side. When placed in water and exposed to sunlight, the strip split the water molecules to release and oxygen and hydrogen . The same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins  (stock image shown) ‘Solar-to-chemical production is the heart of this paper, and so far we've been using plants for that, but we are using the unprecedented ability of biology to make lots of compounds.’ The same principles could be used to produce drugs such as vitamins in small amounts, Pamela Silver said. And in theory, any carbon-based liquid fuel could be engineered from the process. The team said its immediate challenge is to increase the bionic leaf's ability to turn solar energy to biomass by optimising the catalyst and the bacteria. Their goal is 5 per cent efficiency, compared to nature's rate of 1 per cent efficiency for photosynthesis to turn sunlight into biomass. ‘We're almost at a 1 per cent efficiency rate of converting sunlight into isopropanol,’ Professor Nocera said. ‘There have been 2.6 billion years of evolution, and [Professor Silver] and I working together a year and a half have already achieved the efficiency of photosynthesis.’ The findings are published in the journal PNAS and co-authors include Joseph Torella, and Christopher Gagliardi.","The technology was created by biologists from Harvard University .

"Abattoirs providing the majority of British supermarkets with fresh pork use a stunning method that campaigners claim causes the animals 'severe distress' before they are slaughtered. MailOnline has learned LIDL, the Co-operative and Waitrose source all of their pig meat from plants using carbon dioxide to knock out the animals. Sainsbury's said the 'majority' of their pork is sourced from CO2 plants and ASDA's suppliers use the gas too. Tesco now wants every one of its plants to adopt the same method by 2018. It did not disclose the proportion which already do. Researchers and welfare groups say it is 'aversive' to the animals who can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness. Morrisons slaughters '100 per cent' of its fresh pork in its own abattoirs and uses electric stunning, which has drawn its own condemnation. During the CO2 stunning process Tesco wants implemented, groups of pigs are mechanically herded into cages which are then lowered into pits with high carbon dioxide concentration. Scroll down for video . Panic: CO2 stunning has been deemed humane because the pigs are moved in groups before they are stunned, but they can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' when they are in the high concentration pits . Stunned: Tesco has called on every one of its fresh pork suppliers to stun their pigs (pictured in a CO2 stunning plant in North-west Europe) with carbon dioxide by December 31, 2017 . Suffocating: CO2 is aversive to the pigs' breathing and can cause them 'severe distress', campaigners say . The procedure before stunning is considered humane because pigs naturally move around in groups without human interaction. But they can get stuck the wrong way in the machinery that shepherds them - and become frightened. When they are lowered into high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is aversive to their breathing, they panic and kick out for 'a period of up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness. In emails revealed to MailOnline, Tesco says it wants the plants to use a machine called the Butina backloader or an equivalent stunning system by December 31, 2017. Footage obtained from a plant in North-west Europe - using that very machine - shows the animals climbing over each other and gasping for breath as they enter the CO2 pits. The gas 'induces respiratory distress, causing hyperventilation and a sense of breathlessness,' researchers say. As one cage is brought to the surface, another is lowered into the pit and the cycle continues. Animal welfare group Eyes on Animals, who filmed inside the plant, says the pigs are 'out of sight out of mind until they come back up and their bodies are no longer reacting'. Robert Hubrecht, Chief Executive of the Humane Slaughter Association told MailOnline: 'As with many gas killing systems, carbon dioxide partly acts by displacing oxygen so the brain cannot function and brain death ensues. 'Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid with a low pH when it meets moisture and probably because of this, inhalation of carbon dioxide at high concentrations causes irritation of the nasal mucosal membranes and lungs.' He added that all available commercial methods for the stunning and slaughter of pigs have their disadvantages, and the use of CO2 is 'often the most reliable' for large operations. 'Looking to the future, further research into inert gas mixtures and other controlled atmosphere systems might well lead to welfare benefits,' he said. Their director Lesley Moffat told MailOnline: 'I think Tesco rushed into making a really, really big decision that has an impact on animal welfare for years to come and on slaughterhouses. 'They made the wrong decision because they're expecting slaughterhouses that don't yet have the CO2 system to install it when maybe five to ten years down the road, it could be banned. 'It means a lot of animals will be slaughtered in a way that isn't ideal.' A survey carried out by the Food Standard Agency in 2013 found that a similar number of pigs were stunned using electricity and carbon dioxide - but the gas method was far more efficient. Of the 167,325 pigs it recorded slaughtered one week, 80,768 were stunned electrically at 116 plants. Whereas 86,456 were stunned using 'high concentration' CO2 at just seven abattoirs. Electric stunning knocks the pigs out instantly, but the herding leading up to it causes them more stress than during gas stunning because they move in single file and they can see the animal in front being stunned. Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'The handling systems associated with gas stunning are generally better for pig welfare than those when electrical stunning is used.' But he added: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness, usually about 30 seconds. They gasp, throw their heads around and squeal.' Herded: Tesco wants its pig meat suppliers to adopt the Butina back loader (pictured) or equivalent, which mechanically herds the pigs into cages - which are then lowered into CO2 pits . Carousel: One group of pigs is lowered into an area of high-concentration CO2 as another is brought back up . The slaughter method has been previously criticised by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC), which advises the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). One of their previous reports called for the practice to be 'phased out' out by 2008 after concluding: 'the use of high concentrations of carbon dioxide to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable.' It added: 'FAWC supports further research into and development of alternatives to CO2, such as mixtures including argon or nitrogen, which are less aversive.' Experiments using gases like as argon mixed with lower concentrations of carbondixodie have shown it is non-aversive to pigs, who lose consciousness without showing signs of stress. According to Butina, the CO2 back loader system is for slaughterhouses who want to implement the latest technology and focus on animal welfare and meat quality. Its components are thouroughly tested to prevent the pigs from becoming stressed. The concept for the product is based on the pigs being driven forward to the stunning system in groups in groups using a 'mechanical driveway'. The pigs are divided into smaller groups and driven into the stunning boxes which are lowered into a CO2 atmosphere using a 'paternoster' or continuous lift system. After stunning, the pigs are tipped out of the boxes for shackling and 'sitcking'. The back loader can manage four to eight pigs per stunning box and between 125 and 900 pigs every hour. But using argon is less profitable because the gas is more expensive, it can lower the quality of meat and it takes longer for the pigs to lose consciousness - so fewer pigs can be stunned every hour. According to Professor Broom: 'The small extra cost and the extra minute during the process are easily outweighed by the better image of both the pig industry and Tesco if the best method is used.' That message was echoed by Compassion in World Farming who is 'utterly opposed to the use of high levels of carbon dioxide stunning or killing pigs'. It was one of seven welfare groups who wrote to the European Commission in January urging them to phase out CO2 and discuss alternative methods that will not cause the animals pain and distress. A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We are committed to high animal welfare standards. All of our pork suppliers must be fully compliant with nationally recognised welfare assurance schemes as well as meeting additional Tesco requirements. 'We are guided by the advice of independent bodies such as the Farm Animal Welfare Council and available scientific evidence demonstrates that CO2 stunning, combined with moving pigs in groups together, reduces stress and injury. 'We will continue to work with our pork suppliers and acknowledged veterinary experts, to explore and invest in methods that can further improve animal welfare.' A Co-operative Food spokesperson said: 'Animal welfare is a priority for us and we only source fresh meat and meat product from UK abattoirs which adhere to our strict sourcing requirements and high standards.' Welfare concern: Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness' 'Gondola system': Pigs are only slaughtered once they are completely unconscious and their pain reflexes have been tested . Waitrose stated: 'Animal welfare is a top priority for us. ​Our process has been described by Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) as ensuring stress is minimised. We are confident our welfare standards are among the highest in the UK.' ASDA said: 'Our suppliers do use carbon dioxide stunning in common with many others around the world.' And Lidl confirmed their fresh pork suppliers 'use abattoirs that adhere to the CO2 gassing method to stun their pigs prior to slaughter'. 'This method, which is approved according to both Freedom Food and Red Tractor animal welfare standards, is widely used in the UK and rest of Europe and commonly considered to be a more humane form of stunning than others,' its spokesperson said. Morrisons, who use electric stunning only, said it is 'the quickest and most effective way to minimise suffering and uphold the high level of animal welfare we operate in our abattoirs'.","Most British supermarkets are buying in pigs stunned with carbon dioxide .

"She has lived through two world wars, 70 governments and her life spans three centuries. Now, Europe's oldest woman has revealed the secrets of her long life. Emma Morano, from Verbania, Italy,  has been alive for over 115 years - and claims eating raw eggs and avoiding men has kept her young. Ms Morano is not only the oldest person in Europe, but the fifth oldest person in the world. Emma Morano, 115, says eating three raw eggs a day and avoiding relationships with men are the key to her long life. She separated from her husband in 1938 and never married again . When asked about her longevity, she simply said: '115 years are a lot'. Although she was married at one point,  it was an unhappy union, and ended in 1938 after the death of her young child. Since then, she has had many suitors but has resisted all their advances, the New York Times reports. 'I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,' she said. Separation at that time was rare, and divorce only became legal in Italy in 1970. Ms Morano also credits her longevity on her love of raw eggs. She has also been eating three a day since she was a teenager, after a doctor said this would counter her anaemia. Her niece, her main carer, brings the eggs – along with the rest of the day's meals – to her every morning. The Gerontology Research Group has confirmed the ages of more than 70 living supercentenarians —  those who are 110 and older. Nearly all are women, and most are located in North America, Europe and Japan, where proof-of-age records are more readily available. Here are the 10 oldest people in the world whose ages have been validated by the group: . 1. Misao Okawa, 116, Japan . 2. Gertrude Weaver, 116, United States . 3. Jeralean Talley, 115, United States . 4. Susannah Mushatt Jones, who turns 115 on Sunday, United States . 5. Bernice Madigan, 114, United States . 6. Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, 114, Italy . 7. Antonia Gerena Rivera, 114, United States . 8. Ethel Lang, 114, England . 9. Nabi Tajima, 113, Japan . 10. Blanche Cobb, 113, United States . Her life has straddled three centuries, and she has watched Italy evolve from a monarchy to a republic. She was born on November 29, 1899, in Civiasco, a town in Piedmont, northwest of Italy and bordering Switzerland and France. She moved to Verbenia , a town on the shore of Lake Maggiore, as a young woman, where she got a job in a factory making jute sacks, which are usually used to hold potatoes. She has been there ever since. She was one of eight children, and living well into old age runs in the family; one of her sisters died just short of 100, while another lived to 102. She became famous when she turned 110, joining the ranks of the 75 living supercentarians – who are nearly all female. Doctors and researchers travel to her bedside to study her genetics and lifestyle. In general, researchers studying ageing have found different 20 to 30 per cent of a person's lifespan is related to genetics, the rest is down to lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise. A 2012 study published in PLoS Medicine found even small amounts of exercise can extend life expectancy by up to 4.5 years. Older research studying the world's 'blue zones', where people commonly live past more than 100 years, theorised that not smoking, eating a plant-based diet, eating vegetables and nuts, regularly exercising and having a healthy social and family life are the key behaviours related to living longer. Feeling youthful could also help delay old age. A recent British study found people who feel three or more years younger than their chronological age have a lower death rate compared with those who felt their age or who felt more than one year older than their age. Older-feeling adults were about 40 per cent more likely to die than younger-feeling adults. Ms Morano also credits her longevity on her love of raw eggs.

A mother on morphine accidentally killed her 25-year-old son when she squirted her medicine into his mouth 'for a laugh', a court heard. Marianne Willoughby was accused of giving her high-strength oramorph - which she was taking to treat knee pain - to Christopher Rowley-Goodchild after he had spent a night drinking with a friend. The 25-year-old collapsed and died at the family home in Weybridge, Surrey, after taking 'at least four or five' doses of the drug, including one he administered himself. His mother, 50, is standing trial for manslaughter despite a jury hearing Mr Rowley-Goodchild was happy to take the drug. When paramedics asked Willoughby, who walks with the aid of crutches, why she had given her son the oramorph, she allegedly replied: 'You know, just for a laugh'. A post mortem found the 25-year-old died from a combination of alcohol and oramorph. Willoughby denies manslaughter, saying her son administered the fatal dose himself. Guildford Crown Court heard Willoughby was taking the medicine, which is morphine-based, for severe pain in her knee when the tragedy unfolded late on June 22, 2013. Mr Rowley-Goodchild had been drinking with a friend, 25-year-old Kirk Ugle, when his mother joined them at around 11pm. The court heard that after a couple of hours, Willoughby raised the subject of her oramorph and offered it to the two men, neither of whom had taken drugs before. 'They looked at it and they both decided individually that they would have some,' said prosecutor John O'Higgins. Willoughby used a 10ml syringe to suck up the drug and then squirted it into the two men's mouths, the jury was told. Mr Rowley-Goodchild passed out, and his mother and friend put him on a bed. They thought he was healthy because he was snoring but this later stopped, and they could not get a response out of him and realised he had gone cold. An ambulance was called at 4.20am, with Willoughby telling the operator she thought her son's condition had been caused by his epilepsy. She did not initially mention the oramorph, the court heard. When paramedics arrived, she was 'screaming hysterically' and the crew began performing CPR. The jury heard that during this time, she told one of the paramedics she had given her son 40mg of oramorph. Police were called and arrived at 5.30am, with Willoughby arrested a short time later. At the police station, she was overheard saying: 'I didn't force him to have the morphine. I shouldn't have let him have it.' Giving evidence, Mr Ugle, also 25, said: 'She squirted the oramorph into our mouths. We said we were happy to take it.' Close: Willoughby (right) is accused of accidentally killing her son Christopher Rowley-Goodchild (left) Mr Ugle said that as far as he knew Mr Rowley-Goodchild had 'at least four or five' doses of the drug, including one which was self-administered, over a period of a couple of hours. 'It just never occurred to me that it would be dangerous to use it,' he told the jury in tears. 'I never thought that what happened, would happen - not in a million years. 'Never from what we took. It just looked like cough medicine. 'The idea kind of sprung up that maybe we should try some, just for a laugh. He (Christopher) was quite adamant about it. He stood up and said it would be fun. 'I think he felt safe taking it. He wouldn't have done it without me there and I didn't really see the harm in it.' Graham Trembeth, defending Willoughby, said: 'You didn't see it as a drug like heroin or cocaine, like an illegal drug?' Mr Ugle replied: 'No. It didn't even feel that strong when we took it.' Horror: Willoughby was screaming were called to the family's street in Weybridge, Surrey (pictured) Mr Trembeth asked Mr Ugle why he had not initially told police Willoughby had squirted the drug into their mouths. Mr Ugle said he didn't want to get her into trouble. Blonde-haired Willoughby appeared visibly emotional and rocked back and forth as details of the case were read out. Mr O'Higgins told the jury of six men and six women: 'It is the prosecution case that the defendant, who sadly is [Mr Rowley-Goodchild's] mother, provided the oramorph and administered it by literally pouring or squirting it into his mouth. 'What she did was to administer her prescription medication to somebody that she knew was already drunk and to whom the drug was not prescribed.' In her interview, Mr O'Higgins told the jury she was willing to answer general background questions but said 'no comment' when asked about details of that night. 'The key factual issue in this case is going to be the question of the direct administration of the drug,' said Mr O'Higgins. 'It is the prosecution case that it is not just that Mrs Willoughby made the drug available, brought it into the room, offered it to Christopher or even gave it to him. 'The prosecution case is that she deliberately and directly administered it to him. She emptied a syringe into his mouth.' The trial continues and is expected to last a week.

"A former inmate of Kerobokan prison has told of how he was baptised by Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan who helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction, and called on the Indonesian government to show the Australian mercy. When Matius Arif Mirdjaja first spoke to Andrew Chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs. The pair knew of each other from the previous three times Mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken. Scroll down for video . Matius Arif Mirdjaja (right), a former inmate of Kerobokan prison, has told of how he was baptised by Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan (left) who helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction . Matius Arif Mirdjaja first spoke to Andrew Chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs . It was not until Mirdjaja personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity . In 2011, the Indonesian - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery. '[The first time we spoke] we had a debate about philosophy and Christianity,' Mirdjaja told Daily Mail Australia. 'At that time, I mocked him because I said that ""The Christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe. How do you as a Christian believe in someone who died on the cross and couldn't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass?""' Mirdjaja said Chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled at him. After the first conversation, they continued their debates about religion, philosophy and history, which the Australian 'knows a lot about'. 'One day he came to me and said ""You can't fit God in your brain man, no matter how big your brain is, you cannot fit God in your brain because God is in your heart, so you have to fit God in your heart"",' Mirdjaja said. 'He said that to me... at that time I had addiction to drugs inside prison still [to heroin]. 'During that period, he gave me a Bible but I just threw it away and again Andrew never got offended.' After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan (second left) started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison . The group was one of many programs Chan and his fellow Bali Nine inmate, Myuran Sukuraman, pioneered to help rehabilitate 'hundreds' of prisoners . It was not until Mirdjaja personally witnessed Chan's devotion to God that he started to believe in Christianity. 'A spiritual encounter happened during that period [when Mirdjaja was still addicted to drugs], one of them was when Andrew helped me get through my addiction so he laid down and prayed on me and then he did it constantly,' Mirdjaja said. 'Andrew didn't intend to ask me to stop drugs at that time but how he approached me was helping [me to be] free from my addiction. 'I had my addiction for 20 years and that's when I stopped and I realised that he taught me a lot about Christianity. I made the decision to be baptised in prison, so Andrew baptised me.' After Mirdjaja was baptised, he and Chan started up a Bible study group inside Kerobokan prison. According to the Indonesian, this is one of many programs Chan and his fellow Bali Nine inmate, Myuran Sukuraman, have pioneered to help rehabilitate 'hundreds' of prisoners. Mirdjaja left prison in 2013 and has now started to preach at churches in south-east Asia, while trying to roll out rehabilitation programs started by the Australians to help others at 17 different prisons around Indonesia.

Mirdjaja visits Chan five times a week when he's in Bali. As part of his role as an evangelist, Mirdjaja visits Nusa Kambangan - also known as Death Island - where Chan and Sukuraman are expected to meet their fate and says the prisons are surrounded by jungle with 19 tigers prowling the grounds. Just hours before Mirdjaja spoke with Daily Mail Australia, news emerged the executions of Chan and Sukumaran, who were meant to moved to Nusa Kambangan this week to be shot dead, were postponed. The former inmate is very vocal about how he feels about the death penalty in Indonesia. 'The maximum sentence is actually written in our system to give impact so people can change themselves, so people can rehabilitate themselves,' Mirdjaja said. 'Now we have two living monuments [Chan and Sukuraman] who can make a testimony of how people can change themselves inside prison but then the government is going to shoot them anyway.' Mirdjaja also pointed to a piece of draft legislation that would see those sentenced to death have their penalty reduced if they showed 10 years of good behaviour. 'Why don't we wait for that to become the law. We're not running out of time to give life,' he said. 'It's unfair, not only about them, but for everyone. The government should really open dialogue [about the death penalty] to give people a chance to live.' The external view of Indonesia's prison on Nusakambangan Island, Indonesia . Australian death-row prisoners Myuran Sukumaran (right) and Andrew Chan (left) Mirdjaja said he had witnessed Chan and Sukuraman change people's lives in prison and they deserved to be spared. 'These guys have love and compassion and a genuine heart. My life before I had seen so many lies, I've seen all the people speak the other way around with their behaviour,' he said. 'They do a good thing in their right hand but bad thing in their left hand. [Chan and Sukuraman's] message is simple - love and compassion. They never judge other people.' When asked how the pair are dealing with their impending deaths, Mirdjaja said they were 'not even sad' about it. 'They really surrender everything to the Lord, whatever happens, happens,' he said. '[Andrew] never said there's nothing we can do but he knew everything has a reason for the Lord and how we respond [to it is up to us]. 'These boys responded very well, they give love and compassion. Why don't we give a chance for them? 'Andrew jokes about [his last rites]. He says I have the right to live in Bali. We never talk about how are you preparing for death. 'The boys they're strong. If it was us, we'd get very emotional like me and the family, I'm very emotional.

"Gregory John O'Brien, 21, has been arrested for pointing his gun at students and firing it in the air during a dispute between rival fraternities . A 21-year-old college student who allegedly fired his gun in the air during a dispute between two fraternity houses has been arrested. Gregory John O'Brien was on the balcony of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, where he is a member, at the University of Georgia when he pointed his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol at members of the neighboring Pi Kappa Alpha, according to police. O'Brien then 'raised the gun' and fired one shot into the air before pointing it once more at the Pi Kappa Alpha members, cops say. The two fraternities, located on the college's on-campus Greek Park Circle, had been involved in an altercation a half-hour before the shooting, police told The Augusta Chronicle. O'Brien was one of the members involved in the argument, which occurred over the weekend, authorities believe. Less than an hour later, several Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity members stood in-between the two houses. Members of Tau Kappa Epsilon were standing on their balcony.

"Patrick, a finance executive, was diagnosed with bowel cancer after doctors diagnosed anaemia . Patrick McIntosh had given blood every six months for nearly two decades. Then two years ago, when he went to donate as usual, he was told he couldn't - because his iron levels were too low. 'It came completely out of the blue,' says Patrick, 58, a financier who lives with his wife, Sue, and their two dogs in Smallfield, Surrey. 'I felt very healthy. I sail and I cycle - I've done the London-to-Brighton bike ride more than 25 times.' At first, he wasn't too concerned. 'The nurse at the donor session said it was nothing to worry about, that I was probably a bit run-down, and I should try taking iron pills - which I did.' About a month later, Patrick had a routine appointment with his GP and mentioned that his iron levels were low. 'He was pretty reassuring - but just in case, he said he'd measure them again,' says Patrick, a director of KMG financial planners. 'But 36 hours later the doctor rang to say my iron levels were so low - about 35 per cent below minimum - I shouldn't even have the energy to stand up.' A lack of iron - anaemia - typically causes fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath; it can also lead to headaches, cold hands or feet, and pale skin. 'But I had no symptoms at all,' says Patrick. His GP thought this was likely to be because he was so fit and his rigorous fitness regimen had helped his body to compensate. At this point the doctor suggested that bleeding from a stomach ulcer might be to blame, and sent Patrick for tests. These revealed the true cause was far more sinister: a tumour in his colon. Anaemia is often thought of as purely a woman's problem, with about three million women affected. But 3 per cent of men, roughly one million, also suffer from it, according to a report last year in the British Medical Journal. The danger is that - as in Patrick's case - anaemia can be a sign of an underlying problem, but men aren't seeking help. 'Men may not realise they are at risk, and are generally more hesitant to see doctors,' says Dr John Mason, a consultant gastroenterologist at Central Manchester University Hospitals. The body needs iron to produce red blood cells. Without sufficient iron, not only are there fewer red blood cells, those that are produced lack haemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that transports oxygen around the body. His iron levels were so low - about a third below minimum - he shouldn't even have had the energy to stand . The lack of oxygen affects almost every function in the body, such as the immune system - which is why frequent infections can be a warning sign. Iron is also vital for the hair, skin and nails. Often a lack of iron can simply be down to not getting enough from the food we eat. It is found in many foods, including red meat, fish and dark green leafy vegetables. Otherwise, in women the usual cause is heavy periods. In men, however, anaemia is typically a result of bleeding in the gastro-intestinal tract (the stomach and intestines). This can happen for many reasons, but most often it occurs when taking aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is the single largest cause of gastro-intestinal blood loss in both men and women, responsible in 10 to 15 per cent of cases, according to the British Society of Gastroenterology. Daily aspirin is taken for a number of reasons, including lowering the risk of heart disease and stroke. It works by interfering with platelets, the blood cells that help blood to clot. A side-effect of anti-clotting action is that it can result in an increased risk of gastro-intestinal bleeding. 'Aspirin is a significant cause of bleeding, especially in older people, who may also not get enough iron because of poor diets,' says Dr Mason. Other NSAIDs work by blocking enzymes involved in pain and inflammation, but this also stops production of another type of chemical that protects the stomach lining from stomach acid. This means that NSAIDs increase the risk of developing an ulcer - and thus of anaemia. As well as stomach ulcers, other causes of anaemia in men are bleeding from abnormal blood vessels (angiodysplasia); non-cancerous growths in the colon (polyps); and infection with the stomach bug H. pylori. Treatment for anaemia depends on the cause. Anaemia is typically a result of bleeding in the gastro-intestinal tract (the stomach and intestines) Where it is due to a chronic disease causing bleeding, such as ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory bowel condition), treatment of the underlying disease should stop the bleeding and the anaemia. In about 5 per cent to 10 per cent of cases of gastro-intestinal bleeding, the cause is cancer in the colon or stomach. A fortnight after his anaemia was diagnosed, Patrick went for tests. 'I had an endoscope or tube and cameras stuck into my backside about two weeks after anaemia was diagnosed. And they found a tumour in the colon. They found several smaller ones, too.' Cancers can cause bleeding because either the tumour itself bleeds or surrounding tissue bleeds as a result of damage caused by the growth. 'I ended up having 17 inches of my large and small colons taken out, as well as lymph glands and stomach muscles,' says Patrick. 'The muscles went in a sort of belt-and-braces approach to make sure everything was got. Because I was pretty healthy, I was discharged after 40 hours, rather than the expected four to five days. 'I did not have any chemotherapy or drugs. Bowel cancer can be cured quickly and efficiently if caught early.' Where no underlying cause for the anaemia can be found - thought to be the case for about one in four people - iron supplements or diet changes may be effective. Treating the problem, even when there is no apparent cause, is important because untreated anaemia can put a strain on the heart as it needs to work harder to pump more blood around to make up for the lack of oxygen in the red blood cells. For people who already have heart disease, this could cause angina (chest pain as the heart is deprived of blood), which is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke. As Dr Mason explains: 'Anaemia makes the heart work harder and brings out angina, in the same way as running for a bus can bring it out.' The importance of diagnosing anaemia was brought home to Patrick, who now campaigns to raise awareness of the signs of bowel cancer and has raised funds for Bowel Cancer UK with a sponsored trek to the South Pole. 'The frightening thing is that the first sign of my bowel cancer was low iron levels,' he says. 'Looking back, there were other tell-tale signs,' he adds, recalling a change in stool colour ('pretty black') and odour, 'which I discovered can be symptoms of cancer, but I didn't know at the time'. 'Had I known, I would have seen a doctor. But there was no apparent blood, and I felt so well. 'If the anaemia hadn't been diagnosed when it was - and it was only by chance - who knows what would have happened.' bowelcanceruk.org.uk .","Patrick McIntosh, 58, from Surrey was diagnosed with anaemia 2 years ago .

"Mr Cameron said he wanted to ensure Jews continued to feel safe in the UK . David Cameron this morning insisted Britain is a safe place for Jews to live - and vowed to keep it that way. The Prime Minister said the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was right to demand security against anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, but insisted British Jews were proud to call the UK home. Mr Cameron's remarks came after Mr Netanyahu said that Europe was no longer safe for Jews following the terror attacks in Paris and Copenhagen. He called for mass emigration to Israel - claiming it is the only country in the world where Jews are totally safe. A Number 10 spokesman insisted Britain was safe for Jews. The spokesman said: ‘As the Israeli Prime Minister has said today, Jewish people deserve security in every country. ‘And Prime Minister David Cameron could not be clearer. We will fight anti-Semitism with everything we have got. ‘Together we will make sure Britain remains a country that Jewish people are proud to call home – today, tomorrow and for every generation to come.’ Mr Cameron's remarks came after tens of thousands of Danes gathered at memorials around the country last night, commemorating the victims of deadly attacks on a synagogue and an event promoting free speech. A torch-lit manifestation in Copenhagen this evening attracted a large crowd, including Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and political leaders from fellow Nordic countries. Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, 22, opened fire on a cafe in hosting a free speech debate on Saturday, killing 55-year-old film director Finn Nørgaard, and attacked a synagogue, shooting 37-year-old Dan Uzan, who was volunteering as a security guard at a Bat Mitzvah. El-Hussein was later killed in a shootout with police in his neighborhood of Norrebro, a largely immigrant part of the Copenhagen. The shootings - which came after the Paris gun attacks - sparked Mr Netanyahu's call for mass emigration to Israel. But European leaders reacted angrily to Mr Netanyahu's suggestion that Jews were not safe outside Israel. Thousands of people attended a memorial ceremony in Denmark last night after the terror attacks in Copenhagen . Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt took part in a vigil near the cultural club in Copenhagen where the shooting took place . His comments were attacked by the leaders of France, Germany and Denmark, and were met with fury from Jewish groups. French President Francois Hollande said. 'I will not just let what was said in Israel pass, leading people to believe that Jews no longer have a place in Europe and in France in particular.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government is doing everything possible to protect Jewish sites. She said: 'We are glad and thankful that there is Jewish life in Germany again,' Merkel said in Berlin. 'And we would like to continue living well together with the Jews who are in Germany today.' The chair of Britain's Parliamentary committee against anti-Semitism, John Mann, also attacked Mr Netanyahu's remarks. He said: 'Mr Netanyahu made the same remarks in Paris - it's just crude electioneering. It's no coincidence that there's a general election in Israel coming up. 'The comments are not helpful and I think people will ignore them...We're not prepared to tolerate a situation in this country or in any country in Europe where any Jews feel they have to leave.' But he added: 'But if people make a positive choice to move then that's their right to do so.' Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Jews in Europe should emigrate to Israel to stay safe . German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) yesterday said that her government will do everything possible to ensure Jewish sites are secure, while Francois Hollande reacted angrily to the Israeli leader's remarks . Mr Netanyahu's renewed call for a modern-day exodus came just hours after the deadly terror attacks in Copenhagen and one month after four hostages were killed at a Paris kosher deli . 'We know there are doubts, questions across the community,' French President Francois Hollande said as he reacted with shock and anger to Netanyahu's comments. France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls also slammed Netanyahu's comments, telling 475,000 French Jews the whole nation was 'wounded with you' after a gunman killed two people including a synagogue security guard in Copenhagen, Denmark. Mr Valls criticised Netanyahu's plea for mass migration - and questioned its timing just a month before Mr Netanyahu seeks re-election to the Israeli Parliament on March 17. The French Prime Minister said: 'My message to French Jews is the following: 'France is wounded with you and France does not want you to leave'.' 'I regret Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks. Being in the middle of an election campaign doesn't mean you authorise yourself to make just any type of statement... The place for French Jews is France.' A Jew who leaves France is a piece of France that is gone,' he later added. Victims: Finn Norgaard, 55, (left) was killed at a free speech debate in a cafe hours before El-Hussein (right) Uzan (right) shot a guard in the head outside a Bat Mitzvah . Gunned down: The terror suspect believed to have killed two men in separate shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Valentine's Day was shot dead by police at around 5am yesterday after a dramatic standoff . Smashed glass: Investigators were seen at the Krudttonden cafe in the city yesterday morning where the gunman fired 200 bullets at crowds attending a freedom of speech event . Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt also expressed support for the Jewish community, telling reporters: 'They belong in Denmark, they are a strong part of our community, and we will do everything we can to protect the Jewish community in our country.' 'The Jewish community have been in this country for centuries. They belong in Denmark, they are part of the Danish community and we wouldn't be the same without the Jewish community in Denmark,' she added. Mr Netanyahu's comments also triggered an angry response from Copenhagen's chief rabbi, Jair Melchior, who said he was 'disappointed' by the remarks. 'People from Denmark move to Israel because they love Israel, because of Zionism. But not because of terrorism,' he said. 'If the way we deal with terror is to run somewhere else, we should all run to a deserted island,' he added. More than 80 per cent of the world's Jews live in the U.S. and Israel but there are large communities elsewhere, including in Canada, Britain, France, Russia, Argentina, Germany and Australia. British senior Labour party backbencher Louise Ellman also criticised the Israeli leader's remarks. Mrs Ellman - one of the most prominent Jewish MPs in Parliament - said: 'I disagree with what he has said...It is the responsibility of all governments to look after their citizens and that includes Jewish citizens.' A spokesperson for Britain's Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis told MailOnline he would not be giving an immediate response to Netanyahu's comments as he is currently attending a conference. The terror suspect believed to have killed two men in separate shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Valentine's Day was shot dead by police at around 5am on Sunday after a dramatic standoff.","PM says Netanyahu right to demand security against anti-Semitic attacks .

The exact location of the wreckage is remaining a secret not prevent looters. Skydiving plane hijacker . Whichever way you look at this, it's an impressive stunt. In 1971 someone known  as 'DB Cooper' aka Dan Cooper boarded a Boeing 727 from Oregon to Seattle wearing a suit and sunglasses. Shortly after takeoff he lit a cigarette, ordered a whisky and passed a flight attendant a note explaining that he had a bomb and was hijacking the plane. He demanded $200,000 upon landing and a parachute. The pilot radioed his demands and the authorities complied. FBI composite of airplane hijacker D.B. Cooper who demanded $200,000 dollars then parachuted from plane . A passenger named Dan Cooper boarded a Boeing 727 from Oregon to Seattle then held it to ransom in 1971 . He allowed passengers to depart before ordering the pilot to takeoff once more (with the money). Somewhere over the lower Cascade mountains in southwestern Washington he parachuted from the plane to a highly dubious fate. DB Cooper was never seen or heard of again despite the last four decades seeing more than 1,000 suspects  considered. Four years ago a woman came forward claiming to be the DB Cooper's niece. She said she saw her uncle - a man named Lynn Doyle Cooper - badly injured the day after the incident when she was eight years old. He said he had been in a car crash and then promptly vanished out of her life forever. She believes he died in 1999. The case has now been closed. Pioneering pilot Amelia Earhart . On an ill-fated flight over the Pacific Ocean on July 2 1937 aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart went missing. On an ill fated flight over the Pacific Ocean on July 2 1937 aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart went missing . The 39-year-old US famed pilot was nearing the end of a record breaking attempt to fly the longest route around-the-world and had become somewhat of a celebrity. During one of the last longest and dangerous legs of the journey from Lae, Papa New Guinea to Howland Island Earhart something went very wrong. 39-year-old US pilot was nearing the end of a record breaking around-the-world attempt when she vanished . Radio transmissions stalled, the weather was cloudy and she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were running out of fuel. Before takeoff they had tried to make way for extra fuel by  throwing out every non-essential item, but it wasn't enough. One of the last radio messages from her to the island was recorded as: 'We must be on you, but we cannot see you. Fuel is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.' A fragment from her plane was found near Nikumaroro, an uninhabited atoll in the  Pacific republic of Kiribati . Theories rained hard after the disappearance but the closest anyone has got at an explanation was when a  fragment  from her plane was found near Nikumaroro, an uninhabited atoll in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati, in 1991, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island. Last year, experts confirmed they did indeed believe the aluminium fragment found was part of Earhart's plane, used as to fill in a navigation window when the aircraft stopped in Miami. Some experts believe the couple may have landed on the coral reef   as castaways and eventually died on the atoll. Bermuda Triangle . In case you want to avoid it, the famous mythical stretch of Atlantic Ocean is roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico and is the location where dozens of ships and airplanes have vanished over the years. A snapshot of strange occurrences reads as follows: . The Bermuda Triangle is  bounded by Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico and is an mythical area of intrigue . In 1945 six US navy bombers disappeared, as did those who went to rescue them. Before they vanished one of the pilots saud, 'Everything looks strange, even the ocean.' On average four aircraft and 20 yachts go missing there every year. Pilot Bruce Gernon claims he inexplicably jumped 28 minutes forward in time and 100 miles forward in space here, and has since written a book about it. In 1945 six US navy bombers disappeared, as did those who went to rescue them in Bermuda Triangle area . In 1955 a yacht that survived three hurricanes was found minus all its crew. Experts assure us that most mishaps are due to weather and human error but  more outlandish explanations include everything from gas deposits and aliens to 'crystal' interference from the City of Atlantis thought to be somewhere beneath the waves. Death ship . Depending on who you speak to, in June 1947 or February 1948 a disturbing distress call was picked up by multiple ships from the Dutch cargo ship SS Ourang Medan. It said, 'All officers including captain are dead, lying in chartroom and bridge. Possibly whole crew dead.' This terrible message was followed by a flurry of Morse code, then a final, grim two words: 'I die.' Shrouded in mystery: A vessel believed to be the SS Ourang Medan whose  crew suffered a terrible fate . A US merchant ship Silver Star headed to the scene and found all its members of crew, including the ship's dog, dead. According to reports their eyes were wide open and faces twisted in frozen horror. The ship soon after exploded and sank. No one has ever come close to an explanation but many have speculated at ghosts, dangerous chemicals and even aliens causing the bizarre incident. MH370 Malaysia Airlines . When it comes to recent travel tragedies, none is perhaps more so at the forefront of our minds than missing MH370 Malaysia Airlines. En route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 the flight carrying 239 people lost contact less than an hour after take-off.

Australian vessel conducting search operations for  missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on April 4, 2014 . No distress calls were made and very little more is known about what happened. In the months that followed the world watched as a huge rescue operation began, spanning almost three million square miles from Kazakhstan to remote areas of the Indian Ocean. Based on satellite data best estimates place the wreckage somewhere far west of Australian city of Perth. Last year Reuters estimated that $44 million had been spent on the hunt and that figure was expected to run into the hundreds of millions, making it the most expensive search in aviation history. So far search teams have not found a single trace of the plane or its passengers. In the following months a vast rescue operation  spanning almost three million square miles was launched .","Despite satellite surveillance inexplicable events still happen in transit .

"West Coast ports that were closed to incoming cargo vessels during the holiday weekend reopened in full on Tuesday as Labor Secretary Tom Perez arrived in San Francisco seeking to broker a settlement ending months of shipping disruptions. Retail and manufacturing executives say a full, extended port shutdown could cost the US economy some $2 billion a day. Perez was sent to meet with the two sides in the conflict at the behest of President Obama, who has come under mounting pressure to weigh in on a labor dispute that has cascaded through the U.S. commercial supply chain and beyond. 'Secretary Perez has meetings with both parties today in San Francisco,' spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in an email. 'He'll urge the parties to resolve their dispute quickly at the bargaining table. We don't have any updates at this time.' All at sea: Ships gather off the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California earlier this month. A labor dispute between dock workers and port management has prevented cargos being unloaded . Thousands of containers stacked up on the docks in California as the U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday to broker a settlement to end the shipping disruptions . A ship from the Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation is pictured anchored offshore on February 6 after it was unable to dock in California . It was not immediately clear whether Perez would meet with the two sides together, separately or both. But one source familiar with the situation said Perez would likely huddle in a room with the principal negotiators from both sides, along with the federal mediator who joined the talks last month. Representatives of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, representing 20,000 dockworkers, and the bargaining agent for shipping companies and terminal operations, the Pacific Maritime Association, have declined public comment since agreeing last Friday to honor a news blackout requested by the mediator. No face-to-face talks between the parties are believed to have occurred in the three days since then. The PMA previously said the talks, which have dragged on for nine months, hit a new snag on a union demand for changes in the system of binding arbitration of contract disputes. The union has insisted the two sides are near an accord. Operations to load and unload cargo vessels at all 29 West Coast ports were halted through the holiday weekend as of Friday night but resumed on Tuesday morning, port authorities said. More than 30 freighters idled through the weekend waiting for berths to open outside the adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's two busiest cargo hubs. It was the longest such suspension in the months-long labor dispute. Vessel operations were likewise suspended for two days last weekend, and again last Thursday, which was a union holiday. But shippers said work at the ports continued in the dockyards, rail yards and terminal gates to move cargo already unloaded from ships. The affected ports handle nearly half of all U.S. maritime trade and more than 70 percent of imports from Asia. A domino effect has rippled through much of the U.S. economy, extending to agriculture, manufacturing, retail and transportation. Cranes load containers onto the ships at the Port of Los Angeles on Tuesday. Seaports on the West Coast were all but shut over the weekend because of a contract dispute between dockworkers and their employers that already has disrupted billions of dollars in U.S. international trade . Some shipping containers have been piled up at the Port of Los Angeles for weeks now which is causing pain for countless businesses who can't get their hands on goods . California farmers have been hit especially hard, with port disruptions posing a major barrier to perishable goods headed to overseas markets and export losses estimated to be running at hundreds of millions of dollars a week. Asian exporters faced rising shipping rates and some have been forced to reroute their goods by more costly air freight. One automaker, Japan's Honda Motor Co, said on Sunday it would slow production for a week at plants in Ohio, Indiana and the Canadian province of Ontario, because of port-related delays in parts shipments to those factories. The shippers have said they were curtailing port operations because they were no longer willing to pay union workers premium overnight, holiday and weekend wages during work slowdowns the companies have accused the union of orchestrating. The union has blamed changes in shipping practices instituted by the carriers themselves for causing worsening backlogs, including super-sized freighters that have inundated the ports with high volumes of cargo all at once, and say that suspending vessel operations has only made matters worse. Port officials say it will take many weeks to clear the immediate backlog of cargo containers piled up on the docks once the dispute is settled. A long-term concern is that U.S. export business lost to other countries and other ports may not return.","US Labor Secretary Tom Perez arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday to broker a deal between dock workers and management to end delays .

"A cat has walked away unscathed from a 26-storey tower fall after it crashed through a canvas tent roof beneath its owner's apartment. Jommi, an 18-year-old cat from Hong Kong, had been playing in owner Al Ling's flat when he went into the kitchen to make her some food. But when he returned a few minutes later, Jommi had gone. Jommi, 18-months-old, was playing in her owner's Hong Kong flat when she fell out the open window . She fell 26 storeys from the window of this downtown Hong Kong apartment block, but miraculously walked away unscathed . He said: 'We went into the other room for a few minutes and shortly after when I came out calling for her, I was looking everywhere and could not find her. 'We had left a little window crack open to get some fresh air and I suddenly had the horrific thought that she may have gotten through the gap.' Going over to the window, he looked outside and could not believe his eyes. He said: 'I looked over and saw a large hole in a tent 26-storeys below, and I knew she had gone over.' Jumping into the lift, Ling hurtled downstairs and ran outside to see if Jommi was still alive. He said: 'I really did fear the worst and was convinced I would find her dead. 'The force of her impact was so great it had bent the tent's aluminium frame so you can imagine my utter shock when I went inside and found her licking her paws as if nothing had happened.' Owner Al Ling said he was convinced he would find Jommi (pictured) dead after she fell from the window . Despite falling 26 storeys, her fall was cushioned by a tent roof, which was left torn and bent (pictured) from the impact of her landing . After falling from the tower block (left), Jommi went straight through the roof of a tent at ground level (right) Stunned Ling then took her back upstairs and closed the window. He said: 'I remember seeing a QI programme once where they talked about a cat's low terminal velocity when falling from great heights and that the higher the fall the more likely the survival.

"Sales of English apples are set to hit a 20-year high - pipping demand for imports. The boom in favourites, including Gala, Braeburn, Cox and Russet, was fuelled by good weather, which boosted production, and increased availability in supermarkets. Ironically, the rise of apples grown in the UK has stemmed from the fact we are planting large numbers of foreign varieties, particularly Braeburn and Gala, which originated in New Zealand. Sales of English apples are set to hit a 20-year high but ironically, the rise of apples grown in the UK has stemmed from the fact we are planting large numbers of foreign varieties . Traditional English apples like Cox may have a superior taste, however the likes of Braeburn are easier to grow, producing more fruit per tree and are more likely to meet the EU’s designated ‘Class 1’ status. The Cox’s Orange Pippin can trace its heritage back to 1830, at Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire, England, where it was developed by the retired brewer and horticulturist Richard Cox. By contrast the Braeburn is a much more modern variety. It is believed to have originated from a cross between a Granny Smith and Lady Hamilton and was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by a farmer in the Moutere Hills, New Zealand. The first Gala was a cross between the Golden Delicious and the Kidd’s Orange Red and was planted in New Zealand in the 1930s and is now grown across the globe. New research shows that this season’s sales of English-grown apples reached 92,700 tonnes at the end of January, a significant increase on the 75,000 tonnes sold at the same point last year. The rise in demand and sales was announced by Adrian Barlow, head of the industry body English Apples and Pears, who expects total sales of the 2014 crop to hit 130,000 tonnes – up by 15,000 on the year before. The boom in favourites, including Gala, Braeburn, Cox and Russet, was fuelled by good weather, which boosted production, and increased availability . In 2003 just 23 per cent of apples sold here came from British orchards, however this is now up to more than 30per cent and the industry is aiming for 65 per cent. Mr Barlow said a tactical decision by growers to switch to producing apples that originated overseas has been a huge factor in the industry’s growth, describing the transformation as ‘electrifying’. He said sales of UK produced Gala apples were up by 7,900 tonnes on last year’s figures, rising to 29,600 tonnes by the end of January. Such is demand that the 2014 English crop is expected to be sold out by April. Mr Barlow told The Grocer magazine: ‘We have recovered the ground lost by the shortages in the crop we saw in 2012 and 2013.’ While English growers are selling more, the total number of apples sold in the UK is showing signs of decline. Total consumption in 2014 was 482,000 tonnes, which was down by 9per cent on the 527,000 in 2011. Growers attribute this to the rising competition from fast food, sweets and other snacks. They also complain the government’s healthy eating advice to consume five portions of fruit or vegetables a day is being ignored, with the current average put at three. Mr Barlow said: ‘Shoppers should recognise that English apples are good both for them, local economies and the environment. There really is an English apple for everyone and due to our climate, they are the best in world.’ Despite the bumper harvest, he said apple growers are disappointed with the price they are being paid for their crop. British growers generally receive about 15 per cent more than their European counterparts for apples destined for the fruit bowl. By contrast, some who supply the juicing and processing market have experienced a ‘torrid time’ due to low prices. The first Gala apple was a cross between the Golden Delicious (pictured) and the Kidd’s Orange Red .","Boom in favourites, including Cox and Russet, fuelled by good weather .

"A professional gambler was killed in a honey-trap murder before his killers were filmed posing with £50 notes, a court has heard. Leonie Granger, 25, was seen 'passionately kissing'  poker player Mehmet Hassan, 56, at a West End casino in the hours before the killing, the Old Bailey has heard. Mr Hassan was tied up and savagely kicked to death by robbers after he took Miss Granger back to his flat in Islington, north London, jurors were told. Investigators later found a film on Granger's phone said to show her and others 'holding bundles of £50 notes' while one man stuffs money into his underpants. A jury  have been shown a film prosecutors say shows Leonie Granger with alleged accomplice Kyrron Jackson and wads of £50 notes they are said to have stolen from a professional poker player . The Old Bailey heard the film was made at the same time as Mr Hassan (left) was lying dead at his flat in Islington, north London. Granger (pictured right) is accused of murder and false imprisonment . Granger is on trial at the Old Bailey accused of murder and false imprisonment alongside her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and his close friend Nicholas Chandler, both 28. Opening the case, Crispin Aylett QC said: 'When Miss Granger was arrested, the police seized her mobile phone. It appears that she had attempted to delete much of the incriminating material stored in that telephone. 'Nonetheless, among the items that have survived is a piece of film which appears to have been recorded on the morning of Monday 24 March. 'Miss Granger, Jackson and Chandler can each be seen holding bundles of £50 notes. At one point Chandler is spraying £50 notes all over the floor while Jackson is stuffing £50 notes into his underpants. 'While Mr Hassan's body lay undetected in his flat, his killers were literally throwing his money around.' The jury was shown the video in which Jackson's face was obscured by a gas mask. Mr Hassan was described as a professional gambler who sometimes won as much as £15,000 at a time. Rather than using bank accounts, he would stash his winnings around his flat, even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave. He was known to have two favourite casinos in Mayfair - the Playboy Casino on Old Park Lane and the Palm Beach Casino in Berkeley Street. Prosecutors said was footage taken from defendant  Granger's phone during the murder investigation . They claim the money was poker winnings stolen from Mr Hassan when the robbers gained entry to the professional gambler's flat after he met Granger in a casino . The video is said to show Granger with boyfriend Kyrron Jackson, who are now both on trial for murder . The divorced father-of-three also 'enjoyed the company of women', making him 'vulnerable to the unscrupulous', Mr Aylett said. He would regularly be seen arriving at a casino with an attractive woman on his arm or meeting one there, jurors were told. The prosecutor said the victim met Granger in February last year at the Palm Beach Casino and they saw each other again on March 15 when she went back to his flat before 'she made an excuse and left'. The court heard Mr Hassan was 'flattered' by the attention and had joked with friends that she was with him without him even having to pay her. But Mr Aylett said: 'The truth, sadly, is that Miss Granger was not interested in Mehmet Hassan for anything other than his money. And that is how Mehmet Hassan came to be tied up and kicked to death in his own flat.' The court heard that on the evening of Sunday March 23, Granger met the victim for a drink before going on to the Palm Beach Casino where they were seen kissing passionately. They left before midnight and went back to Mr Hassan's flat. About half an hour later, Mr Hassan booked a mini-cab which took Granger to an address in Lewisham. The court was told the cab driver overheard her on her phone exclaiming: 'Swear down! I don't believe it. Don't tell me the money's not there! I saw it. Look in the drawer. Look under the cabinet.' The court heard Mr Hassan and Granger were seen passionately kissing in Palm Beach Casino, Mayfair on the night prosecutors claim he was killed . The jury was told she was speaking to someone using Mr Hassan's phone suggesting it was one of her conspirators who had planned to go to the flat and overpower Mr Hassan. His body was found by police on the evening of March 24 last year after his sister became concerned that she could not get hold of him. When police tracked down Granger and told her about his death, she began to cry and claimed that two of his friends had turned up and begun sniffing cocaine so she left. But when officers examined her phone, they found the video of the defendants throwing £50 notes around which was taken the day after the killing. Jackson and Chandler are further accused of robbing Mr Hassan, two counts of plotting to rob employees of Grosvenor Casinos, two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in January last year, and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison. The prosecutor told the jury that Mr Hassan's death was the 'culmination of the ruthless greed' of Jackson and Chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in South Kensington in January and February last year. In each case, guns were used and the victims were tied up and subjected to violence, Mr Aylett said. The first robbery took place on 12 January 12, 2014 at the Grosvenor Casino at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel in South Kensington. Granger, Jackson and Chandler are now on trial at London's Old Bailey, they deny the charges against them . Mr Aylett said, on that day, the  robbers ordered a mini-cab, whose driver was forced at gun-point to pick up three men in boilers suits and balaclavas. The driver was bound and tape was placed across his eyes, while one of the robbers drove the car. After arriving the robbers moved through the casino, with one of the gang shouting to gamblers: 'This is a f****** robbery. Get on the floor!' Mr Aylett said they 'must have had some inkling of the high stakes for which they were playing' because one robber was heard to shout 'It's not there' after jumping over the cash desk. Takings from the previous day were £101,270 but counting had been delayed on the day of the robbery and was still taking place in the basement, the court heard. The robbers still managed to seize over £10,000 in cash - including £2,965 in sterling - before fleeing the casino, the court heard. The case against Jackson and Chandler relies mostly on telephone evidence, the court heard. Mr Aylett said phone records suggested Jackson acted as a lookout and gave the signal to the three robbers who entered the casino. Granger, of Gillingham, Kent; Jackson, of  Lewisham, south-east London; and Chandler, of south-east London, deny the charges against them. The trial continues.

"A Canadian mother says she is 'humbled' by the fact that thousands of people around the world claim she inspired them to vaccinate their children. Jennifer Hibben-White wrote a diatribe against vaccine-hesitant parents last week after a hospital said her 15-day-old son had been exposed to measles as he waited for a check-up on January 27. Tomorrow a doctor is expected to give baby Griffin the all-clear, DailyMail.com has learned. During the tense four-week wait, Mrs Hibben-White took to Facebook, slamming 'misinformed' parents for 'twisting science', adding: 'I am angry as hell.' The post, which systematically lists and debunks the various myths surrounding vaccinations, has been shared more than 270,000 times since February 10 - and thousands of parents from as far as New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands have been moved to reassess their stance. Speaking to DailyMail.com from her home in Pilkington, Ontario, Mrs Hibben-White said: 'It has been quite overwhelming. I had to stop reading the messages by the time it passed 200. I've now had thousands. Furious: Jennifer Hibben-White and her husband Glenn are furious after being told 15-day-old Griffin could have been exposed to measles while waiting for a routine check-up at an Ontario hospital last month . 'People all over the world who were on the fence emailed me saying they saw my post and it made them look at the data for themselves, make an informed decision, and vaccinate their children. 'I never expected it to go around the world like it did. 'It was a very upsetting and stressful tome and I think I'd just kind of had it at that point.' Mrs Hibben-White, a vice-president of marketing at a private school, and her husband, Glenn White, have rebuilt their lives since their five-year-old daughter Olivia unexpectedly died in her sleep three years ago. Tests showed she suffered from a rare blood infection. Describing the ordeal to DailyMail.com, Mrs Hibben-White said the phone call from York Region Public Health about Griffin was the last straw. 'We have gone through a lot as a family over the last few years. 'This was a tipping point where I felt that the responsibility of people had to be addressed.' But despite the positive reactions she has had, the fear surrounding vaccinations does not appear to be waning. 'I have heard so much misinformation over the past few days that it is really frightening. 'I am talking about celebrities who make connections between vaccinations and autism. We need to start being smarter. 'It is a simple case of education; talking to the right people such as the family doctor, reading established peer-reviewed sources such as those from the World Health Organization. It's all about mitigating risk. 'What would happen in an epidemic? Now it's measles. What about mumps? Polio?' After a tense four-week wait, the family will visit a doctor tomorrow to find out if baby Griffin is measles free. In the post Mrs Hibben-White wrote: . Agonizing wait: The family has to wait three more days to hear if Griffin is infected with the disease . Further fears: Their three-year-old daughter Aurelia only has one MMR jab which they hope will protect her . 'You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't,' she wrote. 'And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. 'You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies.' She continued: 'You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't. 'I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children.' More than 100 people in California and others in several states and Mexico have been infected with measles since an outbreak traced to Disneyland was first reported in December. A Center for Disease Control statement said that it has been dealing with a large, ongoing multi-state outbreak since the beginning of the year. Though the vast majority of cases are in California, 18 states and Washington DC had seen cases as of Tuesday. Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington have seen patients with measles. Political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination, with President Barack Obama saying that there is 'no reason' for all parents not to have their children immunized. The year 2014 saw a record number of measles cases, with 644 patients across 27 states. Last year had one major outbreak that consisted of 383 cases in the unvaccinated Ohio Amish community. The US normally sees less than 100 measles cases a year. This is my son Griffin, and he may have measles. On February 9th, I received a phone call from York Region Public Health, informing me that Griffin, alongside my mother and I, was potentially exposed to the measles virus while attending a newborn weigh-in appointment at my doctor's office in Markham on January 27th. Griffin was 15 days old at the time. I was informed that someone who later developed measles sat in the doctor's waiting room between 1 hour before and 30 minutes before we arrived. I was also informed that measles is regarded as 'airborne' and can stay in the air and on surfaces up to 2 hours after the infected person has left. I was then asked if I had had the measles vaccine. I had. Griffin. Griffin had not. Can not. I was advised to not be around small children. If I worked in such an environment I would be written off work. I do work in such an environment; my home. Where I now sit with Griffin and my 3 year old, Aurelia, who has only been able to get one MMR vaccine so far. She is now, technically, exposed too. We are to sit tight and watch for symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose. If we develop any of these we are to call my doctor and arrange to come in under official medical precautions. We are to wait at home, in isolation, until February 17th, after which the 21 days of possible incubation will have passed and we are clear. So, Griffin is now Schrödinger's baby. Simultaneously with measles, and without it. Until he develops symptoms, or until a further 7 days pass. One or other. And I'm angry. Angry as hell. I won't get angry at or blame the person in the waiting room. I would have likely done the same thing...you get sick, you go to the doctor. I have no idea what their story is and I will never know. But I do know one thing: . If you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child, I blame you. I blame you. You have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long. From that high height, we have given you the PRIVILEGE of our protection, for free. And in return, you gave me this week. A week from hell. Wherein I don't know if my BABY will develop something that has DEATH as a potential outcome. DEATH. Now, let's unpack this shall we. All out on the table. You have NO IDEA what this 'potential outcome' means. NO IDEA. I do. Unfortunately, I do. You think you are protecting your children from thimerosal? You aren't. It's not in their vaccine. You think you are protecting them from autism? You aren't. There is no, none, nada, nothing in science that proves this. If you want to use google instead of science to 'prove me wrong' then I am happy to call you an imbecile as well as misinformed. You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't. I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children. You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't. As an unvaccinated person you are only protected by our good graces. WE LET YOU BE SO PRIVILEGED thanks to our willingness to vaccinate ourselves and our children. You know what vaccines protect your children from? Pain. Suffering. Irreparable harm. Death. And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies because that is what I would have done, if I could, to save my daughter. The fact is, there was no vaccine for her. Not for her illness. And she died. She died at age five and a half, and she is gone. And I watch these arguments trotted out on Facebook and twitter citing false science and long discredited'studies' that just won't stop and Jenny McCarthy quotes and 'it's MY choice' to not vaccinate...and I think...what would you have done if your child lay dying? Would you give them a scientifically proven, safe and effective vaccine and risk the minuscule likelihood of a side effect? Or would you let them go, knowing that at least they won't develop autism (which they wouldn't even develop anyway because SCIENCE)? And don't you DARE tell me that you wouldn't vaccinate them then. Don't you dare. You have no idea what it feels like to go through what we went through. So, look at Griffin.

"Painter Jack Vettriano, whose work has been labelled as 'dim erotica', but sells for hundreds of thousands of pounds has criticised the art establishment for snubbing his work. The 63-year-old's paintings are hugely popular, and have been reproduced countless times on posters, calendars and souvenir mugs. But despite his success, critics of the Scottish artist have branded his work 'brainless' and 'dim erotica' - statements he says are down to his popularity. Scroll down for video . Painter Jack Vettriano, whose work has been labelled as 'dim erotica', but sells for hundreds of thousands of pounds has criticised the art establishment for snubbing his work . 'They don't like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority,' he told Radio Times magazine. 'If they want to ignore me, let them. 'I have what I want and that is the support of the public and that means far more to me than the approval of a bunch of well-educated art buffs.' Vettriano's most famous painting The Singing Butler, featuring a couple dancing on a beach despite an approaching storm, sold for almost £750,000 at auction in 2004 . Vettriano's most famous painting The Singing Butler, featuring a couple dancing on a beach despite an approaching storm, was rejected for display at the Royal Academy summer exhibition after it was completed in 1992. However, it went on to fetch almost £750,000 at auction in 2004, a record at the time for a Scottish artist, and has since appeared on prints, posters and even Marks and Spencer biscuit tins. 'The person who made that decision ought to go and live in a cave somewhere,' Vettriano said of its omission from the Royal Academy show. Despite his success, critics of the Scottish artist have branded his work 'brainless' and 'dim erotica' - statements he says are down to his popularity . Vettriano, who is thought to have sold around 12 million posters of his works, recently enjoyed a retrospective at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum (pictured) 'That painting has since sold over 10 million copies. How could somebody get something so wrong?' The artist, who often paints women in stockings, heels and suspenders, said: 'There are days when I think, 'What is it they (critics) don't like about me?' 'To be honest with you I just don't think they see sex as a serious subject. If I was painting drug use or inner-city violence they'd consider that to be art. 'They think what I paint is just titillation. It's not titillation, it's what every couple does on a Saturday night'. Vettriano, who is thought to have sold around 12 million posters of his works, recently enjoyed a retrospective at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Hollywood star Jack Nicholson and Sir Alex Ferguson are among owners of his paintings. Despite his immense popularity with the public, Jack Vettriano has often been the recipient of more negative comments from art critics . Despite his immense popularity with the public, Jack Vettriano has often been the recipient of more negative comments from art critics, and was once famously described as 'The Jeffrey Archer of the art world'. Throughout the years, his work has been described as twee and chauvinistic, with his more erotically-charged material written off as 'pornography'. However, his work has sold for thousands, and he is believed to be Britain's most reproduced artist - making thousands from versions of his paintings. Scottish art historian Duncan Macmillan once said of Vittriano: 'He’s welcome to paint so long as nobody takes him seriously.' And Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said: 'Jack Vettriano is no 21st-century Van Gogh. He is the Tom Jones of art: big, bold, brassy and devoid of inner truth.' Jones added: 'The world of Jack Vettriano is a crass male fantasy that might have come straight out of Money by Martin Amis.' Sandy Moffat, head of drawing and painting at Glasgow School of Art, said: 'He can’t paint, he just colours in', while Richard Calvocoressi, former director of The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, said: 'I’d be more than happy to say that we think him an indifferent painter and that he is very low down our list of priorities (whether or not we can afford his work, which at the moment we obviously can’t). 'His ""popularity"" rests on cheap commercial reproductions of his paintings.' Alice Jones wrote in The Independent that in Vettriano's paintings 'women are sexual objects, frequently half naked and vulnerable, always in stockings and stilettos.' But sculptor David Mach has spoken out in support of Vettriano saying in The Scotsman: 'If he was a fashion designer Jack would be right up there. 'It’s all just art world snobbery. Anyway, who cares, he probably makes more money than Damien Hirst anyway.' Vittriano himself has said of criticism that his popularity is down to the prints and greetings cards, that Van Gogh and Monet would have been in favour of selling reproductions, telling Radio 4 in 2013: 'Let me put this to you, if Van Gough were alive, if Monet were alive, and you were to say to them, ""look, you can sell a print to a Frenchman for 10 francs"", they would have jumped at the chance.'","Scottish painter's pieces have been reproduced countless times on posters .

"So, is this how the Formula One cars of the future will look? Ferrari have released images of a ‘concept’ design, a cross between their 2015 challenger and a supercar. They have called on their fans to voice their opinion, and, despite its seemingly radical nature compared to today's cars, the Maranello marque insist few changes to the current regulations would be required for F1 to venture down such a route. Ferrari have called on their fans to voice their opinion following the reveal of a concept Formula One car . With the sport looking to make changes for the future, and with ideas up for discussion at an F1 Commission meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, Ferrari have unveiled their own idea as to how an F1 car should look . Sebastian Vettel gets to grips with this year's Ferrari at the season-opening test in Jerez . Vettel is starting his first season with Ferrari after the four-times world champion left Red Bull . Explaining the release of the pictures, Ferrari said via their website: ‘Would it be possible to come up with an F1 car which not only is technologically advanced, but also captivating to the eye and aggressive-looking? And could this be made without having to overturn the current technical rules? ‘At Ferrari, we believe so. Let us introduce you to the ‘concept design’ that was conceived by our design studio together with the Scuderia’s aero department. ‘Minimal changes give the car a look that is way different from what have been familiar with so far. ‘Our challenge was to create something that was – to put it short – better looking.’ Former Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso puts his new McLaren through its paces at the opening winter test . Ferrari’s aggressive design comes on the day the Formula One Commission is considering aesthetic changes to the cars for the 2016 campaign and beyond. Wider cars and tyres have been agreed on in principle, but a date is yet to be settled on.

"Britain has been warned to brace itself for 'boats full of terrorists' if Islamist fanatics are allowed to cement their foothold in Libya. Egypt's Ambassador to the UK said the flood of migrants from north Africa  poses a new threat now that the Islamic State controls the Libyan coastal town of Sirte. Nasser Kamel's comments come after 2,164 migrants were rescued at sea in a 24-hour period over the weekend in what has been described as an 'exodus without precedent'. He said: 'You know how far Sirte is from Italy? It's 300km. 'Those boat people who go for immigration purposes and try to cross the Mediterranean... in the next few weeks, if we do not act together, they will be boats full of terrorists also.' Scroll down for video . Uncertain future: Migrants arrived as Italy's interior minister warned of an 'exodus without precedent' Rescue: Another 2,000 stricken migrants were rescued from the Mediterranean by Italian officials . Mr Kamel also criticised Britain and other countries that intervened militarily in Libya in 2011 for not doing enough to help the transition from Colonel Gaddafi's dictatorship to a legitimate state. He told BBC's Newsnight: 'I think after toppling Gaddafi, while no one is questioning that he was a dictator, we as an international community, especially those that intervened militarily, did not put enough resources (in) for developing a modern, democratic, Libyan state. 'I think we should have done more, the UN should have been more involved.' He also called for the lifting of the UN arms embargo on the Libyan government to help it fight terrorism. David Cameron today insisted he does not regret British efforts to oust Gaddafi despite the growing unrest and the threat from terrorists. The Prime Minister added the UK would not abandon Libya as he maintained his decision to send British military forces to the north African country in 2011 was the 'right thing to do'. Italy had yesterday also warned  to expect an exodus of migrants, with a heightened risk of jihadis 'slipping into Europe' after boarding boats crossing the Mediterranean. Bombing: It was Egypt's first official military action in Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 . Retaliation: Egypt blitzed ISIS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers in a video (above) released on Sunday . Interior minister Angelino Alfano insisted the North African state was an 'absolute priority', warning there was 'not a minute to lose'. ISIS, which wants to include Italy as part of its so-called Caliphate, now controls a number of ports and there are fears that fighters could be on boats bound for southern Europe. Mr Alfano added: 'If the militias of the Caliphate advance faster than the decisions of the international community how can we put out the fire in Libya and stem the migration flows? We are at risk of an exodus without precedent.' Italy says there are about 600,000 migrants in Libya preparing to make the perilous sea crossing – a third of them in five camps along the coast. Italian coastguards were also reportedly threatened during recent rescue operations when four armed men approached by speedboat from the Libyan coast. Militants loyal to so-called Islamic State have heightened concerns they could establish a stronger presence in the area after they beheaded 21 hostages, who were all Coptic Christians from Egypt, on a Libyan beach. It is feared the political uncertainty and violent power struggles in the north African country are the worst seen since Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011. 'Working for unity in Libya': David Cameron insisted he does not regret British efforts to oust Gaddafi despite the growing unrest and the threat from terrorists . Speaking in Hove, Mr Cameron told reporters: 'On the question of abandoning Libya, there's no question of Britain abandoning Libya. 'Britain is giving Libya support through our aid budget. We did a major training project for the Libyan security forces. We are doing work to try and bring together a national unity government in Libya. 'But of course what we face in Libya is a very difficult situation with far too many armed militias, without a proper government and with the growth of ungoverned space, and we've had the appalling events of the last few days with the brutal, senseless murders of Coptic Christians on the beach, which I know has shocked the whole world. 'I discussed it yesterday with the president of Egypt and what the whole world needs to do is come together and work for a Libya that has a national unity government, obviously excluding terrorists, and that can start to build the institutions of a state. 'Do I regret that Britain played our role in getting rid of Gaddafi and coming to the aid of that nation when Gaddafi was going to murder his own citizens in Benghazi? No I don't. 'It was the right thing for Britain to do. Gaddafi was no friend of our country - the Semtex given to the IRA has done a huge amount of damage in our country. 'Libya, Britain and the world are better off without Gaddafi but we have to do as much as we can now with, I hope, a willing Libyan population and politicians to try and bring that national unity government together - but it has been very hard work.'","Egypt's Ambassador to the UK warns of a new threat from north Africa .

"They can burn with intense heat that destroys swathes of habitat in just a few hours and throws out huge clouds of thick black smoke. But it seems that despite this pollution, forest fires may actually be helping to cool the planet. Scientists have found that the destruction caused by wildfires in the huge boreal forests of north America and Eurasia can lower temperatures. Forest fires like above can destroy huge areas of vegetation so  the landscape reflects more of the sun's heat . This is because fires transform the landscape, allowing snow and ice to cover the ground and changing the amount of sunlight it reflects. Cows and other livestock can produce large amounts of methane as they digest their food - a gas that can contribute to global warming. However, biologists have found that by tweaking the way in which cattle graze in fields it is possible to use cows to cut the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by trapping it in the soil. The researchers used a technique called adaptive multi-paddock grazing management, which involves using small-sized fields that are grazed for only short periods of time. The fields are then given a long period to recover before they are grazed again, allowing plants to grow longer roots and store carbon dioxide from the air in their tissues. As they die, the carbon stored in the plants then becomes trapped in the soil. The method mimics the natural migration of wild herd animals such as elk, bison and deer. Dark green foliage of trees tends to absorb heat from the sun while the snow covered ground is more reflective. The study, led by Dr Brendan Rogers at Woods Hole Research Centre in Massachusetts, found that in areas where the destruction is greatest the cooling affect is also bigger. In total it could account for twice as much cooling as other natural cooling, such as aerosols release from volcanoes, put together. The findings could alter predictions for how the climate is likely to change as carbon dioxide emissions increase. Dr Rogers said that climate scientists may need to factor in the affect of forest fires on global warming in their models. He said: 'Current global fire models neglect the influence of these species-level traits and misrepresent boreal fire feedbacks to climate warming. 'We need to move beyond generic representations of trees, and use this information to make informed decisions on how to manage forest fires for climate mitigation.' It has been commonly assumed that forest fires might contribute to global warming by releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The black soot produced from these fires can also cover the surrounding landscape and absorb heat from the sun. The graph above shows the amount of sunlight reflected by the landscape after a forest fire in North America (NA), Eurasia (EU), north east Eurasia (NEEU), southern Eurasia (SEU) and northwest Eurasia (NWEU) Spruce forests in North America, like this one above in Yosemite National Park, are particularly flammable . Black spruce, like above in British Columbia, Canada, can absorb a lot of heat from the sun even in winter but after a forest fire the snow can lie on the ground and reflect much more of the sunlight than before . However, the researchers found that the long-term 'albedo' effect - where the colour of the landscape changes and reflects sunlight - caused by the destruction of the forest by fire has an overall cooling impact, particularly in the cold winter months. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that the forests in Alaska and Canada are dominated by black spruce trees that burn ferociously. It is here that the forest fires also seem to cool the climate the most. In northern Europe and Siberia, where the forests are dominated by Scots Pine and larch, their impact on the climate is 69 per cent weaker. This, say the researchers, is because more of the vegetation that covers the ground is destroyed by the fire in the black spruce forests, opening up more of the land to snow cover. The diagram above shows how natural and man-made influences can cause 'radiative forcing' of the climate . Forest fires release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere but they also produce cooling that lasts for years . The researchers calculated that in North America, forest fires like this can cool the climate by around 6 Watts per square metre. In Eurasia, they found that forest fires will cool the climate by around 1.9 Watts per square metre. Known as 'radiative forcing' this suggests that forest fires can make a significant contribution to balance global warming from carbon dioxide emissions. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Dr Rogers and his colleagues, said: 'Our results provide evidence that fire-related climate feedbacks from the two continents are decidedly different. 'It has been shown that fires in North American boreal forests may have an overall cooling effect because of the dominant surface short-wave forcing5. 'Although highly dependent on severity, this can be twice as strong as the other combined biogeochemical and aerosol forcing terms, which are generally positive and scale with carbon emissions. 'In contrast, fires in boreal Eurasia may be close to climate-neutral or have a warming effect. 'We found that current-generation global fire models do not capture the continental differences described above.'","Researchers at Woods Hole Research Centre looked at the impact of fires .

"A Utah high school senior was forbidden from attending her school's Valentine's Day dance because it was for couples only - and she didn't have a date. Friends Josee Stetich, Mikayla Robertson and Shivani Lindmeir, who are all 18-year-old students at Bountiful High School, had planned to go to the dance as friends when they did not get dates to the 'Sweethearts Dance'. But when they arrived at the Utah State Fairgrounds in Salt Lake City, school officials said only Lindmeir and Robertson could attend because they had bought a ticket together. Josee Stetitch (middle) was forbidden from attending her Utah high school's Valentine's Day dance with friends Mikayla Robertson (right) and Shivani Lindmeir (left) because she did not have a date . But Stetich could not attend solo. 'They said ""No, you can't come in, because you don't have a date,""' Stetich told KUTV. Stetich was willing to pay the $30 couple's ticket price, but administrators wouldn't budge. 'I didn't get asked to the dance, which is fine,' she said. 'I love hanging out with my girls. It would've been fun.' Stetich said she had never heard of the rule before. The girls said it was a disappointing blow after they had spent the entire day getting ready and going out to dinner in anticipation for the event. 'I didn't get asked to the dance, which is fine,' Stetich said. 'I love hanging out with my girls. It would've been fun' 'We got our hair done, put on nice gowns and Josee even bought new shoes,' Robertson told ABC News. 'We wanted to look our best and be dressed and ready as though we would have had a date.' The school refunded Robertson and Lindmeir's ticket and the three girls toured a nearby chocolate factory instead. Bountiful High School Principal Greg Wilkey, who confirmed the dance was only for couples, told KUTV he was informed by assistant principal Sue Baylis that the three girls left 'voluntarily' after their tickets were refunded, and that there were 'no protests' from the students or their parents. 'Sue said none of the girls were upset or protested,' Wilkey said in a statement. 'They knew it was couples only, but they were hoping for a pass.' But Stetich said all her friends, and their parents, were upset. And they believe the school policy should be changed. 'It's not a necessary rule,' she said. 'People don't get asked to dances, and sometimes plans change.' Stetich was willing to pay the $30 couple's ticket price to attend the dance at the Utah State Fairgrounds (pictured) in Salt Lake City, but administrators wouldn't budge .

"What should have been the holiday of a lifetime soon turned into a personal hell as a serious leg infection while visiting Thailand turned John Capretta's world upside down. Capretta, 25, a network engineer from Melbourne, had gone for a two-week holiday in Thailand. But after spending five enjoyable days in Bangkok, an accident on his first day in Koh Pangan island, on Christmas Day, gave him an unwanted present. He had gone out with a group of people from a nearby hostel, and when they stopped at a beach he decided to go for a run. It was a decision he would live to regret. John Capretta could still manage a smile despite a dislocated right finger and an infected left leg . 'I tripped and cut my left ankle on some metal. There were some superficial cuts on my leg and then a deep one, but it wasn't a big deal,' John explained. 'Afterwards I went to a clinic and they sent me to a hospital to get treatment. I came back from the hospital with it bandaged up. They gave me some meds and I was told to keep the wound clean every day, so no problems.' In the fall John had also dislocated his finger which was now in a splint and it seemed this was going to cause more bother than his leg, however, things soon took a turn for the worse. Things didn't look to bad at first but the infection in John's leg just refused to go away . 'Two days later my leg got really swollen. My friends got concerned about it and told me to go to the First Western Hospital - I ended up staying there for two weeks,' John said. 'I didn't feel sick or anything. But when I went back to the hospital, they opened up the wound to have a look and it was all black inside.' Over the next fortnight John had five procedures on his leg in Thailand including a series of debridements, where they took away the infected tissue. Even when he arrived back to Australia on January 11 he wasn't out of the woods. He had to have two more surgery procedures at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne. This included a skin graft because so much infected skin had to be cut out. Despite a number of surgical procedures the infection kept coming back again and again . 'Unfortunately, even after surgery in Thailand, it was still infected. So they had to do two more surgeries a in Melbourne. I was there for a week and a half,' he said. John can look back now and talk calmly about what he's been through, but at the time it was a very different story. 'The most scary thing was that they told me in hospital in Thailand that they'd only have to cut out all the infected area and I'd be fine. But every time they did that when they'd check my leg the next day there would still be infection there. ' At one stage I did think 'Am I going to lose my leg or something?' The thought did cross my mind. But you have to stay positive.' After five days in Bangkok John's holiday was going well until he got a Christmas present he'll never forget . 'But it was worrying because it as like it was an invincible bacteria and just kept coming back. At that point when it kept coming back it was a pretty scary period. Something very minor just got out of control.' Fortunately John is nearly back to full health but still has to have his leg checked regularly. 'These checks are just precautionary,' he said. 'It won't put me off travelling.' And the one other crucial thing he learned about the whole experience - if you go on holidays always have travel insurance.","John Capretta fell while out for a run on his first day in Koh Pangan island .

"To many, it would seem the epitome of paradise - an idyllic isle thousands of miles from civilisation where the worst noise pollution comes from the azure sea gently lapping the shore. But no-one can be persuaded to live there, for love nor money. The colony on the remote Pitcairn Islands, which were largely populated in the late 1700s when mutineers on the HMS Bounty washed ashore, is under threat of dying out. Faced with a rapidly ageing population and with no children having been born there for more than four years, the inhabitants are desperately trying to attract new residents. But the task is proving far harder than they hoped, in large part due to its dark past of child sex abuse that continues to haunt the community to this day. Scroll down for video . Shirking paradise: Inhabitants on Pitcairn Island, the last British overseas territory in the Pacific Ocean, are struggling to attract new residents because of a lack of jobs and its dark past of child sex abuse scandals . Andrew Christian (above) is one of just 50 inhabitants on Pitcairn. Pitcairn officials have been trying to raise the population up to 80 for three years with an impassioned plea for new people to join their tiny community . Remote location: The island is believed to have been inhabited by Polynesians for hundreds of years, but the first European encounter came when Captain Philip Carteret's HMS Swallow stumbled across it in 1767 . Cut off from civilisation: The islands are more than 3,000 miles from New Zealand and 1,000 miles  from Tahiti . In 2004, six men were jailed for child sex offences in a scandal that made headlines around the world. Get past that and there is still the problem of a severe shortage of job opportunities. Pitcairn officials have been trying to raise the population up to 80 for three years with an impassioned plea for new people to join their tiny community. But only one person has applied to make the move to the island, located some 3,000km from New Zealand and 1,000km from Tahiti. The island is believed to have been inhabited by Polynesians for hundreds of years, but the first European encounter came when Capt Philip Carteret's HMS Swallow stumbled across it in 1767. The bulk of the island's ancestors arrived 22 years later when the HMS Bounty arrived, led by Fletcher Christian. The eight mutineers from the vessel settled on the island with six Polynesian men and twelve women from Tahiti that they brought with them. But paradise did not last and, within four years, only four mutineers and ten women and their children remained, with the rest murdered because of ill treatment or jealousy. The island features beautiful scenery and wildlife but that doesn't seem to be enough to attract new residents . Fewer than 50 islanders - including Pawl Warren (above) - live in Adamstown, the smallest capital in the world . Bleak future: Pitcairn residents wave off a boat of tourists. Only one person has applied to relocate there . It is not the only black mark in the history of the island after a child abuse scandal rocked the community in 2004. Eleven years ago, six men, including the Pitcairn mayor Steve Christian, were jailed for a string of sex offences, meaning that almost half of the island's male population were locked up. Now the islanders face a race against time to restore its image and the population. Fewer than 50 islanders live on the isolated rock in Adamstown, the smallest capital in the world, and the average age is now more than 50 years old. Pitcairn-born Jacqui Christian, 44, said: 'We've been appealing for more people to boost the population and we've had many inquiries, but only one person has applied to move to Pitcairn. 'The reality is that we don't really have any jobs to offer. 'Islanders used to sell stamps to raise funds but, of course, stamp collecting is not as popular as it once was. 'And the ships that go between Pitcairn and New Zealand were scrapped. 'The island has been surviving on government aid since 2004 and now we are trying to become self-sufficient again.' Jacqui, like many Pitcairn children, left the island at the tender age of 12 to go to a boarding school in New Zealand and did not return to the island for 20 years. But she insists that the lure of the island's beautiful vistas could not keep her away forever. Ageing population: Len Brown holds a nail from the HMS Bounty in his workshop on the island . History: A cannon from the HMS Bounty is proudly displayed in front of Len Brown's house on the island . Remote: The Pitcairn Islands are the last British territory in the Pacific Ocean . The island's representative in Europe, Jacqui said: 'The journey to the island feels like the middle of nowhere. 'But once you are there, you are as connected as anywhere else - the island has electricity and internet now. It is like a completely different world being there. 'It's a special place and it's beautiful seeing the stars without light pollution and there are the bluest waters you've ever seen.' The island now hopes to move past their history to attract more visitors. One visitor Tony Probst, 56, from San Francisco, in the United States, has made the long trip to the island on four occasions since 2010, spending up to a month in Adamstown. The electronics shop owner, who left his native Scotland aged six to sail around the world with his family, owns the biggest collection from the HMS Bounty  in private hands. He said: 'I was given a book about the Bounty by my dad as a kid and I made a promise to my adult self that I would go. 'And it didn't disappoint. In fact, it far exceeded my expectations. 'If the world came to an end the islanders would still survive, it's a totally different lifestyle. 'The first thing you realise when you get to the island is that you can just feel the history of the place when you set foot on dry land.' The Mutiny on the Bounty took place in 1789 when Captain William Bligh was ousted by his second-in-command, Fletcher Christian. Bligh was cast adrift in a dinghy and later landed on the island of Timor, in the then Dutch East Indies, from where he travelled back to Britain. The mutineers first sailed to Tahiti, dropping off 16 of their number. Fletcher Christian, eight mutineers and 18 Tahitians - six men and 12 women - then set sail to avoid apprehension, landing on Pitcairn in 1790.

The Tahiti-based mutineers were recaptured in 1791. Three were later executed after a trial.

"A list compiled by genealogy experts shows some hilarious names given to some children in the 1800s . With the likes of Suri, Apple and Audio Science tossing sand at each other in Hollywood playgrounds, it's clear some modern-day parents are always striving for something a little different when it comes to naming their children. But it appears that  parents were even playing the originality game with their offspring right back in the 19th century - albeit with slightly less stylish results. According to a hilarious list of historic baby names, children born in the 1800s were given names such as Mineral Waters and Friendless Baxter by their highly-amused parents. One inventive couple even pipped Victoria Beckham to the post by calling their child after the place they were born or conceived - more than 100 years before Brooklyn Beckham entered our lives. Joseph and Ann Cope's child was given the name Leicester Railway after being born in a carriage at the station in 1863. Another young girl was given the name Windsor to go with her surname Castle, while one poor boy from Walthamstow was labelled One Too Many when he was born in 1870. The entertaining list was put together by genealogy firm Fraser & Fraser in London, who have spent more than 40 years trawling through documents to find the most bizarre names in the 19th century. The experts then whittled down the list to the most 10 most amusing names for children born around the UK at that time. Neil Fraser, 39, a partner at the firm, said the hilarious names could be interpreted as being 'unkind' because somebody has to live with it. But he also said it showed Britons had a real sense of humour at that time. He said: 'Our genealogists get to look through hundreds of thousands of birth, death and marriage records. 'Over the years we have picked out certain names which have amused us and we've made a note of them. 'We have been pulling them out of records for the past 40 years and some of them are quite brilliant and hilarious. These historic birth certificates show some of the names given to children during the 19th century, which included a child born in 1892 being called Mineral Waters . One young girl was given 25 names, representing each letter of the alphabet, while her surname 'Pepper' made up the 26th letter . Despite the most popular name at the time being John and Mary, one of the peculiar girls' names found by the genealogists was Zebra Lynes, who was born in Southampton in 1875. Also on the list was Faith Hope Charity, born in Gillingham in 1892, and the young boy born in Hoo, Kent who was given the pronoun Time Of to cunningly match his surname Day. One girl on the list was even given 26 names by her parents to represent every letter in the English alphabet. The young girl, who was born in 1882 in West Derby, was named 'Ann Bertha Cecilia Diana Emily Fanny Gertrude Hypatia Iug Jane Kate Louisa Maud Nora Orphelia Quince Rebecca Starkey Teresa Ulysis Venus Winifred Xenophen Yetty Zeus.' Her surname, Pepper, accounted for 26th letter of the alphabet. Another young boy born in Hoo, Kent, was given the name Time Of to go alongside his surname Day . Meanwhile, a boy born in Strood, Kent, was also named That's It Who'd Have Thought It. Experts at Fraser & Fraser spend hours trawling through birth, death and marriage records trying to find names of family members. It was after continually seeing the number of A-list celebs calling their children unusual names that the firm decided to compile the list and share it with the public. Among the bigger list was a child who was called Prince Charles and a young boy who was given the moniker John Stone to go with his surname Wall.  There was also Frank Still Knight, who was born in Newbury. Mr Fraser added: 'One of the people we found had 25 given names - making one name beginning with each letter in the English alphabet when added to their surname, which is unique. One child was even called Leicester Railway (pictured) after being born in a carriage at the station in 1863 . 'I imagine most parents struggle to find a suitable name for their child, so it must have been a horrendous task to try and find 25. 'A boy was named ""Leicester Railway"" after he was born on a carriage at Leicester Train Station. 'It shows people in the 19th century had a great sense of humour. But some of the names on the list, for example, One Too Many' Gouldstone might be seen as unkind.' The father-of-one, from Highgate, London, named his 18-month-old son Nelson Eugeniusz Isambard Lukasz - which is an acronym of his name, Neil. He added: 'As a parent you like to give your child a name which you feel is unique and individual. But we should always remember the child has to live with this name. 'I'm pretty sure if a parent tried to name their child One Too Many nowadays, it would not be allowed.' Births, deaths and marriages are public records and anyone can access this information. 1. Friendless - Friendless Baxter was born in 1871 in Leeds, West Yorks. His parents were James and Jane Baxter. His father was a poultry dealer. 2.

"A P-plate driver who was filmed repeatedly swearing at a police officer and taunting him over his weight will be slapped with more than $700 in fines after footage of his encounter was uploaded to social media. The man, believed to be in his early 20s, was pulled over by an officer in Sydney on Saturday for driving without his P-plates. He was filmed calling the officer a 'f***ing useless piece of s**t' before uploading the video to Facebook where it has been viewed almost 80,000 times. NSW Police have since confirmed the man will receive two fines - one for driving without P-plates and another for offensive language - after Daily Mail Australia published footage of the encounter on Monday. The infringement notice for driving without P-plates is $242, while using offensive language comes with a $500 fine. Scroll down for video . Two young men have filmed themselves repeatedly swearing at a police officer after they were fined for driving without p-plates in Sydney on Saturday . The driver was filmed verbally abusing the officer by a friend in the passenger seat after they were made to wait 15 minutes before they were handed a fine. The video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver's license before the two men unleashed a torrent of abuse. 'Four times you've been given tickets for not displaying p-plates,' the officer can be heard saying. The driver hit back: 'What are you trying to prove? You want to know what I think of you. I think you're just a f***ing useless piece of s**t.' 'You're just bored.You're just a redneck that's bored.' Scott Weber, president of the Police Association of NSW, described the footage as 'disgusting' and said it showed 'a lack of regard to police officers and the job they do'. 'I think the offender needs to realise they have broken the law,' Mr Weber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Regardless of how minor he thinks these offences are it does not warrant behaviour that is offensive and does not meet community standards. 'If people want to drive on the road or to be part of society, they have to obey society's rules and laws. 'If they disagree with that, swearing or becoming aggressive is not the way to deal with the situation.' The video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver's license before he tells the driver this is the fourth time he has been pulled over for the same offence . The p-plate driver uploaded footage of the encounter to Facebook boasting about his brush with the law . The video shows the passenger chiming in accusing the officer of being 'racist' for pulling them over. 'You are a racist. Mate you done 180kms to catch me without p-plates. You're putting people in danger for a p-plate,' the driver said. His friend ordered the officer to hand back the license before telling his to 'wake up to yourself'. 'You've done your job, now we're going. We've been waiting for 15 minutes for you to give us a fine for a P-plate,' he said. The officer was filmed warning the driver not to drive like that again to avoid getting another fine before asking if the pair had any questions. 'Only question I have is that you need help... like Jenny Craig,' the driver said. 'Give yourself an upper cut.' Mr Weber said situations like this could have easily escalated and it was part of a 'sad trend' where people had a lack of respect for police. 'If a person disobeys a police direction that can set in motion a chain of events which can lead to fines, an arrest or serious injury or even officers using their appointments – baton or firearm,' Mr Webers said. 'It can escalate very quickly.' The driver called the officer a 'f***ing useless piece of s**t' but was allowed to drive away without a fine . The p-plate driver uploaded footage of the encounter to Facebook and it has since been viewed more than 60,000 times . 'There are proper avenues to question police directions or behaviour. There are oversight bodies that govern police behaviour, or you can take the matter to court. 'It is a sad trend in society where people have a lack of respect for not only police, it occurs across the board with teachers, nurses, doctors and ambulance officers.' Mr Weber said disrespectful behaviour was not confined to any age group. 'All people from an early age can question authority, but if you disagree or are told something you dislike or are instructed to do something you don't want to, it's not right to become violent or aggressive, or use offensive language, it's about having a conversation,' he said.","Two young men were pulled over in Sydney for driving without P-plates .

"Gary Miller (pictured) threatened to send sexually explicit photos and videos of his ex-girlfriend to her employer to ruin her chances of getting promotion . A jilted lover threatened to send sexually explicit photos and videos to his ex-girlfriend's employer to ruin her chances of getting promotion. Binman Gary Miller, of Salford, Greater Manchester, sent his lover 44 messages in under a month, some of which were threats to send naked images and footage of her to her council employers. Bombarding the victim with texts, the 44-year-old married father-of-one wrote 'I am going to send an email with photos to Leeds City Council' and 'Your boss will love it, promotion over'. A court heard that despite Miller threatening to send the material to her employers he tried to keep the case from his own bosses and family. Miller had been involved in an alleged racist incident at work last September and claimed the stress caused by that and his suspension from his job as a Salford council binman caused him to act out of character. In the incident Miller, a UNISON shop steward, was accused of telling a Polish worker that town hall jobs are 'for English people'. Miller also claimed his relationship with the victim was a way of talking to someone about his job and drinking problems. The pair only met in person three times but exchanged numerous 'sexually explicit' photos and videos, Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court heard. It was said that the nature of their relationship was mainly sexual. Louise Hartley, prosecuting, said: 'The complainant and defendant met on Facebook in 2014. They met in person on three occasions. 'Between November 17 and December 13 last year she was sent 44 texts, most of which were sexually explicit. 'She responded to three in the hope he would leave her alone.' But former Royal Marine Miller continued to harass the victim with texts messages and threats. Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard how the married father-of-four sent his lover 44 messages in under a month . Defence barrister Patrick Williamson said: 'He has said his mind was clouded by problems at work and because he was drinking so much.' Miller was ordered to pay £85 court costs and £60 victim surcharge, as well as undergoing a community order and curfew preventing him leaving home between 6pm-6am after pleading guilty to harassment. He was also given a two-year restraining order preventing him contacting the victim. Magistrate Gary Gillespie said of 'revenge porn': 'It is becoming more a feature of a relationship that breaks down. What is deemed to be private is becoming public and used as a weapon.'","Gary Miller sent his ex-lover 44 messages in under a month, court is told .

"Former Islamic State fighters who deserted the terror group have leaked a set of chilling letters purportedly containing the handwritten orders and commands of senior commanders. The notes contain orders for ISIS militants to carry out suicide bomb explosions, to besiege villages in Syria and Iraq and even to claim credit for last month's terror attacks in the French capital, Paris. Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent, and are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters, whose job it is to pass on or act upon the information contained in the letters. Brutal: This letter dated August 22 last year refers to the distribution of 'relief goods' - understood to be food and medical supplies. In it the commander of Raqqa province demands a militant named Abu Imad ensures the supplies are only given to the Mujahideen brothers [fighters], not the suffering local population . Claim: The letter on the right contains an order for a militant named Faruq al-Jazrawi to contact the ISIS media office in Deir ez-Zor immediately in order to take responsibility for Paris' Charlie Hebdo terror attack . Demonstration: Thousands of French citizens are seen taking part in a solidarity march through the streets of Paris after last month's terror attacks left 17 people dead. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the atrocities . The letters have not been independently verified and ISIS are yet to comment on them, but they were originally published on a Twitter account claiming to represent ISIS' Al Qaeda-affiliated enemy in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra - also known as the Al-Nusra Front. Each of the handwritten notes was shared on the social media website with the hashtag #HackingTheSecretMessagesOfBaghdadiState and came with an explanation that they had originally been given to jihadis who had fled ISIS, according to Vocativ. The men are now said to be fighting for Al-Nusra in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor - an ISIS stronghold - and are determined to expose the inner workings of the barbaric terror group which has seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in its campaign of rape and massacre. One letter purportedly sent from ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa on January 13 contained an order for a militant named Faruq al-Jazrawi to contact the ISIS media office in Deir ez-Zor immediately in order to claim responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo terror attack in Paris six days earlier. Another letter sent on May 13 last year contains a sickening order for a fighter named Abu Ahmad al-Tunisi to organise a suicide bomb attack on the 'disbelievers of Shejil' - a village near Deir ez-Zor. The note insists 'one of the brothers from the [Arab] peninsula' carry out the atrocity. Giving orders: The letters have not been independently verified and ISIS are yet to comment on them, but they were originally published on a Twitter account claiming to represent ISIS' Al Qaeda-affiliated enemy in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra - also known as the Al-Nusra Front . Bloodthirsty: The letter on the left was sent on May 13 last year and contains a sickening order for a fighter named Abu Ahmad al-Tunisi to organise a suicide bomb attack on the 'disbelievers of Shejil' - a village near Deir ez-Zor. The note insists 'one of the brothers from the [Arab] peninsula' carry out the atrocity . Militants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters . Another letter purportedly sent by the Islamic State on August 22 last year refers to the distribution of 'relief goods' - understood to be food and medical supplies. In it the commander of Raqqa province demands a militant named Abu Imad ensures the supplies are only given to the Mujahideen brothers [fighters], not the suffering local population. Each of the letters is signed with a blue stamp, which appears to indicate authenticity and the province from which it was sent. The vast majority of the leaked letters were sent between commanders in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor provinces. Deir ez-Zor is also where the branch of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front terror group - who say they came in to possession of the letters when local ISIS fighters defected - claim to be based. The letters are among the first indications of how the terrorist organisation operates. The brief, handwritten instructions recall the so-called 'pizzini' Sicilian Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano used to communicate with the rank and file while on the run from the authorities in the 1990s. The emergence of the letters comes amid reports that ISIS' leadership  has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi  (pictured) Dead: Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left), a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. Another former member of Saddam Hussein's army turned ISIS commander, Abu Musa al-Alwani (right), has also been killed . The jihadi who murdered two civilians in Denmark swore allegiance to Islamic State just nine minutes before his first attack. Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein declared his devotion to the terror group on his Facebook page and then gunned down a film director at a free speech debate in Copenhagen. The 22-year-old fanatic later killed a volunteer security guard at a synagogue before police shot him dead. Last night it emerged that Danish intelligence service PET was warned that El-Hussein had become radicalised while in prison. A senior member of his former gang, called the Brothas, said El-Hussein had been released two weeks ago. Abo Saddam added: 'When he went inside he was a member of our gang. He lived his life with us. We would drive around, smoke hashish together, fight rival gangs. This is the Omar that I knew. 'But when he came out he changed. He stopped keeping in touch with the Brothas. The emergence of the letters comes amid reports that the Islamic State's leadership in Syria and Iraq has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, have killed more than 6,000 fighters since September, including more than half the militants serving on ISIS' ruling council. Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders. This because his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists is becoming increasingly small the longer the airstrikes continue targeting the terror group. Baghdadi has not been seen in public since July and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes. The likelihood, however, is that Baghdadi has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months. Other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq that remain under ISIS' control. This forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead, or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if ISIS' rivals on the ground.","Notes contain orders for ISIS militants to carry out sickening acts of terror .

"A woman who plummeted 150 feet off a seaside California cliff only to land upside down at the start of what became a 72-hour battle to survive has now shared the tale of how she made it out alive. Debbie Lopez, 57, says at first she didn't realize her truck had landed on its roof February 7 after she skidded off the road while putting out a cigarette. When the full breadth of her dire situation sunk in, it took the Atascadero woman an unbelievable 24 hours just to get out of car. Miracle: Debbie Lopez, 57, is seen here as she recovered in a California hospital following 72 hours she spent first escaping from her vehicle then climbing up a cliff face after her truck plummeted 150 feet when she missed a curve in a road along the Pacific Coast on February 7 . 'The truck just flew over, and I could just feel myself flying down and hitting things I don't know what I hit, and when I landed, I didn't know I was upside down,' she told KSBY. With no drinking water in her truck, Lopez says she survived on water that collected from a storm in the vehicle's wheel well. But even after she managed to escape the truck with serious bruises and injured ribs, the 150-foot cliff face rose menacingly before her. 'I just kept looking for different outlets and you know striking out, striking out,' Lopez told KEYT of the beginning of her ascent. Plummeted: Lopez was driving her pickup along this road near Ragged Point, California when she missed a turn while putting out a cigarette . But, she says thoughts of faith and family kept pushing on. 'I knew at that point that I had to get myself out, I had to see my husband and my family.' Lopez told the San Luis Obispo Tribune that she prayed the rosary over a dozen times for each of the two days she spent clawing her way up the cliff overlooking the Pacific. 'It was the adrenaline of just knowing I could not get back down if I stopped,' Lopez said, 'I just kept going forward and forward, little by little.' For 48 hours, she made her way up. Finally, on Tuesday, she was at the road. She bent down and kissed the pavement. Lopez managed to flag down a passing family visiting from Louisiana who called for help. She was released from the hospital Thursday. 'I just have a new lease on life, and there is a God and he listens,' she told KSBY. 'I just have a new lease on life, and there is a God and he listens,' Lopez said .

"Drifting on the surface of the ocean, jellyfish-like creatures called Portuguese man o' war are feared by swimmers and surfers because of their painful stings. But one photographer has braved numerous agonising encounters to capture these beautiful creatures on film. Taken at the waterline, the photographs show the siphonophore’s luminious tentacles glowing brightly beneath the waves. Drifting on the surface of the ocean, jellyfish-like creatures called Portuguese man o' war are feared by swimmers and surfers because of their painful stings. They glow because of a natural phenomenon called bioluminescence . Matthew Smith, originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, was attracted to the creatures, also known as bluebottles, because of their vivid colouring. Found in tropical and subtropical waters, the bluebottles live at the water’s surface and because they have no means of propulsion, and are carried along by currents, winds and tides. However, they are far from helpless because their tentacles deliver a painful sting. Matthew Smith was attracted to the creatures, also known as bluebottles, because of their vivid colouring. Found in tropical and subtropical waters, the bluebottles live at the water’s surface (pictured left and right) and because they have no means of propulsion, are carried along by currents, winds and tides . The Portuguese man o' war is a carnivore. Using its venomous tentacles (pictured) it  traps and paralyzes its prey. It typically feeds upon small marine organisms, such as fish and plankton, but is itself eaten by loggerhead turtles and the blanket octopus, for example . Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton. The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light. Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction. Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways. Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat. Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators. On numerous occasions the alien-like marine creatures wrapped their tentacles around Mr Smith’s wrist and neck, which were not covered by his wetsuit. He spent the last 12 months at Bass Point Cove in New South Wales, Australia, photographing the Bluebottles. Mr Smith, 38, used an 'over-underwater' technique with a waterproof lens dome he made himself. In order to get highlight the glowing effect of the bluebottles he used an underwater flash gun. The bluebottles appear to light up because of a natural process called bioluminescence. Bioluminescence is also the reason why sea waves to light up neon-blue at night. Tiny plankton are disturbed, causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction. Organisms such as plankton, jellyfish and anglerfish are able to glow by releasing the chemical luciferin, which reacts with oxygen to create light. While some fish use their light to lure prey, it’s thought that jellyfish and siphonophores glow as a defence against predators. For example, comb jellyfish flash brightly to startle attachers, while siphonophores such as bluebottles either display a chain of light or release thousands of glowing particles into the water in order to confuse predators. In the bluebottle’s case, it may draw attention to its venomous tentacles to scare off hungry loggerhead turtles, or equally lure small fish, which it traps and paralyses with its fronds. Dr Andy Davies, a marine biologist at Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences, explained: 'Bioluminescence occurs widely among some groups of animals, especially in the open sea and in insects. Mr Smith (pictured left) spent the last 12 months at Bass Point Cove in New South Wales, Australia, photographing the Bluebottles (right) and suffered numerous stings to his wrists and neck. He used an 'over-underwater' technique with a waterproof lens dome he made himself to create his beautiful images . While some fish use their light to lure prey, it’s thought that jellyfish and siphonophores glow as a defence against predators and in the bluebottle’s case, draw attention to its venomous tentacles . ‘Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater,’ he said. ‘However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light. ‘Sometimes thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of bioluminescent bacteria in the milky seas.' Mr Smith said: ‘What you don't see in the still image is the constantly changing dynamics of what's going on. ‘The ocean is surging back and forth, the wind is blowing and these guys are perfect sailors - they motor along in the slightest breeze. ‘I'm also trying to frame all this up whilst treading water or swimming alongside trying not to get stung. It can be frustrating at the best of times.’ Describing what it feels like to be stung by bluebottles, Mr Smith said: ‘The stings start out like an electric shock feeling, followed by a stinging, tingling sensation which then dulls to muscle numbness around the area after an hour or two. ‘The numbness lasts the rest of the day and too many stings can be potentially dangerous so I do my best to minimise it. ‘I guess they do say you have to suffer for your art.’ Describing what it feels like to be stung by bluebottles, Mr Smith said: ‘The stings start out like an electric shock feeling, followed by a stinging, tingling sensation which then dulls to muscle numbness around the area after an hour or two.

"Technology giants LG Electronics and Samsung are heading to court in a bizarre legal battle over claims  LG executives vandalised four Samsung washing machines at a trade show last year. Jo Seong-jin, head of LG's home appliances department, and three other staff members have been indicted on charges of property damage and defamation. LG hasn't denied their employees were present and looking at the washing machines when the vandalism is alleged to have occurred, but  claimed the products' doors were broken because their hinges were weak. CCTV footage of the incident, released by LG, shows its executives looking at the washing machines . Although LG admits its executives were present, it denies allegations the products were vandalised . The company has also hit back publicly by releasing CCTV footage showing the incident itself and firing off public statements in defence of its staff members. A lawyer for Mr Jo said: 'It is questionable whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that the president of a global company deliberately destroyed the machines where employees of the competing company were present,' The Wall Street Journal reported. He added: 'The truth will be revealed in the courts.' There were unsuccessful attempts by lawyers from both companies to mediate a solution before the charges were laid. And LG has already paid for the four washing machines that were alleged to have been vandalised at the trade show, which was held in Berlin in September last year. But it also responded by releasing the CCTV footage on YouTube, which said it showed the staff members looking at the products at the show in the presence of Samsung staff members, CNBC reported.

"Dean Weiss is quickly building a reputation as one of Australia's leading personal trainers, and it's a world away from the dark days of steroid abuse. Weiss, 30, readily admits he 'crashed and burned' on illegal substances a few years ago and his advice to teenage boys wanting to 'get on the gear' is to 'forget it, there's no quick fix and it's not worth it'. He told Daily Mail Australia his story of trying body-building drugs and how damaging the experience actually was and his fears for the new generation of young gym junkies. Scroll down for video . The before and after images Dean Weiss uses to convince his clients to go clean. At left the much bulkier version using steroids, while at right is the clean Dean version . Dean pictured with competitors he trained for the recent International Natural Bodybuilding Association competition held in Brisbane . 'Steroids weren't for me, so I went back to the basics - hard work and good nutrition and that's what I teach' said Dean Weiss, seen here in sprinting training . 'I’ve been training since I was about 17 and was in mining when I started (using),' he admitted. 'It was before I knew what I was doing, I thought that (taking steroids) was the answer, the people I was hanging around at the time, they did it and they were telling me how good it was and so I gave it a go. Heart problems . High cholesterol levels . Higher then lower sex drive . Depression and no motivation . Hair loss and acne . Permanent liver damage . 'But I just didn’t get the results, there were massive highs but then terrible lows, you'd crash and burn.' The burgeoning business of illicit performance enhancing substances led to more than 10,000 detections by Customs in the 2012-13 year - a record number - double those of Ecstasy and five times more than cocaine seizures. Dean calls himself a Body Transformation Specialist and hopes to keep spreading the message of hard work and good nutrition, taking teams to natural body-building events as proof it works .. but he fears the new generation of gym junkies are doing themselves harm. 'The problem for these kids, 18, 19 or in the early 20s, is they see all the images out of America and all the pros, who live on steroids, and they want to get like that, quickly,' Weiss said. 'Most of our team (at the National Bodybuilding Classic) was there for the first time' Dean Weiss said of the clients he had brought through his Cutting Edge Performance workouts . Dean Weiss in different guises. At play (left) in a natural body-building event and at work (right) getting ready for his next client at Cutting Edge Performance . 'I was assuming the same, that I was gonna get big and strong but the side effects are the thing. 'When you take it, yes, you think it I am strong and you feel you’re invincible, you feel awesome at the time but then there is that other side of it when you just don’t feel right, you don’t feel like going to train, you get lazy, you get down and couldn’t be bothered going to the gym.' 'I didn’t expect to be where I am now, it is crazy to see the transformation in my own life and I try to relate that to my other clients, particularly those who want to go on steroids. 'I talk to them and and walk them through my own story. I have the experience to say to them ""it's wrong, it's cheating"" and hope they follow the plan I have. 'I tell them my story because everyone wants that quick fix, that is why a lot of the young guys they are stuffing their bodies up for later in life. 'There's no real correlation to draw on, no long-term studies, but in the next 10 years there will be a lot of that coming to light and a lot of guys into their 20s right now, they might feel great now and in the next 12 months, things might change. Dean says his clients, including his partner Nicola (on the left), a bikini pro and Chantelle (right) are both proof his plan works, having both won international competitions . Dean oversees the wokout of another client, Cam Bennett, 'who competed last year and won his division for the INBA male fitness and come second for overall in Queensland' 'You've got to ask though, are they gonna crash out in 10 years. What's gonna be the state of the body and the state of mind, if they have been cheating.' But worse still, he said, is the affect it can have on sex drive. 'Look, fact is, when you are on it (a cycle), you have so much testosterone in your system, it isn't a problem but when you come off it, it's not the same, it's a lot harder to sustain anything or even feel like it (sex), you could say it's a bit of a problem,' he said. 'And that’s when a lot of the guys just stay on it, you get sick of not maintaining normality, so they choose never to get off the drugs - it’s like any other addiction. 'Like a junkie, you can't function a normal life. 'The thing is, you are judged if you are a heroin junkie, many see it as disgusting whereas if it is steroids you're using people are a lot less likely to judge, but the fact is they are both Class A drugs, they are both considered as serious as each other by authorities. 'All those substances are so foreign to your body, and the part of the brain which controls the hormones and endocrine system senses an overload of testosterone and shuts off the normal production and it says ""ok we don’t need to produce any more"", it can have a long term effect. 'That’s why people get so dependent on it, I know a few guys who are dependent on it because they have had so much and in their minds they have to keep going, otherwise they just crash. It's one extreme to the next.' 'I've competed in six or seven natural body-building events and I'm proud of what I'm doing now for myself and my team' Dean Weiss said . But Dean is proud of how he turned it all around. 'I decided in 2012 that I needed to leave the mining and construction lifestyle behind and come back into something I really loved doing, going to the gym every day,' he said. 'After I bottomed out, I recovered and got back into training and thought that (drugs) was not the answer and I had to learn how to actually train properly and did a fitness business course and changed my whole perspective on what is healthy and what is not. 'That's why that happened to me, I learned of the physiological changes that happen, learned a lot more about nutrition and got out into the workforce. 'We work hard for natural body building preparation, I've done about 6 or 7 shows, the difference is simple, rather than amazing big highs and equally big crashes, naturally you are fit and strong and stay that way by training properly. 'I love training people properly, so that's why I became a PT, it's full bore ahead from here.'","Leading trainer Dean Weiss admits he once used steroids .

"A landowner whose MP brother claimed expenses for cleaning a moat is embroiled in a planning row over the road to his 18th Century country manor. Aristocrat's son James Hogg, 63, started work without planning permission on a 'minimal' upgrade to an entrance of Grade II*-listed Wherwell Priory near Andover, Hampshire. But the work prompted a complaint from neighbours who live next to the road - in his 100-acre estate's Grade II-listed former gatehouse. Dispute: This gatepost is the centre of a row between James Hogg, the brother of an expenses-claiming MP, and the couple who live at the former gatehouse (pictured) of his 100-acre estate in Hampshire's Test Valley . Estate: A satellite image showing Wherwell Priory (left), the access road and the junction in dispute (right) Mr Hogg said his builders were simply putting a kerb on the road, but neighbours Martin and Gail Starbuck said it looked like 'a large lay-by'. And they said it could increase the number of lorries using their local entrance to the estate, which has other entrances, risking damage to the Grade II-listed gateposts next to their home. Test Valley Borough Council sent enforcement officers and the work has now been halted until the council decides whether Mr Hogg should be granted retrospective planning permission. Mr Hogg is the son of the late Lord Hailsham, a prominent politician who served as Leader of the Lords, Education Secretary and Lord High Chancellor before his death in 2001 aged 94. His brother Douglas Hogg, now the third Viscount Hailsham, was an agriculture minister under John Major but stepped down from the Commons in 2010 after his expenses were exposed. 'Lay-by': Photos were submitted to Test Valley Borough Council to show the extent of the works so far after James Hogg's neighbours Martin and Gail Starbuck complained roadworks had ruined their country view . In one of the most notorious incidents in the MPs' expenses scandal, Douglas Hogg agreed to repay the £2,200 cost of cleaning a moat at his country home after he charged it to the taxpayer. James Hogg was not implicated in the row, but also owns a large estate. Built on the site of a former 10th Century abbey, Wherwell Priory is on a 100-acre island in the middle of the River Test and is used as a wedding venue. In a letter to planners, Mr Hogg's agent said the work was 'de minimis' - Latin for small-scale. He added: 'The access road itself does not require consent as it has been in existence for at least the period of current ownership beginning in 1990, and was indeed used by the present owners (the applicant) when moving in as the only viable route for removal vans. 'The proposal is to construct a kerb which will limit the spread of the existing scalpings used to formulate the road and delineate its line on a permanent basis. 'The road already exists and the central philosophy of this project is simply to maintain and improve it. Controversy: A plan showing the proposed road, which would run to the south of the the Grade II-listed gateposts (centre right) which are next to the former gatehouse (in black) where the neighbours live . 'This will make it more usable as the current arrangement is slightly too small for the use of normal delivery vehicles.' But father-of-two Mr Starbuck, 57, who has lived with his wife in the Priory's former gatehouse for 24 years, said the work had disrupted what was 'until a few months ago a green paddock'. He said: 'It is now a monstrosity. It has pretty well finished. It is an eyesore - it is a hell of a mess. It is absolute nonsense to say it has been there since 1990. It is new. It was a fenced paddock. 'We rang the council and asked if they needed planning permission and the council came down and said he needed permission. 'The council then spoke to Mr Hogg and the work stopped. Mr Hogg has now put in these applications.' In a letter to Test Valley Borough Council, Mr and Mrs Starbuck added: 'The applications make reference to the access road to the south of the listed gateposts as being in existence since 1990. This is untrue. Family: James Hogg's father Lord Hailsham (left) served as Education Secretary before his death aged 94 in 2001. His MP brother Douglas Hogg (right), now 3rd Viscount Hailsham, claimed expenses for moat-cleaning . 'During our residency we have witnessed a gradual, progressive and unauthorised opening up of an alternative entrance to the south of the listed gateposts to allow access by HGVs and other traffic to serve the growing business demands of Wherwell Priory. 'It can clearly be seen from the road [and] it totally detracts from what was a pleasing view of historic parkland... To all intents and purposes it resembles a large lay-by.' They added: 'We are convinced and extremely concerned that this development unless reversed will lead to significantly increased levels of traffic passing within feet of our home.' Wherwell Parish Council chairman Jane Andrews said: 'We need to look into this. It is a shame because we obviously hate neighbour disputes and we like to feel common sense prevails.' A Test Valley Borough Council spokesman said: 'This matter was brought to our attention and investigated by our enforcement team. 'The applicant was then advised planning permission was required for it. Retrospective applications were then made.' The council is expected to make its decision in the summer. Mr Hogg has been contacted for comment.","James Hogg, 63, criticised for work near Grade II*-listed Wherwell Priory .

"First came the 'thigh gap' trend, which demands legs so thin that they do not touch above the knees, gained momentum. Then came the 'bikini bridge', described as 'when bikini bottoms are suspended between the two hip bones, causing a space between the bikini and the lower abdomen.' But with a new year, comes a new body part to hate - and fix. Make way for the 'mon pubis', which refers to the mound of flesh on the pubic bone. The 'mon pubis', which refers to the mound of flesh on the pubic bone  is being hailed as the latest body part to feel insecure about . Writing in The New York Times, Jennifer Weiner explains: 'This year, the hot new body part is the formerly unnoticed span of flesh between the top of one's panties and the labia majora, currently displayed on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition by the model Hannah Davis. 'Great! Another thing to hate about ourselves.' The hashtag #Monspubis is already starting to do the rounds on Twitter and there are plenty of forums dedicated to women who can air their insecurities about the body part. There's even a cosmetic surgery procedure to fix it. Monsplasty, also called Pubic Lift is a surgical procedure used to reduce and tighten the mons pubis. Millie Mackintosh is a fan of posting bikini shots when she hits the beach . According to Davinciplastic.com, the area in question often becomes overly large with weight gain, childbirth or normal ageing. The treatment apparently reduces the sagging skin and tightens remaining muscle and tissue to create an improved appearance. Celebrity skincare guru Jamie Sherrill, who runs skincare line Nurse Jamie, uses non-invasive ways to create a monsplasty effect including using infrared thermal energy - Thermage. Jamie says the treatment uses focused radio‐frequency energy to 'strengthen collagen in your skin for a smooth, sleek look that can help you feel years younger'. In 2014, the 'thigh gap' trend, which demands legs so thin that they do not touch above the knees, gained momentum, with girls citing Cara Delevingne as their inspiration . Speaking about the treatment, Dr. Ernest Guillem M.B.B.S (Lond.), of ‘Marbella Cosmetic High Care Group’, said: 'Monsplasty is a posh word for the removal of suprapubic fat. Not to be confused with lower abbdominoplasty or tummy tuck, it can also occur in men and women who have been overweight and have lost a considerable amount of weight. 'Women seek it because they are on the eternal quest for perfection. With women being constantly bombarded with images in the media of perfect bodies and the current trend of designer abs, abs have never been more visible and more revered. 'You can treat this area with radio frequency assisted lipo suction, which also tightens everything up preventing post-operative loose skin and minimises scarring. Cases resulting from significant weight changes might need surgical correction under general anaesthesia involving the removal of excessive skin . 'It is a walk-in-walk-out treatment with negligible downtime requiring the wearing of compression pants for six weeks. The cost would be approximately £1485. More serious cases need hospital admission and general anaesthesia and therefore the costs are considerably higher with scars healing over a period of ten days.; . Dr Guillem says it is becoming very fashionable and  popular at his clinic in the Costa del Sol where women are spending a lot of time on the beach. The latest body insecurity comes after the 'bikini bridge' became a social media trend last year. There were even facetious comments posted promoting the 'benefits' of possessing a 'bikini bridge' such as 'fitting an iPod into your bikini bridge' and 'getting a smoother tan line from your bikini bridge'. Speaking to MailOnline at the time, body image and wellbeing expert Katie Lowe said: 'The bikini bridge is just another example of horrendous thinspiration that encourages young women to develop poor body image and self-esteem. 'Images like this used to be constrained to pro-anorexia websites - which are themselves dangerous, damaging communities for young men and women to encourage disordered eating behaviours. 'Bikini bridge or otherwise, we need to learn that bodies are beautiful in all shapes and sizes - and encouraging young women to strive towards something like this is an unhealthy result of a body shaming culture.'","Mon pubis refers to  mound of flesh on the pubic bone .

"To cover up the fact he'd crashed his relative's car while driving drunk, Brian Byers concocted a plan to blame the accident on a faked patch of black ice, Sparta police say. The New York Daily News reports that 20-year-old Byers was intoxicated behind the wheel of a 2001 black BMW when he blew past a stop sign and crashed the vehicle into the guard rail. After driving the car back to his house, police say Byers began work on the coverup, filling two buckets with water and driving back to the scene of the crash in 20-year-old accomplice Alexander Zambenedetti's car. On ice: Brian Byers, 20, crashed a relative's BMW while driving drunk and had the help of a friend, Alexander Zambenedetti, 20, to create a patch of black ice to fake an accident . The two splashed water onto Sawmill Road and possibly returned to refill the five-gallon buckets for multiple layers, according to authorities. Police say by the time they were done, the two co-conspirators had left a patch of thick black ice on the road - an actual hazard to other drivers. The pair were caught sitting in Zambenedetti's silver 2005 BMW by a patrol officer. The pair stuck out, as Byers's friend was shirtless in the 1 degree air. When police questioned him inside the car, where the pair had also stashed the two buckets, Zambenedetti said he'd falling in snow and taken his wet shirt off. Police said he denied icing the roadway and claimed he didn't drive his friend to the scene, in spite of being in the car. 'I’ve never seen anything like this and I’ve been here 21 years,' Sparta Police Sgt John Lamon told CBS. Hazardous driving: Police say the two left a patch of thick black ice on the road that required half a ton of salt to melt . Police said the scheme was also to ensure that Byers could have the insurance company fix the vehicle. 'The original driver of the first vehicle that crashed and left the scene made an admission that that was their intent, was to blame it on the ice so they could collect insurance for the vehicle,' Sgt Dennis Proctor told 1010 WINS. Both were charged with driving while intoxicated, and Byers also was hit with charges including failure to report an accident and creating a dangerous condition. Other charges are pending. A crew had to be called to the scene to dump half a ton of salt in order to melt the ice and keep the road safe.","Brian Byers, 20, crashed a relative's 2001 BMW into a guard rail .

"Henry VIII almost took a seventh wife but gave up on his final Tudor love because she was too feisty, outspoken and had a habit of nagging him, it emerged today. The monarch considered divorcing his sixth bride Catherine Parr to walk down the aisle with duchess Katherine Willoughby, a new book claims. She had already given birth to two sons and Henry was so obsessed with producing male heirs that he believed she could help continue the Tudor dynasty. The pair met in the 1530s and  flirted at court, danced together and even exchanged gifts around Christmas. But Henry was 'jaded' after six failed marriages, two of which he ended with executions, and finally put off another divorce because she was too domineering, according to her biographer. Would it have been seventh time lucky? Henry VIII considered marrying Katherine Willoughby, Duchess of Suffolk, but decided to stick with Catherine Parr because she was too feisty . Katherine was known to enjoy offending other aristocrats and dressed her dog as a priest and named him after Catholic bishop Stephen Gardiner because she hated him. She was also known to lecture people on Christianity, including the king, who made himself the head of the church after breaking from Rome in 1534. Author of Henry VIII's Last Love, David Baldwin, claims despite Henry's love of strong women he had learned his lesson and finally decided to stick with the wife he had. He said: 'It was apparent that Henry was very fond of Katherine. 'Henry was obviously keen on her, and what wanted Henry wanted, he usually got. He liked her feistiness as one of his subjects, but as a wife - that might have been a different matter. 'She could've become his seventh wife but he may have just been getting a bit tired of the whole business. It wouldn't be surprising if he was jaded by the experience of his six wives.' He says Katherine, Duchess of Suffolk, first caught the King's eye when she was married to the Duke of Suffolk. The monarch went on to marry Anne of Cleeves, Kathryn Howard and then the devout Protestant Catherine Parr in rapid succession between 1540 to 1543. Katherine waited on both Anne of Cleeves and Catherine Howard before joining Catherine Parr's household - and was regularly at court. At one point they exchanged New Year gifts. Lady Willoughby also sought to gain favour with Thomas Cromwell - the king's chief schemer and main character in Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall - but the marriage never happened. 'Jaded': Henry, played by Damian Lewis in Wolf Hall, had been worn down by a series of disastrous marriages, including to Anne Boleyn, played by Claire Foy, who he eventually had executed . Queenmaker: Lady Willoughby sought to gain favour with Henry's closest aide Thomas Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance, and wrote to him regularly but the marriage to the king never happened . Expert: Author David Baldwin says the king 'liked her feistiness' but 'as a wife - that might have been a different matter' Mr Baldwin said: 'Rumours are sometimes without foundation, but there are strong indications that King Henry found Katherine attractive. 'They had been exchanging New Year gifts since 1534, and he had been ""masking and visiting"" with her in March 1538, only months after Jane Seymour's death. 'It is possible he saw this younger, perhaps more attractive, woman who was now a widow and the mother of two healthy boys as the solution to his problem. 'He would not have been the first man to think that a new, more exciting, relationship would somehow restore his lost youth.' Katherine was known for being outspoken - and liked offending people in front of other members of aristocratic society. She once dressed her dog in a white religious vestments and named it after a Conservative bishop, Stephen Gardiner, whom she particularly disliked. Mr Baldwin said she was known as a 'virago' - a domineering woman - and her 'feistiness' and 'sharp tongue' made Henry fearful of another disastrous marriage. Divorced and beheaded: Henry married Catherine of Aragon but split up with her because she failed to produce a son. The king then married Anne Boleyn but had her beheaded on grounds of adultery, incest, and witchcraft . Died and divorced: Jane Seymour, left, died two weeks after giving birth to Edward VI, and Henry then married Anne of Cleves but divorced her after six months and sent her back to Europe with a huge payoff . Beheaded and survived: Catherine Howard was executed after two years of marriage for cheating on the king and then married Catherine Parr, his final wife until he died in 1547 . In his book, David adds: 'The feistiness he admired in her as a subject could have made her less appealing as a wife. 'The reality is that he would have found Katherine's forceful Protestantism as disconcerting as Queen Catherine's if he had allowed her to take Catherine's position, and it made no sense to exchange one virago for another. 'He didn't like being lectured by his wife on matters of religion as if she knew more than he did. 'Catherine Parr and Katherine Willoughby were both equally staunch Protestants and equally feisty ladies. 'If he wasn't getting much joy from Catherine Parr, he probably wouldn't have been any better off with the other.' Their marriage was not to be and Katherine later fled England in exile when Catholic Queen Mary came to the throne. 'Henry VIII's Last Love' will be published on March 28 and is available for pre-order on Amazon. Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Henry VIII was well known for his six marriages, all of which ended in some sort of tragedy - divorce or death - but the Tudor king was also known for other, stranger things. He was known to self-medicate, even going as far as making his own medicines. A record on a prescription for ulcer treatment in the British Museum reads: 'An Oyntment devised by the kinges Majesty made at Westminster, and devised at Grenwich to take away inflammations and to cease payne and heale ulcers called gray plaster.' He was also a musician and composer, owning 78 flutes, 78 recorders, five bagpipes, and has since had his songs covered by Jethro Tull. Many are unaware that he died while heavily in debt, after having such a lavish lifestyle and spending far, far more than taxes would earn him. He also possessed the largest tapestry collection ever documented, and 6,500 pistols. While most portraits show him as a slight man, he was actually very large, with one observer calling him 'an absolute monster'.","Katherine Willoughby could have been Henry's last wife  but king resisted .

"Missing: Lindsey McNamara, 24, from Ashland, Massachusetts, who was last seen on Valentine's Day having dinner with two others at the Natick Mall . The star of a notorious pork-throwing incident at a police station that went viral after CCTV footage was released has been reported missing. Lindsey McNamara was arrested at a police station in Framingham, Massachusetts, in December after hurling pounds of bacon and sausages at the receptionists' window while shouting, 'It's time to feed the pigs'. The 24-year-old nursing student has not been seen since Valentine's Day. Police told CBS News they are actively investigating her disappearance, but have learned nothing to indicate foul play. Miss McNamara was last seen at dinner with acquaintances at PF Chang's, a Chinese restaurant at the Natick Mall, on February 14, said Ashland police spokesman Lieutenant Richard Briggs. Her cell phone also pinged in the area. An Ashland PD statement said: 'We are actively investigating this and any assistance from the public would be appreciated.' Miss McNamara's disappearance comes days after a judge dismissed a charge against her relating to a bizarre bacon-throwing incident that made her an unwitting Internet star. In replies to an appeal on the Ashland PD Facebook page for information on her whereabouts a woman who identifies herself as Miss McNamara's aunt says she thought 'someone was out to get her.' 'She stated this at her court appearance,' wrote Denise McNamara Fitzgerald, also noting that her niece 'appeared to be doing better on her medication'. 'She is my niece and has always (until [the pork-throwing] incident) been a beautiful, intelligent woman..with goals,' Denise McNamara Fitzgerald added. 'We are all just praying for her sa[f]e return, regardless of any prev problems.' Miss McNamara has blue eyes and brown hair. Her family do not recognise the man and woman she was having dinner with on Saturday night, CBS Boston reported.

Captured for posterity: A bystander whips out his phone to take a picture as McNamara is led away . Surveillance camera footage that went viral last month showed Miss McNamara walking into Framingham Police Department at around 11am on December 26, dressed in pyjamas and carrying a Dunkin' Donuts box. She opens the cardboard container to reveal pounds of raw sausages and bacon rashers, which she starts hurling at the receptionist's bulletproof window. The video has no sound but according to police, Miss McNamara, who is from Ashland, shouted 'it’s time to feed the pigs' as she threw the raw meat. As the camera continues to roll, two police officers enter the scene and Miss McNamara drops the box before being handcuffed and swiftly taken away - but not before an astonished bystander whips out his phone for a cheeeky photo. Police said she told them: 'God told me to go feed the pigs.' Aftermath: The raw meat left on the police station counter after McNamara's episode. She was charged with malicious destruction of property under $250 and disorderly conduct . Hearing: A judge dismissed the malicious destruction of property charge but ordered her to pay $150 costs on the disorderly conduct charge. She reportedly told the judge she thought someone was out to get her . A judge on Thursday dismissed a charge of malicious destruction of property against Miss McNamara, CBS Boston reported. She was ordered to pay $150 court costs on a charge of disorderly conduct after earlier being ordered to have a psychiatric evaluation.

"A new caviar is thought to be the most expensive food in the world with a kilo of the 'white gold' fetching an incredible £200,000 - that's a staggering £27,000 a teaspoon. The costly caviar is made from rare albino fish eggs and laced with 22-carat gold. The brand-new product will be served to royalty and the super rich at some of the best restaurants in the world from Monaco to Dubai. A kilo of the white gold  Strottarga Bianco caviar will fetch a whopping £200,000 . The powdery caviar, called Strottarga Bianco, was invented by fish farmer Walter Gruell, 51, and his son Patrick, 25. They say that the price is not just because of its exclusivity or its great taste, but also for its health advantages. The Austrian father and son duo said they decided to also include gold leaf as it was good for the immune system. Patrick, from the central Austrian city of Salzburg, who along with his father is the first caviar producer in Austria, said: 'Our Strottarga Bianco comes from the white roe of the extremely rare albino sturgeon.' The powdery caviar was invented by fish farmer Walter Gruell (pictured)  and his son Patrick . The Persians were the first group of people to regularly consume the eggs of the sturgeon fish and they believed the Caspian delicacy enhanced the physical strength and endurance of those who ate it. Later, the Romans also attributed healing and medicinal properties to caviar. At present, and with the sturgeon in danger of extinction, white caviar has become a rare delicacy, exclusive and scarce, and now what is essentially the essence of white caviar is set to take it's place as the world's most exclusive food. The albino beluga sturgeon that produces it originally lived in the Caspian Sea but is now almost extinct in its native environment, where the last surviving wild albino beluga sturgeon live in the unpolluted areas near Iran. Although sturgeon fish usually live more than 100 years, very few of the albino variety reach that age, as the lack of melanin that makes them white is also a genetic disorder that limits their life. It also explains why their eggs have become the most sophisticated and expensive food in the world. He believes the extremely high standard of water in Austria flowing down from mountain snowfields helps to make sure the caviar produced in Austria is the best in the world as it has none of the pollution issues other countries have developed. He added: 'It is part of the reason why it probably taste so good, that and the fact that it is specially seasoned before being dehydrated, when it loses 80 per cent of its weight. 'It is then grated extremely finely and mixed with 22-carat gold, which in very small amounts has a very positive effect on the human immune system. 'The golden yellow white spreadable powder that we create can quickly be made into a paste, risotto or put on toasted bread with butter. It only needs very small quantities for the flavour to be spread to a meal. 'The taste is very strong and taste distinctly of fresh fish.' Regular white caviar sold by the father and son duo has been known to fetch a price of up to £40,000. Because the new Strottarga Bianco caviar uses five kilos of white caviar, which is then dehydrated to make one kilo of the gold mixture, it would cost at least £200,000 for the same amount. In order to give people a taste of what they have on offer, however, the producers are currently offering it at the discount price of £73,000 to selected customers. Patrick said: 'It is certainly not a product for everyone, but there is definitely a market for extremely exclusive products especially when they are something new.' The Austrian father and son only use older sturgeon, because the eggs are more elegant, smooth, aromatic and better tasting with a spongier texture.","Strottarga Bianco invented by fish farmers Walter and Patrick Gruell .

"Monopoly, the world's favorite capitalist board game, was first invented by a left-wing campaigner as a protest against the unbridled thirst for profit, a new book claims. Elizabeth Magie, the daughter of a progressive newspaper publisher from Illinois, filed a legal claim for her Landlord's Game in 1903, 30 years before Parker Brother began manufacturing Monopoly. Her story disputes the origin myth sometimes distributed with the game, which claims Charles Darrow came up with Monopoly in the 1930s, saving himself and Parker Brothers from ruin. Scroll down for video . The original: Elizabeth Magie alongside her original patent drawing for The Landlord's Game, the first precursor to Monopoly, which she designed to draw attention to the unfairness of U.S. economics . Mary Pilon, author of a new book about Monopoly's hidden history, writes in The New York Times that Magie came up with the game as a protest against America's property moguls. These powerful businessmen, including such figures as John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, controlled much of the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century, when there were massive disparities of wealth between rich and poor. Magie was inspired to create the game by the theories of Henry George, an economist and politician. He advocated for the institution of a single 'land-value tax' to shift the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy landlords. Each person legitimately owns 100 per cent of the value they create, said George, but natural resources, common opportunities and, most importantly, the value of land, belongs equally to each person in a community. Magie had learned of George's theories from her father, who once ran for office in Illinois on an anti-monopoly ticket, but it wasn't until she was 37 and living with friends in Maryland that she finally perfected her game. She was granted U.S. Patent 748,626 for The Landlord's Game on January 5, 1904. In 1906, she moved to Chicago where she and fellow Georgists formed the Economic Game Co. to self-publish her invention. Pilon wrote: 'She created two sets of rules for her game: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents. 'Her dualistic approach was a teaching tool meant to demonstrate that the first set of rules was morally superior.' Pretender: Charles Darrow, left, earned millions after he took the essence of Magie's game and sold a modified version to Parker Brothers. Right is a recent issue of the UK version of the board game . Despite a lack of major financial backing, Magie's game quickly spread among left-wing intellectuals, particularly in the Northeast, Pilon wrote. College students also took it up, many of them apparently making their own boards according to the rules Magie laid out. But it was after it spread to a Quaker community in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that Magie began to lose control of her invention. It was this version, which included various modifications including the Atlantic City neighborhoods on Parker Brothers' first issues of the game, that was picked up by Charles Darrow. Darrow pitched his version of the game to Parker Brothers, who snapped it up. The company then struck a deal with Magie to buy out her Landlord's Game patent, as well as two more of her game ideas. As the game grew in popularity, Magie was gradually pushed aside, despite her public protestations. Eventually, even after newspaper reports in which she presented original game boards to prove she was the game's true creator, her progressive set of rules was dispensed with. Darrow became a millionaire. By the 1970s, the false notion that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become more than popular folklore: it was printed in the game's instructions. Even now, a potted history of Monopoly on the website of Hasbro, the toy giant that currently owns the rights, makes no mention of its history prior to 1935. Despite the eclipse of her socially progressive take on the Monopoly board game, it seems that Magie anticipated one of the game's most-notorious effects - family rows over the unfair behavior of players to opponents who find themselves in hard times. In a commentary on The Landlord's Game given to the Single Tax Review in 1902, she wrote: 'There are those who argue that it may be a dangerous thing to teach children how they may thus get the advantage of their fellows, but let me tell you there are no fairer-minded beings in the world than our own little American children. 'Watch them in their play and see how quick they are, should any one of their number attempt to cheat or take undue advantage of another, to cry, ""No fair!"" And who has not heard almost every little girl say, ""I won't play if you don't play fair."" 'Let the children once see clearly the gross injustice of our present land system and when they grow up, if they are allowed to develop naturally, the evil will soon be remedied.' Magie's role in the genesis of Monopoly was uncovered by a economics professor during a long legal battle against Parker Brothers. Ralph Anspach found Magie's patents after the company tried to stop him producing his own Anti-Monopoly game in 1973. They entered court record and helped him finally win a Supreme Court case against Parker Brothers. But it was too late for Magie, who died in relative obscurity in 1948, a widow without children, having made just $500 from her idea.","Elizabeth Magie came up with Monopoly as a protest against capitalism .

"Broadchurch fans were left shocked last night after the programme aired a lesbian kiss between middle-aged women - who many viewers mistakenly thought were sisters. The passionate embrace between lawyer Jocelyn Knight and newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe, atmospherically staged on the programme's iconic cliff top, was clearly meant to cause a stir among the 5.7million viewers. But fans appeared to be taken aback, with many under the impression that the two characters  were related. Scroll down for video . Sisters? Broadchurch viewers were left baffled last night when lawyer Jocelyn Knight and newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe shared a romantic kiss during a cliff-top picnic - despite many thinking they were related . The pair had been portrayed as friends throughout the series after Radcliffe, who is played by Carolyn Pickles, convinced Knight to take on the show's central case, the murder trial of Joe Miller. There had also been brief references made by Knight, played by Charlotte Rampling, about feelings for someone in her past - with no indication that the person was Radcliffe. But the kiss came after Knight arranged the romantic picnic and confessed her undying love for her close friend. She said: 'There was a moment, must have been 15 years ago, I should have said it then and I didn't. I'm in love with you Maggie.' When Radcliffe replied that the revelation was too late, Knight takes matters into own hands and leaned in for the kiss. As is par for the course with this series of Broadchurch, it was just a matter of minutes before viewers were sharing their disbelief on Twitter. The pair had become firm friends throughout the series after Radcliffe convinced Knight to take on the show's central case, regarding Joe Miller . Maggie Radcliffe (left) was left stunned after Charlotte Rampling (right) confessed she had been in love with her friend for 15 years . When Radcliffe says it is too late, Knight takes matters into own hands and leans in for the kiss . One person tweeted: 'Biggest shock of my life this week on Broadchurch I thought Maggie and Jocelyn were sisters', while another added: 'I thought them women were related?!' A third fan wrote: 'Literally thought Jocelyn and that journo were sisters. Massive plot twist for me!', while another viewer said: 'That lesbian kiss. We all thought they were sisters.' Even those who were better informed about the characters' relationship were still left baffled, unsure why the kiss had only happened in the penultimate episode of the second series. One viewer wrote: 'That lesbian kiss i have just seen on broadchurch is one of the strangest things i have ever seen.' The interaction sparked a flurry of comments on Twitter, with one saying: 'Biggest shock of my life this week on Broadchurch I thought Maggie and Jocelyn were sisters' Another wrote: 'Run out of plot ideas? Throw in an attempted drowning and a lesbian kiss. Writing tips via #Broadchurch.' Even Philip Schofield felt he needed to vent his frustration, simply tweeting 'Aaaaaaaaarrghhhh!!!! #Broadchurch'. The second series of the ITV cult show has already divided opinions between viewers, with many criticising legal inaccuracies during the trial. Last week, viewers were shocked to see a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' scene in which Lee Ashworth is seen 'strangling' his wife Claire. The pair's encounter took place outside in the ruins of a barn on the cliff tops where Ashworth is living. Fans also complained that they were finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'. Even those who were better-informed about the characters' relationship were still left baffled - including Philip Schofield - unsure why the relationship was only explored in the penultimate episode of the series . The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received wide-spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed show. But a number of viewers have complained that they are finding it increasingly difficult to understand his accent ever since the second series got underway. Viewers also accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene in last week's episode - table service from Nando's. Elsewhere, mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. Viewers accused Broadchurch of going 'Fifty Shades of Grey' following this charged scene between Lee Ashworth and Claire on last week's show . Meanwhile, a scene showing David Tennant being given table service at Nando's also sparked outrage . Viewers also criticised the fact that Beth Latimer (pictured) had returned to court to witness Joe Miller's trial just after giving birth . Last night's viewing figure was at 5.8million, a huge slump from the initial 7.3million who tuned in for the first episode of the second series. The criticism has led to Tennant to jump to the show's defence, saying the second series of the show is a victim of its own success. He said: 'I think we're a victim of our success to be honest. The first series was such an extraordinary thing. This country, we never allow lightning to strike twice in this country...we just don't let that happen. 'So, inevitably there was going to be a certain amount of ""it's not as good as the first time"". 'I think it is. I think it's a wonderful series that I'm very proud to be part of.'The revelation was made as the pair enjoyed a wine fuelled picnic atop a cliff top – as you do.' The series finale is due to be aired next Monday.","Lawyer Jocelyn Knight declared her feelings for editor Maggie Radcliffe .

"A business analyst who quit a high-flying job in London to become landlord of a country inn has seen his freehouse named pub of the year. Peter Tiley quit the rat race in 2013 and spent nearly all his savings on leasing The Salutation Inn in Ham near Berkeley, Gloucestershire, after realising his 'passion' was 'spending time in a wonderful old boozer talking rubbish with friends.' The 31-year-old had had heard a talk from Steve Jobs on being passionate about work which got him thinking 'about how I would look back on my life as an old man'. After quitting his high flying job in London Peter Tiley opened a pub in Gloucestershire with his wife Claire which has just been named Pub of The Year . So Mr Tiley quit his job at the telecoms consultancy in Soho and moved with his now-wife Claire to the heart of rural Gloucestershire - despite never having pulled a pint in his life. But Mr Tiley's passion has clearly paid off, with the freehouse now awarded the prize of Pub of The Year - just two years after the couple took it over. He told the Independent: 'I started thinking about how I would look back on my life as an old man. 'You have to be passionate, but if you are really, really passionate about something, the chances are you will be good at it. I am doing 90-hour weeks, but it doesn't feel like work.' At the time of switching careers, the only experience Mr Tiley had had with the beer world was brewing his own in the bath at his home in Herne Hill, south London. Despite this, Mr Tiley ploughed all his savings into buying the pub and, within a year, the pub had won its local Camra branch competition. It then took the regional title before beating thousands of pubs across the country. The pub was given the accolade by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), which described it as a 'gem'. Mr Tiley opened the pub in 2013 and just two years later it is known as one of the country's best . The pub specialises in cider and beer both of which Mr Tiley is especially passionate about . The interior of The Salulation Inn or The Sally as it is known to locals has a cosy feel . Mr Tileyr grew up in Gloucestershire but left to work as a telecoms business consultant in London. He regularly visited pubs in the capital and quickly realised what made some more welcoming and successful than others. A speech by Apple boss Steve Jobs about being passionate about work made him realise that he wanted to work in the drinks industry, and he devised  an original plan to run a micro brewery. But when his father told him the Salutation Inn was for sale so he took the plunge - and now he's working on plans to brew his own beer. Mr Tiley says that he learnt good bar practice visiting his own locals in the city. He said: 'When I went to pubs in London I figured out that little things like a warm welcome, saying hello, goodbye or, better still, knowing your name, meant a lot so I have put that into practice here. 'I had a good job in London, but I felt I needed to do something I really cared about.' Mr Tiley says that he learnt good bar practice visiting his own locals in the city . Built in 1840, The Salutation, know locally as the Sally, has two cosy bars, a log fire and skittle alley, while Camra's judges were overwhelmed by the welcome drinkers receive, one saying: 'It's like being invited into a private house.' Mr Tiley was determined to continue local traditions such as Morris dancing and apple wassailing on offer, while regulars can try their luck playing barman in special Locals Behind The Bar nights. Regulars often crowd round the wooden piano in the bar for singalong sessions, enjoy Morris dancing and go wassailing to ensure a good cider year. There are live folk music events, guest chef nights - one each month, the only time dinner is served - and meet the brewer evenings so locals can see the face behind their pint. 'We have a lot going on and it is always busy here,' Mr Tiley said. 'I’m not sure what makes it so special, it has something about it that you can’t put a name to. 'On a Friday night all the regulars are crammed in and you can barely move but it is just the most brilliant place.' The Salutation has two cosy bars, a log fire and skittle alley . Meanwhile, Mr Tiley raised 11 pigs in a walled garden last year and now serves their meat on the menu. The pigs are fed apples from local growers, as well as pulp leftover from cider making, which gives the meat an 'incredible' flavour, Mr Tiley said. He explained: 'This isn't a pub for vegetarians but we're in rural Gloucestershire, this is traditional farming country.' Mr Tiley added that he had to give thanks to not only his staff but his customers for making the pub what it is today. 'We count ourselves unbelievably lucky to have a brilliant team of staff who are so passionate and dedicated, as well as a community of locals who have given so much to support and contribute towards the pub. 'They have been brilliant from the moment we arrived. They’ve painted the skittles hall, done the gardening, built picnic benches. We feel so lucky. 'I was terrified on my first night, I thought everyone was thinking, ‘who is this young guy behind the bar, what does he know about running a pub?’. 'I truly believe that every village should have a pub, they are so vital for the local community and I would be absolutely devastated to mess this one up. We had to get it right. It’s been hard, really hard, but it is worth it.' Mr Tiley offers few soft drinks and no coffee or tea as he says this is a pub where people come to drink real ale . Mr Tiley says that having been awarded such a prestigious title was a dream come true for him. 'For the Sally to have won National Pub of the Year is beyond our wildest dreams - we're totally shell-shocked. 'Pubs are so important to me that to have our own one recognised in this way is just amazing. 'It is these people that have made the pub what it is today and for that we are incredibly grateful.' Camra director Abigail Newton said that they had been incredibly impressed with what the husband and wife had managed to achieve since opening. 'What Peter and Claire have done in the short time they have been running the pub is nothing short of staggering and goes to show that passion, enthusiasm, and a real love of beer are hugely important when running a pub. 'They have hit the ground running and taken what was already a great pub and made it truly exceptional - beating off over 50,000 other landlords from across the UK.' Pubs are judged on atmosphere, level of service, value for money and community focus, with extra weighting for the quality of their real ale, cider and perry. The winning pub is described in Camra's Good Beer Guide 2015 as a 'rural gem in the Severn Valley, within walking distance of the Jenner Museum, Berkeley Castle `and Deer Park. 'The enthusiastic landlord keeps an inspired selection of ales and eight real ciders and perries.' The three other finalists were The Freshfield in Formby (Merseyside), The Harewood Arms in Broadbottom (Greater Manchester) and The Windmill in Sevenoaks Weald (Kent).","Peter Tiley quit his job in 2013 to take over a pub in Ham, Gloucestershire .

"With a bumper backside that measures 8ft around, Mikel Ruffinelli is the owner of a bottom that is large enough to make even Kim Kardashian's pale in comparison. Yet despite being just 5ft 4"" and tipping the scales at 30st, Mrs Ruffinelli, 39, from Los Angeles, says she is healthy and has a shape that other women envy. 'I have an extreme physique,' explains the mother-of-four, who has a proportionally small 40-inch waist. 'I love my curves, I love my hips, I love my attributes. Scroll down for video . Supersized: Mother-of-four Mikel Ruffinelli is the owner of the world's largest hips which measure 8ft around . 'I love my shape and I see no reason to diet because I don’t have health problems. Men don’t fancy skinny girls, they like an hourglass figure.' Now she is to appear on a new documentary, World's Biggest Hips, alongside three other women who boast supersized rear ends. Among them is Austrian Claudia Floraunce, 40, who also lives in Los Angeles and tips the scales at 23st, and Las Vegas native, Denise Souder, a 56-year-old grandmother-of-two with 74-inch hips - and who, like Mrs Ruffinelli, has turned her 'curves' into cold, hard cash. 'Growing up, I was the chubby girl,' explains Mrs Souder. 'I was always the chubbiest girl in the class but I never let it stop me from doing whatever I wanted to do. 'There are challenges - I can't get on a rollercoaster. You learn to get around your hips, you learn to embrace your hips, you learn to shop for your hips. 'If someone wants to make a comment about my hips or my size, I don't care what your opinion is.' Curvy and proud: Mrs Ruffinelli says men don't want slim girls and like an hourglass shape like hers instead . Impressive: Mrs Ruffinelli says she adores her prize-winning posterior - even it it does cause her some issues . Mrs Souder makes her living courtesy of a double life as 'Sweet Cheeks', a plus-size stripper and 'fetish provider' who specialises in services such as squashing and trampling. 'Only in Vegas could you have a stripper like me,' she chuckles. 'They come here on their bachelor party, take the blindfold off and I'm standing there with Twinkies in my hand. It's funny!' And she's not the only one to monetise her curves. Mrs Ruffinelli has become something of a minor celebrity, while Miss Floraunce hopes to make it as a plus size model. All, however, are adamant that big really is beautiful. 'I think a lot of people like looking at me because I am a very unique size, very large, but I carry myself with a lot of confidence,' explains Miss Floraunce. 'I get a lot of people saying, look at those hips, look at those curves, your waist looks so tiny compared to those hips. Curves are in and I am in... Finally.' Miss Floraunce, who moved to Los Angeles from her native Austria aged 19 and  gained 12st 7lbs within six months of arriving, says learning to love her supersized proportions has taken time. 'In Austria, it's really rare to have curves,' she says. 'When I go back there, I get stared at. It used to bother me but now I'm like, Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.' Making a living: Denise Souder, 56, has turned her curves into cold, hard cash courtesy of online videos . Family business: Her daughter, known online as Lil' Cheeks, has joined her mother in the video business . Mrs Ruffinelli is also a relative newcomer to a supersized shape, having only gained the extra weight after having children. 'There was a time before I had kids when I had a flat stomach,' she reveals. 'I got this large because genetically, whatever happens with weight gain, goes here [hips].' Not all, however, developed their large looks as an adult. Marlena Plummer, a 35-year-old New Yorker with the second largest set of hips on the planet, says she has always been big. 'I always had hips, even as an infant I had hips,' she explains. 'It's just a mystery why I have hips and why I am the shape I am. 'I love my hips, I love my shape and I love me. I've been a plus size girl all my life and I've never let it stop me doing anything I want.' Miss Plummer, who has hips that measure 83 inches around and who tips the scales at 28st, says her supersized physique is all the more surprising because she has a a tiny appetite. Redefining beauty: Plus-size model Claudia Floraunce, 40, says the criteria for beauty needs an overhaul . Second place: Marlena Plummer, 35, has the second largest set of hips on the planet, after Mrs Ruffinelli . 'Because of my shape and my size, people assume I eat a lot. I don't.' Nevertheless, she admits that her world-beating hips do cause some problems. 'My hips always affect me when I'm on the train because I have to take up two seats,' she says. 'I do feel bad sometimes when I see a person standing up but I can't help it that I need two seats.' Mrs Ruffinelli, for all her exhortations of love for her hips, also admits that hers cause her problems and force her to take a reinforced chair with her wherever she goes. 'Fitting in, fitting on, sitting down... Those are some of my challenges,' she says. But rather than lose weight to fit in with society, she says it's time society started fitting in with her. 'I just think that society hasn't learned that it needs to make things a bit bigger,' she says. 'It's OK to make things bigger. What's the problem?' Miss Floraunce agrees and says its time to redefine what beauty really means. 'There's a lot of men who love curves,' she says, . 'We get forced to look at a certain criteria of women which only about 10 per cent of the world fit into.' Mrs Ruffinelli agrees. 'I have something that everybody's not going to have,' she says. 'It's like having an outfit that no one else has and most women would like that.'","Mikel Ruffinelli, 39, is the owner of the world's largest backside .

'It serves as a sharp warning to me and I have blemished an otherwise clean licence and shall be paying the penalty charge willingly from my own pocket.' Mr Ferguson, who normally drivers an electric powered Smart Car or uses a bicycle, described the speeding as an 'inexcusable mistake' for speeding in the Ford Fiesta . The Independent mayor, known for driving a smart car, said it was a 'stupid miskt . The Independent mayor added: 'That is a stupid mistake. I shall pay the fine and I shall pay in a number of other ways I'm sure. 'I have an unblemished license now it'll have some endorsement on it and of course I personally pay the fine. 'But it was 35mph in a 30mph limit on the Portway I obviously wasn't concentrating. I just apologise. 'It is right that speed limits are there for a good purpose. We should respect them. I do respect them. I made a stupid mistake. I'm sorry. 'I make no excuse at all and I shall pay the fine and in my position I probably pay a lot more in reality.' A decision has not been made as to whether Mr Ferguson will take three penalty points or go on a speed awareness course, said a council spokesman. Mr Ferguson was elected in November 2012 and is serving a term of three-and-a-half years, with the next mayoral election in the city in 2016. Ironically, he was believed to have been returning from a visit to the Bloodhound project - a land vehicle attempting to exceed 1,000 miles per hour - when he was clocked at 5mph over the speed limit in the Ford Fiesta. Bristol City Council voted to introduce 20mph speed limits following a pilot scheme in July 2012. Mr Ferguson was a keen advocate of the scheme and imposed a city-wide roll out after taking office. Every street in the city - excluding dual carriageways and 40mph and 50mph roads - are being considered for the tough speed limit, although some other roads may be included on a local basis. Mr Ferguson, 67, was behind  a scheme to install 13,000 20mph speed limit signs across Bristol . Last month it emerged that 6,204 signs have been installed so far with another 7,160 set to be erected in the near future. Motoring groups and councillors have criticised the plans as an 'utterly stupid waste of money' as no authority will be routinely enforcing the new limit. Hugh Bladon of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'As far as I'm aware this scheme is a huge waste of money. '20mph zones are completely moronic because it is universally agreed that they are unenforceable and it's bringing other speed limits into question.'","George Ferguson installed 20mph speed signs across Bristol city centre .

"The Obama administration is drawing fire for suggesting that defeating ISIS requires more of a jobs program for terrorists than a sophisticated approach to killing them. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday night on MSNBC that 'we cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.' Instead, she said, the administration should 'go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups' – including 'lack of opportunity for jobs.' 'We can work with countries around the world to help improve their governance,' Harf insisted. 'We can help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.' The embarrassing gaffe aired as the White House attracted new criticism for papering over religious aspects of a mass-beheading of Coptic Christians by the ISIS terror army. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . JOBLESS JIHAD: State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf insisted Monday night on MSNBC that a jobs program in the Middle East could stem the tide of ISIS . President Obama steps off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Bace in Maryland after spending Presidents' Day weekend playing golf in Palm Springs, California . 'THEY WERE CHRISTIANS': Pope Francis mourned the loss of 21 Copts in Libya who were beheaded on video by ISIS terrorists . Video surfaced on Sunday showing Libyan ISIS sympathizers decapitating 21 Christians on a beach. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest issued a 192-word reaction condemning the brutal killings as 'despicable' and 'cowardly' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims. The words 'Christian,' 'Islam' and 'Muslim.' were not included in Earnest's statement. The video itself was titled 'A Message Signed With Blood to the Nation of the Cross.' The slaughtered men, clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of Guantanamo Bay detainee garb, were described as 'crusaders.' One of the men was seen praying just moments before his throat was slit. The White House convened a conference with representatives from more than 60 countries on Tuesday on a subject it calls 'countering violent extremism.' Like Earnest's statement, administration officials connected with the event have studiously avoided any mention of radical Islam or its animosity toward Christians and Jews. 'We are not treating these people as part of a religion,' a senior administration official said Monday during a conference call with reporters. 'We're treating them as terrorists. We call them our enemies and we’ll be treating them as such.' World leaders outside of Washington have leapt to connect ISIS, the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, with a religious battle that pits Islamists against the world's other great religions. The 21 Copts, 'were killed simply for the fact that they were Christians,' Pope Francis said Monday at the Vatican, speaking in his native Spanish. MUSLIM VS. CHRISTIAN: The five-minute ISIS video released on Sunday was captioned: 'The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church'; One of the terrorists (center) boasted that 'safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for' IMPATIENCE IN CONGRESS: Republicans including New York Rep. Peter King are growing more frustrated with a White House that steadfastly refuses to frame the ISIS battle in religious terms . 'The blood of our Christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out to be heard. It makes no difference whether they be Catholics, Orthodox, Copts or Protestants. They are Christians!' British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'appalled by the murder of Christians in Libya, a simply barbaric and inhumane act.' 'Our efforts to defeat the monstrosity of Islamist extremism must not waver.' A CNN/ORC poll found 57 per cent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama is handling the threat posed by ISIS. Even among Democrats, 46 per cent say America's battle with ISIS is going badly. Public approval of the administration's anti-ISIS efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since September. Part of that slide may be due to the State Department's focus on what conservatives deride as 'hashtag diplomacy' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away ISIS's glamorous appeal to would-be jihadis. The New York Times reported Monday that State is engaged in a broad effort through its Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications to coordinate all the government's social media resources in response to nearly 100 Twitter accounts blasting pro-ISIS recruiting messages into the Internet's digital ether. 'We're getting beaten on volume, so the only way to compete is by aggregating, curating and amplifying existing content,' Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel told the Times. 'These guys aren't BuzzFeed,' Stengel said. 'They're not invincible in social media.' But National Counterterrorism Center director told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week that 'the government is probably not the best platform to try to communicate with the set of actors who are potentially vulnerable to this kind of propaganda and this kind of recruitment.' 'We try to find ways to stimulate this kind of counternarrative, this kind of countermessaging, without having a U.S. government hand in it.'","'Countering violent extremism' conference kicks off in Washington but the White House insists 'we are not treating these people as part of a religion'

"One of China's most polluted areas is reportedly where contaminated frozen berries are grown and packed before they are imported and sold in Australian stores. It has been revealed the frozen berries which were recently recalled after links to hepatitis A, are from the Shandong province in east China, the Daily Telegraph reports. Cities and villages in Shandong are reportedly plagued by chemical and industrial waste pollution, with farming land laying adjacent to factories and petrochemical plants. One river running through the village of Jinling is so polluted by nearby chemical factories that the water is red coloured and has a foul smell, according to local Chinese reports. A river which flows in the Chinese village Jinling in the Shandong province is one of China's most polluted areas, reportedly where frozen berries are grown and packed before they are imported and sold in Australian stores . The latest recall is for the 1kg packs of Nanna’s Raspberries with best before dates until 15/09/16 . This comes as raspberries were added to the growing list of Nanna's frozen berries that people should throw out of their freezers as the risk of hepatitis A continues. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service has banned people who have eaten the recalled berries from donating blood for two months as a precaution against the spread of hepatitis A. The latest recall is for the 1kg packs of Nanna’s Raspberries with best before dates until 15/09/16 but does not apply to the Creative Gourmet Raspberries 300g and 500g packs as the Chinese supplier, believed to have contaminated the recalled items, no longer supplies these particular products. As the number of people who have contracted hepatitis A from consuming frozen berries rises to ten across Australia, one woman has revealed her anger and fear over potentially being diagnosed with the virus. The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City . The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City, according to the Epoch Times. In previous reports, there have been claims that the company releases chemical distribution into the river, which was once sparkly clear but has now visibly been contaminated and also emanates a stench. Residents also say there's a 'cancer virus' floating around the village as cancer is quite common in the town. This comes as reports emerged that health tests weren't conducted on any frozen berry products imported to Australia while similar goods have been tied to hepatitis breakout in North America and Europe,The Australian reports. This prompted a call to have the testing system to be reviewed. People who ate berries linked to the hepatitis A scare have been banned from donating blood for two months tests as the service tests for 70 diseases, but not hepatitis A due to its low risk. While those who have donated, either on or after 1 November 2014, after eating the berries is asked to contact the Red Cross Blood Service on 13 14 95, so they can identify any risks posed to those receiving blood. 'This will help us identify whether or not we need to take further action to minimise the unlikely event of hepatitis A being spread via blood transfusion,' Red Cross Blood Service spokesman Shaun Inguanzo said. Patties Foods CEO, Steven Chaur, said the further recall on raspberries was a precautionary measure as investigations identified the potential link of the product to the Chinese supplier in question. 'While there are no confirmed test results indicating a potential link to Hepatitis A, we are working proactively with health authorities based on the information they have presented to date,' said on the company's Facebook page. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday evening, when she was alerted to the health warning which had been issued. 'I'm really angry ... (and) it's absolutely terrified me', Ms Sims told Daily Mail Australia. So far four cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in Queensland, three in Victoria, and two in New South Wales. Ms Sims' case could take the national toll to ten. Doctors say she is exhibiting common symptoms of the disease and expect to formally diagnose her with the virus when her results come back on Tuesday morning. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies and doctors suspect she has hepatitis A . The products which have been pulled from shelves are Nanna's Mixed Berries 1 kilogram packets, and the 300 and 500 gram varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. 'Over the last two to three weeks I've been getting quite sick and I just thought it was a flu,' Ms Sims revealed. 'Last night I just couldn't really swallow anymore and I was going to make a frozen drink like I have been for the last four to six weeks,' she added added. After her partner Trevor alerted her to the health warning which had been issued when he saw Ms Sims with a packet of Nanna's berries - he rushed her to hospital. Since her admission her eyelids have turned yellow and she is exhibiting signs of jaundice. Ms Sims is also suffering from chronic tonsillitis and a chest infection - likely a result of her body fighting multiple infections. 'I'm massively jaundice and my liver's pretty crappy and these are the first signs of hep A from the berries,' Ms Sims revealed. Though still awaiting the definitive results of her blood tests, Ms Sims said her doctor was almost certain she had hepatitis A, news which left her in tears. The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the food company, and claims she was misled over the origin of the product which she thought were Australian made. She is suffering from jaundice, evident on her eyelids, and doctors expect to formally diagnose her with hepatitis A when her blood test results return . 'I'm really angry', Ms Sims said before adding 'It's disgusting. We're in Australia - we have our own resources.' She now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner. Ms Sims said she was beside herself when she found out, especially since she and partner Trevor visited his sick mother in hospital just last week. She hopes that she did not pass on any virus. The Ballarat woman decided to share her story in the hopes of alerting others of the dangers. 'I thought I'm going to tell someone … if I didn't know about it then how many other people don't know,' she revealed. In recent days the frozen berry products have been pulled from supermarket shelves after increasing numbers of people contracted the potentially deadly hepatitis A virus after consuming the fruit. The first items to be pulled were 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries after five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, fell ill after eating the fruit. Ms Sims now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner Trevor (left) who rushed her to hospital on Sunday night . The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the company, and would not have bought the fruit had she known it wasn't made in Australia . On Sunday Patties Foods also recalled a number of their products, the 300 gram and 500 gram varieties of their Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back. 'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said. 'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.' The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria. Meantime Australian farmers say the outbreak from frozen the berries imported from China illustrates the risks involved with imported food and called on consumers to always buy homegrown products. Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said not all imported food adhered to Australia's strict guidelines which were some of the best health and safety standards in the world. Mr Tuohey urged consumers to always buy Australian made products but conceded identifying those products could be quite challenging. Australian farmers urge consumers to always buy homegrown products . 'I can only assume that this company is using Chinese berries because they are offering a lower market price,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Berries are certainly in season in Australia.' He said that it was likely the berries were contaminated when they were first picked. 'They may have been placed on the ground where rats and other vermin could have caused the problem,' he said. 'Unfortunately, Australian Customs don't test every batch, they only check a certain percentage of shipments.' The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past. 'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks. Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes. Concerned consumers can call Patties Foods on 1800 650 069.

"Andrea Flutter, 32, wants to have her PIP breast implants removed because they cause her 'constant discomfort' A city worker plans to sue over apparently faulty breast implants that cause her 'constant discomfort'. Andrea Flutter, 32, wants to have the PIP implants removed but is unable to do so because she is pregnant. She is one of many women involved in a case that lawyers hope to bring against the company that certified the PIP implants as safe. Ms Flutter aims to secure up to £10,000. She paid £6,500 to have the implants - made by French company Poly Implant Prostheses - fitted at a Harley Street clinic in February 2009. Mrs Flutter chose to boost her chest to an E-cup. She said: 'I had the implants put in initially because I had different size breasts and it was making me unhappy. 'I'd also been very sporty as a teenager - I used to compete in track events and swimming. 'As a result, my breast tissue had started to sag, so not only did I have breasts that were different sizes, they were sagging too. 'When the bandages were taken off [after the enlargement op] I was initially thrilled with the result. 'They looked fantastic and for the first time, they were both the same size.' But her happiness did not last long. She said: 'I've been in constant discomfort since having the implants put in. 'I went to see the doctor but was told it would settle down - but it never has done.' Mrs Flutter has had annual mammograms and been assured the implants have not burst, but said: 'I worry about them constantly, about them affecting my health and am planning on getting them out as soon as possible. 'I'm four months pregnant so I can't have them taken out until after the baby is born and that worries me too.' PIP implants were banned in 2010 when it emerged industrial grade silicone had been used in them and they were twice as likely to rupture. About 47,000 UK women had PIP implants out of about 300,000 worldwide. They were not found to be toxic or carcinogenic but the leaking gel can lead to the formation of scar tissue and cause pain and inflammation. The Stanton Fisher Group, a firm of financial claims experts, estimates the total payout for women in and around London alone could be millions of pounds. A legal appeal in France is due to decide this summer if a German firm that certified the implants is safe, TUV Rheinland, can be held liable. The city worker is hoping to sue over the apparently faulty implants. She wants to have them removed but because she is four months pregnant she will have to wait until her baby is born . In December 2013 PIP chief executive Jean-Claude Mas was jailed for four years for fraud but many women were denied compensation because the firm was insolvent. Stanton Fisher is working with a French lawyer which led the initial court action against TUV, which found it had failed in its duty of vigilance. TUV claims it was a victim of fraud and a cover up by the French firm. Its lawyers argue that the firm was expected only to check PIP's paperwork. Women have until Friday 20, March to contact Stanton Fisher about a potential claim.

"A man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery in connection with a 93-year-old widower being mugged for five pounds outside his home. Pensioner Stanley Evans, who lives on his own, was left lying on the floor for 10 minutes after being targeted as he returned from a shopping trip in London. Police yesterday released CCTV footage of the robbery and assault, which a senior officer branded 'totally unprovoked, callous and sickening'. Officers confirmed today that a 29-year-old man had been arrested in Camberwell, south London, in connection with the incident. He remains in police custody. Victim Stanley Evans says he was left 'flailing like a seal' on the ground for 10 minutes after the attack . Mr Evans was left lying on the ground for 10 minutes before he managed to get to his flat and raise the alarm . Mr Evans - a retired cameraman who worked on films including the 1947 classic Brighton Rock with Richard Attenborough - said he was left 'flailing like a seal' after the incident. Describing it, Mr Evans said: 'I've gone past anger, I'm frustrated. If I ever came across that one again I was a boxer and aggressive, if someone punches me I punch them back. 'When you fall over at my age every bit of your body hits the ground, I was flailing like a seal. It's almost impossible to pick yourself up. 'I waited 10 minutes for someone to come but nobody did. Then I managed to struggle to my feet and go up to my flat and call the police.' The incident took place at Ingestre Court, central London at around 8pm on Saturday, January 31. Mr Evans, originally from Cardigan in Wales, once worked as an assistant cameraman at Welwyn Studio, where his first feature was John Boulting's 1947 adaptation of Brighton Rock, starring Richard Attenborough, before moving to MGM Studios in Borehamwood. After the film studio closed down in the 1970s he set up as a freelance photographer in a studio in Marshall Street in Soho, where he captured celebrities including Michael Crawford. He is determined not to let the incident scare him out of leaving his flat and enjoying Soho where he has lived and worked in for so many years. He said: 'It doesn't scare me though. I'm not going to hide away in my flat.' The CCTV footage released by police shows Mr Evans being followed by a man as he returns from the shops into the block of flats where he lives. Pushing a small shopping trolley, the frail victim is seen waiting in a communal entrance for the lift to his flat as the robber approached him. The assault happened as the pensioner was waiting for a lift to his flat in Ingestre Court in central London . The attacker is then accused of grabbing his pocket and pushing him to the floor. The footage shows the shocked pensioner collapsed in the communal area as he waits for help to come. As a result of the incident, Mr Evans suffered a shoulder injury, which was treated by an ambulance crew. Detective Sergeant Gemma Alger of the Westminster Serious Crime Unit said: 'This is a totally unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner. 'The victim is fiercely independent and has lived in London all his life. His confidence has been eroded as a result of the actions of this individual and now he is fearful about going out. 'I would urge anyone who has any information on who was responsible to contact us as soon as possible.'

"A new pill designed to combat both hearing loss and tinnitus is now being tested on patients for the first time. The first drug treatment for both conditions has been developed by scientists in the UK and acts on brain cells involved in the processing of sound. Laboratory studies have shown that the drug has the potential to reduce symptoms of age-related hearing loss and tinnitus. Age-related hearing loss occurs when hairs in the inner ear that normally pass on sound signals to the hearing nerve become damaged or die . Around 50 per cent of men and women aged over 60 suffer from age-related hearing loss and 10 per cent of the population suffers from tinnitus. Age-related hearing loss occurs when hairs in the inner ear that normally pass on sound signals to the hearing nerve become damaged or die, so the nerve impulses relaying sound to the brain are reduced. Increasingly scientists believe that this form of hearing loss may also be linked to problems with nerve cells in the brain, too. There is no cure. Hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some sufferers, but having implants requires surgery and hearing aids can be uncomfortable, increase the risk of infections and, even then, interpreting speech remains a challenge for some. Tinnitus is the perception of sound in one or both ears when there is no obvious source. The type of sound heard varies from buzzing to ringing or hissing and can vary in pitch. Although many people cope well with the symptoms, for around 1 per cent of the population it has a significant impact on their quality of life. Hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some sufferers, but having implants requires surgery . Scientists have developed several treatments, from drugs affecting the central nervous system to electrical treatments and behavioural therapies, but the success has been limited. The new drug works on a protein called Kv3 that helps form pores on the surface of nerve cells in the area of the brain connected with hearing. These pores allow potassium to enter the cells - the potassium is needed to help signals, such as hearing signals, pass between the nerve cells. Researchers say there is evidence that levels of Kv3 become damaged or decline with age. This may cause patients difficulty in understanding speech and may be linked to tinnitus, too. Studies at the Institute of Experimental Medicine in Prague show the drug, known as AUT00063, can improve hearing in older animals, while research at University College London and the University of Southern Illinois has found the drug can have a beneficial effect on tinnitus. Now University College London Hospital and ten other hospitals in the UK are embarking on a clinical trial, recruiting around 150 patients, who will receive four daily pills, or a placebo, every day for four weeks. This trial is focusing on patients who have had tinnitus for between six and 18 months. If successful, future trials are likely to include people with longer term tinnitus. Meanwhile, 100 patients with age-related hearing loss are taking part in a trial at the University of South Florida and other centres in the U.S. where they will take three capsules of AUT00063 or a placebo for four weeks. Andrew McCombe, consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, said: 'I have a suspicion that they may get better results in tinnitus sufferers than in age-related hearing loss.' Meanwhile, a drug has been shown to slow the growth of cells that can lead to hearing loss and tinnitus. U.S. researchers have shown that salicylates, a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, prevent the development of usually benign tumours, known as vestibular schwannomas. These grow on the hearing and balance nerves in the ears and can cause gradual hearing loss, tinnitus, facial nerve paralysis and dizziness. Currently, patients who are experiencing hearing issues as a result of vestibular schwannomas can undergo surgery or radiotherapy, but both can cause complications. Salicylates work by inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme, which is responsible for inflammation and pain and is also thought to encourage the growth of vestibular schwannomas. The scientists hope their findings will lead to a clinical trial.","First drug treatment for both conditions has been developed in the UK .

"As her two-year-old daughter Darcey covers her hands in paint then shrieks with delight, Trish Gregory looks on with amusement. Her once tidy and ordered home in Newark, Nottinghamshire, has descended into a permanent state of noisy chaos, since Darcey and her baby sister, Bea, came along. But Trish, 49, wouldn’t have it any other way. Trish and Rob Gregory with Darcey, left, and Bea, right, conceived their children through egg donations . In fact, she loves being a mum so much so that she and her partner Rob, 46, are even hoping to start trying for another child next year. By then, Trish, a social worker, will be 50, but she says her age doesn’t put her off. ‘Both my pregnancies were easy and I have plenty of energy, so why not?’ she said. Trish conceived Darcey and then Bea through egg donation at CARE Fertility Nottingham. She believed that using the eggs of a younger woman would give her a better chance of getting pregnant. The clinic used Rob’s sperm, so he is biologically the girls’ father. But Trish has never felt like any less of a mother because of the way the girls came into the world. Trish, pictured after giving birth to Darcey in 2012, said she left having children late in life as she hadn't met anyone she wanted to become a parent with . Trish and Rob, pictured at a friend's wedding, started trying for a baby after they met 10 years ago but weren't able to conceive naturally . She said: ‘I carried them for nine months and gave birth to them and so they couldn’t feel more like mine. ‘And funnily enough, Darcey is blonde like me, whereas Rob is dark. She also has many of my mannerisms. ‘If I have a bad day with them both I just joke that they’re nothing to do with me,’ she laughs. Like so many other women her age, Trish resents the endless talk about women putting their careers before family and then leaving motherhood too late. ‘This certainly wasn’t the case for me as I always wanted children,’ she said. 'They couldn't feel more like mine,' Trish says of Bea, left, and Darcey, right . Happy family: Trish and Rob with Darcey after the birth of Bea . ‘I love my job but it isn’t the reason why I’m having kids now.’ She points out that she only got together with Rob, a horticulturist, when she was 40, and up until then she had not met anyone that she actually wanted to have children with. The couple met on a bouncy castle at a friend’s barbecue and they hit it off straightaway. ‘We’re both very laidback and Rob is very funny and kind,’ Trish said. ‘I knew he was the one for me.’ After a couple of years together, they started trying for a baby but when nothing had happened after a year or two, they began to talk about IVF. ‘We certainly didn’t rush into anything, and we aren’t really the types to panic,’ she said. ‘We both loved our jobs, we had a good social life and a great relationship so I think we realised that if we didn’t have a family it wouldn’t be the end of the world.’ But when the clinic suggested egg donation, they both agreed to give it a go - and they eventually settled on a college-educated, blonde-haired donor. Trish says she's a calmer mother to Bea, left, and Darcey, right, now that she is older . Trish is planning to have a third child next year . Unfortunately, only one embryo was viable from the eight donor eggs. Remarkably, though, Trish still got pregnant, and she and Rob were delighted. In spite of her age, she sailed through the pregnancy, giving birth to Darcey only a couple of hours after finishing work. Trish jokes that she spent her entire maternity leave simply staring at her daughter. ‘I was just mesmerised by her and I didn’t really care about anything else,’ she said. And to her surprise, Trish seemed to be a lot more relaxed than many of the other new mums around her. According to the mother-of-two, some of the women she met in their 20s were worried about getting things wrong, and were fixated on having all the best equipment for their babies – while Trish and Rob had bought everything second-hand. ‘They worried if their baby had a sniffle or hadn’t put on much weight,’ Trish said. ‘I guess being older, I was just more used to trusting my instincts more, and having a bit more perspective on things.’ But it was, says Trish, the mums in their 30s who seemed the most anxious. ‘Many just wanted everything to be perfect,’ she said. ‘Perfect houses, perfect babies and perfect careers, whereas I just wanted to enjoy my baby, without worrying about what anyone else thought.’ Other mothers would often comment on how calm Trish was, and because she looks young for her age, she says she has never had a problem meeting other mums at playgroups or in the park. She and Rob loved being parents so much so that when Darcey was one, they returned to the clinic to start the egg donation process again. Unfortunately their original donor was no longer available, so they chose another one – and this time they were left with two viable embryos. One became Bea and the other they have frozen for the future. ‘We’re hoping to go back to the clinic again soon, and it would be great if we could have a third,’ said Trish, who is back at work full-time, having found the girls a child-minder. ‘We are fatalistic though. If it happens, it happens, but if it doesn’t, we have two wonderful girls, and we certainly feel very blessed. ‘One thing is for sure though. I’m certainly not going to waste my time wishing I’d had children when I was younger. ‘This works for us. We’re all happy and healthy and I don’t think I’d have been quite this relaxed if I’d embarked on motherhood any earlier.’ For more information on egg donation, visit www.carefertility.com .","Trish Gregory paid £25k to have her two daughters through egg donation .

"Actress Amy Schumer has brushed off the negative comments made by a film critic, who deemed her too unattractive and unconventional to star in a romantic comedy, saying that she ‘could not care less’ about his rude remarks. Following last Wednesday's release of the trailer for her upcoming film Trainwreck, Hollywood Elsewhere writer Jeffrey Wells commented on the 33-year-old actress's looks and weight, calling her 'chubby' and noting that her 'wide facial features' remind him of a 'blonde Lou Costello'. 'She’s obviously sharp and clever and funny as far as the woe-is-me, self-deprecating thing goes, but there’s no way she’d be an object of heated romantic interest in the real world,' he wrote.

The following day, Amy responded by tweeting a photo of herself wearing only underwear with her arms strategically covering her bare chest. 'I am a size [six] and have no plans of changing. This is it. Stay on or get off. Kisses!' she captioned the snapshot. The tweet has since been favorited over 7,000 times, with one male Twitter user commenting: 'Please don't feel the need to be even a tiny bit defensive because of a few idiots. Trailer looks great!'

Amy told USA Today she was not fazed by the writer's comments because she didn't even read them. 'I didn’t read the thing… It was such an example of sort of the reason for trolling,' she said.

"When Andrew Cadigan's mate Chris Simpson died of myelodysplasia in 2011, the carpenter from New South Wales spent 18 months walking around the coast of Australia to raise money for cancer research. But in a cruel twist of fate, the 31-year-old suffered severe head injuries in a motorbike accident just one month after completing his 15,000km walk and raising $65,000 for the Cancer Council and Leukaemia Foundation, dying three months later. That's how his devastated father, Neil Cadigan, found himself hosting annual walks for cancer charities two years later and turning the detailed diary his son wrote during his 350 day adventure into a novel titled With Every Step. Scroll down for video . Andrew Cadigan died just 12 weeks after he walked 15,000km around Australia over 350 days to raise $65,000 for the Cancer Council and Leukaemia Foundation . 'While I was sitting by his [hospital] bedside, I started to read his diary and decided that because there was so much depth to his diaries, that I would turn it into a book,' Mr Cadigan told Daily Mail Australia. 'He had died while preparing to write the book and I made a vow that I was going to complete the task for him.' Mr Cadigan said he was left in awe after flicking through the personal notes from his son's trip. Starting in Sydney, Andrew had walked down to Melbourne and across to Hobart before continuing on around the country - right through the Kimberley's during the lead up to the wet season in which he endured over 48 degree heat while drinking up to 14 litres of water a day. Andrew (pictured with his mother and father) has had his diary entries from the emotionally and phyically challenging trip, turned into a novel, written by his father . Chris Simpson (left) died from leukaemia in 2011. Now his best mate's diaries, written during his epic trek around Australia to raise money for cancer research, are being published . Determined to accomplish what he'd started, he even sold his own home to finance the trip. He is the third person to ever walk around the entire country solo with no accompanying tour. But his father had no idea of the pain his son had endured. 'He fought temperatures nearly freezing when he slept in a tent in Tasmania, he dealt with plagues of locusts and mice and wild bulls in the Kimberly's,' Mr Cadigan said. 'He had times when he woke up in the morning and had blistered feet and was in pain before he started and he would still walk 60km somehow. 'In some parts of West Australia, he was so detached and isolated between towns - he would be walking for days and days and there would be virtually no civilisation - it was then in his diaries that he wrote that he felt depressed and saw a doctor who said it was the physical relentlessness of the trip.' Accompanied by only a three-wheeler pram which carried his tent, sleeping bag and a solar panel, Andrew is only the third person to ever walk around the entire country solo with no accompanying tour .

But it was the last video blog that Andrew posted on his website ozonfoot.com.au that Mr Cadigan finds the most tragic. 'Done and dusted! It's all over… day 536, but tomorrow will be day 1: getting on with the rest of my life,' Andrew filmed himself saying as he walked across the finishing line at the Sydney Harbour Bridge. In a cruel twist of fate, the 31-year-old suffered severe head injuries in a motorbike accident just one month after the trip, dying three months later .

It was a month after the recording that his mother and father rushed to his hospital bedside in Thailand, where he had travelled to relax after his huge year, and 12 weeks after it that he passed away. 'It has been a very tough mourning process, listening to his voice and going through his diary for the book, reading a lot of the things he wrote that we didn't get a chance to discuss amongst ourselves and knowing that I never would be able to,' Mr Cadigan said. 'He struggled far more than I had realised, even though I spoke to him regularly, so I became in awe of that and in times when I was struggling to get through it and keep writing it I thought ""no, I'm going to keep going because he did"". 'He just refused to give in until he got to the finish line and that became my drive.' Andrew's family said they have been overwhelmed with the messages of support they have received from people all over the country who met him and became inspired by his selfless goal .

"Anna Wintour may have been derided for using a $15 flip phone at the US Open earlier this year - but it appears she may have simply been ahead of the curve of Japanese fashion. New figures reveal Japanese shipments of traditional flip-phones rose in 2014 for the first time in seven years while smartphone shipments fell. Experts say the figures highlight Japanese consumers' tenacious attachment to the familiar and typically less expensive older models. The handsets have been dubbed 'Galapagos' phones because they have evolved to meet unique Japanese standards and tastes . Dubbed 'Galapagos' phones because they have evolved to meet unique Japanese standards and tastes, flip-phone shipments rose 5.7 percent to 10.58 million in 2014, data from market researcher MM Research Institute Ltd shows. Smartphone shipments fell 5.3 percent to 27.70 million, down for a second year. Users in Japan pay some of the highest smartphone fees among developed nations, the telecommunications ministry says, while flip-phone rates are among the lowest. Many Japanese accustomed to years of deflation are content with old-style flip-phones offering voice calling, email and in most cases basic Internet services. Japanese electronics companies Panasonic Corp and NEC Corp have pulled out of the consumer smartphone business, unable to compete with dominant brands Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. They still make flip-phones, though, competing in a crowded market with Fujitsu Ltd and Sharp Corp, among others. But with a mobile penetration rate of 98.5 percent, or 125 million subscriptions, there is little scope for significant overall growth in Japan's mobile market, MM Research said. 'Smartphones are also peaking in terms of functionality and they tend to last a long time as well, so there are fewer renewals,' said MM Research Executive Analyst Hideaki Yokota. He said 2014 was a particularly strong year for renewals in the subscription cycle for flip-phones, suggesting that last year's growth may not be repeated this year. However, its not just in Japan the flip phone is back. In between cheering on players at the U.S. Open in New York earlier this year, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour was pictured glancing at her cell phone - a rather dated looking flip phone. The 64-year-old fashion maven was seen peering out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone, which appears to be a $15 pay-as-you go phone from AT&T. Old-fashioned: In between cheering on players at the U.S. Open on Thursday, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour was pictured glancing at her cell phone - a rather dated looking flip phone . The model, an AT&T Z222 GoPhone, has a small two-inch display screen and offers texting and calling but no apps. Her decision to use such a simple and inexpensive is something of a surprise considering Ms Wintour presumably has the most cutting-edge products at her fingertips. Perhaps the editor, who is known to be a creature of habit, simply likes to stick with what she knows best. Indeed, back in 2004 she was seen using a similar flip phone while watching a Michael Kors runway show, although that particular model looked even more retro with an antenna. By 2007, she graduated to a somewhat sleeker model - the Motorola Razr, which she brandished proudly at yet another fashion show. From 2009 to 2012, Ms Wintour was pictured multiple times using a Blackberry, and it seemed she had finally found a modern phone she liked. And just last year, she was seen carrying around both a Blackberry and an iPhone, a symbol of her busy business life. Though it may be easy to mock Ms Wintour's low-tech choice of phone, she may actually be on the money. A recent trend observed by MailOnline has seen classic 1990s models by Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola commanding four-figure sums on eBay and other resale sites. While they may lack features, these retro phones are simple to use, have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalents. 'Some people don't blink at the prices, we have models at more than €1,000 (£810 or $1,360),' said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009. 'The high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time.' French online shop Lekki, which sells a range of vintage, revamped mobile phones, claims simplicity is the way forward. 'Too many online social networks and an excess of email and applications, have made us slaves to technology in our everyday life,' it said on its website. 'We have two types of profiles: the 25 to 35 year-olds attracted by the retro and offbeat side of a telephone that is a little different, and those who are nostalgic for the phone that they used when they were younger,' said Maxime Chanson, who founded Lekki in 2010. 'Some use it to complement their smartphone, but others are going for the vintage, tired of the technology race between the phone makers.' Here are some of the retro phones making a comeback: . Motorola StarTac 130: A model launched in 1998 - and repainted bright orange was recently offered for €180 (£145 or $245). Ironically, the trend is just starting as the telecommunications industry throws such handsets into the recycling bins, hailing smartphones as the way ahead. Motorola StarTac 130, $245 . Nokia 8210: Has a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons, at €59.99 (£48 or $80).

Nokia 8210, $80 . Nokia 8800 Arte Gold: Currently listed  for €1,000 (£810 or $1,360), while a Nokia 8800 could be purchased for €250 (£200 or $337).

"Trial: Abid Naseer goes on trial today in New York after pleading not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway . A terror suspect on trial in New York was among several young recruits under orders by Al Qaeda to infiltrate Western society and pull off the biggest operation since the September 11 attacks, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening statements. Assistant U.S. Attorney Celia Cohen told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that the failed conspiracy in 2009 called for attacks in New York City, England and Denmark. She said that Abid Naseer, 28, who is acting as his own attorney, headed a cell in Manchester, England, where he attended college as part of his cover and communicated in coded emails with his Al Qaeda handler about the cell's plan to attack a shopping mall. The jury will be the first to see evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that left Osama bin Laden dead, Cohen said. In his opening statement, Naseer read in a monotone voice from prepared remarks in which he referred to himself in the third person. He said that the time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry, he said. 'The evidence at trial will not show the defendant is an Al Qaeda member. ... He has no extremist or jihadist views,' Naseer said. Naseer objected several times during the testimony by the first government witness, former Queens resident Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty in the New York City prong of the plot that targeted the subways. For instance, he challenged the introduction of a photo of bin Laden but was overruled. 'I agree with you that this case is not about 9/11,' U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie told Naseer during a break. But the judge said Zazi should be able to reference Bin Laden in describing how he became radicalized. Aside from Zazi, other witnesses will include testimony from British secret agents who will wear wigs and makeup on the witness stand to conceal their identities. The agents conducted surveillance on Naseer and other terror suspects in Britain before their arrests in April 2009. After no explosives were found, the men were released without being charged but ordered to leave the country — a fate Naseer avoided after a judge ruled it was likely he would be mistreated if he were sent to Pakistan.

Testimony: Najibullah Zazi testifies in the trial of Abid Naseer in this courtroom sketch on February 17, 2015 . Naseer was rearrested at the request of U.S. prosecutors and extradited to the United States in 2013. 'That was the whole point of the Western operatives. ... They knew how to blend in and conduct reconnaissance and pick the best target,' Cohen said. The goal, she added, was to 'repeat the devastation of 9/11.' Meanwhile, a document said to be the Al Qaeda pledge of allegiance is among the classified papers to be disclosed at the trial of the alleged would-be terrorist. 'Pledge of allegiance': Prosecutors say the trial will feature evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden, pictured, including an oath Naseer presumably took on joining Al Qaeda . Evidence: Eight more documents from Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad are to be revealed.

The trial of Naseer began in New York today after he pleaded not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway and The Trafford shopping centre in Manchester, England. The text of the Al Qaeda 'pledge of allegiance', which has been translated by prosecutors. We, of course, take the pledge of allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama bin Laden. We say in the wording something like: I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomsoever Sheikh Usama assigns to be my Amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and the rule of Islam that governs the law of God, and to memorise the secrets of the group, and to be where I am ordered to. (Source: New York Daily News) Prosecutor Celia Cohen said in her opening statement on Tuesday in New York that Abid Naseer headed a terror cell in Manchester, England. The trial is set to feature evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed bin Laden, including an oath Naseer presumably took on joining the terror kingpin's organisation. The pledge is among eight documents found among bin Laden's possessions and declassified for the trial, which will also hear testimony from British spies who have been given permission to take the witness stand in disguises. If convicted, Pakistan-born Naseer who denies he was a member of Al Qaeda, faces a possible life sentence. He says he holds 'no extremist jihadist views'. Two government witnesses to testify against him - Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay - have already pleaded guilty to the subway plot. Prosecutors claim email account evidence shows all three men were under the direction of the same Al Qaeda handler. They also say one of the now-declassified documents seized by SEAL Team 6 during the bin Laden raid mentions Naseer and refers to the Manchester and New York plots. The pledge of allegiance to Al Qaeda, which has been translated by prosecutors for the court's benefit, is also due to be given as evidence, according to the New York Daily News. Statements: Naseer listens to opening statements in his trial as seen in a courtroom sketch he went on trial on Wednesday on U.S. charges that he took part in an Al Qaeda plot to carry out bombing attacks in the United States and Europe in 2008 and 2009 . In court: Naseer, second from left, is pictured in a January 7 court sketch as he is arraigned in Brooklyn Federal Court. He pleaded not guilty through his attorney Steven Brounstein, centre . The vow binds those who utter it to 'follow whomsoever Sheikh Usama assigns to be my Amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and the rule of Islam that governs the law of God.' At a pretrial hearing, U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie approved a request from Britain's internal intelligence service, MI5, for its agents to give evidence in disguise. Prosecutors had told the judge that the officers continue to work undercover on sensitive cases and 'disclosure of their identities would pose a significant risk to their safety'. The agents will testify using identification numbers rather than names and wearing wigs and make up, the papers added. A former resident of Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Naseer was one of 12 people arrested in the UK in April 2009 as alleged members of an al Qaida-backed terror cell. After no explosives were found, the men were released without being charged but ordered to leave the country - a fate Naseer avoided after a judge ruled it was likely he would be mistreated if he were sent to Pakistan. In a lengthy written statement submitted during the deportation proceedings, Naseer claimed to come from a moderate Muslim family. He said he went to Great Britain to get a degree in computer science, not to attack the West, he said. 'Committing terrorist acts is not justified, and I do not consider this to be jihad,' he said. 'I believe in spiritual jihad.' The New York Subway: Two government witnesses expected to testify against Naseer - Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay - have already pleaded guilty to a plot to bomb the transport network . The time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry, he said. 'I used to spend all night on the internet in chat rooms talking to girls,' he wrote. Naseer also denied allegations that he used code words to conceal messages about the terror plots. In one, he talked about having a 'party' in Manchester in April 2009 — what British counterterrorism officials said was the proposed time for the attack. 'My reference to holding a huge party and trying to include as many as possible was referring to the intended wedding,' he said. Authorities rearrested Naseer in July 2010 at the request of U.S. prosecutors. He was extradited from the UK in 2013.","Abid Naseer, 28, pleaded not guilty to an alleged plot to bomb trains .

"Robin Fleming, professor of history from Boston College, says Britons lived longer after the fall of the Roman Empire . What have the Romans ever done for us? The best thing they did was to leave, an historian has suggested. Despite being credited for bringing roads, sanitation and medicine to Britain, amongst other things, studies show that Britons had a longer life expectancy after the fall of the Roman Empire. Research into graves dating from 400AD to 650AD show, on average, people lived for around two years longer after the Romans had left. Robin Fleming, professor of history from Boston College in the US, said that once Roman taxes were lifted people were able to eat more nutritious food and thus lived longer. Asked if the fall of the Roman Empire was good for Britain, Prof Fleming told the Daily Telegraph: ‘If you are a villa owner, no. But it you are part of the 97 per cent of the rest, then, yes, it might add a couple of years to your life which makes a difference. ‘The people were living longer after Roman Britain because they weren’t being taxed.‘ . Life expectancy after the fall of the Roman Empire reached 35 for women who tended to die younger due to the dangers of childbirth, while men were usually dead by their early forties. The research, which looked at graves from West Heslerton, a village in North Yorkshire, was presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in San Jose, California. A famous Monty Python sketch from the 1979 film Life of Brian showed the character Reg, played by John Cleese, blasting the presence of the Romans and asking: ‘What have they ever given us in return?’ His comrades point out that the Romans introduced the ‘aqueduct, sanitation, roads, irrigation, medicine, education, wine, public order, hot baths and peace’, much to Reg’s irritation. Despite being credited for bringing roads, sanitation and medicine to Britain, the best thing the Romans did for Britain was leave.

"About 20 passengers, some of them screaming and trampling others, fled through emergency doors and onto the tarmac at a Los Angeles International Airport terminal Monday after someone incorrectly said an armed man was on the loose, authorities and witnesses said. The 'misinformed announcement' near a boarding area apparently stemmed from a police pursuit of an unarmed driver that ended outside Terminal 2, LAX Police Sgt. Belinda Joseph said. Police responded to an emergency call around 9am reporting that a man may be trying to commit suicide. They apprehended the man, and the fire department took him to a hospital for treatment of an unspecified condition. But 'someone said that there was a man with a gun, which was not true,' Joseph said. No danger: Police are seen above taking a man into custody outside Los Angeles International Airport Monday morning. The arrest led someone inside the terminal to incorrectly state that there was a 'man with a gun' on the loose . Running for their lives: That incorrect announcement caused passengers to panic and start fleeing, some running out the doors and onto the tarmac. Police say the man arrested this morning was not armed . Benjamin Horton, a photojournalist who was in the terminal at the time, told The Associated Press in an email that it was clear from people's reactions they thought it was a dire situation. Horton said, 'People started screaming and I could hear the trampling of a large number of people coming down the terminal. By the looks on people's faces and the way that they were scattering it seemed to me that people were trying to get away from a shooter by the body language and the way that some were hiding and others were running.' Horton said he hid behind a pillar and saw an elderly woman fall and get partially trampled but didn't appear to be injured. Police initially said the rumor was spread over a public address system but later said the announcement was made by someone at the gate area. It was unknown whether an airport or airline employee, a passenger or someone else spread the incorrect information. Travelers who fled outside were 'under observation the whole time' they were near planes, and officers got things under control within 15 minutes, Joseph said. 'They just went outside and told them the accurate information, and the passengers went on their flights,' Joseph said. Horton said he didn't learn it was a false report until he landed in Hawaii six hours later and read the news. LAX has been the scene of gun violence before. In November 2013, a man shot and killed a Transportation Security Administration screening agent and wounded three other people. Paul Ciancia faces federal charges in that case that could bring the death penalty. The New Jersey native has pleaded not guilty. In 2002, a limousine driver opened fire at a ticket counter, killing an airline employee and a person who was dropping off a friend.","An unidentified passenger or LAX employee said there was a 'man with a gun' around 9am Monday .

"The daughter of murdered schoolteacher Ann Maguire will join leading musicians and ballet dancers to host a special gala night in her mother's honour. Emma Maguire, 30, will be joined by world-renowned ballet dancer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell and dancer Jonathan Cope to host the first Ann Maguire Gala next month. The evening will be in memory of Mrs Maguire, 61, who was stabbed to death as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April last year. Scroll down for video . Ann Maguire, 61 (left), was stabbed to death as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April last year. William Cornick (right) was handed a 20-year minimum prison term for the killing . William Cornick, who was 15 at the time, pleaded guilty to the killing on the day he was due to stand trial and was handed a 20-year minimum prison sentence. Mrs Maguire, who was loved and respected by pupils, parents and colleagues, had taught at the school for 40 years and planned to retire just weeks after she was killed. Following her death, her widow Don and daughters Emma and Kerry described her murder as a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and said they were 'looking to the future with fragile hope'. Now, just 10 months on they are planning to host a special night in her honour. The gala, which is to be held at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on Sunday March 22, will feature music and dance and will raise money for the Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund. Emma (left), a professional dancer who has starred in a host of famous ballet productions including The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty, will host the event with dancer and Strictly judge Darcey Bussell (right) Emma, a Royal Ballet soloist who has starred in a host of famous ballet productions including The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty, said: 'My mother was an inspirational teacher for generations of young people in Leeds. 'As a family we felt that setting up a charity that continues her dedication to helping young people is what she would have wanted. 'We are eternally grateful to all the artists who agreed to come together to make the inaugural Ann Maguire Gala possible, an event which not only launches a new charity but will also honour our mother.' The evening will feature performances from the classical ballet repertoire including works by Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan, Royal Ballet Artist in Residence Liam Scarlett and Director of the National Romanian Ballet Company Johan Kobborg.

"Two women who spiked their victims with a dangerous drug known as 'Devil's Breath' before robbing them have been arrested in Colombia. Nini Johana Rey Sanchez, 33, and Jenny Fabiola Rodriguez Velasquez, 29, would prey on lonely men in the nightclubs and bars in Bogota, before slipping the potent drug scopolamine into their drink . Scopolamine, known on the streets of the South American country as 'The Devil's Breath', causes people to lose their free will and their memory. Arrested: The women - who worked together under the nickname the Nanitas - have been arrested after stealing an estimated £27,000 in cash and goods . Devil's Breath: Scopolamine is made from the Borrachero tree, which blooms with deceptively beautiful white and yellow flowers. The odourless and tasteless drug can kill . Scopolamine - known as the most dangerous drug in the world - is odourless and tasteless, making it impossible for victims to detect when it is poured in their drink. The drug can even be blown in the face of a passer-by on the street, and within minutes, the victim can be rendered 'zombie like' under the drug's effect. It completely blocks the formation of memories, which means victims have absolutely no idea what has happened to them and stand no chance of identifying the people who have assaulted or robbed them. The CIA are believed to have used the drug as part of Cold War interrogations, with the hope of using it like a truth serum. However, because of the drug's powerful chemical makeup, it also induces strong hallucinations which can leave victims unable to speak. Scopolamine is odourless and tasteless, making it impossible for victims to detect. According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the drug - also known as hyoscine - causes the same level of memory loss as diazepam. Stories surrounding potent scopolamine remain the stuff of urban legend, with some telling horror stories of how people were raped, forced to empty their bank accounts, and even coerced into giving up an organ. In ancient times, the drug was given to the mistresses of dead Colombian leaders – they were told to enter their master's grave, where they were then buried alive. Joseph Mengele - the Nazi's Angel of Death - experimented on using scopolamine as an interrogation drug on prisoners. The drug is derived from the borrachero tree, which is common in Colombia, and noted for its white and yellow flowers. The women - who operated under the nickname the 'Nanitas' - would approach lonely men in the bars of the south of city, before chatting them up to gain their trust. The pair would then spike their target's drinks, before marching them to a cash point and having them empty their accounts once they were under the effect of the drug. Police estimate they may have stolen as much as £27,000 in cash and goods from around 30 victims over the years. After drugging the men, the women - together with an accomplice taxi driver who was caught last October - would take the men to cashpoints and have them empty their accounts. They would also take men back to their homes and make off with their appliances and valuables. One man told police he was robbed and beaten after being drugged, and felt the after effects of scopolamine for two days. The two women are set to be charged with aggravated robbery and kidnapping. According to a police investigator, their last heist pocketed them approximately £600 in cash, along with their victim's watch, wallet and mobile phone. General Humberto Guatibonza, commander of Bogota's metropolitan police, said: 'We officially received four complaints from victims and initiated an investigation. 'Finally we located the women and established that they had participated in at least 30 more cases with victims in Bogota.' Video shows the two women after being arrested, both wearing blue jeans and dark jackets and covering their faces. Police revealed that the women would also dye their hair every two weeks to avoid being detected by the authorities. It is believed they would alternate between blonde, red and purple hair dyes to continue to commit their crimes. Caught: The two women are set to be charged with aggravated robbery and kidnapping following their arrests in the Colombian capital of Bogota . The Colombian daily newspaper El Tiempo has reported a 57% increase in scopolamine attacks in the city. In 2014, Colombian police documented a total of 258 cases of male victims under similar conditions and so far this year police have already identified 25 cases. Following the arrests, police have advised men in bars and clubs not to be tempted to 'continue the party' with women that approach them out of the blue. A drug-free version of this form of robbery is known as the 'paseo milionaro' - or 'walk of millionaires' - and is often carried out on tourists in the city.","Duo dubbed the Nanitas arrested following crime spree in Bogota .

"Koala’s are often regarded as Australia’s cuddliest critter, but a recent video from Adelaide shows they have a hostile side, too. Vision has surfaced showing two of the mammals holding on to the same limb of a gum tree when one rushes the other and grapples it from the branch, sending it plunging several metres onto the ground. Taronga Zoo koala keeper Laura Jones told Daily Mail Australia the behaviour is commonplace during the end of the mating season, when the animals argue over breeding. The two koalas are on the same branch when the male rushes towards the female and begins to wrestle her off the branch . The female can be heard squealing in horror as the male tussles her off the branch . ‘The darker one is the male and the other is the female. The male tried to approach her for breeding, but she was not interested. ’ The female koala can heard squealing in protest as the male approaches and wrestles it off the branch, sending it plummeting onto the ground with a crash. Momentarily dazed, the animal wanders away towards another tree, seemingly unharmed. Jones said that while females can often defend themselves against their male counterparts, the male in the video was much larger and stronger. The behaviour is commonplace during the end of the mating season, when the animals argue over breeding . ‘The females would be interested in season, but since it is coming to the end of that time they generally decline the advance.’ The clip, which was captured by an onlooker in the Adelaide Hills, was uploaded to YouTube last week.","The video from Adelaide Hills shows a male koala rushing towards a female .

"If you don't have your heart in your mouth after watching this then you probably are a fighter pilot. This astonishing video shows an Airbus A320 HB-JLT soaring over pristine white snow-covered mountains in Switzerland with six F-5E Tigers of the Swiss air force aerobatic team the Patrouille Suisse - the country's equivalent to the RAF's Red Arrows. The Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) passenger jet and its escort were performing a flypast over the Wengen resort in Bernese Oberland in celebration of the Lauberhorn International Ski Races last month. Scroll down for video . Swiss International Air Lines A320 HB-JLT took with it an escort of six F-5E Tigers of the Swiss air force aerobatic team the Patrouille Suisse . Eat my dust: The vapour trails of the jets can be seen scudding across the perfectly blue sky above the pristine whiteness of the Bernese alps . From all angles: the incredible shots of the jets taking a turn around the mountain are taken from 20 cameras both in the air and on the ground . Something to behold: Winter sports fans were treated to the amazing acrobatic flypast by Switzerland's equivalent of the Red Arrows . Too close for comfort: One of the Patrouille Swiss jets looks like it is hanging off the edge of the Airbus' wing in this stomach-churning shot . In the two minute video incredible shots of the jets taking a turn around the mountain, taken from 20 cameras both in the air and on the ground, are spliced with footage of a skier speeding down the famous downhill course. The course is the longest in the world at 2.78 miles, resulting in run times of two and a half minutes - about 30-45 seconds longer than standard downhill races, with top speeds approaching 100 mph for the top racers. The Lauberhorn downhill run is surrounded by the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau mountains above the Lauterbrunnen valley. In the video the skill of all the pilots involved is there for all to see as they cruise in effortless harmony above the bright white peaks to an exhilarating soundtrack. Observers from below can only look on in wonder as the aircraft bank at seemingly impossible angles, with the fighter pilots even turning their F-5E's upside down at one point. Just as the skier never strays off piste they are always in control, though the pilots of the Airbus are shown having the occasional peek outside the cockpit to check exactly where their cohorts are. The HD-quality film was compiled from more than 60 hours of footage, and features a soundtrack specially composed for the occasion. It offers a glimpse behind the scenes of the whole exercise including cockpit views of the nine pilots involved which provide previously unseen perspectives of the air show. The film was produced to celebrate the fourth consecutive year of SWISS' partnership with the Lauberhorn International Ski Races in what was their 85th edition. SWISS is Switzerland’s national airline, serving 104 destinations in 48 countries from Zurich, Geneva and Basel and carrying some 16 million passengers a year with its 91-aircraft fleet. It has 8,250 staff, is part of the Lufthansa Group and is also a member of Star Alliance, the world’s biggest airline network.

"Leicester climbed to fifth place in the Aviva Premiership standings after beating bottom club London Welsh 26-5 at the Kassam Stadium. The Tigers took an age to quell the spirited Welsh, who kept the visitors to a 5-5 score line after 35 minutes before Leicester's forward power told after the interval. Harry Thacker scored two tries for the visitors, Graham Kitchener and replacement Robert Barbieri the others with Tommy Bell kicking three conversions. Bell had taken over the kicking from Freddie Burns, who had a poor match, missing all three kicks and taking a number of wrong options before being substituted. Jamie Gibson breaks through a London Welsh tackle as Leicester showed enough strength to win . London Welsh, buoyed by an impressive effort from their new recruit, number eight Opeti Fonua, gave a much improved show with their defence considerably toughened after conceding more than 70 points at Wasps. However they did suffer a major blow when Fonua was helped off late in the second half. Leicester gave Bell a Premiership debut at full-back whilst wing Adam Thompstone was selected for his first Premiership start of the season. The pack was unchanged from last week's home draw with Saracens but Burns returned at fly-half. Welsh were without forwards Pablo Henn and Chris Hala'ufia who were both injured in last weekend's crushing defeat at Wasps. Ricky Reeves and Fonua were their replacements with veteran Gordon Ross selected at outside half in place of Will Robinson. Seb Jewell goes on the attack as London Welsh put in a much-improved display at the Kassam Stadium . Ross began with a careless error, kicking the ball straight into touch to concede a line-out in the home 22. Welsh were then penalised but the Tigers elected an attacking line-out before a knock-on enabled the hosts to clear the danger. Burns had the game's first chance for points but his long range penalty sailed wide as Leicester made a whole host of mistakes in the first 15 minutes. Welsh were unable to get out of their half in the opening quarter but another missed penalty from Burns ensured that the match remained scoreless after 20 minutes. The errors continued in abundance with Burns' charged down kick the latest, which gave Welsh their first chance of points but Tom May's drop goal attempt went wide. However, Welsh surprisingly took the lead with Seb Jewell being the catalyst for the score. The full back first retrieved his high kick ahead and when the ball was recycled, skilfully placed a cross-field kick directly into the path of Scott, who easily collected for the try. Graham Kitchener dives over the line as the Leicester pack began to dominate in the second half . After the two misses from Burns, Leicester opted for an attacking line-out after being awarded another penalty. This time it paid dividends with Thacker crashing over for the try with Burns again off target with the kick. Welsh nearly regained the lead when Lachlan McCaffrey charged down a clearance kick and looked set to score, only for Burns to race back and narrowly beat the flanker to the touchdown. However, back came Leicester to secure another attacking line-out for Thacker to score his second. Bell took over the kicking duties and succeeded from the touchline to give Tigers a 12-5 interval lead. Tommy Bell took over the kicking responsibilities after Freddie Burns had missed his first three efforts . Leicester dominated the opening period of the second half and deservedly went further ahead when Kitchener brushed aside two tacklers to score for Bell to convert. With 20 minutes remaining, Burns was replaced by Owen Williams and he was in time to see Barbieri finish off another line-out drive for the bonus point try. Welsh lost Fonua through injury after he had attempted to force his way over before a thoroughly disappointing game meandered to a tame conclusion.","Bottom side London Welsh have lost every game so far this season .

"A star-studded private memorial was held this afternoon for veteran CBS News reporter Bob Simon who was killed in a horrific car crash last week. Dozens of fellow broadcasters, writers and other prominent public figures gathered at the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan earlier today to say goodbye to the highly regarded 60 Minutes correspondent. CNN presenter Anderson Cooper, PBS host Charlie Rose, former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw and ex-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly were among those invited to the service intended only for family and close friends. Famous guest: CBS This Morning anchor Charlie Rose, left, arrives at the Metropolitan Opera House in Manhattan, New York, for Bob Simon's memorial service February 17 . At the conclusion of the service, Charlie Rose described the somber event as a tribute to a man who loved life and culture, and who lived his life well . News giant: Tom Brokaw, 75, praised Bob Simon as a wonderful professional friend . New York City's former top cop Ray Kelly said Simon, whom he'd known since 1980, was a 'legend' and 'quite a guy' Cooper eulogized the veteran journalist in a touching statement released a day after his tragic passing. ‘I dreamed of being, and still hope to be, a quarter of the writer that Bob Simon is and has been. ... Bob Simon was a legend, in my opinion,’ he said. The New York Daily News reported that a team of six pallbearers carried the casket containing Simon's body into the palatial concert venue for the intimate memorial, which lasted about 90 minutes. The well-respected newsman was eulogized by his 60 Minutes colleague Morley Safer, reporter Steve Kroft, CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager, his long-time producer Joel Bernstein and his daughter, Tanya Simon. Tom Brokaw, 75, also paid tribute to Simon, whom he praised as a wonderful professional friend. 'We both thought we were two of the luckiest guys you could possibly imagine because we got to race off and cover the things we always cared about,' the anchor said. Familiar face: The front of the program for Bob Simon's memorial service at the Metropolitan Opera House in Manhattan .

Colleague speaks: CBS 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Krofts was among the speakers at Simon's memorial . The ever-laconic New York City's former top cop Ray Kelly said Simon, whom he'd known since 1980, said Simon was a 'legend' and 'quite a guy.' 'He'll be missed,' he added. It was no coincidence that the famed New York City opera house was chosen as the venue for Simon's memorial service, as he was known as a life-long music lover and opera connoisseur. The speeches at the memorial were interspersed with musical compositions that were among Simon's favorites, including Giuseppe Verdi's 'Ingemisco,' Richard Wagner's 'Liebestod,' and The Beatles classic 'Let It Be.' Simon, 73, died Wednesday in a devastating two-car collision on the West Side Highway. Police said he suffered fatal injuries when he was thrown from the back to the front of a livery cab when the car careened out of control near 30th Street. Simon is survived by his wife, Francoise, their daughter, Tanya, who is a producer for 60 Minutes, and his beloved grandson, Jack. At the time of his death, Simon was awating the arrival of his second grandchild. At the conclusion of the service, Charlie Rose described the somber event for a group of reporters assembled outside as a tribute to 'a life lived well and lived around the world, and lived with courage and lived with a great sense of the human spirit.' Somber task: Tanya Simon, Bob Simon's daughter and one of the producers of 60 Minutes, over the weekend accompanied her mother to a funeral home to make preparations for his memorial service .

Francoise Simon, Bob's wife of nearly a half-century is pictured in Manhattan just three days after her husband's tragic death in a car accident . Funeral home to the stars: Tanya and her mother, Francoise, are pictured arriving Saturday at the Frank E. Campbell Chapel. The same Manhattan funeral home handled Joan River's final arrangements last year . Last sign-off: Bob Simon's final report for 60 Minutes about the search for an Ebola cure aired Sunday on CBS . A larger public memorial service for Bob Simon will be held at a later date. 60 Minutes remembered its longtime correspondent Sunday by airing a story he finished on the day he died, four days earlier. The story looked into a possible new treatment for the Ebola virus. Following the report, fellow correspondent Steve Kroft spoke of Simon's 'sense of justice and his sense of the absurd,' both of which informed his journalism. Kroft said Simon was 'both a model and an inspiration' to his colleagues at CBS News during 47 years at the network. 60 Minutes will devote its full hour next Sunday to Simon and his storied career.","CNN's Anderson Cooper, PBS' Charlie Rose, former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and ex-NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly were in attendance .

"These colourful sketches offer an often literal interpretation of song titles from the decade that fashion forgot. Seven-year-old Sam, from Portland, Oregon, began drawing them after being exposed to his mother Lori Ferraro's love of Eighties music at an early age. The nostalgic mother says that with her passion for the decade it easily infiltrated her son's lifestyle and the result is a photo series called Drawn to the '80s. A woman with a rabbit out of a hat? It must be Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic by The Police . Cyndi Lauper's True Colours is interpreted as a rainbow with the word 'true' in a cloud above it . She said: 'I am obsessed with the Eighties - maybe a little too much. Movies, fashion, television, giant hair... pretty much everything makes me nostalgic for that decade. 'Sam's first favourite song ever at age two or three was Whip It by Devo, which, of course, made me crazy happy.' Lori says that her son first began drawing songs after hearing an upbeat track on the radio. His sketches manage to be both literal and clever. For instance with John Waite's Missing You, he writes the entire alphabet but instead of including the letter 'U', Sam puts a question mark. The Police's Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic is illustrated by a female magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. And Prince's Purple Rain becomes a shower of bright purple raindrops. Here Sam draws  Hungry Like The Wolf by Duran Duran (left) and The Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams (right) Lori says that her son has become almost as much as an expert as she is on the the 1980s . Seven-year-old Sam sketches 1980s songs with his felt-tip pens. Here he draws John Waite's Missing You . 'We mostly listen to Eighties music at home and in the car and one day after hearing Hold Me Now by the Thompson Twins on our way to school, Sam came home and drew this for me. 'He said it was us. He went on and on how much he liked the song and wasn't it so pretty? I agreed.' Sam's mother says that helping her son draw has become a great way for the pair to bond. 'We started paying attention to the music that's always on in the background and Sam started drawing what he heard. 'This was our time together. I love sitting with him and sharing something I love so much with someone I love so much. Footloose by Kenny Loggins (left) and Stuck On You by Lionel Richie (right) Sam was exposed to Eighties music from a young age. Pictured: Take Me Home Tonight by Eddie Money . Hold Me Now by Thompson Twins (pictured) was the very first song Sam drew . The drawings don't usually take Sam more than five minutes to complete. Pictured: Purple Rain by Prince . 'We put on some music and sit at the kitchen table. He always asks me the song title and when I tell him he'll usually giggle and shake his head, then he gets down to business.' Lori (pictured) says that the drawing sessions help her and her son to spend quality time together . She added that it may be a thoughtful process but it is not a particularly lengthy one. 'A typical song takes Sam less than five minutes to draw. 'We sit at the kitchen table and put a something on, usually by the time the song is over he is done with the drawing. 'But sometimes he wants to make it really detailed and he'll spend longer on it.' When it comes to picking a favourite Lori says the more literal Sam has interpreted the song, the better. 'There are so many that I love, especially the first few that he did when they were super-literal. 'Like Hot For Teacher or Footloose where the foot has broken off. 'I also think his She Blinded Me With Science is just great, people have requested that one on a T-shirt or a coffee mug.' Having been drawing along to music for two years Sam has become quite the expert on the music from that decade. Lori says the more literal interpretations are her favourite.

Sam's interpretation of the The Smiths Please Please Please Let Me Get What I want probably mirrors many of those desires of children his age as it includes sweets and ice cream . 'His knowledge of Eighties music continues to surprise me. Yesterday we got in the car and turned on the radio and before I even heard what song was on he blurted out ""Video Killed the Radio Star Mommy!"" 'But my all time favourite would have to be the first one he did which was Hold Me Now by Thompson Twins. 'I will never hear that song the same way again, and I'll never not think of him in the back of the car in that little five-year-old voice asking questions about the music and talking about how pretty it was.'

"Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha are reportedly jetting off to Japan in a few weeks. The First Lady's latest vacation emerged just days after she returned from a weekend skiing jaunt in Aspen, Colorado. Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported that the mother and teen daughters will visit Tokyo and Kyoto in March but without the President who was in Japan last April. Last March, Mrs Obama and her girls visited China and have previously taken trips to Ireland and Germany. Scroll down for video . The First Lady and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, pictured at the Great Wall of China last March. Mrs Obama and her two daughters were scheduled to jet off to Japan next month . The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. It is unclear whether the Japan visit is an official trip or a private vacation. This weekend, the Obamas reportedly spent $2.5million on weekend breaks. The President spent Valentine's weekend in California, where he squeezed in three rounds of golf at a California course owned by Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, Michelle and the girls flew to Aspen for a skiing trip on board a separate presidential aircraft. According to the White House, President Obama flew to San Francisco on Thursday afternoon where he had several events, before taking Saturday, Sunday and Monday off. Michelle Obama, pictured in Aspen in 2014, has brought her daughters to Colorado for the past four years . As President Obama enjoyed the California sunshine, his wife's jet was spotted in Aspen, Colorado . He delivered a speech at a summit on cyber security before attending a round-table meeting with business leaders. His final official engagement of the weekend was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee  at the home of venture capitalist Sandy Robinson. Guests paid $10,000 for dinner and a photograph with the president or $32,400 to co-chair the fundraiser. While President Obama was in California, his wife was in Aspen, Colorado, where she has spent several Presidents' Day holidays away from her husband. President Obama used his weekly television address to wish his wife a happy Valentine's Day. According to figures obtained by Judicial Watch, President Obama's VC-25A jet, better known as Air Force One, costs $228,288 per hour while it is in the air. It is estimated that the jet, which has a cruising speed of 575mph, spent approximately 10 hours in the air during its four-day trip to the West Coast, at a cost of $2,228,000. Previous golfing trips on Presidents' Day cost $50,000 in hotels and a further $16,000 in car rental. Mrs Obama's skiing trip in 2013 cost more than $81,000 according to figures released to Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act. The earlier trip cost $13,000 in flights, $4,000 in car hire and a further $64,000 for renting an exclusive lodge. According to USA Today, President Obama played the Porcupine Creek Golf Course in Palm Springs, owned by Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. The President had two days of engagements in northern California before playing three rounds of golf. He returned to Washington D.C. on Monday. The US Air Force has announced that the current pair of jets used to fly the president will be replaced by a pair of new Boeing 747-8 aircraft. Mr Obama has enjoyed 219 rounds of golf since he took office, according to a website that tracks the amount he plays. Mrs Obama's skiing trip is the fourth time she and her daughters visited the exclusive Colorado skiing resort. The visit was meant to be private, but visitors to the local airport spotted a private jet in presidential livery parked on the ramp.","The First Lady's latest vacation emerged just days after she returned from a weekend skiing jaunt in Aspen, Colorado .

"The boss of an under-fire hospital department hanged himself after the end of a workplace affair which he would not accept was over, an inquest has heard. Mark Channell, 44, was found dead in a flat 200 yards from the A&E department of North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton, north London, where he worked as a nurse manager. The married father-of-two had been having an affair with a colleague named Rebecca Mills - but they had split up months before his death, North London Coroner's Court in Barnet was told. Found hanged: Mark Channell was discovered dead in a flat 200 yards from his A&E department in London . Mr Channell - who lived with his wife Sarah, 37, a veterinary surgeon, in a detached two-bedroom house worth £285,000 in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire - was found dead in August last year. Miss Mills told the coroner that that the couple had split up some months before his death, ‘but Mark wouldn’t accept it was over’. She arrived home from a holiday in the U.S. on the day he died. Spouse: Mr Channell, 44, lived with his wife Sarah (above), 37, a veterinary surgeon, in Peterborough . His colleague Sharon King said she became concerned about him and called round to a flat he shared opposite the hospital. She had a key to the property and found him hanging. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Andrew Walker said no note had been left and although the dead man had ‘troubles’ there was not enough evidence that he committed suicide. The inquest was told the ‘highly regarded’ Mr Channell wanted to leave the hospital for a job working for the London Ambulance Service, but became distressed when he failed to get this. The A&E department was in the news last year when a Care Quality Commission report found managers were ‘firefighting’ as the hospital was ‘stretched’ due to taking in more patients. However Dr Edward Lamuren, a lead A&E consultant who headed the department with Mr Channell, said he did not know his colleague - who was also as a friend - might harm himself. Mrs Channell declined to comment on her husband's death. An employee at her workplace of the Cromwell Veterinary Practice in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, said she was on maternity leave. A North Middlesex Hospital spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Mark was a much loved and respected NHS professional who worked at North Middlesex University Hospital for over five years as our A&E service manager. Work: Mr Channell was a nurse manager at North Middlesex Hospital (pictured) in Edmonton, north London . ‘He cared deeply about his patients, worked tirelessly and helped lead some important changes to the department. His death last summer was a totally unexpected shock for his family, friends and colleagues.’ The Mail on Sunday told last August how MP David Burrowes feared for his life as he waited almost 36 hours for an emergency appendix operation in the ‘chaotic’ hospital. It was having to cope with 40,000 extra patients a year due to the closure of Chase Farm Hospital’s A&E in Enfield, north London, when only 26,000 were predicted. The Conservative MP for nearby Enfield Southgate described how it took 12 hours to get a CT scan - because overworked staff forgot to enter his details on the system.","Mark Channell was found dead in flat 200 yards from his A&E department .

"A disgraced town crier has been stripped of his post after falsely boasting that he had a distinguished military career and wearing war medals he bought online. Anthony Church was often seen around Oxfordshire wearing the replica  medals, having allegedly claimed he was a regimental sergeant major with the Coldstream Guards during the Falklands War. The 62-year-old, from Cowley, Oxford, wore the Order of the British Empire, the South Atlantic Medal for those who fought in the Falklands, and a General Service Medal with a Northern Ireland clasp. Mr Church, who worked as a town crier in Banbury, Oxford, Thame, Chipping Norton and Wallingford, today apologised for his 'grave error in judgment' Town crier Anthony Church (pictured left and his medals, right), from Cowley, Oxford, has been stripped of his post after falsely claiming he had a distinguished military career . The 62-year-old (pictured with fellow town criers from around the country) often wore the British Empire Medal and the South Atlantic Medal for those who fought in the Falklands which he had purchased online . He also used the title BEM - which stands for British Empire Medal - after his name on Banbury Town Council's website and apparently wore the award as well. But Mr Church was today forced to apologise for his 'grave error of judgement' after it emerged that he had never served in the Armed Forces. Instead, Mr Church admitted he had bought the medals off the internet before wearing them in public, including at Remembrance Day parades. He has now been forced to step down from the Loyal Company of Town Criers and the Ancient and Honorable Guild of Town Criers. Issuing an apology, Mr Church, who worked as a town crier in Banbury, Oxford, Thame, Chipping Norton and Wallingford, said he had 'made a mistake'. He claimed the BEM medal was awarded to his late father Jack Church for taking part in the Berlin Airlift and that he mistakenly believed he was entitled to wear it. He added that he wore the other medals as a 'tribute' to former servicemen. He said: 'I was told several years ago that as the sole-surviving son I was entitled to wear the BEM and put BEM after my name. 'Tribute': The disgraced town crier claims the medals were worn to honour the Armed Forces . Church used the title BEM after his name, which stands for British Empire Medal, pictured, and apparently wore the award as well . 'I also wanted, with the anniversary of the Falklands and World War One, to show my solidarity for those people who had served in these campaigns and found a place I could purchase replica medals and purchased a South Atlantic Medal. 'In September I contacted Buckingham Palace on an unrelated matter and received a letter back asking when I had been awarded the BEM. 'I wrote back explaining the situation and was told that I had been misinformed and was in fact not allowed to use the title or wear the medal as it would lead people to assume that I had been awarded the medal, so I immediately removed all medals.' He added: 'I realise now that I made a grave error of judgement with this. 'It was very stupid and I categorically now apologise to everybody who has served in the forces. It was never my intention to cause any distress or upset. 'I made a mistake, I told someone I'd served and it's been going on from there. I can't apologise enough for the hurt and distress it has probably caused people. 'People will probably feel, with hindsight, that I have misled them. I was in the wrong. I did not mean to offend anyone in the military - it was meant to be a show of support. Mr Church also used the title BEM - which stands for British Empire Medal - after his name on Banbury Town Council's website . 'It was never my intention to cause any distress but it has backfired and cost me everything.' Mr Church was exposed by a group calling itself the Walter Mitty Hunters Club, a group of former servicemen which investigates those who illegitimately wear medals. The Royal British Legion said medals awarded to a deceased service or ex-service people may be worn on the right breast by a near relative. Mr Church wore the medals he acquired on the left. On their Facebook page, John Theman, Secretary of The Loyal Company of Town Criers, said: 'We wish to thank The Walter Mitty Hunters Club for outing Anthony Church. 'We wish to make it known that his actions are deplorable and beneath contempt. 'He has resigned from all Town Crier positions, but rest assured, even if he hadn't resigned, he would have been thrown out of our organisation in disgrace. 'A month ago we investigated his wearing of medals, and he apologised profusely, saying it was a one-off, and we accepted his apology. However the fact he claimed the awards of MBE and BEM really is astounding. 'The Loyal Company of Town Criers has immediately removed all trace of Anthony Church from our websites. 'To the many genuine Town Criers in the UK and beyond, this will come as a huge shock, so, once again, well done sirs.' Chairman of the Oxfordshire Royal British Legion, Jim Lewendon said: 'I saw Mr Church wearing the medals at Remembrance time on his left breast and assumed they were his. 'And a few years back he told me he had been in the Coldstream Guards. Wearing the medals like this is an insult to the bravery of the troops who served. 'I can't believe Anthony was a pretender and I hope he can put this behind him.' In 2012 Mr Church, from Cowley, in Oxford, led Team GB athletes to the spectacular opening ceremony for the London Olympics. He was one of three representatives of the Ancient & Honourable Guild of Town Criers who dressed in traditional liveries to help marshall athletes from 205 nations from the Olympic Village to the stadium in time for the Athletes' Parade.","Anthony Church, 62, wore several medals, including British Empire Medal .

"A Norwegian tourist was raped twice in one night in separate attacks on her way home from a barbecue, a court heard. Marius Stakele, 24, and Aftab Mohammed, 39, who are unknown to each other, allegedly forced themselves on the woman just hours apart after she asked for their help getting home. The intoxicated victim, who has not been named for legal reasons,  had no idea the second attack had taken place until police carried out a DNA tests. The 23-year-old had spent the afternoon drinking at a barbecue in Lancaster Road, Romford, Essex, on May 9 last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. The intoxicated victim was alleged to have approached Stakele and his friend at Canning Town Station (file picture) She was so intoxicated she believed she was at Heathrow Airport when she approached Stakele and his friend at Canning Town station on the DLR. They walked with her towards the A13 Canning Town flyover where Stakele allegedly smashed her head against a concrete wall and raped her. She later reported the attack to police and tests revealed she had been raped by a second man, the court heard. Pam Oon, prosecuting, said: ‘She had too much to drink at the party, by midnight she was drunk, getting quite emotional, crying and making a scene, so a taxi was booked to take her and a friend home.’ During the journey she had behaved unreasonably and tried to get out of the taxi while the vehicle was moving. She was eventually let out on her own in New Road, Dagenham, but left her phone and new jacket in the car. Ms Oon continued: ‘There’s a period [between midnight and 4am] where the alleged victim doesn’t have any recollection at all, and it’s during this period that the prosecution say she was raped by Mr Mohammed.’ The woman said the first thing she remembered was being at Canning Town station at about 4am. The victim allegedly met Mohammed after knocking on the booth of his building site near the A13 in Dagenham. Pictured: A31 in Dagenham . ‘She asked someone what time the trains were leaving and ended up speaking to two eastern European men - she asked what time the trains were leaving and they told her they didn’t leave for another two hours. ‘She went with them to the Canning Town Flyover, the men were walking either side of her, holding her, she tried to leave them but they said no - the situation didn’t set of any alarm bells with her, then the other man left. ‘[Mr Stakele] tried and succeeded in taking advantage of her in her drunken state, he attempted to kiss her, and attempted to kiss her again when they were under the flyover. ‘He slammed her head against a concrete wall and then pushed her on to her knees.’ The woman later told police Stakele raped her and forced her to perform a sex act on him. She had bruising to her cheek and eye socket after the attack and lacerations across her back and torso from all the broken glass on the ground. Ms Oon said: ‘During the entire incident she struggled, she tried to get away, she didn’t consent to any of the sexual activity and the prosecution say that nothing that she said or did could be interpreted as consent by Mr Stakele.’ Marius Stakele, 24, and Aftab Mohammed, 39, who are unknown to each other, are on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court . The young woman sought help at Canning Town Station and a staff member who helped her described her as ‘trembling, but like someone who had had a shock, not like someone who was cold or on drugs’. Mohammed, a security guard, was only tracked down via DNA evidence, and the alleged victim had no memory of him at all, saying she had never had sex with an Asian male before. He claimed the victim had knocked on the window of his booth guarding a building site near the A13 in Dagenham and had begged him for a lift. Mohammed told police he had refused at first, because it was against company policy to give lifts in a work vehicle, but eventually changed his mind.. During the journey, he said the woman had told him she ‘wanted to make love’. Ms Oon said: ‘He said he took her to an area of waste ground near St Stephens Road and that’s where they had sex and he didn’t force her, said he had asked for his number - out of concern he gave her money to get home.’ CCTV footage from Canning Town station showed Mohammed dropping the young woman off in his work car. When he was interviewed by police, he showed them where he had thrown the complainant’s bra in some rubbish bags on some nearby wasteland. ‘She has no recollection, she had a feeling she took a taxi because there’s no way she could’ve walked there from Essex, she doesn’t recall talking to anyone.’ Mohammed, of  Manor Park, London, denies two counts of rape, and Stakele, of no fixed address, denies two counts of rape, one count of attempted rape and one count of assault by penetration.

"After 30 years as a pilot, Captain Peter Elliott got to fly with a co-pilot he knew more than most. The pilot, who has clocked up more than 15,500 hours of flying during his career, made a special announcement to passengers travelling from Birmingham to Tenerife to tell them he was flying with his daughter. Senior First Officer Laura Elliott has been flying for six years but has never before got to work her father who first inspired her to fly when she was 18. Captain Peter Elliott (left) and his daughter Senior First Officer Laura Elliott flew together for the first time . Mr Elliott inspired his daughter (pictured with her father as a child) to take to the skies when she was just 18 . 'It's a dream come true to be able to fly with my Dad - even if he was still checking up on me,'  said Laura of Birmingham in the West Midlands. The father-daughter pairing at the controls was a fluke but Miss Elliott said she hopes she will be able to fly with her father again before he retires. It had seemed unlikely the pair would ever co-pilot the same aircraft because Miss Elliott learned to fly on Airbus planes when she joined the company in 2009, and her father flew Boeings. However when Miss Elliott took a break from Thomas Cook to work for another company her father retrained to work on the Airbus fleet and the pair were able to co-pilot their first flight. Miss Elliott, 30, became interesting in flying when her father got her a trial flight for her 18th birthday. She said: 'Becoming a pilot was never something I had considered, even though Dad had been a pilot since before I was born. The father and daughter flying team made their dream a reality after Mr Elliott trained to fly an Airbus . Mr Elliott told passengers aboard the Airbus that the flight on February 6 was a special one for him . Miss Elliott (pictured in yellow headband) said she had never thought about flying until she went on a trial . 'It was only when my Dad bought me trial flight as a birthday present that I got the bug. 'But I was already preparing to go to university so I headed off to study sport and exercise science like I'd always planned. 'It was only when I graduated four years later that I considered following in my Dad's footsteps. 'I applied for a flying course and spent 14 months in southern Spain getting my license and then started with Thomas Cook in 2009. Miss Elliott has been flying for six years and her father (right)  has more than 20 years experience as a pilot . 2006 - Graduated from Birmingham University . 2007 - 2008- Training in Spain at Flight Training Europe Jerez . 2009 – Joined Thomas Cook as a Cadet . Nov 2011 – Promoted to Senior First Officer at Thomas Cook . Dec 2013 – Went to fly for Monarch for one year . Dec 2014 – Returned to Thomas Cook . 1977 – Graduated from Manchester University . 1979-81 – Flight School training at Hamble Air Training College after working as accountant . 1985 - Joined DanAir . 1992 - Joined Airtours which became MyTravel and merged with Thomas Cook. 2014 - Retrained to fly an Airbus craft, similar to the craft his daughter flies . Feb 2015 - First flight with his daughter . Miss Elliott said her father inspired her to train to become a pilot and her mother had encouraged them both . 'Dad and I are really similar - he hadn't planned on being a pilot at the beginning either and was an accountant before but Mum encouraged us both.' The pair are the first father-daughter team at Thomas Cook, but Miss Elliott said she is not surprised. She added: 'Female pilots are still very unusual. The airline industry is still a bit of a mystery for some people and nationally just three per cent of pilots are women.' The pair finally sat in the cockpit together on February 6 and Mr Elliott, who has been a training captain for 23 years, made an announcement to passengers that the flight made it a special day for him as he was flying with his daughter. The father-daughter flying-duo found themselves in the cockpit together because of a quirk in the roster . After a hassle-free flight both said they hoped to fly together again on a Thomas Cook flight in the future . Miss Ellliott added: 'I thought that Dad would have retired by the time I got back to work and so we thought that we'd never get the opportunity.' But after just a year I went back to work, and in the time away Dad had retrained on the Airbus. 'It was only my second flight back that it just popped up on the rota that we were due to fly together, simply by chance. 'It was quite a surprise because Dad's based in Birmingham and my base is East Midlands Airport, but when we realise I was so pleased I'd finally get to fulfil my wish.' Miss Elliott said she was initially nervous flying with her father and said it was like going for a driving lesson with him. However the flight went smoothly and both hope to repeat the experience.","Captain Peter Elliott has worked as pilot for Thomas Cook for over 30 years .

"At least 20 people were killed during the Haiti Carnival in the early hours of this morning when they were electrocuted by a power line falling on their packed float. The accident happened as thousands of people filled the streets of central Port-au-Prince, the Caribbean country's capital, for the raucous annual celebration. Witnesses at the scene said someone on the float used a pole or stick to move a power line so the float could pass under it, but video appeared to show it striking the head of a singer riding on top. Meanwhile in the southeastern Brazilian city of Nova Iguacu, three men were killed in eerily similar circumstances when their carnival float ran into a power line. Scroll down for videos .

Seven people were reported dead on the float, which caught fire after the flash of sparks, Reuters reported. Others managed to jump off, leading to more deaths and injuries in the densely packed crowd of spectators as people began to panic. A further 46 people were injured in the accident, according to Nadia Lochard, a coordinator for the Department of Civil Protection. Reuters put the toll of injuries at 60, without citing a source. The float was sponsored by the Haitian hip-hop group Barikad Crew. An unverified video posted to YouTube and on social media today  shows a rapper from the group hit in the head by an exposed power line while riding a tall float. A second YouTube video shows crowds parting as paramedics race to the scene in an ambulance. 'I saw the wire falling and sparks and I started running for my life,' said Natacha Saint Fleur, a 22-year-old who was near the float at the time. Dr Joel Desire at the General Hospital, where many of the victims were taken, said at least 18 people died. It was not immediately clear if other victims had been taken elsewhere.

A statement by Haiti's Minister for Information, Rotchild Francois jr, carried on the Dynasty Haiti website, said: 'The Government of the Republic informs the public that an unfortunate accident, following an electric shock, happened earlier this morning at 2.48am when Barikad Crew's carnival float passed through the area of the Champ de Mars in the course of the second day of the National carnival 2015. 'A preliminary assessment allows for more than a dozen dead and forty wounded. The government offers its sympathies to the families of the victims and said that all arrangements have been made to assist all those affected by this tragedy.

"Part of Margaret Thatcher's formidable reputation was down to how little she slept. The former British prime minister was believed to get by on just four hours of sleep each night - and she wasn't the only one. Nikola Tesla, the 'grandfather of electricity' was thought to sleep just two hours a night, while Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi only gets two to four hours, and Barack Obama six hours. Scroll down for video . New infographic reveals some of the strange sleeping habits of the world's most successful people, and most are below the recommended levels of shut eye. The National Sleep foundation recommends seven to nine hours of sleep a night for 18-64 years olds to maintain a healthy lifestyle . Now, a new infographic reveals some of the strange sleeping habits of the world's most successful people, and most are below the recommended levels of shut eye. Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, averages seven hours sleep and billionaire Donald Trump only gets three to four hours. The National Sleep foundation recommends seven to nine hours of sleep a night for 18-64 years olds to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Despite Thatcher and Obama's example, politicians are the group who with the most people who get more than nine hours of sleep each night. Part of Margaret Thatcher's formidable reputation was down to how little she slept. The former British prime minister (left) was believed to get by on just four hours of sleep each night - and she wasn't the only one. Barack Obama (right) currently only gets six hours of rest each night . The Uberman cycle was used by Leonardo Da Vinci. This involves taking 20 to 40 minutes naps every four hours. The Dymaxion cycle, meanwhile, was created by Richard Buckminster 'Bucky' Fuller – a renowned American neo-futuristic architect who died in 1983. He slept for 30 minutes every six hours . Having eight hours of 'quality sleep' a night can help stave off developing Alzheimer's in later life, a study has found. Sound sleep in young and middle-aged people allows the brain to consolidate the day's memories- boosting memory and learning. Now research has revealed that sleeping well in our formative years can predict better mental function in old age, and may be able to delay or even help prevent age-related memory loss. Michael Scullin, director of Baylor University's Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory, in Texas, examined 50 years of sleep research in his study. 'It's the difference between investing up front rather than trying to compensate later,' he explained. 'We came across studies that showed that sleeping well in middle age predicted better mental functioning 28 years later.' Sleeping well is also linked to general better health, with those who get enough sleep more likely to have better mental health and less likely to be overweight, develop high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes- all factors which make people more prone to memory loss. The chart also shows how people in marketing and PR get the least sleep, with the sector having the highest number of people who sleep less than three hours. 'You often read and hear stories of successful individuals, especially in business, boasting about how much they get done while the rest of us are tucked up in bed,' said Made to Measure Blinds who made the graphic. 'We wanted to compare these individuals against data from other people working in those sectors.' The researchers took data from a YouGov survey, which asked 1,401 working adults about their sleeping habits to create a chart. But people don't necessarily have to get unbroken sleep to get their rest. 'Though often relying on anecdotal evidence, there have been reported cases of alternative sleeping patterns that have been used to apparent success,' the Berkshire-based company said. The firm has also created a chart detailed various sleep patterns, such as the Uberman cycle, which was used by Leonardo Da Vinci. This involves taking 20 to 40 minutes naps every four hours. The Dymaxion cycle, meanwhile, was created by Richard Buckminster 'Bucky' Fuller – a renowned American neo-futuristic architect who died in 1983. He slept for 30 minutes every six hours. Former British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, enjoyed taking siestas. The Everyman cycle reveals a similar pattern is which three short 20 minute naps are taken throughout the day . Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, averages seven hours sleep each night. Research last year found that interrupted sleep can be as physically detrimental as having no sleep at all . Former British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, enjoyed taking siestas. He would sleep four to four and a half hours per night and then take a 90 minute nap around noon. However, research last year found that interrupted sleep can be as physically detrimental as having no sleep at all. The study linked interrupted sleep patterns and compromised cognitive abilities, shortened attention spans, and negative moods. The researchers at Tel Aviv University discovered that interrupted sleep is equivalent to no more than four consecutive hours of sleep. Sleeping well is also linked to general better health, with those who get enough sleep more likely to have better mental health and less likely to be overweight, develop high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury should never expressed regret over the British bombing of Dresden – because it helped save 'thousands' of lives, an MP has said. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said the RAF attacks 70 years ago helped shorten the War. The Most Rev Justin Welby was criticised on Friday for telling an audience in the German city of his 'profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow' at the bombings, which killed thousands. And BBC coverage of Friday's 70th anniversary commemoration also came in for criticism for including a prisoner of war who claimed the UK had been 'worse than' the Nazis. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby should never expressed regret over the British bombing of Dresden, an MP has said . Last night it emerged that 54 people had contacted the Corporation to complain about the coverage. On Friday, Archbishop Welby said the bombing of Dresden, which killed an estimated 25,000, 'diminished all our humanity'. But he made no reference to the 53,573 British aircrew killed in the struggle to overthrow Hitler, nor to the German bombing of London or Coventry. On the Radio 4 Today programme yesterday, Tory MP and former defence minister Sir Gerald said Mr Welby should have made it clear it was wrong to apologise for Dresden. 'This is a very sensitive issue indeed and has been for the last 70 years,' he said. 'I am a big admirer of Archbishop Justin Welby, but I do think here it came across – and we have to be careful how we measure our words – it came across like he was more sensitive to the Germans than he was to the sacrifice of 56,000 members of Bomber Command. He said the bombing raids on Dresden (pictured), which killed an estimated 25,000, ‘diminished all our humanity’ 'When he said 'I stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow', it was in the sense that one felt he was on the verge of apologising. 'When he did a Radio 5 interview subsequently, he was asked 'Should we apologise?', to which he replied: 'I think it is more complicated than should we apologise'. 'I'm very sorry that the Archbishop, for whom I do have a lot of time, did not seize that opportunity to say I was not apologising nor should we apologise. 'It was a brutal war. The bombing of Dresden undoubtedly brought the War to an end sooner than would otherwise have been the case, and unquestionably saved thousands – possibly hundreds of thousands – of lives.' Nick Baines, the Bishop of Leeds, said on the same programme that when he read the text of the Archbishop's speech that it did not 'come across' like an apology. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said the RAF attacks 70 years ago helped shorten the War . Most Rev Justin Welby apologised for Dresden (pictured), but made no reference to the German bombings of London and Coventry . 'Whatever the moral judgement about the right or wrongness of the firestorms and the bombing raid, this caused terrible devastation, and to acknowledge that is not to diminish the price that other people paid. 'The Archbishop did not apologise for what went on.' The BBC's coverage of the commemorations was condemned as disgraceful by RAF veterans and MPs. One British prisoner of war was interviewed, saying the raids were 'demonic' and 'evil'. Last night a spokesman for the BBC said: 'Last Friday the Dresden commemorations were watched by more than 15 million people on BBC TV news – with many millions also listening on radio or viewing online; and 54 people complained.' The Archbishop said it was ‘miraculous’ Dresden (aftermath of bombing pictured) was welcoming him given the ‘brutal and devastating’ nature of the attack .","Justin Welby apologised for British bombing of Dresden in World War II .

"A father was stabbed by a farmer in a dispute over a pet poodle. Gavin Watson, 30, confronted Michael Turford after being told he had manhandled his daughter’s dog Lola. But Turford drew a knife on the builder and plunged it three times into his chest. Gavin Watson was stabbed three times by farmer Michael Turford after Mr Watson confronted him about manhandling his daughter's pet dog, a poodle cross called Lola, at a holiday park they were at in Yorkshire . The 32-year-old was jailed for seven years at York Crown Court on Monday after a jury convicted him of wounding with intent at the end of a week-long trial. The incident happened while Mr Watson was on a camping holiday with wife Kelly, 29, and children Madelaine, 11, and Harry, seven. They left Lola in their tent when they went on a car trip but the spaniel cross-breed escaped and found its way to the campsite’s clubhouse. Turford, who lived across the road and was in the building, took it on himself to throw the dog out. Michael Turford (left) has been jailed for seven years following the attack which left Mr Watson needing stitches (right) after he stabbed him three times outside the Hare and Hounds pub in Yorkshire . Mr Watson had been on holiday with his family including (from left to right) his father Steve Watson, mother Janet Watson and wife Kelly Watson, as well as their two children Harry (front left) and Madelaine (front right) When Mr Watson heard what had happened he tracked Turford to a nearby pub to demand an explanation, which was not forthcoming. Nicholas Barker, prosecuting, said Mr Watson was leaving the pub when Turford, following behind, struck with his knife. Mr Watson fought back but was stabbed twice more. Turford fled and was arrested the next morning – April 21 last year. Lola the dog belonged to Mr Watson's daughter Madelaine and the builder was concerned about the pet . Turford stabbed Mr Watson three times outside the Hare and Hounds pub near Whitby, north Yorkshire . Mr Watson was taken to hospital because of his injuries (left) and has been left with scars (right) Mr Watson has recovered after the stabbing by Turford and the family are at their home in Belper, Derbyshire . Peter Makepeace, defending, claimed Turford acted in self-defence but the jury agreed with the prosecution that the farmer made the first move. Mr Watson said he thought he was going to die . After sentencing, Mr Watson, from Belper, Derbyshire, said: ‘I was told that he had thrown Lola at a wall or floor. My daughter was devastated because it was her dog and she was really upset.’ He said he thought the first blow from Turford’s knife was a punch. ‘As soon as I realised he stabbed me, he was coming at me with a knife again,’ he added. ‘He stabbed me in the guts, just above the spleen and close to my lungs right near my heart. ‘Doctors told me that I was lucky that I didn’t die because the wounds were so close to my organs.’ Mr Watson was driven from the pub back to the York House campsite in Hawkser, near Whitby, north Yorkshire from where an ambulance took him to hospital. He has made a full recovery. Detective Sergeant Ash Khan, of North Yorkshire Police’s major crimes unit, said: ‘This case demonstrates the dangers and consequences of people carrying a knife and hopefully Michael Turford will use his time in prison to reflect on his actions.’ Turford was cleared on a charge of attempted murder.","Gavin Watson was on holiday with his family at campsite in north Yorkshire .

"Scientists have mapped the quietest places in America, as well as some of the noisiest. Researchers from the National Park Service collected more than 1.5million hours of acoustical monitoring data from around the country and found that the quietest areas were in national parks. The team found sound levels that are as quiet as before European colonization in some wild places of the country, according to Science. Scientists from the National Park Service used a computer program to map the noise levels throughout the entire country. This map shows the combined decibel levels from both natural and human-made noise, which ranged from below 30 decibels to above 60 . National parks, such as Yellowstone in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, were the quietest places in the entire country, with low levels of human noise . While the most peaceful places saw less than 20 decibels of background noise on a typical summer day, places such as New York City can average up to 60 decibels. The map shows a stark difference between the noisy eastern half of the country and the West, where large swaths of land see measurements below 30 decibels. Noise is measured logarithmically in decibels, with a jet engine  around 100 decibels, an office environment measured at about 60 and a whisper at 20. The quietest places in the US are found at the Rockies and westward, with secluded areas such as Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado leading the way. Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii was also among the quietest, lead author Dr Daniel Mennitt told Daily Mail Online. Urban environments and towns along the interstate system got the noisiest ratings, according to maps from a study by  Dr Mennitt, Dr Ken Fristrup and Dr Lisa Nelson. Researchers have previously pointed out how long-term exposure to loud background noise can cause health problems. Dr Fristrup has said that constant noise may be creating a 'deaf generation' that is unable to use our bodies' ability to hear sounds far away. The researchers also made a map of the country's noise if humans were taken out of the equation (above). Large amounts of natural noise, which was mapped on a smaller scale than the total noise, was found in areas with rivers and insects, such as the Southeast . The naturally noisiest parts of the country include the area around the Mississippi River (pictured) while naturally quiet places were generally high,dry shrubland . However, the difference between the bustling East and the more peaceful West was not only limited to areas with large amounts of human development. A map of sounds created by natural sources, where scientists redid the map as if there were no people, also shows a country split in half. Warm areas in the Southeast and interior Midwest saw high values and appear in yellow, though the scale for the amount of noise is smaller than for when human sounds are included. Non-human noise came mostly from running water, rain and 'wind-induced vegetation sounds'. The wetlands and area around the Mississippi River also support a huge amount of wildlife and the constant buzz of insects can be heard even in areas with few or no people. Humans' contribution to the noise levels were mapped by subtracting the natural levels from the soundscape (seen above). Even areas without large human populations saw man-made noise from roads and airplanes flying overhead . Big cities such as New York (pictured) can see background noise levels as high as 60 decibels, roughly the same as an office environment or a conversation in a restaurant . The quietest places in terms of natural sounds were high, dry shrubland and barren, flat terrain'. Dr Mennitt and his team then measured the affect that humans have on the soundscape by finding the difference between the total noise and natural noise levels. Even remote spots saw some man-made noise, with the rumble of aircraft overheard destroying the natural stillness. Other patches of would-be quiet were also broken up by roads or other transportation networks. One aircraft can be heard 25 miles from from its path and cars can be heard six miles from the road, the study said. The largest areas without large amounts of unnatural noise were the Adirondacks in northern New York state and parts of the Rocky Mountains. Half of 'low impact' areas were in protected lands. The scientists were unable to collect data from every point in the entire country, and used Random Forest, a 'tree-based machine learning algorithm' to create their maps. Though the researchers originally began looking just at the country's national parks, their more recent research has included data from urban areas and airports. The noise study's combined map bears a striking resemblance to NASA's map of nighttime light, with much of the activity clustered around humans in big cities .","National Park Service scientists created maps of human and natural noise .

"Childhood friend Abo Saddam (pictured) said Omar El-Hussein had gone into prison as a gang member and come out radicalised . The jihadi who murdered two civilians in Denmark swore allegiance to Islamic State just nine minutes before his first attack. Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein declared his devotion to the terror group on his Facebook page and then gunned down a film director at a free speech debate in Copenhagen. The 22-year-old fanatic later killed a volunteer security guard at a synagogue before police shot him dead. Last night it emerged that Danish intelligence service PET was warned that El-Hussein had become radicalised while in prison. A senior member of his former gang, called the Brothas, said El-Hussein had been released two weeks ago. Abo Saddam added: ‘When he went inside he was a member of our gang. He lived his life with us. We would drive around, smoke hashish together, fight rival gangs. This is the Omar that I knew. ‘But when he came out he changed. He stopped keeping in touch with the Brothas. ‘Prison changed him. He became a much harder Muslim with more hardcore beliefs. He wanted to act on those beliefs as well, instead of just talking about them.’ The 24-year-old gangster added: ‘He went into prison a gang member like us and came out wanting to wage holy war.’ Last night a video emerged of El-Hussein competing in a Thai kick-boxing bout two years ago looking toned and athletic. Highly-skilled, he was known as ‘The Captain’ and hoped to turn professional. Instead, he started smoking marijuana heavily and became involved in tit-for-tat battles with rival gangs in the poor areas of Copenhagen. In November 2013 he stabbed a man of 19 in the thigh and buttock on a train in an unprovoked attack. He was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm – where he became radicalised. Born in Denmark to Palestinian parents, he developed a hatred of Jews, his associates claim. Copenhagen terrorist Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein (left) competes in a kick-boxing match in February 2013 . 'It feels very strange to have boxed against him': Footage has emerged showing the jihadi fighting Peder Jepsen (right), who today spoke of his shock after discovering he had once been in the ring with the killer . Saddam said: ‘I grew up with him. Academically he was one of the brightest at school.’ It also emerged that El-Hussein posted a video on Facebook called the ‘Sword of Jihad’ 45 minutes before his first attack. The footage is of an Arabic song, which says: ‘Soon, soon, will see the indescribable. Our purpose is to destroy you, therefore the sword has been made sharp. We will come to you with slaughter and death.’ And nine minutes before his first attack he wrote: ‘I swear allegiance to Abu Bakr and will obey him in adversity and prosperity, and will not go against the orders I get assigned, unless I witness blatant disbelief.’ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the head of Islamic State. El-Hussein set up his Facebook page under the Islamic name of Abu Ramadan Almuhajir. He lists himself as an employee of ‘Murder Inc’. El-Hussein, who was well known to police for violence and weapons violations, was killed in a shootout with police in his neighborhood of Norrebro, Copenhagen, following the attacks. Five police officers were injured . Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, who shot 55-year-old film director Finn Nørgaard and 37-year-old security guard Dan Uzan dead after storming a cafe and synagogue on Saturday, may have been radicalised in prison . PET head Jens Madsen has acknowledged that El-Hussein had been ‘on the radar’. The gunman killed film director Finn Norgaard, 55, while indiscriminately firing at the Krudttønden café on Saturday. Some ten hours later he shot Dan Uzan in the head at a synagogue. Mr Uzan, 37, an economist at the Danish treasury, had been acting as a volunteer security guard. Two police officers, also guarding the synagogue, were wounded. Two men appeared in court yesterday, accused of providing and disposing of the gun used in the shootings, as well as helping the killer to hide . Mr Norgaard was killed at a free speech debate attended by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has received death threats for drawings of the Prophet Mohammad, and French ambassador Francois Zimeray, who likened the attacks to the Charlie Hebdo killings. Vilks and Zimeray were both unharmed. Danish film director Finn Nørgaard, 55 (left), and 37-year-old security guard Dan Uzan (right) were killed . El-Hussein opened fire at a cafe in the Oesterbro area of Copenhagen (pictured) during a free speech seminar . Vilks is believed to have been the target of the attack and has previously spoken of how he sleeps with an axe under his bed and has a panic room in his secret location house as he lives under constant threat from Islamist fanatics. Yesterday, tens of thousands of Danes gathered at memorials around the country to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. A torch-lit manifestation in Copenhagen attracted a large crowd, including Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and political leaders from fellow Nordic countries. Singing John Lennon's Imagine, defiant Danes promised to uphold their trademark open society and showed solidarity with the country's Muslim minority after El-Hussein was identified to have Palestinian roots and a passion for Islamist issues. The shooting spree was Denmark's worst terror attack since a bomb exploded outside the Copenhagen office of the North West Orient airline in 1985, killing a 27-year-old Algerian tourist. U.S. president Barack Obama has phoned his Danish counterpart, Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmid, to offer his condolences. The White House said Mr Obama offered the United States' support, and the pair agreed to work together to confront those who would challenge free speech or religion. A torch-lit manifestation in Copenhagen drew tens of thousands of people who lit candles for the victims .

"Jailed for three years: Theressa Morrisroe, 51, of Northampton, made over 80 fraudulent payments over a three-year period while working for a charity . An accounts clerk who defrauded a charity out of more than £100,000 by paying money into her seriously ill father’s bank account has been jailed for three years. Theressa Morrisroe, 51, of Northampton, made more than 80 fraudulent payments over a three-year period while working for the Motor Neurone Disease Association in the town. But she was caught after a supplier contacted the charity about an unpaid invoice last June, with investigations finding the money had been paid into an account belonging to her father. The charity then discovered payments to another 22 suppliers had been siphoned into this account without the knowledge of her father, whom she cared for full-time. Even after leaving the charity in 2013, Morrisroe then went on to defraud a company called Phoenix IT out of more than £24,000. She spent all of the money or gave most it away to family members. Morrisroe pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and was jailed yesterday at Northampton Crown Court. But despite pocketing more than £124,000, Morrisroe was not ordered to pay any compensation or costs after Judge Lynn Tayton heard she had ‘no realisable assets’. Ayesha Bell-Paris, prosecuting, told the court Morrisroe had worked for the MND Association as a purchase ledger clerk between 2006 and 2013. But she abused her position and made 80 fraudulent transactions into her father’s account and her own during a three-year period between 2010 and 2013. Caught: A supplier contacted the Motor Neurone Disease Association (based in Northampton, above) about an unpaid invoice, with investigations finding the cash had been paid into an account belonging to her father . The court heard Morrisroe’s crimes were only uncovered a year after she left the charity. Miss Bell-Paris said: ‘Investigations revealed that 22 different suppliers had made payments into the defendant’s father’s account. Other payments had also been made into her own account.’ A victim impact statement read out to the court from Linda Cherrington, head of finance at the MND Association, said Morrisroe’s crimes had left her colleagues ‘visibly shocked and upset’. She added: ‘All her colleagues at the charity have struggled to believe ""one of the family"" could have so persistently abused her position of trust as a member of the finance team. ‘They have all been rocked and visibly upset by the fact a long-term member of staff - on the surface a conscientious and enthusiastic colleague - could be able to defraud the MND Association out of more than £100,000.’ In her police interview, Morrisroe, who was paid a salary of £22,000 a year at the MND Association, said she had stolen the money because she was suffering financial problems . She also told officers that she ‘hated everyone at the charity as they had been horrible to her.’ Stephen Evans, defending, said the accounts clerk had financial issues and had been supporting her father, brother and son. Sentenced: She pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and was jailed at Northampton Crown Court (pictured) He added: ‘She was someone who felt making the payments to family members would demonstrate she was needed. She is desperately ashamed and knows the gravity of what she did. She has nothing materially as she lives in a rental property. She lives a rather sad, isolated existence.’ The court heard the MND Association has managed to claim back just under £100,000 due to having insurance that covers employee theft. But the charity said almost £10,000 had been spent investigating the fraud which had caused considerable damage to their reputation. Speaking after the case, Martin Gosling, a fraud investigator at Northamptonshire Police, said Morrisroe had committed a ‘heinous crime’. Sally Light, chief executive of the MND Association said: ‘Fortunately, our support for people living with MND was not affected by this fraud and I am pleased to say that the financial loss to the Association was reimbursed by our insurance providers. ‘Our systems have also since then been vigorously externally reviewed and found to be as robust as possible moving forward. I would like to thank everyone who continues to support the MND Association by sharing awareness or by raising vital funds to bring us closer to a cure.’","Theressa Morrisroe, 51, made fraudulent payments over three years .

"It is a sumptuous design more familiar with superyachts than a private jet. But theses renderings show just what £400million will buy you if you're splashing out on a full-size Boeing 747-8 for one person. The aircraft, which would normally carry up to 450 passengers, has been converted into a private jet for an unknown owner with a complete re-design to feature everything you would normally find on board a luxury mega yacht. Scroll down for video . The large seating area of the customised Boeing 747-8 aircraft; the plane has been purchased by an unidentified buyer at a huge cost . The master bedroom offers good space, as well as custom-designed storage units and a chill-out seating area . The floor plan for the Boeing 747-8 plane, including the hideaway 'Aeroloft' that offers the ultimate escape . The plane retails in at around £230million, and the estimated 'improvement' work is an additional £160 million taking the overall expense to almost £400million. And Greenpoint Technologies, who have transformed the plane, have delivered the aircraft to an unidentified private owner after three years of hard graft. Although no photos have been released, the company have shown off digital renderings of the design, and these give an accurate portrayal of the class and luxury inside. The 747-8 can normally cater for around 450 passengers, and is the world's longest passenger jet with a cabin space 20ft wide and 200m in length. That is more than enough room to add in the owner's specifications for the redesign, that included a restaurant, dining room, master and guest bedrooms, two large lounge areas and office space. The VIP lounge offers a chance to relax with a tipple of your choice, with large walkways ensuring you can entertain for groups . The conference room may be where stresses of business are talked through, but it's worth remembering the luxury you are in . The luxurious Boeing 747-8 plane is thought to have cost almost £400million to buy, with the redesign alone costing £160million . Well, the office space is more conference room, and no doubt the owner of such a luxury will be well accustomed to business meetings. The master bedroom will leave you wondering what the fuss was over first class - a sizeable bed in complemented by a chill-out seating area, and with lots of windows, the room is as bright and airy as it is comfortable. The Aeroloft provides private sleeping berths located above the main deck in the aft section of the Boeing 747-8. This area is installed with custom designed interior furnishings and a forward entry staircase. VIP clients appreciate the benefit of providing passengers and guests a private rest area above the main deck for additional relaxation and comfort. Writing on the company website, Bret Neely, vice president of sales, said: 'Being a Boeing-only completion center is a key advantage to our clients. They know we have the technical experience to deliver on our promise.'","Greenpoint Technologies have transformed a Boeing 747-8 and delivered to one unidentified owner .

"Police were today hunting two eight year-old muggers who ripped an 80-year-old woman's bag from her hand as she walked down the road. The elderly victim told police she had just got off a bus in the Sinfin area of Derby when the young thieves struck. She said the two boys were no older than eight or nine years old and were only around 4ft 6in tall. Police were today hunting two eight year-old muggers who ripped an 80-year-old woman's bag from her hand just after she got off a bus on this road in the Sinfin area of Derby . Both were wearing hooded tops with the hoods worn up and ran off down a nearby street with her handbag, which contained her purse, keys, bank cards and a Samsung mobile phone. 'She felt someone pull at her handbag,' a police spokesman said. 'She let go and turned around to see two boys running off with her handbag.' Neighbours living near to where the woman was attacked said a similar incident happened around 18 months ago when teenagers mugged a pensioner in the same area. Mick Smith, 59, said: 'This is absolutely despicable and a cowardly act. There have been anti-social behaviour problems in the past before but that's not involved children, it's been teenagers. 'I find it disgusting that people at that age can do this. It's always bad enough when people are mugged, but being eight or nine is unbelievable. 'At that age what are they going to achieve by doing this? It's not like they are on drugs.' Under the law, children under ten cannot be charged with committing a criminal offence, but they can be given a curfew, or subjected to a  child safety order (file photo) Pensioner Glynne Jones, 73, said he felt sorry for the elderly victim. 'It's hard to take in,' he said. 'Being that age and to do something like that is awful. It's very surprising and terrible. 'It's a nice area here and people do look out for each other and keep tabs on what is happening. 'I can't believe they are walking around unsupervised at their age, that's also what worries me.' Lorry driver Pete Lambert, 47, added: 'It's normally quiet here 99 per cent  of the time. But this is horrific. At that age it isn't right, it's terrible. 'They should be doing normal things that normal children do at that age. I would love to see them caught as soon as possible and held to justice. You always get the odd incident but not when they are this age.' Under the law, children under ten cannot be charged with committing a criminal offence. However, they can be given a local child curfew, banning them from being in a public place between 6pm and 6am - unless with an adult, or a child safety order where they are placed under the supervision of a youth offending team. Under tens who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents could be held responsible. People also took to social media to express their disbelief at the crime. Karen O'Donnell said: 'It's disgusting. Maybe if parents were allowed to chastise their kids, this kind of thing wouldn't happen so often. 'Mine wouldn't because they've been brought up properly. I hope the lady is all right and not too traumatised.' Daniel Vasile said: 'Obviously the parents have failed in their mission to educate their children. Further inquiries need to be made. Those children need attention and care.'","Woman was attacked after getting off a bus in the Sinfin area of Derby .

"Michelle Smart, pictured, allegedly threatened her boyfriend with a gun after he rebuffed her sexual advances over Valentine's Weekend . A South Carolina woman was arrested over Valentine's Weekend after she threatened to shoot her boyfriend who fell asleep after spurning her sexual advances. Michelle Smart, 29, of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is alleged to have threatened Ryan Rucker with his own gun after he refused to have sex with her. Deputies from Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office arrested Smart following the incident on February 15. Smart told police that she had 'attempted to make some sexual advances toward Mr Rucker' but he 'pushed her off him'. She claimed that Mr Rucker had punched and kicked her several times and she was forced to flee the house and sat in a truck outside the $78,000 home. Smart told deputies that her boyfriend had threatened to shoot her, but she did not wish to make a statement. However, according to Deputy Castillo, he and several deputies knocked on the door of the house. In a statement, Deputy Castillo said: 'Mr Rucker came to the door and was not visibly upset. Mr Rucker explained that he was asleep when Ms Smart made sexual advances on him. He stated that he pushed her off and the tow started arguing. 'Mr Rucker stated that the argument escalated and that he followed Ms Smart outside. He stated that Ms Smart got into the truck and that she would shoot him because she has the gun.' Mr Rucker told deputies that he went back into the house because he was in fear for his life, although he did not wish to make a formal complaint against his girlfriend.' According to Deputy Castillo: 'Ms Smart continually was changing her story throughout the investigation. She advised that Mr Rucker had gone walking away when in fact he was inside the house. She stated that she thought he had the gun, and tournd out that the gun in question was in her presence the entire time. 'For these reasons, Ms Smart's account became less believable throughout the investigation.' Deputy Castillo said he arrested Smart for Criminal Domestic Violence of High and Aggravated nature. Deputy Castillo said he recovered Mr Rucker's Ruger hand gun and six bullets and placed them into evidence. Deputies arrested Smart outside this $78,000 house in Spartanburg, South Carolina on Sunday .","Michelle Smart is accused of pulling a gun on her boyfriend after rebuff .

"David Beckham reunited with his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson to watch Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in the French capital today. Beckham, who ascended the stands alongside former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, took up pride of place at the Parc des Princes to watch his former club. The 39-year-old ended his playing career with PSG in 2013, making ten appearances in the French team's Ligue 1 winning campaign. Last laugh: David Beckham shares a joke with Sir Alex Ferguson at the Champion's League match between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital on Tuesday . Beckham also enjoyed successful spells with Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan following his all-conquering spell at Manchester United, where Sir Alex was his manager. The pair enjoyed a close relationship at the start of Beckham's career at the club, but this deteriorated in the early noughties, following his marriage to Victoria. In 2000, Sir Alex allowed Beckham to miss a training to look after a sickly Brooklyn, then one, but after discovering that Victoria had attended a fashion event that evening, the then-ManU manager fined Beckham two weeks' wages and dropped him from a match. Sir Alex argued that David should have attended the training and Victoria look after Brooklyn, and has since publicly blamed the marriage for changed Beckham's 'professional priorities'. 'He was never a problem until he got married,' Sir Alex said during a Q&A session in Glasgow in 2007. Famous football fans: Beckham, ascended the stands ahead of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Support: PSG was Beckham's last club as a professional footballer in 2013, and also enjoyed successful spells with AC Milan, LA Galaxy, Real Madrid and Manchester United . Fun and games: The relationship between Beckham and his former Manchester United boss turned sour in the early nougties, but they appeared to have left their troubles behind at Tuesday's match . THAT boot: Ferguson famously kicked a boot that hit Beckham over the eye, requiring stitches, during a dressing room row in 2003 . 'Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part. The big part is his persona.' The culmination of their feud came in 2003 when Sir Alex kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, requiring him to have stitches. According to Sir Alex, he kicked the boot at Beckham after the player swore at him in the Manchester United changing room following an FA Cup defeat against Arsenal. However, it seems the two have let go of their old issues, as they were seen joking and laughing in the stands at  the Parc des Princes. The former footballer had arrived by train from London after spending the past few days in New York to support his wife Victoria at her Fashion Week show on Sunday. Lone rider: Beckham was dressed all in black as he arrived at Paris' Gare du Nord station today . Heading home: David Beckham with his children Harper, Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn arrive to catch a flight back to London at JFK airport in NYC . Beckham had departed from New York on Monday evening along with his children Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and Harper, but travelled to Paris alone today. His three-year-old daughter has already become a darling of the fashion industry, being hailed as the world's best dressed child after the family's appearance on Victoria's front row. Mrs Beckham herself  had every reason to celebrate after sending a polished and sophisticated collection down the runway, which she described as 'sexy, liberating and full of bounce'. In the hours that followed her show, a steady stream of positive reviews began flowing in, with Women's Wear Daily lauding the star for putting 'an abstract, artful spin on her minimalist polish'. Speaking to The Independent today, Mrs Beckham said: 'I have a different way of expressing myself because I haven't had that formal training. She added: 'I've learnt a lot, in the last seven years. I've learnt a lot very, very quickly. And I continue to learn.'","David Beckham spotted with Sir Alex Ferguson  at the Parc des Princes .

"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is speaking out against partisan politics in Washington - saying that the current  Congress isn't 'equipped really to do anything'. Ginsburg, who was the second woman ever appointed to the Supreme Court, also talked about how she still experiences sexism in the chamber - and said she has no plans to retire anytime soon. While discussing Congress, Ginsburg said she was confident the country would one day get the legislature it deserved. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a recent interview that the current Republican-controlled Congress wasn't 'equipped really to do anything' 'The current Congress is not equipped really to do anything... Someday, we will go back to having the kind of legislature that we should, where members, whatever party they belong to, want to make the thing work and cooperate with each other to see that that will happen,' she told MSNBC. Ginsburg's fighting words should come as no surprise. One of the loudest voices of dissent in conservative Chief Justice John Roberts' court, she has hardly been shy when it comes to expressing her disapproval. But there was a period of time when she said she couldn't make her point of view heard at all. 'Once it happened all the time that I would say something and there was no response and then a man would say the same thing and people would say ""good idea,""' she said. 'That happens much less today.' And Ginsburg, who has beaten two forms of cancer and said she does 20 push ups a day, also has no problem shooting down calls for her retirement based on concerns for her age and health. The eldest sitting justice on the court, Ginsburg described her job as the 'best and hardest' one she's ever had - and she has no intention of letting it go just yet. 'I will step down when I feel I can no longer do the job full steam,' she said. Ginsburg also discussed experiencing sexism in the chamber: 'Once it happened all the time that I would say something and there was no response and then a man would say the same thing and people would say ""good idea,""' ‘Once I sense that I am slipping, I will step down’ But Ginsburg said she has only become more vocal about her opinions as she's aged, saying that, when she was younger, she just accepted that there was nothing she could do about discrimination. But now Ginsburg said she uses her opinions and speeches to try and teach  'how wrong it is to judge people on the basis of what they look like, the color of their skin, whether they're men or women'. 'My aspirations have not changed since the '70s,' she said. 'My hope for our society is that we're going to use the talent of all of the people and not just half of them.' And when it comes to racism, Ginsburg believes society still has a long way to go. 'People who think you could wave a magic wand and the legacy of the past will be over are blind,' she told MSNBC. More recently, Ginsburg made headlines after writing a scathing dissent against the Burwell vs Hobby Lobby case, which allowed corporations to use religious beliefs as a reason to not provide contraception in their health care plans. The justice was especially worried about how the ruling would affect women who now had to pay for their birth control out of pocket. She wrote: 'It bears note in this regard that the cost of an IUD is nearly equivalent to a month's full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage.' Ginsburg said she has only gotten more confident about voicing her opinions as she's aged, saying that, when she was younger, she just accepted that there was nothing she could do about discrimination . But Ginsburg (pictured here with the sitting Supreme Court justices) has become one of the loudest voices of dissent in Chief Justice John Roberts' (center of bottom row) court . Ginsburg voiced similar concerns when discussing how state-enforced abortion laws were especially hurting low-income women. Although Ginsburg was confident that 'women of means' will always have access to safe abortions, she said current state restrictions were operating 'against the woman who doesn't have the freedom to move, to go where she is able to get safely what she wants'. Even as she was happy to voice her opinions on race and women's rights, Ginsburg was careful to keep silent about same-sex marriage, which the court will rule on this year. 'I don't want to suggest how the court will decide that case, one way or another,' she told MSNBC. Ginsburg, who is the first Supreme Court Justice to officiate a same-sex wedding and recently said nationwide marriage equality would not require 'a large adjustment' from Americans, has already come under fire from groups. The National Organization for Marriage demanded that Ginsburg disqualify herself from the upcoming hearings because she had made it 'crystal clear that she is going to rule in favor of redefining marriage when these cases come before her,' a spokesman said. Despite calls to retire so Obama can select her successor, Ginsburg said she has no plans to quit and that she will step down when 'I feel I can no longer do the job full steam'","Ginsburg said one day members of Congress will once again 'want to make things work and cooperate' - despite their party loyalties .

"The art of making a good cup of tea has been perfected over centuries - requiring care, attention and a good degree of patience. For those who have none of these, there are tea bags. But now a new gadget promises to allow those pressed for time to enjoy the delicate flavours that come from a brew made from loose tea leaves. The designers of the Mychai claim it can transform a mug of cold water into a steaming cup of tea in just a few minutes simply by placing it in the water and pressing a button. Scroll down for video . The MyChai, shown above, allows tea lovers to make a brew using loose tea leaves by adding it to cold water . The battery powered device, which is designed to fit inside a handbag or pocket, can heat the water and diffuse the leaves at the press of a button. The device features four different settings that will adjust the brew time according to whether you prefer green tea, black tea, herbal tea or Oolong. Uttara Ghodke, 22, an industrial design student from Pune, near Mumbai in India, has spent two years developing the device. She is now hoping to attract support on the crowdfunding site Behance to develop her prototype into a commercial product. Miss Ghodke, said: 'Being an enormous fan of tea, I always dreamed of owning a portable tea maker which I can carry anywhere. The battery powered device will make two or three cups of tea on a single charge, according to the designer . The device, pictured above, is not yet commercially available but Miss Ghodke hopes to sell it for around £35 . 'I thought why not convert this idea into reality. This is how I came up with the idea of an entirely portable personal tea maker. 'Mychai's portability and its new technology makes it stand out from other products. 'It doesn't involve any electrical connection to work. It operates on a rechargeable battery which will allow for two or three cups to be made on one charge.' Users fill the base of the MyChai with the loose tea leaves of their choice before connecting it to the rest of the device. A thermoelectric material in the stem of the gadget acts as a heating element to warm the water to the required temperature. The diagram above shows how Miss Ghodke expects the MyChai will be used to make tea using loose leaves . Once it reaches the right temperature, a hatch will open to allow the tea leaves to be infused in the water. For black tea it will heat the water to 88 degrees and brew it for three minutes, for green tea the water is heated to 78 degrees C and is brewed for two minutes. Oolong tea is also brewed for three minutes at 99 degrees C while herbal tea uses water at the same temperature for six minutes. Once the brewing time is over, the hatch will close and prevent the leaves from stewing. Miss Ghodke said she hopes to sell the device for around £35 when it gets to market. She said: 'Mychai is a personal, portable tea maker that helps you get your fix anytime, anywhere.' The diagram above shows how Miss Ghodke envisages the hatch to open to allow the leaves to infuse in the water and how different settings can allow users to control the brewing time according to their choice of tea . The British Standards Institution has published official guidelines on how to make the perfect cup of tea. They explain that the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served. For standard black tea, the BSI says that freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F). Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). Regardless of the temperature, the BSI says that tea should be steeped for six minutes. Milk should be added to the cup first before the tea is poured from the pot. At least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot, and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. This helps the milk mix more evenly though the 'liquor' when the tea is added. To make sure the water doesn't scald the milk, the BSI explained that its temperature should not exceed 85°C (185°F), but should be above 60°C (140°F) for optimum flavour and sensation. According to the official best practice guide by London-based British Standards Institution there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml of water used, and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served with milk. At least 2.5ml of milk should be added to a small bowl or cup before the infused water is added .","MyChai allows users to brew tea using loose tea bags with minimum fuss .

"Early morning in a Manhattan apartment, and a camera shot lingers on discarded underwear on the floor before panning to a sleeping couple in bed, two half-drunk glasses of wine on the table beside them. The man rises, dresses, and tiptoes out before pitching up at a photo shoot where he explains to his model friend that he ‘done a little sneak out this morning’. Yes, while the backdrop may be pure Sex And The City, the language in this particular show is rather more The Only Way Is Essex. But then that’s not a huge surprise, given that it’s made in exactly the same mould. Following in the sky-high heels of Towie and Made in Chelsea, Taking New York is the latest in ‘constructed reality’ series, this time following a group of twenty-something Brits as they forge new lives amid the skyscrapers of the Big Apple. Scroll down for video . These Brits abroad are filmed as they work, fight and look for love in the Big Apple in E4's new 'reality' show . And while the architecture might be new – think achingly hip rooftop bars and loft apartments - the content is all too familiar, with squabbles, snogs and slightly contrived friendship dramas the order of the day. And of course, the cast are universally easy on the eye, not in the least because two of them are models: Jamie, a 23-year-old model from Essex (and the culprit who abandons his date in the first shot of the opening episode), and Sumner, 24, who has previously featured in Britain and Ireland’s Next Top Model. Moreover the producers have even managed to nab a couple of achingly pretty blonde identical twins, Amy and Megan Purssey, 26, although in fairness they are also both rather clever too. Both speak fluent French and Amy has a History of Art degree under her belt, while her twin studied Mandarin at London’s SOAS. Little wonder, then, that both are anxious to emphasise that in their view, Taking New York is a cut above the average reality show. Amy said: ‘Yes it’s a reality show but I hope people will think there’s a little bit more to it as well. The young people in this city are so inspirational and everyone works so hard. You can’t drop the ball. You have to be focused and I think that comes across.’ In fact, moving to New York was always Megan’s dream – Amy just got there first after Megan fixed up an internship at a contemporary Chinese art gallery downtown. Two years later, it has turned into a full-time curator role complete with apartment in a fashionable area of Brooklyn with a view of Manhattan’s skyline. Amy Purssey (left) is working in New York while her twin, Megan (right) tries to devise a way to join her . She left her back in Brighton trying to work out how she could join her twin – although we see plenty of her in the show as she visits so often. Amy was the one with the history of art degree, so it was the right thing for her to get that job,’ she said. ‘And us two being twins there’s not a jealous side – I mean as long as one of us wins or comes second that’s what matters.’ Neither had reservations about submitting to the glare of the cameras. ‘To be honest I just thought it sounded like a really good platform for us both,’ said Megan. ‘Initially it did feel a bit strange being followed around by a film crew but you quickly get used to it and by the end we barely even noticed them.’ What, though, about the cringe-worthy prospect of their parents watching their fledgling romances and - whisper it – one night stands unfolding on the small screen. ‘You’ve got to go with it – you can’t be half-hearted when you agree to do a show like this, so it’s warts and all,’ said Megan. ‘I’m okay with it. My parents were totally ‘‘go for it’’. The only thing that will make them cringe will be if they see their daughters kissing a guy – we’re still their little girls and no parent likes that.’ In any event, Amy insists that despite being one half of beautiful British twins they are not overwhelmed with offers. ‘People actually seem to find us a bit intimidating. We are very confident with each other and I think that puts people off so we don’t get approached as much as you might think’. Self-confessed 'posh' cast member Sophie Pape runs her own events business in New York . Their friend and fellow cast member Sophie Pape, meanwhile, admits she did have reservations about taking part in the show – although she is also similarly defensive. Boarding school educated, the 28-year-old self-confessed ‘posh one’ arrived in New York via a few years on women’s magazines in London and now runs her own events business, something she puts down to ‘sheer hard work.’ She said: ‘I came with a couple of hundred of dollars and a bag and the offer of a room for a couple of days in the apartment of a friend’s brother. Three years later I’m still there. 'I’ve worked massively hard to get where I am so obviously I wondered if a reality show would damage that - but then the way I saw it is that like it or not the reality genre is a huge part of our cultural landscape, so why not embrace it? 'I hope people will see that we put a lot into our lives here. We’re not just flitting from cocktail to cocktail.’ In any event, her main dismay having seen an early edit of the first episode is about her appearance. ‘I’ve got the opposite of body dysmorphia in that I’m one of these people who thinks I look pretty great most of the time – you know, I do yoga, I eat kale, how bad can it be?’ she laughed. ‘Then I watched it and thought ""where the hell did I get double chin"". And the humidity didn’t do me any favours hair-wise.’ Sophie is the first to admit that adjustments had to be made: while Taking New York features a whirl of rooftop cocktail bars and openings she says the reality of her life is much harder work. ‘It’s part of the culture here. If someone sends you an email at 11pm not answering it is not an option.’ Then there are the different dating rules. ‘My penchant for American men is my downfall as they tend to date numerous people at the same time. So you’ve been dating someone for two months and you think maybe you are properly going out and they look at you like you’re a psycho. So there’s a degree of hopelessness with boys and my personal life is often in disarray,’ she admitted. All the better, of course, for the series producers, who for whom romantic trauma is a ratings boost. Gagan Chadha, 27, has been in New York since 2010 and is one of the show's many lotharios . Step forward Gagan Chadha, 27, one of the (many) lotharios of the series - a suggestion he appears to be in no hurry to deny. ‘It’s inevitable. I’m surrounded constantly by models so it’s hard not to be,’ he shrugged. ‘Being British definitely helps – the accent and even the way we dress is completely different. They can spot you a mile off.’ In fact, Manchester-born Gagan actually ended up in New York by accident, after attending a wedding there in 2010 and liking the city so much he never came back. ‘I thought if I went home and tried to make a plan to move it would never happen so instead I thought I would just stay. The worst that was going to happen was that I would just have to come back.’ He didn’t have to – within six months he had returned to England, but only to pack up his things for good. After an internship for a hedge fund and a marketing firm he got paid work with an events firm, working his way up before setting up his own printing business and latterly running a bar and club. It helped that he had dual citizenship, courtesy of his family, who for a time were going to move to the US, meaning he had none of the visa trouble that plagues other ambitious young Brits. Still, he insists it wasn’t easy. Hunk Jamie, 23, from Essex is a male model who abandons his date in the first episode .

It all certainly seems to have turned out rosily enough - these days Gagan rents an apartment in the West Village and counts Sarah Jessica Parker as his neighbour. ‘I see her most mornings when she takes her kids to school but it’s really not a big deal.’ It all feels insanely glamorous, what with the fashion parties and gallery openings. Still, Sophie insists there is a lot she misses about life back home. ‘Marks and Spencer, the sense of humour and self-deprecation, which doesn’t exist over here – over here if you do yourself down they assume you need therapy,’ she said. ‘I even miss drizzle.’ Not enough to come back though. Because as Amy puts it, New York is a seductive mistress. ‘It’s like an amazing lover,’ she said. ‘Sometimes it doesn’t treat you well and you know you deserve better - but you can’t deny there’s a chemistry and you always end up going back for more.’ The key question, of course, is whether the viewers will do the same.

"Every woman wants to look their best for their wedding day but one bride went to extreme lengths. Liz Kerslake, 39, from Plymouth, lost five stone and five dress sizes on a grueling calorie restricted diet in a bid to look perfect for her wedding day. The pretty brunette had previously been spurred on to lose weight after a cruel former partner called her 'fat and ugly'. Liz Kerslake from Plymouth dropped five dress sizes after piling on the pounds before her wedding . Liz says she used to have a takeaway every night and would drink a couple of glasses of wine as well . Stunning Liz might now be rocking an athletic eight-and-a-half stone body but, only two years ago, she tipped the scales at a bloated 13st 8lb. But this isn't the first time she's beat the battle of the bulge. During her first marriage Liz, a new home saleswoman, became comfortable and piled on the pounds. She decided to lose the weight however when her hubby insulted her looks, hitting the gym, cutting calories and dropping four stone. And it wasn't just the weight she lost. Liz eventually left her husband behind too and as they were going through their divorce in 2008, she met her now husband Nick. But as their relationship blossomed, 5ft 6in Liz stopped going to the gym and the weight piled on again. Ahead of their wedding last summer, she was determined to get rid of her belly and fit into her sleek white gown. Following her extreme diet which sees Liz have a protein shake for breakfast and nothing for lunch she is now a size eight and happy with her body . Liz wanted to look perfect for her second wedding after her first husband told her she was 'fat and ugly' A newly svelte Liz said: 'I was determined to look the best on mine and Nick's big day. When we got together I'd been hitting the gym four or five times a week. 'I felt really comfortable and stopped exercising but carried on eating the same. The weight piled back on and I was worried I would look bloated on my wedding day.' Liz lost four stone thanks to rigorous calories counting. She met her now husband Nick,  while going through her first divorce in 2008 . In a desperate attempt to shed the inches, Liz signed up to the National Slimming & Cosmetic Clinics (NSCC) weight loss plan. She had heard about her local clinic in Plymouth from a male friend who had lost two stone and looked 'incredible'. Liz said: 'The final push to really do something about my weight came when Nick proposed. We set the date for the summer of 2014 and that gave me a goal. 'Within the first week of signing up with NSC I saw results. As soon as I could see a difference in the way I looked I was looking for reasons to stay on track. 'Before then I had always looked for an excuse to fall off the wagon.' As part of the NSCC plan, Liz visited the clinic every two weeks and met with the manager Karina where they discussed her goals and diet. Due to the demands of her work, Liz very rarely finds time to make it to the gym during the week, but mixed her healthier diet with walking her Chihuahua, Roxy, for up to an hour a day. Liz said: 'I had never snacked and always thought I'd been quite healthy but I could never shift the weight. 'What really worked for me was cutting out carbs. Where I'd normally have bread for breakfast and lunch, I'd swap that for a meal focused on protein.' Liz says she started to see results as soon as she joined up to her slimming club . Liz says cutting carbs is what worked best for her and focusing on meals that had a lot of protein in them . Eight months on from Liz and Nick's glorious wedding, she has managed to maintain her weight loss and feels much healthier. Liz said: 'When I'd tried before I'd eventually put the weight back on, but with NSC I've managed to keep it off. 'Two years on and now married the weight has stayed off. My clinic still support me through the maintenance of my weight loss and continue to make me feel part of a very big and successful family. 'Now I know I can walk into a shop and pick up a size eight dress and know it will fit - the same as buying something online. It's given me so much more confidence.' Breakfast: .

"Two care home workers have been arrested on suspicion of ill-treatment and neglect following the ‘unexplained’ death of an elderly resident – the second in days. A 43-year-old man and a girl of 19 were quizzed by detectives over the death of a 93-year-old woman at Birdsgrove Nursing Home in Bracknell, Berkshire, on February 8. It came days after an 86-year-old woman died at the home on January 31. Police arrested two care home workers after 83-year-old and 93-year-old residents died within days of each other . Police said they are not linking them, but because the two women died within days of each other they have launched a joint investigation with health and safety, health watchdogs and council officials. The staff members were arrested and questioned on suspicion of neglect under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and were released on bail until March 8. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said no other arrests had been made but the investigation was ongoing. Emergency measures have been put in place to make sure there are no risks to other residents at the home, which was criticised in a report by watchdogs two years ago. Detective Sergeant Richard Johnson, from Thames Valley’s protecting vulnerable persons unit, said: ‘The deaths are being treated as unexplained at this time and it is important to stress that although they both involve residents of Birdsgrove Nursing Home, we are not currently linking them.’ Both women died in hospital, it is understood. The home, run by Aster Healthcare, has 76 single rooms and two double rooms in a converted domestic home and two extensions. It provides 24-hour care for the elderly and has a self-contained dementia care unit with 20 beds. A 43-year-old man from Hillingdon, west London and a 19-year-old woman from Bracknell, were questioned and released on bail . Last month an elderly resident was taken to hospital after part of the ceiling collapsed, causing a piece of plaster to hit her on the head. In 2013, the Care Quality Commission launched an unannounced inspection after concerns were raised and ordered the home to improve. It found Birdsgrove was failing in areas including staff training and record keeping and found residents were at risk of malnutrition and dehydration. A report said staff had not been trained how to help those with swallowing difficulties – a common symptom of dementia – or on how to reduce the risks of choking. ‘This meant people were not protected from the risks of inadequate nutrition and/or dehydration,’ the report said. Inspectors also found that many staff had not received food hygiene training. Police, Bracknell Forest Council, the Health and Safety Executive and the health regulator, Care Quality Commission (CQC), began a joint inquiry after the deaths, but police say the deaths are not being linked . A follow-up inspection the same year found the home was meeting all five of the regulator’s safety standards following a number of changes. Relatives yesterday told of their shock at the arrests. Albert Boyling, 85, from Bracknell, whose 82-year-old wife is a resident at the home, said he was spoken to by police and asked if anything ‘weird’ was happening there. He said frail and elderly residents were often left to wander around the building alone but said that, overall, his wife was happy. The CQC said it was working closely with other organisations in response to the ‘tragic’ incidents and warned further action would be taken to protect residents if needed. Adrian Hughes, the watchdog’s deputy chief inspector in the South, said: ‘Measures have been put in place to ensure there are no further risks and we will continue to monitor the situation and if necessary take action to protect the safety and well-being of those living at the home.’ Aster Healthcare, which runs five other care homes, declined to comment yesterday. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","A joint investigation has been launched following deaths of elderly women .

"Spare pair of knickers: tick. Extra pair of tights: tick. Checking the location of public loos along the route I'll be taking today: tick. No, this isn't my plan for when I take my toddler out. It's what I have to do every time I leave the house. Because I'm one of those women you'll see crossing their legs when they're about to cough or sneeze, or who regretfully decline the opportunity to jump on a trampoline with their children. Sound familiar? I expect so - because some estimates say as many as one in three women have ongoing problems with their pelvic floor muscles and incontinence after their first baby. The more babies they have, the more interventions during labour (such as forceps), the bigger any subsequent babies, or the older the mother, the more likely they are to have this problem. Many women have ongoing problems with their pelvic floor muscles and incontinence after their first baby . And yet, despite this being incredibly common, many of these women suffer in silence or, if they do seek help, struggle to get the treatment they need. I'm a typical example. At 48, I've had four children, now aged 20, 18, 16 and 12, and for years I have shamefully kept my secret - that any sudden pressure on my bladder can cause varying degrees of what is euphemistically described as 'leakage'. This condition, known as stress urinary incontinence (SUI), is not to be confused with urge incontinence, or overactive bladder. This is where people have a sudden desire to pass urine and may leak before reaching the loo - thought to be because the bladder gives the wrong messages to the brain. SUI occurs when the pressure in the bladder wall becomes too great for the urethra (the tube through which urine passes) to withstand. It is usually caused by weak pelvic floor muscles, which wrap around the underside of the bladder and rectum, supporting these structures. Some really unlucky souls have both stress and urge incontinence - known as 'mixed incontinence'. Over the past 15 years, I have developed my own strategies for hiding my problem. I know I'll leak if stress is suddenly put on my bladder. So I don't lift heavy bags; I wear pads when exercising; I stand still when I'm about to sneeze. And I never, ever, dance along to Jeff Beck's Hi Ho Silver Lining. This is a lesson learnt from when I wet myself at a wedding - one high kick caused my bladder to give way, and I spent a miserable half-hour in the ladies', stuffing my knickers with tissue to try to dry out. I don't think anyone noticed, but my humiliation makes me blush to this day. Some really unlucky souls have both stress and urge incontinence - known as 'mixed incontinence' Although much can be done to improve the lives of women with such conditions, specialists say that whether or not a woman gets the right help will largely be down to the initial response of her GP. When I finally plucked up the courage to visit a female GP a year ago, I was met with a nonchalant shrug and a, 'What do you expect? You've had four babies'. I was handed a photocopied sheet of pelvic floor exercises and advised to lose some weight - excess weight on the pelvic floor adds to its load and leads to sagging. When I recount this story to Alison Bourne, a women's health physiotherapist at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital, Derbyshire, there is a palpable intake of breath. 'Women who go to their GPs reporting stress incontinence should be referred to units that can provide the specialist pelvic floor training that can vastly improve their lives,' she says. I made a half-hearted attempt to lose weight and do the exercises - which basically involve eight to ten squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles three times a day - but lost interest when I read it would take at least 12 weeks to see a difference. It was only months later, when I heard Katie Mann, a women's health physiotherapist, on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, advising women like me not to take no for an answer, that I returned to my GP. Now, it was my turn to produce a photocopied sheet - information from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, which stressed it should never be considered normal to spend the rest of your life wetting yourself. 'We believe nearly 70 per cent of women report a degree of urinary incontinence during pregnancy,' says Ms Mann, who works in the North-West and specialises in helping women for whom dealing with incontinence has become a way of life. And, after pregnancy, 38 per cent of women experience ongoing problems, according to a survey by Netmums for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Royal College of Midwives. A staggering 75 per cent of those with problems had never sought help for this treatable condition. Indeed, half the 1,900 respondents had never even talked about it. I haven't shared my 'secret' with anyone, not even my husband. And my first GP visit saw me stumbling over my words. Aside from the obvious embarrassment, there's the fact people seem to find it acceptable to laugh at urinary incontinence - Ms Mann cites the Little Britain sketch in which David Walliams' old-lady character empties her bladder at inopportune moments. It is frustrating to see the way the problem is trivialised, says Mark Slack, lead clinician in the department of urogynaecology and pelvic reconstructive surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Much hinges on who women first see when they seek help, he adds. 'A female GP with children of her own is more likely to have read up on the subject and refer you on. But if your first contact is with a 45-year-old, rugby-playing male, your chances of getting the right help are not so good. If the issue is not taken seriously at that first consultation, many women will not return.' All three specialists are adamant these women have every right to be seen by a specialist, whether it's a urogynaecologist or a physiotherapist specialising in pelvic floor muscles. And a sheet of teach-yourself pelvic floor exercises alone is not the answer - expert guidance is needed, as some report not knowing if they are doing them correctly. 'Forty per cent of the women I see respond incredibly well to the exercises - but only when properly taught,' says Mr Slack. For those who don't respond to medication or exercise, surgery is an option (posed by model) Another option is medication - duloxetine, which is usually prescribed alongside exercises, aims to increase the urethra's muscle tone, so it remains closed and contracts more strongly. Devices such as weights or cones can also be placed in the vagina to help train the pelvic floor. While these have their place, say Ms Mann and Ms Bourne, they caution women should only use them under specialist guidance. For those who don't respond to medication or exercise, surgery is an option. Surgery aims to tighten or support the muscles and structures below the bladder. One option is tension-free vaginal tape (TVT), where a sling of synthetic tape is used to support the urethra and bladder neck. But some women report needing the loo more urgently afterwards, or being unable to empty their bladder fully. In some cases, the tape can wear away or break up into fragments and cut into surrounding tissue, causing pain, including during sex. An alternative is colposuspension, which involves making an incision in the lower abdomen, lifting up the neck of the bladder and stitching it in this lifted position. This provides better support for the bladder neck, so it stays closed under pressure. But what of those women reading this who have yet to give birth? Luckily, things have moved on since I had my first child. During that labour, I had an episiotomy, a surgical cut in the perineum, between the vagina and the anus. Research indicates this procedure may be one of the risk factors for stress incontinence, and the rate of episiotomies has dropped from 55 per cent in the Seventies to 15 per cent today. It was originally thought such a cut could help women avoid pelvic floor problems, by preventing serious tears extending into the anal muscle. However, it's thought the body is actually designed to tear naturally away from the sphincter during labour. Thankfully, experts agree it's never too late to put this condition right. For a start, a 10 per cent weight loss in overweight women results in a 50 per cent improvement in symptoms, says Mr Slack. After returning to my GP, I was referred to a group session at my local hospital last month. We were talked through correct pelvic floor exercises and will each have a personal follow-up appointment with a continence nurse to check our technique. If I haven't got the hang of things by then, I'll be offered further instruction until the right treatment for me is found. If all goes to plan, you won't keep me off the trampoline this summer.

"A pregnant mother-of-11 who split with her husband after he struck up an online relationship with another woman has taken him back – and wants even more children with him. Cheryl Prudham, who gets £39,000 a year in handouts from the taxpayer, said: ‘We’re good at making babies. ‘I’ve asked Robert to have his vasectomy reversed because being apart made me realise I want more children. ‘And I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’ Scroll down for video . Broody: Cheryl Prudham, who is five months pregnant with her 12th child, has rekindled the love with husband Robert - and they're planning on expanding their brood even more by reversing his vasectomy . Last month Mrs Prudham, 32, said that Robert – the father of her five youngest children – had left her on several occasions for other women during their six years together. His most recent indiscretion was sending indecent messages to a woman on Facebook. His wife vowed just three weeks ago to never forgive him. But after she spoke out on her plight as a single mother, the couple are back together and planning children 13 and 14 – because 13 is an ‘unlucky’ number. Mrs Prudham says her 29-year-old husband has sworn to her that he is a changed man, and that they want to renew their wedding vows. They plan to hold the ceremony after Mrs Prudham gives birth in July. The couple have been told the baby is a girl. In her latest interview, Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine: ‘Robert said he’s sorry and we ended up in bed together because we love each other. ‘He has admitted to sleeping around in the past but he said this time he had only been messaging a woman on Facebook. ‘I believe him – he broke down and cried... he’s never done that before. I’m not making excuses but he tends to cheat when I’m pregnant. I don’t really want sex as much then as I just feel fat.’ Cheryl claimed last month that husband Robert, the father of her five youngest children, had left her on several occasions for other women during their six years together . The Prudhams, from Gravesend, Kent, have previously caused public outrage because of the huge sums they get from the Government for their ever-expanding brood. The family claim £39,192 a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000. They have managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year benefits cap because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. Cheryl announced the news of her twelfth baby on Facebook . They live in a five-bedroom semi-detached council house but are on the waiting list for a seven-bedroom home because their current accommodation is ‘too cramped’. The Prudhams have been looking into vasectomy reversals on the NHS but have determined they will have to cough up £2,000 to have the procedure carried out privately. Mrs Prudham said: ‘It will be worth every penny.’ She had her first son, George, when she was 17 and living in a homeless hostel. She moved into a flat with her then boyfriend and had another son and a daughter. Three unplanned pregnancies followed, before she met Mr Prudham in March 2009. Within months of their first date, they were engaged and she was pregnant. But two weeks before their wedding, he cheated for the first time. The wedding went ahead when Mrs Prudham was eight months pregnant. She said last month: ‘I was desperate to have a more stable family life and give the kids a home with a mum and a dad – something I’d never had but always craved.’ But six months after saying their vows, she claims Mr Prudham walked out, telling her he needed space. He returned three weeks later. Mrs Prudham said: ‘My friends think I’m mad but Katie Price [the former glamour model] took back her husband after he cheated.’","Cheryl Prudham, 32, has taken husband back and wants more children .

"Roberto Mancini knows his second coming at Internazionale will be a whole lot tougher than his first after this Milan derby. Where previously he commanded players the calibre of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Patrick Vieira in a league shorn of Juventus, his squad now are not at that level and Juventus reign supreme. He returned to the San Siro dugout, where he won three Serie A titles and two Coppe Italia before his sacking in May 2008, more experienced from his time at Manchester City. He will need all his nous to send Inter to the summit once more. In his first match since taking over from Walter Mazzarri, Mancini oversaw a 1-1 draw here, in an encounter that was low on quality. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: AC Milan 1-1 Inter Milan .

Booked: Obi, Juan Jesus . Manager: Roberto Mancini 6.5 . Ref: Marco Guida 7 . MoM: Menez . Att: 79,173 . It did include a wonderful goal from Jeremy Menez in the 23rd minute. The French international applied a cushioned volley of exquisite technique to Stephan El Shaarawy’s cross to send the ball past Samir Handanovic with pinpoint accuracy. Credit to Michael Essien for the clever pass that unleashed El Shaarawy. Joel Obi found an equaliser that Mancini’s side deserved in the second half, to leave both Milan teams with a point that neither will really savour. Rather like Arsenal versus Manchester United on Saturday evening, this was a match between two once proud title challengers reduced to hopefuls for their country’s final Champions League place. It was eighth versus ninth, each far back from leaders Juventus, who look likely to run away with this Scudetto as they did the last. Inter won most recent of their five successive Serie A titles (the first awarded when Juventus were stripped due to the Calciopoli scandal) in 2010, when Jose Mourinho left for Real Madrid. They have had six permanent managers since but zero trophies, now turning once more to Mancini. AC last won the Scudetto under Massimiliano Allegri in 2011 and this year replaced Clarence Seedorf with his former teammate Filippo Inzaghi following poor results. Neither Milan club finished in the top four last season. But while the football may not be what it once was, the atmosphere remains fearsome. Rival ultras at either end of this shared stadium produced impressive banners before kick-off and kept the flag-waving and noise going throughout the match. Inside the first three minutes, each set of supporters bayed for a penalty. Inter cried loud as Mauro Icardi fell, AC when Michael Essien went down. The cat calls were sent Icardi’s way in the eighth minute when the Inter striker missed a glorious chance. Obi's exuberant celebration went on as he capped off a nice move to slot home to level the scores . Menez's team-mates piled on top of him after the Frenchman gave the hosts the lead with his measured finish . Sulley Muntari, who played in Inter’s 2010 Champions League final success, must have thought he still wore Milan blue rather than red – carelessly placing a pass straight to the 21-year-old Argentine that allowed him bear down on goal. But as Icardi approached the area his confidence seemed to ebb away and Diego Lopez, an experienced goalkeeper, managed to block his tame finish before Philippe Mexes scrambled the ball clear. Dozens of AC fans in the Curva Sud raced from their seats to mock their rival player nearby. Icardi would fare no better nine minutes after the interval, when the ball came his way in the area after a goalmouth scramble that should have seen Inter equalise, only for him to balloon the ball high over the bar. With 12 minutes remaining Icardi found space in the area to arrive onto a cross from the right but sent his shot onto the top of the crossbar. He was not the only striker who struggled, however. Fernando Torres continues to perform with nothing like the drive and ruthlessness that characterised his glory years at Liverpool. Escaping from Chelsea on loan, this was supposed to offer the freedom he never really found at Stamford Bridge. There was little evidence of that. At one stage in the first half he had the chance to run at Brazilian defender Juan Jesus but lacked conviction and was easily dispossessed. The Spaniard was replaced by Keisuke Honda after 72 minutes. Roberto Mancini waves to the gathered group of photographers ahead of the Milan derby in his first game back in charge at Inter .

Even Nemanja Vidic, who Torres used to terrorise in England, would have fancied his chances had he made it from the bench. That the former Manchester United captain failed to feature here undermines to some degree the accusations his departure from Old Trafford was shocking mismanagement. Inter were the better side up until AC took the lead but found an equaliser just after the hour mark. Obi wriggled past Essien on the edge of the area and swept a left foot shot that angled inside the far post and beyond the dive of 6ft 5in Lopez. No such composure from El Shaarawy in the 75th minute. Menez seized on a heavy touch from Juan Jesus to send the AC winger clean through but, at the same end where Icardi missed, he lifted his finish too high and the ball clipped the crossbar and went over. At the death Andrea Poli almost won it for AC but his deflected shot trundled just wide. Mancini could head down the tunnel with a smile.

Tell-tale: Rooney referenced the capture of Mata as proof that United can still sign the best players . ‘This . is a new era for the club. We have a new management team and a great . new manager in David Moyes – there has to be some time for change. ‘We . have some great players here and despite our recent form everyone has . stuck together and the team spirit is still good. We will continue to . work hard and get Manchester United to the top where it belongs.’ Persuading . Rooney to stay represents Moyes’s greatest victory as United manager so . far. On Wednesday night he insisted that the club were always in control of . the situation despite the speculation surrounding Rooney’s future last . summer. ‘As far as I was . concerned it was never in doubt,’ said Moyes. ‘The way I looked at it, . this football club was never selling Wayne Rooney. Never. ‘The one thing I’ve found about Manchester United is that they decide what players go when they want them to go. ‘The players won’t control that no matter who comes to the club. The club will always be in control of that.’ The . new deal is also expected to mean that Rooney succeeds Nemanja Vidic as . captain next season, although Moyes said that the decision will not be . made until the summer. He . revealed that he met Rooney in secret on two occasions before starting . his new job last July after the striker had been frozen out by Ferguson. Thumbs up! The deal is thought to be for five-and-a-half years, representing a massive win for David Moyes . Improvement: Rooney has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season, and has improved in all areas . 1. Sir Bobby Charlton (1953-73) - 249 goals in 758 appearances . 2: Denis Law (1962-73) - 237 goals in 404 appearances . 3: Jack Rowley (1937-55) - 211 goals in 424 appearances . 4: Wayne Rooney (2004 - present) - 208 goals in 430 appearances . 5: George Best (1963-74) - 179 goals in 470 appearances . Moyes . added: ‘I said to Wayne that I wanted him to stay before I’d actually . come in here. I’d met Wayne privately a couple of times to talk about . his situation, to try to understand. ‘He . came up to my house and I said to him, “if you ask me what’s missing I . think you’ve gone a bit soft”. I thought he hadn’t been the . hard-working, aggressive player he was. I needed to try to get him back . to that level. ‘When he came . into the team I felt as though he nearly had to re-invent himself . again. Go back to being the old Wayne Rooney, fighting for everything . that’s there but with the technical ability of a top player. ‘I . think he’s done that. He’s back, he’s showing leadership qualities and . he’s shown exactly what it is to play for Manchester United. ‘I’ve . heard people saying he wouldn’t be here at different times but, as you . know, football deals don’t get done quickly now. I’ve probably known for . three or four months that this would probably happen. In fact, I’ve . felt it since August.’ Break: Rooney's wife Coleen pictured in Barbados on a holiday with sons Kai and Klay . Say cheese! Coleen and Klay smile for the camera while Wayne finalises his £300k-a-week deal at Old Trafford . Moyes . was in charge at Everton when Rooney signed his first professional . contract, and admitted that there was ‘a bit of déjà vu’ when they posed . for photographs on Friday. Despite . a poor first season in charge, Moyes believes that Rooney’s decision to . sign a new contract is a clear sign that he trusts the Scot to be a . success at United and attract some of the world’s top players to Old . Trafford. ‘I always felt some day our paths would cross again and they have,’ said Moyes. ‘He . knows by the way I train, by the way I work, by my determination to . succeed that I won’t allow this to go the way it is. I'll make changes . if it doesn’t improve. Secured: Moyes has drawn the very best out of Rooney this season, but his future had been in doubt still . ‘I . said to you as well, and you’ll get to know when I say it I mean it, . that we’d be in for all the best players in the world – and that hasn’t . changed. ‘All the top . players want to play for Manchester United. I can’t tell you the amount . of phone calls I’ve had from top players around the world who want to . play for Manchester United.’ Now . Moyes believes that Rooney can go on to achieve legendary status at Old . Trafford and elevate himself alongside United greats like George Best . and Sir Bobby Charlton. ‘To . be a legend at Manchester United it is something where you are . associated with this club for the rest of your life,’ he said. ‘For Wayne, I think he’s recognised people like Bobby Charlton George Best and the way those big stars are seen here. Bobbing! David Moyes took training in a club bobble hat while Rio Ferdinand grinned from ear to ear . Main man: The England striker has been a standout for the Reds this season in trying circumstances . ‘Wayne’s next thing is that we have to keep challenging him to get those goals and make those big targets.’ In . order to make sure that he gets the most out of the remaining years of . his career, it has been agreed that United’s commercial department will . take over the handling of his endorsement contracts from now on. For . example, Rooney’s deals with companies like Nike and Samsung will now . become the responsibility of the club, meaning that the England striker . will now have one of the biggest football clubs on the planet . effectively working on his behalf to maximise his earnings. It had looked as if the 28-year-old would be leaving for pastures new last summer, with Chelsea keen to land the England man.","Manchester United announce Wayne Rooney's new contract .

"Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky. Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll. The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough. What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations . The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years. In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly. Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients. Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently. Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com. But in  the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin. What children in other countries eat (clockwise from top left): Ukraine's version of sausage and mash; Brazil's plantains, rice and black beans; beetroot salad and pea soup in Finland and steak with beans and carrots in France (photo courtest Sweetgreen) South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina . The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland. The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David, . Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'. Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page. Mary's Meals  - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America. The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren. While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items. Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow. Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink .

Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes (courtesy Sweetgreen) In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish . School lunch in Alba, Spain (left):  white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas . In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie. This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans. And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones  tucking into kiwi fruit and apples. The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive. A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage. In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries. South Korean children tuck into broccoli and peppers, fried rice with tofu, fermented cabbage and fish soup .

Rice, a chicken croquette, a piece of taro root and yellow pea soup is the school lunch in Old Havana, Cuba . In Japan, school children tuck into fried fish, dried seaweed, tomatoes, miso soup with potatoes, rice (in the metal container), and milk . A plump portion of lightly fried fish sits atop rocket salad in the Italian lunch tray. This is accompanied by a small portion of pasta, a simple caprese salad of tomatoes, mozzarella and basil, a crusy roll and a bunch of grapes. Most of the schools have kept to traditional foods for the school lunch. Children in Spain start their meal with cold tomato soup, gazpacho, served with shrimp and brown rice. This is served with a seeded roll, peppers with red cabbage and half an orange for dessert. Children in Greece have baked chicken with orzo, stuffed grape leave, cucumber and tomato salad, yoghurt with pomegranate seeds and oranges. Wholesome: Seeded roll, shrimp with brown rice, gazpacho and tri-colour peppers. Dessert is half an orange . A serving of borscht (beetroot soup) with pickled cabbage, sausages and mash.

Traditional South American food such as rice with black beans, baked plantains and pork with vegetables are on offer for Brazilian children. They also had a side serving of salad and bread with their meal. In Ukraine children feast on mashed potato, sausages, borscht, cabbage and syrniki, a type of dessert pancake. US school lunches feature fried popcorn chicken with ketchup, mashed potatoes, peas, a fruit cup and a chocolate chip cookie.

"The extreme winter weather that hit the South on Sunday and Monday is making its way up the coast, and has already succeeded in shutting down the federal government. All government offices in Washington DC were closed on Tuesday due to the dangerous blend of snow and ice that has made travel increasingly difficult. And while the storm is slowly making its way out of the South, its effects are still being felt by the 330,000 people who are without power in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Scroll down for videos . A plow removes snow from the White House driveway as all federal government offices in Washington, DC, have been closed . Snow covered ice is seen on the Hudson River outside of Pier 92 and 94 in New York City . A front-loader clears snow from a parking lot at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia . State police work the scene of an overturned car on I-95 near NC-87  in Fayetteville, North Carolina . A cat walks through snow on Tuesday  in Tasley, Virginia . The storms has also forced the cancellation of over 1,000 flights, and left hundreds stranded due to the icy roads. NBC News reports that the worst hit was Coleman, Kentucky, where 18 inches of snow fell, and Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, where a ¾-inch coating of ice was reported. The ice also became a huge problem for Lauren Adamski of Cabot, Arkansas as she and her husband David drove to the hospital Sunday night after her water broke. Because of the ice on the roads the two did not make it in time, and Adamski gave birth in her truck. In the end, the couple had a healthy baby boy they named Brennan. In New Jersey, one unlucky plow even fell into a sinkhole, becoming almost entirely swallowed up. It happened in Lopatcong Township early Tuesday, and the driver, while shaken, was able to get out, and after being taken to the hospital he was quickly released. The South will be hit again on Thursday with snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures expected in parts of Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. Nashville, Tennessee could even reach a record low of -13F, the coldest since 1871. These temperatures could turn into an even bigger problem should power not be restored to some 330,000 homes and business that are in the dark. Boston residents continue to have it the worst though, and now there are new problems as some people have not been following a new order put in place that guarantees any resident who shovels out a parking spot the right to keep it for 48 hours. One person got revenge on someone who took their spot by dumping snow all over their car, and posting the photo online. Residents in Washington DC also took some time to have a little fun on Tuesday, with a massive snowball fight in Meridian Hill Park. 'That was a lot of fun and I figured, heck, why not do it this year. Just this time in costume,' said Colin Lawrence, clad head to toe in a Captain America get-up. 'Good times. Everybody's having a good time.' The cold weather will only get worse in some areas later this week .

Meanwhile, a passenger on an Amtrak train heading between New York City to Boston filmed the sub-zero conditions between carriages due to Winter Storm Neptune. The passenger filmed the Arctic conditions between the carriages on the train service. In the video, the passenger opens the passageway door and enters the freezing area. The passenger pans their camera around to show how all the surfaces are covered in a dusting of frost. There also appears to be snow on the floor - despite the windows being closed.

Traffic moves slowly along an icy Interstate 485 in Charlotte, North Carolina . Despite the unusual conditions on board the train and the freezing conditions along the East Coast, unseasonably warm temperatures across the rest of the country mean the U.S. is experiencing one of its warmest winters on record. Almost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January, while parts of the East Coast, including New York and Boston are continuing to be battered by a freezing storm system. In this month alone thousands of warm weather records have been broken as high temperatures across the western states contributes to what is now the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. The West is experiencing temperatures which have contributed to the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. Pictured is Lake Success, near East Porterville, California, where drought conditions are worsening . The East Coast storm system - which follows a weekend storm that dumped a staggering 16.5 inches of snow on Boston - is set to hit the South . So far this month there have been 4,074 records set for warm temperatures across the West, USA Today reported. This includes hot weather records in Seattle, San Jose, Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City. Remarkably, the average February temperature in Salt Lake City is 16.4 degrees above average, while Boise is up 12.2 degrees and Phoenix 8 degrees. A Delta jet is deiced early Tuesday at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina . As the door slides open, an Amtrak passenger was confronted with sub-zero conditions in the passageway . Amazingly, as well as being covered in ice, the area appears to have its own fog problem . Last month, the West, Rocky Mountains and Northern and Central Plains were all warmer than average, with many maintaining hot temperatures that placed the month among their top ten warmest averages. Incredibly, San Francisco had no measurable rainfall during January, while the state of California itself had its fourth-driest ever January. As well as remaining unseasonably warm, much of the West continues to suffer drought conditions. Nearly all of Hawaii was drier than average, with drought expanding to 46.6 per cent of the state, according to the National Climatic Data Center. And although the drought improved in parts of the Southern Plains and Southwest, it worsened in the West and Midwest. While storms in early December gave farms in California a boost, temperatures across the state remain unseasonably high . A further six two 12 inches of snow is expected to hit the East Coast over the next several days . Temperatures forecast for Thursday show the blizzard hitting parts of the East while the West remains warm . The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people. In contrast to the big dry in the West, Winter Storm Octavia - which follows a weekend storm that dumped 16.5 inches of snow on Boston over the weekend - is now set to pummel the South. Residents in Boston have battled through 16.5 inches of snow while New Yorkers are preparing for another six inch-dumping. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Washington DC was bracing for between four to eight inches of snow, according to USA Today . Mayor Muriel Bowser told CNN's 'The Situation Room' that the weather was 'dangerous cold'. Federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday. Father south, up to a foot of snow was forecast in Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, where Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a statewide emergency. The bad weather will also hit states as far south as Kentucky and Tennessee bring heavy snow fall . Residents have been advised to avoid non-essential travel, while thousands of children in the region are missing school for a second day running . Kentucky and Tennessee were also preparing to be battered by the storm, which could dump more than a foot of snow on each state. As many as 50 million people were in the path of the glacial weather, which will see temperatures far more frigid than normal, the National Weather Service warned, adding that the misery was forecast to last through much of the week for the eastern US. 'Incredibly, another arctic front will arrive to the East Coast by Wednesday night, and this will bring some truly frigid conditions with it,' it said. ' 'Some places from the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic may see some of the coldest weather since the mid-1990s! Numerous record low temperatures are expected.' Southern states not used to such cold weather were also hit. The storm followed a track from eastern Kansas through Tennessee and West Virginia to the mid-Atlantic Coast, the New York Times said. Most of the affected areas can expect a snowstorm about once a year. But states like Kentucky were seeing snowfall well above average, said Jim Hayes, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center in Maryland. Weather forecasters warned that temperatures were set to plunge to -18F in Erie, Pennsylvania . 'This is going to be a big event for them,' he said. 'They don't get that much snowfall very often,' he said, according to the Times. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said that after a series of mammoth storms in recent weeks it could take up to a month to restore the ageing system to full operation, if no more storms blow in. Boston braced for one to six inches more of snow, forecasters said, according to the Boston Globe. Snowfall amounts of six to 12 inches were anticipated in much of the mid-Atlantic, which includes Washington DC as well as New York City some 200 miles to the north. US forecasters said the storm will buffet a wide swath of the eastern United States with snow, gale-force winds and brutal cold. Among the cities expected to be hardest hit by the temperature plunge are Erie, Pennsylvania, where thermometers are expected to fall to minus 28 degrees Celsius and Cleveland, Ohio, with minus 22 degrees Celsius. The Flightaware air travel website said that some 1,500 flights had been cancelled by midday Monday, before the latest bout of inclement weather had been felt. February has set a record as the snowiest month ever in Boston, with 10 times the snowfall it would get in a typical winter. With the snowstorm expected to at least brush New England's most populous city, mountains of snow piling up were likely to grow even higher. 'No end appears in sight as to the brutal winter we have experienced,' the NWS wrote in its Boston forecast.","The rare blend of snow and ice that ravaged the South on Monday has shut down the federal government at all Washington, DC, offices .

"A cat owner was left stunned after receiving a phone call to say her missing tabby had been found just 20 miles away from her home - eight years after he went missing. Susan MacDonald, 49, was left distraught when Malcolm the cat disappeared from her home in Rockbeare, near Exeter, in Devon in 2007  - 66 years ago in cat years. Mrs MacDonald had owned Malcom, a tabby with white patches, since he was a kitten and frantically searched the entire village for him following his disappearance. Susan MacDonald (pictured with Malcolm) was left stunned when she received a phone call last week to say her beloved tabby cat had been found - eight years after he disappeared from her home in Rockbeare in 2007 . She posted leaflets around the village but eventually gave up hope and moved away to the Greek island of Crete. She recently moved back to the village and was left stunned after receiving a phone call last week to say Malcolm had finally been found. He was discovered wandering the streets of Cullompton, just 20 miles away, by vet Maureen Hutchison who scanned his microchip and immediately contacted Mrs MacDonald. Mrs MacDonald, who works with autistic adults, was reunited with her wandering pet on Saturday and said he was exactly the same as when he went missing  - but a bit fatter. Malcolm the travelling cat (pictured) was reunited with his owner after his microchip was scanned . She said: 'My life has changed so much since he went missing. He was my daughter's cat but she has grown up and now lives in Iowa. 'Malcolm is quite famous over there now. I was devastated when he disappeared - he was very happy. 'I don't think he would have deliberately strayed. I feel he probably got in a car or something like that and ended up being adopted. 'But how he suddenly reappeared after eight years I don't know. 'I often used to think about him - it was the not knowing that I didn't like.' 'I could not believe it. You never think you are going to find your animal eight years later. She said Malcolm, now aged 11, was 'full of kisses' and a 'laid-back, loving cat'. 'He doesn't remember me, however much that hurts. He has been gone for eight years, that's about 64 years in a cat's life. 'He is just how I remember him but a little more rotund.' Vet Mrs Hutchison, who found Malcolm, said: 'He has obviously been doing very well for himself the last eight years and is certainly well fed. 'If cats could speak I'm sure he'd have a tale to tell.' Pet microchips contain a unique identification number which is linked to a database containing details of the pet, as well as the owner's contact details.

"FIFA is facing the prospect of losing two of its biggest sponsors after airline Emirates decided not to renew its contract and electronics giant Sony also considering ending its links with the world governing body. The confirmation comes four months after a number of FIFA's official World Cup partners expressed concerns about the negative publicity surrounding the latest allegations of corruption. Emirates' contract expires next month and the Dubai-based airline has confirmed it will not renew its sponsorship. FIFA said it has known of the decision since 2012. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is facing the prospect of losing two of the organisation's biggest sponsors . It is understood Qatar Airways - owned by 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar - is considering becoming a sponsor in its place. FIFA confirmed that Emirates will not be renewing its deal and that talks are ongoing with Sony. Samsung, which is a major Olympic sponsor, may take over from Sony. Both Emirates and Sony are among FIFA's official partners - the six top tier sponsors who provided hundreds of millions of pounds in sponsorship income to the world governing body. FIFA said in a statement to the Press Association: 'Emirates had already informed FIFA back in June 2012 about the restructuring of its sponsorship concept and FIFA respects this. Due to the ongoing negotiations, we cannot give any further information about future partners in this category at this stage. 'The current contract with Sony still runs until 31 December 2014 and we are currently in on-going discussions with Sony.' Emirates also confirmed its plans, saying in a statement: 'Emirates can confirm that a decision has been made not to renew the sponsorship agreement with FIFA past 2014. This decision was made following an evaluation of FIFA's contract proposal which did not meet Emirates' expectations.' In June, a number of partners including Sony made public their concerns about the effect of continuing negative publicity around FIFA. It followed publication of fresh allegations of corruption surrounding World Cup voting and elections for FIFA positions. Conservative MP Damian Collins wants Chuck Blazer (above) investigated for alleged World Cup bidding fraud . Adidas, the sportswear firm which is perhaps FIFA's most important partner and has a deal until 2030, said at the time: 'The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners.' Japanese electronics giant Sony said in June the corruption claims should 'be investigated appropriately' and called for FIFA to observe 'its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play'. FIFA earned more than £230 million from sponsors and other marketing partners last year. Meanwhile, a Conservative MP has called for the Serious Fraud Office to investigate World Cup bidding after claims that the FBI persuaded a FIFA executive to bug his meetings during the London 2012 Olympics. Damian Collins says reports that Chuck Blazer agreed to take a tiny, secret microphone into meetings with other football officials should persuade the SFO to investigate. The New York Daily News reported that Blazer, the American former FIFA executive committee member, agreed to take a bug hidden inside a key ring into meetings, some of which took place in London. He was under investigation by the FBI and tax authorities for millions in unpaid taxes, the newspaper said. Those he invited to the meetings included Russia 2018 organising committee chief Alexei Sorokin and Frank Lowy, the head of the Australian 2022 bid, but it is not known whether they did actually meet Blazer. The SFO said last week it does not have the jurisdiction to investigate World Cup bidding but Collins believes the latest reports on the FBI should make it reconsider. Collins told Press Association Sport: 'If the FBI investigation includes meetings that Chuck Blazer held in London during the Olympics, then that should come under the jurisdiction of the SFO.' US attorney Michael Garcia has finished his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. England also bid for the 2018 tournament but was eliminated in the first round of voting. Garcia's report is now being studied by the head of FIFA's ethics adjudicatory chamber, German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, but he has said he will not publish it in full. Collins wants the SFO to demand FIFA send it a copy of the Garcia report.","Emirates' contract expires next month and the Dubai-based airline has confirmed it will not renew its sponsorship .

The family-run firm was issued with a compulsory purchase order (CPO) in 2012, but argues that the Premier League club is unlawfully trying to force it out of the premises, according to submissions from the company to the High Court. Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham Hotspur need for their stadium development is arguing at the High Court that the compulsory purchase order it has been issued with is unlawful . Archway was issued with a compulsory purchase order (CPO) in 2012, but argues this is invalid, and is asking a judge to quash the enforcement which would enable the club to buy the 25,000 sq ft site . Archway, which is owned by Tottenham fan Josif Josif, 46, was gutted by fire in a suspected arson attack, and Mr Josif says his firm has been subjected to bomb threats. The London Borough of Haringey made the compulsory purchase order in March 2012 and it was confirmed by the Communities Secretary in July 2014 following a public inquiry. The company argues that the compulsory purchase order is invalid, and is asking a High Court judge to quash the enforcement which would enable the club to buy the 25,000 sq ft site. If the application succeeds it would be a major blow to the controversial plans for the new stadium complex. As well as challenging the legality of the CPO itself, Archway argues that proposed new changes to the Spurs project have come to light which are so substantial that they 'alter the viability case made at the inquiry' and further undermine the order. The new proposals involve 'massive intensification of the scheme' - making it substantially different from the project for which the CPO was obtained. Tottenham, who take on Fiorentina in the Europa League this Thursday, already has planning permission for the new 56,000-plus capacity stadium it hopes to open for the 2018/19 season (artists impression) Archway (pictured) argues that proposed new changes to the Spurs project have come to light which are so substantial that they 'alter the viability case made at the inquiry' and further undermine the order . Christopher Lockhart-Mummery QC, appearing for Archway, is submitting to the judge that an application for disclosure of documents held by Tottenham Hotspur Ltd has revealed the extent of the changes. The QC said in written submissions that the Premier League Club dismissed these as matters of 'minutiae' within 'a sea of detail' which was 'irrelevant'. However, the Tottenham documents in fact revealed discussions had taken place involving an updated design of the Spurs stadium and increasing its capacity by 5,000. Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also say they have received 'bomb threats' Mr Justice Dove, who has revealed he is an Aston Villa fan, has been told by Archway lawyers that the police are currently investigating a suspected case of arson . Other potential improvements included an increase in residential development, incorporating 900 units in five blocks, plus 60,000 square feet of commercial development space and a medical centre and a 30,000 square feet gym and fitness centre. Mr Lockhart-Mummery says the proposals reveal the scheme is now potentially on 'a substantially different scale', raising substantial new issues as to its viability. Discussion of the new proposals, says the QC, have taken place between Haringey Council and Tottenham Hotspur Ltd and representatives 'at high levels of Government', including UK Trade and Investment and HM Treasury, as well as the Greater London Authority (GLA) and Transport for London. The owners of the firm have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans . Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. Mr Justice Dove, who has revealed he is an Aston Villa fan, has been told by Archway lawyers that the police are currently investigating a suspected case of arson. The owners say they have received 'bomb threats'. Mr Josif who runs the family business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.' The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry. The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry . The owners have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans. Tottenham want to build the new capacity stadium next to the existing White Hart Lane ground, where they have played since 1899, which holds just over 36,000. Spurs hope that moving to a larger, state-of-the-art stadium with an increased capacity will help bring in more revenue, making it easier to compete with top European clubs. North London rivals Arsenal moved into their 60,272-capacity Emirates Stadium in 2006. The club, who take on Fiorentina in the Europa League this Thursday, already has planning permission for the new stadium it hopes to open for the 2018/19 season, after Archway's move to challenge the decision in the High Court resulted in a revised construction programme. The club was said to be considering moving to a temporary home for a season during the construction period. Options mooted included Wembley and the Olympic Stadium, while reports of a move to stadium:mk in Milton Keynes were met unfavourably by many fans. A Tottenham club spokesman said: 'We have already successfully and amicably relocated more than 70 businesses in the area to the satisfaction of all parties concerned and a number of these organisations continue to reside in the borough. 'Whilst we were able to accommodate all these other businesses' requests, in the instance of Archway, we have been unable to reach agreement over the period of the last seven years.'","Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd fighting compulsory purchase order .

"A Royal Navy warship intercepted a Russian military vessel that strayed close to Nato-protected waters in the Baltics in an echo of the Cold War. HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, was taking part in a multinational exercise off the Danish coast when she was dispatched to investigate an unidentified surface ship picked up on radar. Despite choppy seas and 30 knot winds, the crew identified the unknown ship as the 104-metre-long Steregushchiy-class frigate RFS Soobrazitelny skirting Danish waters as it sailed west in the Baltic Sea. Dispatched: HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, was taking part in a multinational exercise off the Danish coast when she was sent to investigate an unidentified surface ship picked up on radar . Identified: The 104metre-long Steregushchiy-class frigate RFS Soobrazitelny, a Russian warship, appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters . As HMS Montrose closed with the Russian vessel, a Russian Ilyushin IL-20 ‘Coot’ maritime patrol aircraft was detected and appeared overhead, circling the two ships. It was one of the Royal Navy’s most significant encounters with Russian warships in the region since the Ukraine crisis began. Navy chiefs said the show of strength demonstrated Nato’s resolve to protect its 28 members against any threat from the Kremlin. Both the Russian vessel and aircraft appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters. Commander James Parkin, commanding officer of HMS Montrose, said: ‘All our interaction so far has been professional, and effective, and we have gained huge benefit from working so closely with our allies in such a busy and challenging environment.’ Lieutenant Chloe Lea, HMS Montrose’s watch officer, said: ‘We picked up a vessel on our radar that was not showing any of the normal behaviour expected of merchant vessels or allied warships. International waters: The encounter took place in the Baltic Sea. The incident was the latest in a series of encounters between British and Russian forces . Monitoring: As HMS Montrose closed with the Russian vessel, a Russian Ilyushin IL-20 'Coot' maritime patrol aircraft (pictured), was detected and appeared overhead, circling the two ships . 'We have seen the Russians operate a lot in this area but this is the closest we have seen them.’ Plymouth-based HMS Montrose, which has 205 crew and is armed with Sting Ray torpedoes, Sea Wolf missiles and Harpoon missiles, is taking part in the US-led exercise involving warships, submarines and helicopters from 14 different nations. Last week’s incident was the latest in a series of encounters between British and Russian forces. Base: Plymouth . Crew members on board: 205 .

Earlier this month two RAF fighters shadowed seven menacing Russian warplanes that flew too close to Baltic airspace. The fully-armed Typhoons from 3 (Fighter) Squadron were scrambled after unidentified aircraft were detected by Nato air defences in international airspace. All were subsequently identified as Russian. Four Typhoons were deployed to the region in April under orders to respond forcefully to any violation of the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which do not have their own air defence fighters and rely upon Nato.","HMS Montrose was taking part in an exercise off the Danish coast .

"Manchester City are weighing up a move for Feyenoord defender Terence Kongolo. City had scouts watching 20-year-old Kongolo and his defensive partner Sven van Beek at the recent Europa League game with HNK Rijeka. City want a left-sided centre-back who can provide competition to the first team and who they can also develop. Terence Kongolo, a natural left-footer who has impressed at centre back and left back, is a Man City target . Manuel Pellegrini, preparing to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League, has had Kongolo watched . Kongolo's younger brother, 16-year-old midfielder Rodney, is already at City having joined last summer despite interest from Liverpool and Manchester United. Terence, who can also play left-back, has two caps for Holland after being handed his debut by Louis van Gaal. He was part of the squad that finished third at last summer's World Cup but played just one minute, coming off the bench in the closing stages against Chile. Borussia Dortmund are also interested in the Feyenoord pair and had a delegation including technical director Michael Zorc in the stands for the Rijeka game which Feyenoord won 2-0. Kongolo has played 14 times this season and has started every game in a run that has seen the Dutch side keep five consecutive clean sheets.","City want to buy a new left-sided defender who they can develop .

"This may have been a routine victory for Chelsea, but the playmaking ability of Cesc Fabregas was there for all at Stamford Bridge to see. With his short-corner delivery for Eden Hazard’s goal, the Spain midfielder registered his 10th league assist of the season - more than any other Chelsea player since the start of last season. For a man who looks so effortless in his play, it’s some achievement. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas yet again put in a star performance at Stamford Bridge . Fabregas was the man helping Willian, Eden Hazard, Oscar and Diego Costa as Chelsea stormed to victory . Of course, the former Arsenal man is aided by the surfeit of attacking players making probing runs in front of him – namely Willian, Hazard, Oscar and Diego Costa – but picking the right option must be easier said than done. There wasn’t anything particularly flashy about Chelsea’s attacks against West Brom – most of them started with the visitors losing possession from a goal kick – but Fabregas played his role to perfection. Nemanja Matic or one of the centre halves would win the aerial battle and immediately look for Fabregas, who was never too far away and usually unmarked. Chelsea’s No 4 would then bring the ball forward and pick out one of the four forward players, whose movement completely befuddled West Brom’s rearguard all afternoon. Simple, yet effective. But in truth, Fabregas makes eye-of-the-needle through balls and long-range deliveries look easy. Fabregas celebrates with Hazard after the latter put Chelsea 2-0 up en route to their easy win on Saturday . Fabregas played his role to perfection as Chelsea beat West Brom at Stamford Bridge . Thierry Henry pictured in 2002, the year he set the new record for the most assists in the Premier League . Despite spending much of his time at Barcelona wasted as a false nine, it’s clear Fabregas’s best position is a deep-lying playmaker, rarely even entering the opponent’s penalty area. His assist stats certainly back this up. His total of 10 is three more than his nearest challenger, Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson, and is half way to Thierry Henry’s record haul of 20 in the 2002/03 season. With only 12 games gone, Fabregas looks well on his way to breaking his former Arsenal team-mate’s record. He could easily have moved a few notches closer if it weren’t for the heroics of West Brom keeper Ben Foster. Towards the end of the first half, with the game essentially won, Fabregas’s creative instinct showed no sign of letting up. West Brom had retreated into ultra-defensive mode and with Hazard, Oscar and Costa all well-covered, the Spain midfielder found right back Branislav Ivanovic with a beautifully-weighted through ball. Fabregas’s creative instinct showed no sign of letting up, even with Chelsea comfortably winning . The Serb squared the ball to fellow full back Cesar Azpilicueta, who had broken into the left of the box and clear of West Brom’s back line, but Foster flew at the feet of the left back to push the ball out for a corner. It may not have amounted to a goal, but that particular move, which came after a series of inch-perfect long balls from Fabregas, illustrated his versatility perfectly. It’s somewhat odd that the simple short-corner routine that preceded Hazard’s goal should be the one Fabregas pass that resulted in an assist for the Spaniard, after his numerous defence-splitting and cross-field balls – practically all of which found their intended target. But while the 27-year-old is taking corners, getting a free run of midfield and finding his attacking team-mates with such regularity, he looks a shoo-in to topple Henry’s 11-year-old record.

"Manuel Pellegrini insists that he is not feeling the heat asManchester City attempt to keep their Champions League hopes alive against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night. Pellegrini was hired to take City forward in Europe but after leading the club to the last 16 in his first season in England the Chilean faces an embarrassing exit at the group stage after picking up two points from his first four games. Defeat at the hands of group winners Bayern at the Etihad would effectively end City’s interest in this season’s competition and cast further doubts over Pellegrini’s future, but the manager said: ‘I don’t feel under extra pressure.

Samir Nasri (right) was all smiles as he jogged alongside Ivorian central midfielder Yaya Toure . Central defender Matija Nastasic (front) alongside Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko as training got going . ‘I think it is important for this club to continue in Europe because it is one of our targets to improve every year. Tomorrow we will see the team fighting until the end to continue in the Champions League and I hope we can do it. ‘I don’t know who are those people who don’t believe what we can do. This team and me especially have a lot of trust we can do it and I am sure we can continue having a chance to the last game. ‘Nobody in the whole team is happy the way we have played in this group. We have tomorrow, our last chance to win this year against Bayern Munich.’ The Premier League champions will have a clearer indication of where they stand before kick-off because CSKA entertain Roma earlier in the day. But the task facing City is even tougher without Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, who are both suspended after being sent off in the defeat to CSKA, while David Silva, Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov are injured. Neither Sergio Aguero or Stevan Jovetic trained on Monday morning but Pellegrini said that both players would be in the squad. City were beaten 3-1 at home by Bayern last season but won 3-2 in the Allianz Arena after the Germans had already qualified which bodes well for Tuesday’s encounter, especially if Pep Guardiola puts out a weakened side.

Last season they played here very well and won 3-1. After that we went to Munich and won. The three games we have played against Bayern have been very close. We will see tomorrow which team plays better. ‘We were very unlucky to lose against Bayern in the last minute on a set-piece (in September). After that we conceded a late goal in Moscow against CSKA.

"There will be no great explosion of fizz this morning as the Queen names the biggest ship in the entire history of her Royal Navy. That’s simply because Her Majesty will be doing the honours not with champagne but a bottle of Islay single malt (after all, this thing has been put together in Rosyth). Yet, in naval clubs up and down the land, the corks will be popping - literally and metaphorically. For today is about much more than a colossal new addition to the fleet. It represents something of a renaissance for our Senior Service. Scroll down for video . Ocean-going colossus: Some 10,000 workers from 90 companies at six shipyards have constructed HMS Queen Elizabeth, pictured, which will be able to carry 1,000 troops and 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters . As HMS Queen Elizabeth does not have a catapult system, jets use the 13 degree ramp to aid take-off, reducing fuel usage and improving their mission range . The giant ship is powered by two bronze propellers,each 22ft in diameter and weighing 33 tons, pushing her to a top speed of 30mph . At 72,000 tons and 932 feet long, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is taller than Nelson’s Column and considerably wider than the M25 at its widest point. She generates enough energy to power Swindon, she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day — and travel 500 miles a day, too. Above all, she will be able to deliver 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of British sovereign territory afloat. Her sister ship, the Prince of Wales, is already in production, though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational, mothballed or sold. This week, the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, described the project as a feat of engineering to match the  London Olympics. You could say much the same about the price — more than £6 billion for the pair. And that does not include the planes. These have been the subject of long debates, delays and a costly U-turn in 2012 when the Government switched from a catapult launch system to jump jets. Nor will they be seen at today’s launch. A flypast using American F-35s is off after an engine fire in the U.S. The Queen Elizabeth is so large that she will not come down a slipway but ‘float up’ as water floods into her dry dock. And it will be another two years before she is fully fitted out and ready to leave Rosyth. After sea trials in 2017, she is due to get her first planes in 2018 and to be fully  operational by 2020, with a projected lifespan of 50 years. The name of HMS Queen Elizabeth, pictured right, is covered with a grey sheet ahead of its official naming by the Queen. HMS Illustrious, pictured in the background to the left, will also be in dock during the ceremony . Since no photograph can yet do her justice, we have produced this souvenir illustration to mark today’s event. Thus begins a new era for a service which once ruled the waves but which has had a pretty dismal spell of late. Old salts might trace the low ebb back to 1997 when the Royal Yacht was decommissioned and this ancient maritime nation found itself without a flagship. Others say that the trouble started in 2005 when the Royal Navy insisted on a politically correct bicentenary of the Battle  of Trafalgar. The re-enactment of Nelson’s finest hour featured a ‘red’ fleet and a ‘blue’ fleet so as not to upset the French. In 2007, Britain was humiliated when 15 British sailors and Royal Marines were captured, without a fight, by Iranians in international Gulf waters. Released 13 days later, one of them admitted that he had cried himself to sleep when the Iranians confiscated his iPod. Two years later, the crew of a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship simply looked on as a British couple, Paul and Rachel Chandler, were seized from their sailing boat by  Somali pirates. And all the while, the surface fleet continued to shrink while the Navy was further eclipsed by events in landlocked Afghanistan. Hence the understandable delight this week as the First Sea Lord, Sir George Zambellas, entertained the other services, politicians, diplomats and defence experts to a dinner in honour of the new carrier at London’s Institute of Directors. They heard Mr Hammond praise her as ‘a vital message of confidence and capability as we plan for our future prosperity; a formidable deterrent to our foes; a symbol of solidarity with our allies and an advertisement for the Best of British.’ There remains one further challenge: squeezing this behemoth underneath the Forth Bridge and out to sea. HMS Illustrious, top, the last of the Invincible Class Carriers is dwarfed by the vast HMS Queen Elizabeth next to her at Babcock Marine's Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland . HMS Queen Elizabeth, pictured under the blue crane, is the Royal Navy's biggest ever aircraft carrier and at 65,000 tonnes is three times the size of the 22,000 tonne Illustrious, pictured to the left .

"Unlike traditional speed cameras, the new gantry devices, pictured, are painted grey, making them harder to spot . Labour will ban 'stealth' speed cameras being used on motorways, MailOnline can reveal. The party says all road cameras should be painted bright yellow to be clearly visible to motorists and should not be used to raise money for councils. It comes amid fury at a new grey 'stealth' camera installed on the M25 in Kent which has caught 1,500 motorists in just three months since being installed in October. The new cameras have contributed to recent spike in speeding fines issued to motorists. More than 115,000 motorists in England and Wales were issued with fines of at least £100 by magistrates last year – the highest level in four years. Despite the controversy over the new technology transport chiefs are planning to roll out the digital cameras across 300 miles of Britain's busiest motorways. The Highways Agency has claimed that the current government guidelines do not apply to motorways – allowing the 'secret' digital cameras to be installed. Unlike old yellow speed cameras, the Highways Agency Digital Enforcement Camera Systems, or Hadecs, are grey and mounted on tall poles, making them much harder to spot. And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four. The new cameras also do not rely on marks on the ground to catch a speeding driver – and work instead by comparing two images taken by front and rear facing cameras. Michael Dugher, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary, told MailOnline he would move to ban the 'stealth' cameras on motorways by introducing new rules making it clear that all cameras should be painted yellow and clearly visible to drivers. Labour will also review whether new regulation is needed to ensure speed cameras are not just being used as a revenue raiser for cash-strapped local councils. Scroll down for video . In the three months since the stealth cameras have been installed on the M25, pictured, 1,500 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit . Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher has vowed to introduce tough new rules banning stealth cameras . The grey cameras are being installed across Britain's busiest motorways can  track dozens cars across four lanes in the heaviest of traffic. Conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey. Attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle's speed. The same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database. They enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed. Mr Dugher told MailOnline: 'The aim of speed cameras should be to end up with safer roads by changing the behaviour of motorists - which is what happened under the previous Labour government when cameras were yellow - and they should be used in accident blackspots and on especially dangerous stretches of road. 'New figures show that more and more motorists are getting hit withspeeding fines by the proliferation of grey, hidden 'stealth' cameras on our motorways - yet at the same time our road safety record is getting worse. 'Speed cameras should be about slowing drivers down and changing the way people drive. They should not be being used as a cash cow for ministers.' The new cameras are being rolled out across the M25, as well as the M1, M3, M6 and M60. In total more than 300 miles of Britain's busiest motorways will be monitored by the new generation of cameras. Labour has insisted it is not anti-speed camera – pointing to the dramatic fall in deaths and serious injuries on the road since speed cameras were introduced. Between 1998 and 2009 traffic rose by 15 per cent, but there was a 44 per cent drop in the number of deaths and serious injuries. Where the new cameras will be placed: Several stretches of road are being upgraded to become 'smart motorways', with new speed cameras a part of improvements. Above, a map detailing which will be affected . But the party said progress cutting car crashes was slowing significantly – with Britain losing its top spot on the leader board for road safety in the EU. The number of people killed on motorways increased by 14 per cent to 100 in 2013, the first increase since 2005. And the number of road deaths has now increased over the last three quarters, alarming safety experts. The business behind new 'stealth' speed cameras being installed across Britain is being paid more than £2million by the taxpayer to help catch more drivers. The controversial technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the M25 in Kent. And the same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6. But it has emerged that Redflex Travel Systems Ltd agreed a £2.1million deal with the Government to set up the system. The Highways Agency confirmed to MailOnline they pay £150,000 per site to install the equipment and· £25,000 per site per year to maintain the equipment. The company's UK boss Ronald Moore has refused to comment on whether the cameras are unfair on motorists. The cameras, called the Hadecs3, enforce variable speed limits on motorways when they are congested. But when the speed limit at 70mph they are not switched off, instead they then catch people breaking the limit.","EXCLUSIVE: Party says all speed cameras should be  visible to motorists .

Mother-of-one Kylie Payne, 23, was found dead at a mental health clinic in Norfolk (pictured), just one day after she was told that police would not be pressing charges against the man who she accused of raping her . The mother of one was found hanged in her room at Meadowlands in Thorpe St Andrew, Norwich. Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how she discovered that police had dropped charges against the man she accused of rape just a day prior, due to insufficient evidence. A police investigation had been launched after she sent a text message to her aunt, Karen Payne, on Boxing Day 2012 in which she accused a fellow patient of rape. The inquest heard how doctors became 'concerned' when she befriended the patient at the mental health unit, but did not warn her about his previous convictions because of confidentiality rules. Assistant coroner David Osborne told the inquest that the patient Ms Payne accused of rape had a history of sex offences. The inquest heard how Ms Payne told staff on Christmas Day that she had been raped by the patient and wrote a note outlining suicidal thoughts. She was put under extra observation and care workers were told to increase her supervision visits to six times per hour. Following the five-day inquest, Ms Payne's mother Sheila, 42, told the Daily Mirror: 'I was in shock when I heard she had told staff that she'd been raped. 'I was angry at the clinic. Somebody like that should never have been in the same place as vulnerable women.' Concluding the inquest last week, the jury returned a verdict of suicide and said failings of care contributed to Ms Payne's death. They also ruled that the timing of police dropping the investigation was a contributory factor in her death. Mother-of-seven Mrs Payne issued a statement through her solicitor Zak Golombeck, from law firm Slater and Gordon, in which she revealed plans to take action against Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust over her daughter's death. She added: 'I am relieved that the results of the inquest highlighted failings into the care of Kylie.' The jury returned a verdict of suicide at Norfolk Coroner's Court (pictured) and said failings of care contributed to Ms Payne's death. The jury also said the timing of police dropping the investigation factored . Since Ms Payne's death, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust has introduced new measures to stop convicted criminals being admitted to low-security units. The Trust also said that secure facilities had been changed to single sex accommodation. Meadowlands was deemed no longer fit for purpose and closed in October 2013. Jane Sayer, the Trust's director of nursing, said: 'Kylie's death was a tragedy for all concerned and we fully accept there were failings on our part. Our sincere sympathies remain with Kylie’s friends and family. 'Following Kylie’s death in 2012, we undertook a serious incident investigation, commissioned an external review of the service, and implemented the recommendations made. 'We continue to look at how we can improve the safety of vulnerable patients on an ongoing basis.'

"When a young Championship manager proclaimed in 2011 that his greatest influence and inspiration in life was himself, eyebrows were raised. As Brendan Rodgers' time in the limelight increased, the now-Liverpool manager's proverbs have become part of Premier League life. But more than a few of these have come back to haunt him. Here, Sportsmail gives you Rodgers' Anfield career in quotes... Brendan Rodgers' quotes and proverbs have become legendary, but not always for the right reasons . 2012-13 . 'It's not just about training players, it's about educating players. You train dogs.' 'I will leave no stone unturned in my quest - and that quest will be relentless.' 'That's the problem with being a manager - it's like trying to build an aircraft while it is flying.' 'It (the documentary Being Liverpool) was something I didn't watch, and thankfully it's over.' 'I think there are three players who will let us down this year - the cause, the fight, everything - and I have written them down already in these three envelopes. Make sure you are not in one of the envelopes.' Rodgers admitted that he never watched the documentary Being Liverpool, and didn't enjoy being in it . 'I use a quote with the players, ""Per aspera as astra"", which is Latin for ""Through adversity to the stars"".' On Luis Suarez: 'He's a good guy.' He also said: 'He's so clever.' 'I've always said that you can live without water for many days, but you can't live for a second without hope.' 'I always say a squad is like a good meal. I'm not a great cook, but a good meal takes a wee bit of time. But also, to offer a good meal you need good ingredients.' 'I believe a young man will run through a barbed-wire fence for you. An older player looks for a hole in the fence.' Rodgers described Luis Suarez as really clever and a good guy, some footbalelrs may disagree . 'I've always worked along the statistic, that if you can dominate the game with the ball you have a 79 per cent chance of winning a game of football.' 'When we have the football everybody's a player. The difference with us is that when we have the ball we play with 11 men, other teams play with 10 and a goalkeeper.' 2013-14 . On his speech about envelopes: 'There never were any names.' 'When we lost at Stoke last season I got home on Boxing Day night and family and guests were all around the house. I went straight upstairs to my room and didn't come out.' Rodgers said that Tottenham should be challenging for the title considering the money they spent in 2013 . 'Look at Tottenham. If you spend more than £100million, you expect to be challenging for the league.' (Liverpool spent £113m in the summer of 2014) 2014-15 . 'They don't have to sell. (Southampton) have a choice. Maybe Southampton's objectives have changed. They were looking to be a Champions League club, I believe. 'It's the nature of it. The players will want to compete at the highest level they possibly can.' 'Lots of players are really impressed by what we are doing as a club and really excited about coming to Liverpool.' 'The last 18 months we have been on a magic carpet ride of development but we still have a lot of growth to make. 'We obviously lost a world-class player but our challenge now is to progress. It will be slow but steady and that will always be the best way to get to where we want to.' Liverpool's boss also suggested that Southampton perhaps didn't have much ambition for the current season .

"The actress daughter of disgraced NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams has spoken out to defend her father for the first time since he was suspended for six months for making false claims about his time in Iraq in 2003. Girls star Allison Williams described her father was 'an honest man, a truthful man,' at an event in New York City on Wednesday evening. She was speaking at a Q&A session to discuss her career with late night host Seth Meyers, when he asked how her family were doing following the recent scandal. Passionate: Allison Williams told host Seth Meyers that she is proud of her father and that is he is a man of the utmost integrity . Girls star Allison Williams has spoken out to defend her disgraced father Brian for the first time since he was suspended by NBC for six months for making false claims about his time in Iraq in 2003 . 'This has been a really hard time,' she said. 'One thing this experience has not done is shake my trust and belief in him as a man. 'He's a really good man, an honest man, a truthful man — he has so much integrity and so much respect for journalism. And yes he's a really good dad. I know you can trust him because, as any good daughter does, I've tested him on that.' Allison spoke while 'looking down at the stage' and 'with a subdued tone,' a witness told the New York Post. At the end of last year she starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live, which was aired on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month. Allison said her entire family were rallying round her beleaguered father. 'My mom has been so strong and my brother has been amazing. My dad has always been there for us a 100 percent of the time… so to be here for him is the least we can do,' she said. Allison starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live which was aired in December on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month, while on Wednesday she brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week . Referencing her father's time in Iraq in 2003, she recalled how he had promised to be back in time to take her to a 9th grade father-daughter dance. 'As the day was coming, it didn't seem like he was going to make it as he had promised… I was so upset and I got a surprise call from my dad from Iraq, and he was asking if I had a date to the dance. So that's the kind of man he is. 'I can't wait until he's back on TV and I know many of you guys feel that way. Thank you for all your support.' she said to applause from the audience. Allison has made a name for herself playing Marnie in the HBO series Girls, but a three-hour live production of Peter Pan which aired in December proved a ratings flop for NBC. The musical production only attracted an audience of 9.1 million viewers - less than half of what The Sound Of Music production the previous year had achieved. Allison Williams received applause from an audience on Wednesday night as she told them she couldn't wait until her father Brian was back presenting the new on NBC . Earlier on Wednesday Allison had brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week. The 26-year-old had worn a royal blue two-piece ensemble featuring giant yellow blooms, including a sleeveless crop top that showed off her taut midriff, and a heavy full skirt. The Girls star coordinated the look with royal blue pointed-toe pumps and wore her dark hair partially swept back. Her father's departure from the Nightly News has resulted in the show losing 700,000 viewers. Ratings for the network's Nightly News broadcast dipped by double-digits last Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title. Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8million viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6million by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week. Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension this week after it was revealed the anchor falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire during a mission in Iraq. Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken his place.

"Today marks the beginning of London Fashion Week and, with it, the world's most recognisable models are descending on the capital to strut down the catwalks in designer duds. Most have just arrived after wrapping up New York Fashion Week and, following London, many models will head to Milan and Paris to continue their whirlwind high-fashion tour. So, how exactly do the world's most beautiful women stay looking - and feeling - good, even with such hectic travel schedules? British supermodel, Zoe Huxford, 18, shares her top travel tips for a hectic Fashion Week schedule . Zoe (right) hangs out with fellow models Sam Rollinson (left) and Charlotte Wiggins in London . To find out, MailOnline Travel spoke to ELITE London's model of the moment, Zoe Huxford, to learn more about how she manages her jet-setting lifestyle. The 18-year-old British beauty may be young, but she's already walked for the likes of Prada, Victoria Beckham, DKNY and Ralph Lauren, and has recently been named the face of Preen eyewear. Following a successful New York Fashion Week run, we caught up with Huxford to quiz her on her travel must haves, on-the-go beauty secrets and her favourite places to visit in between runway shows. This past week, Zoe walked in the 3.1 Phillip Lim New York Fashion Week show in New York City . She also worked the catwalk for Ralph Lauren's F/W 15 show (left) and Prada's S/S 15 collection (right) Dry plane air can wreak havoc on your skin, so to ensure you disembark looking fresh, Huxford recommends using moisturising beauty products and drinking lots of water. 'Lip balm and water are essential,' she says. 'You become so dehydrated otherwise and I hate feeling dry. [My travel must haves] are anything that will replenish and moisturise.' And forget chowing down on airline meals. 'I always take my own food on the plane because I think airline food is atrocious,' Huxford says. 'Nuts and fruit, usually.' This season, Zoe walked for fellow Brit, Victoria Beckham, and also in the DKNY F/W 2015 show (right) Packing light - especially when it comes to hand luggage - is key to quickly heading to fittings upon arrival . Because they are often whisked off to a fitting upon landing, supermodels have mastered the art of packing light. What's in Huxford's hand luggage? 'Not much,' she admits. 'Purse, keys, phone - anything else is extra.' Unfortunately, though they travel the world regularly, sight-seeing is simply not in the cards for these top models. Huxford may have just spent a week in the Big Apple, but admits that she really hasn't really seen much of it outside of the Lincoln Center tents. She doesn't have time to do much sight-seeing, but Zoe admits that she'd love to visit Rockefeller Center . The British beauty was caught in a candid moment on the chilly New York streets just last week . During NYFW, Zoe did manage to find time to grab a bite to eat with a friend at the Empire Diner in Chelsea . 'I want to go to Rockefeller Center,' she says. 'But I haven't really had time to explore. 'My friend did take me to Empire Diner though on 10th Avenue between 22nd and 23rd Streets. It was lovely.' And in her native London? 'I think the best places to visit are Hoxton, Haggerston and Islington. They're not touristy, so you get good vibes of how real people actually live.' Fellow ELITE London model, Kendall Jenner, has also posted many travelling snaps on Instagram . Like fellow top model Kendall, Milan holds fond memories for Zoe, who walked in the Prada S/S 2015 show . That's not to say Huxford doesn't look back fondly of her brief visits to New York, Paris and Milan. 'My favourite show that I've walked in was Prada in Milan,' she tells MailOnline Travel. 'It was such an honour.' 'The clothes were lovely and I particularly liked the makeup. The cat-eye flick was beautiful.' But there's a time and a place to be comfortable and that especially holds true during long-haul flights. 'When I'm flying, I wholeheartedly dress for comfort,' she explains. 'If I know I've got a job [when I land], that's when I'll wear jeans. I like to stay warm and comfortable.' 'If I'm not working, I don't use makeup or products. I just let my skin breathe. And I've always got a big pair of glasses on!'","18-year-old model Zoe Huxford has walked for Prada and Ralph Lauren .

"President Obama has kept up with the tradition of hosting a National Prayer Breakfast by inviting guests from 130 nations and a collection of Congressmen and Senators. One of the most distinctive guests was not in politics at all, however, as professional surfer Bethany Hamilton addressed the crowd at the Washington Hilton Thursday morning. The 23-year-old, who survived a shark attack in 2003 where she lost her left arm, read two passages from the New Testament and talked about the inspiration she received to thrive in spite of her injury. In prayer: Michelle and Barack Obama attended the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday morning in Washington . Peaceful event: The President talked about how political ideology is not an issue that is a central focus at the breakfast . The non-denominational gathering focused on the issue religious freedom and the President discussed how important it is to diplomacy. 'No society can truly succeed unless it guarantees the rights of all its people, including religious minorities,' he said. This is not the first time that he stressed that fact, noting that he made the same point to the leaders of China, Burma and Nigeria where such freedom is not guaranteed. Obama says, quote, 'to harm anyone in the name of faith is to diminish our own relationship with God.' 'Our concern should not be whether God is on our side, but whether we are on God’s side,' he said. He put a ring on it: The President told the breakfast that God had led him to his wife . Inspiring: Bethany Hamilton survived a shark attack when she was just 13 years old where she lost her left arm . Guest of honor: Hamilton, 23, shared her story and read two passages from the New Testament . Obama, whose own association with controversial priest Reverend Jeremiah Wright came under scrutiny during the 2008 election, talked about how his faith helps guide his decisions while in office. 'In my life, He directed my path to Chicago and my work with churches who were intent on breaking the cycle of poverty in hard-hit communities there,' he said during the 62nd annual breakfast. 'And I’m grateful not only because I was broke and the church fed me, but because it led to everything else. It led me to embrace Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. 'It led me to Michelle- the love of my life- and it blessed us with two extraordinary daughters. It led me to public service. And the longer I serve, especially in moments of trial or doubt, the more thankful I am of God’s guiding hand.' Joining forces: Democratic Congresswoman Janice Hahn (left) and Republican Congressman Louis Gohmert (right) were the organizers of the 62nd annual event . Big names: Secretary of State John Kerry (center) was in attendance along with Vice President Joe Biden . The bipartisan gathering was hosted by Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert and Democratic Congresswoman Janice Hahn. Gohmert joked that he was prepared for the all backstabbing in Congress, saying, quote, 'I was the deacon of a Baptist church.' For many political watchers, it wasn't the backstabbing that Gohmert was the victim of that they were concerned about but rather his regular target: President Obama. Gohmert is one of the President's toughest critics, but Obama was the one to make light of that fact at the beginning of the event while thanking the co-chairs. 'I, by the way, have always found Louie to be unbelievably gracious every time I’ve seen him. Now, I don’t watch TV, I’ve got to admit. But he is a good man and a great storyteller,' Obama said. Hot ticket: The non-denominational event was held at the Washington Hilton with a crowd of about 3,500 which included representatives from 130 different countries .","Thursday morning's breakfast was the 62nd annual such event .

"This is the shocking moment a brutal carjacker dragged his victim along the road as he accelerated off in his BMW. The incident took place on the same street as another car jacking this month and police are investigating to see whether the crimes are linked. In the latest theft caught on CCTV, the culprit creeps up to the BMW before scurrying in to the driver's seat. As he accelerates away, the victim grabs desperately to the side of the car but is eventually dumped to the ground as the thief drives off. The man spots the parked BMW with its lights on and engine running outside a building suppliers . Crouched over, he dashes towards the parked car as owner Justin Dean, 42, was locking up . He then entered the £26,000 BMW 3 Series M Sport while Mr Dean was away for only 30 seconds . As soon as he realised what had happened, he ran frantically to his car to try and stop the thief . Running alongside the BMW, Mr Dean, a yard foreman, tried in vain to remove the culprit from the driver's seat . He remained gripped to the car as the thief stepped on the accelerated in Farnworth, Greater Manchester . But he was left dumped on the ground as the thief managed to shake him off the side of the vehicle . The thief then drove off leaving Mr Dean lying helplessly on the road - the car has not been recovered yet . The incident happened just after 5.30pm on Wednesday outside building suppliers Cooper Clarke. Yard foreman Justin Dean, 42, was locking up when his £26,000 BMW 3 Series M Sport was stolen. Mr Dean, from Heywood in Rochdale, said: ' I had gone to lock the gate, I was away 30 seconds. Then I heard the car start and the lights on it flash on. 'I ran at the car and reached in. I had a grip of his arm and could see the fear in his eyes. Then he accelerated and I thought I can't keep hold. 'He appeared from an area of bushes across the road. I am convinced this is organised.' It is the second carjacking to take place in Bloomfield Street, in the Farnworth area of Bolton, Greater Manchester this month. In the first, Alan Shuttleworth, 59, was locking up at his premises at Starlight Bedrooms at 3.20pm on February 7, when a thief pounced. He had opened the security gate to the fenced compound and was about to drive his brown Skoda Yeti out when he went to check the shop's security shutters were locked properly. He walked round to the front of the shop, momentarily leaving the yard gate open and the keys in the ignition. At that moment, the thief dashed round the corner got in to the driver's seat and sped away. In a last-ditch effort to save his car Mr Shuttleworth jumped on the bonnet as the thief drove directly at him. But the thief carried on regardless, stepping on the accelerator and eventually flinging him in to the road. The car then sped off out of sight with Mr Shuttleworth left lying in the road. Alan Shuttleworth, who owns Starlight Bedrooms in Farnworth,  was locking up the premises on February 7 . As he went to check the shop's security shutters, the thief dashed round the corner and into his Skoda Yeti . He got in to the car and accelerated out of the premises - with Mr Shuttleworth lying across the bonnet . But that did not deter the brazen thief and he sped off dumping the 59-year-old victim on to the road . Mr Shuttleworth, stood outside his premises at Starlight Bedrooms, said: 'If I had not let go I think I could have been killed' The father-of-three bravely tried to halt the thief by jumping on to the bonnet of his Skoda Yeti . The father-of-three from Astley in Greater Manchester said: 'I saw him getting into the car but I couldn't open the door so I jumped on the bonnet clinging on with my hands near the windscreen wipers. 'He drove down the ramp and onto the road. He was picking up speed and seemed to be weaving from side to side. I shouted at him ""Get off my car"". 'My legs were dangling over the wing of the car and I slid off. I landed on my metal knee - I have had a knee replacement operation. 'If I had not let go I think I could have been killed.' The thief is described as being white, of a thin build with gaunt features and with stubble. He was said to be about 5ft 8in tall, with short dark hair and wearing light blue jeans and a striped top with either blue, white or cream stripes. Police are now trying to establish if both crimes are linked. There has been no trace of either vehicle so far. Even though the method of theft was identical, they suspect two different carjackers may have been involved. Detectives are investigating if the carjackings are linked to organised crime gangs or are the work of individuals. Detective Inspector Sarah May, said: 'We are investigating both thoroughly and keeping an entirely open mind as to any connection. 'I would encourage anyone who knows anything about either incident or the person responsible to call us and I would also ask people remain vigilant and let us know if either vehicle is spotted.' Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 5608 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Thief dragged victim along the road as he sped off in his £26,000 BMW .

"Kanye West has defended himself against critics who labeled his first collection for Adidas Originals a 'disaster'. After Fern Mallis, the creator of New York Fashion Week, told The New York Post that she's 'kind of over Kanye' and is 'not a fan of his music, and the attitude and the agenda are not [her] style,' the 37-year-old took to Twitter last night to voice his own opinion in a rant that was later taken down, but has since been put back up. 'To Fern Mallis, I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult,' he wrote in the first of a series of tweets. 'And I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way.' Scroll down for video . After Fern Mallis, the creator of New York Fashion Week, told The New York Post that she's 'kind of over Kanye,' the 37-year-old rapper took to Twitter last night to voice his own opinion . The long-winded rant that was later taken down, but has since been put back up on Kanye's Twitter account . The Twitter rant seems to be an attempt at defending himself against critics who labeled his first collection for Adidas Originals a 'disaster' Design debut: Kanye West showcased his first collection for Adidas Originals at New York Fashion Week on Friday . Both Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis (left) and fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone (right) slammed Kanye's catwalk show . 'I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world,' he continued. 'I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins. Because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design. 'Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so it's actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we won't stop fighting. 'We want to innovate and we will win someday.' The tweets were also directed at other fashion critics, like publicist Kelly Cutrone, who is known by many for her appearance on Lauren Conrad's LA-based reality series, The Hills. 'I’m not into his fashion thing,' she told People magazine. 'I think he’s fine as a rapper. I think he’s a joke as a fashion designer. 'I just think that you should stay focused at what you’re good at. Just because you’re a good rapper doesn’t mean you’re going to be a good fashion designer.' Kanye's questionable fashion fail has already started to spawn its own collection of entertaining memes, including this one which features designer Ralph Lauren . Kelly was also quick to point out that this is not the first time Kanye's attempts to establish himself as a legitimate designer have failed. 'I mean, it’s not, he’s not legit. Have you seen the product?' she said. 'Didn't he have his own line in London, which was a disaster that he spent $10 million to do, that no one wore?' Plenty of would-be fashion critics on Twitter also shared Kelly's somewhat blunt opinion of Kanye's Adidas collection, which featured a series of skin-tight nude body stockings which were paired with flesh-colored crop tops. 'I'm no fashion guru but I feel like Kanye is the 2015 version of ""The Emperor's new clothes.""' one Twitter user wrote, while another added: 'I can't believe people are actually buying ripped clothing just bc [sic] Kanye designed them. Bruh give me your clothes & I'll rip them for free.' Despite claiming to be incredibly excited at the prospect of showing his Adidas Originals collection, Kanye failed to raise a smile when he took to the catwalk . The collection included a number of unflattering ensembles, which featured skin-tight body stockings and barely-there crop tops . Kelly labeled Kanye's collection, pictured, as a 'joke' and a 'disaster' Kanye's show was attended by a whole host of his celebrity friends, including his wife Kim Kardashian (L), who wore one of his designs, and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour .

"An Oregon man accused of killing his girlfriend while they were on a hike six years ago tried but failed to collect on her $1 million life insurance policy, it has been revealed. Stephen Wagner Nichols, 40, of Bend, was arrested this month at San Francisco International Airport after Oregon authorities alerted California officers that he would be arriving on a flight from China. He had been secretly indicted in April on a murder charge in the death of 23-year-old Rhonda Casto, which had previously been thought an accident, when she fell 100 feet on a steep, narrow path in March 2009. Heartbreaking: Family members say Rhonda Casto, 23, left behind a young daughter, and confirmed that she was dating Stephen Nichols, now aged 40, at the time of her death . Killer boyfriend? Nichols (left), was arrested at San Francisco International Airport on February 12 in connection with Casto's death (right). Her falling during a hike was ruled accidental at the time . He did not appear to have been a suspect in the death of his nine-years-younger girlfriend death when her lifeless body was found on March 16, 2009. Investigators have not revealed if they believe Nichols pushed her or how she may have fallen about a mile from a trailhead in the Columbia River Gorge, 45 miles east of Portland. Court documents show Nichols and Casto became romantically involved in 2005 and had a daughter, who is now six, according to The Oregonian . It was not clear who has custody of the girl. The papers reveal that the couple each bought a $1million life insurance policy in late 2008 from MetLife and named each other as beneficiaries, records show. Their daughter was named as contingent beneficiary. Nichols sued MetLife after it denied his $1million claim. The company said the insurance policy was void because of omissions on the application. MetLife asserted in a counterclaim that ""it is unclear whether plaintiff/counterclaim defendant Steven Wagner Nichols was involved in the murder of Rhonda Casto,"" according to a June 2011 opinion written by U.S. District Judge Ancer Haggerty. If he was, the company said, he may not be entitled to the money under Oregon law. Consequences: If convicted, Nichols could face 25 years to life in prison for Casto's (pictured) murder . In October, Haggerty ruled that the $1million be put in an interest-bearing account under the court's control. MetLife's attorneys agreed that if Nichols was not entitled to the money, it would be given to the couple's daughter. Casto's mother, Julia Anne Simmons, filed a wrongful-death suit against Nichols that Haggerty dismissed. It was later moved to Multnomah County Circuit Court and put on hold in December because the case is ""under review by the Hood River County prosecutor's office,"" according to court documents. Nichols is being held without bail in an Oregon jail, and he is scheduled to appear in court March 3. The case has similarities to one in Colorado, where a man was charged with pushing his wife 140 feet from a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park, where they were hiking in 2012 to celebrate their anniversary. Harold Henthorn, 58, stood to benefit from three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million, court documents said. Ms Simons told FOX 12 at the time of Casto’s death: 'I think about her last moments, and what she was thinking when she fell. Narrow: At the time, Casto's death was ruled accidental. It was then believed that she slipped of the trail. Pictures of the Eagle Creek Trail show how narrow it becomes at points . 'How she's not going to get to see her daughter take her first steps. And how I'm never going to get to see my daughter again.' Not many details were released about Casto's death at the time, other than that a 'male companion' (now identified as Nichols), called 911 around 6pm to say she had fallen off a ledge while they were hiking the Eagle Creek Trail . The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past, due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine. The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the trail slippery. Casto was one of four hikers who either fell to their death or died of exposure on Columbia River Gorge trails like Eagle Creek that year. 'The trail is very steep and narrow there, and it's been pretty wet and slippery,' Hood River County sheriff's Deputy Matt English told The Oregonian in 2009. 'There was still snow on the ground down near the parking lot.' It's currently unclear why Casto's case was reopened and the cause of death switched to homicide. Nichols is currently being held without bail and his next court appearance is scheduled for March 3 at 11am.","Rhonda Kristen Casto, 23, was hiking with her boyfriend Stephen Wagner Nichols, now aged 40, when she fell to her death on March 16, 2009 .

"Labour was accused of hypocrisy last night as a company criticised for promoting ‘industrial-scale’ tax avoidance was revealed to be its biggest non-union donor. Ed Miliband’s party took £386,605 from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in the last quarter of 2014, according to the Electoral Commission. This is despite the fact the accountancy company was accused by a senior Labour MP of devising ‘complex strategies and contrived structures’ to help clients slash tax bills. Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said it was ‘inappropriate’ for Mr Miliband to accept donations from the company. Ed Miliband's party was accused of hypocrisy after taking £386,605 from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in the last quarter of 2014 . Her cross-party committee accused PwC of helping big firms avoid tax ‘on an industrial scale’ and ‘artificially diverting profits’ overseas. Mr Miliband’s acceptance of donations from PwC sits uneasily alongside his claim in the Commons earlier this month that Labour donors accused of tax avoidance had not been allowed to give ‘a penny on my watch’. And it is the latest in a string of embarrassing blows to Labour’s campaign against what Mr Miliband has branded the Tories’ ‘dodgy’ donors. He has already faced questions about his family’s use of a ‘deed of variation’ to minimise potential inheritance tax payments, while Ed Balls’s suggestion that he always asks tradesmen for a receipt was ridiculed by his window cleaner who said the Shadow Chancellor had not asked for one in 17 years. Labour defended its links to PwC, insisting other parties had accepted support from it – particularly when in opposition. The company has paid for staff and research in the offices of several shadow ministers, including Mr Balls and business spokesman Chuka Umunna. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) accused by a senior Labour MP of devising ‘complex strategies and contrived structures’ to help clients slash tax bills . Conservative Party vice-chairman Bob Neill said: ‘Labour’s hypocrisy is laid bare. They are only too happy to publicly lambast companies but in private are happy to benefit from donations from them. ‘Once again, Labour say one thing and do another – and it’s hardworking taxpayers who would pay the price for the chaos of an Ed Miliband government.’ Mrs Hodge attacked her own party leadership earlier this month for ‘inappropriate’ links with PwC. ‘The Conservatives took money from PricewaterhouseCoopers when they were in opposition, the Labour Party does and probably the Liberal Democrats too. I think that’s inappropriate – I wouldn’t do it,’ she said. A Labour spokesman said: ‘Given the complexity of government decisions in areas such as tax policy – and that opposition parties do not have significant access to civil servants – the support provided by organisations such as these helps ensure that there is better scrutiny of Government policy.’ PwC said its staff provided ‘limited and fully disclosed technical support to the main political parties’. A spokesman added: ‘We do not develop policy on their behalf.’ Separately, Labour received almost £80,000 in support from another accountancy firm, Deloitte, which Mrs Hodge has previously accused of using ‘insider knowledge’ from Treasury officials to help wealthy clients avoid tax. Yesterday’s Electoral Commission figures showed that despite the private donations, Labour remains heavily reliant on trade unions. In the last quarter of last year, Labour received £7.2 million in donations, with the Conservatives receiving £8.3 million, the Lib Dems £3 million and Ukip £1.5 million. Unison gave Labour £1.4 million, while Unite donated £1.3 million and the GMB £1.1 million. 'Leaning towards UKIP': Peter Baldwin confronts Ed Miliband yesterday . Ed Miliban was tackled by a disgruntled voter yesterday who said people were deserting Labour because of the party’s failure to offer an EU referendum. In a rare non-stage-managed encounter with a member of the public, the Labour leader was told by an aircraft factory worker that voters wanted to have a say on whether Britain should continue its membership of the EU. In the awkward encounter, Peter Baldwin, an electrician at BAE Systems in Lancashire, told Mr Miliband: ‘This morning we sat in the brew room over there, your workers, and they are all leaning now towards Ukip. ‘The question on everyone’s mind is the referendum. I know what you are going to say but the working-class man in here wants to have a say. We have too many people here, that is why we have all got these people out of work.’ The Labour leader said that if he won office, he would make jobless EU migrants wait two years before claiming benefits and stop firms undercutting the minimum wage, before shaking Mr Baldwin’s hand and saying ‘very nice to meet you’. Mr Baldwin later told the BBC that he was referring to a chat between ‘20-odd working-class blokes’. He said: ‘Basically they are just not happy with Labour at the moment. The big thing with the working-class man is immigration and Europe.’ Mr Miliband was on a visit to the BAE site in Samlesbury and given a tour of its workshops, where the F35 Lightning II and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft are built. His encounter with Mr Baldwin came as one of Labour’s biggest donors warned that failing to offer the public an in-out referendum could lose the party the election. John Mills, who has given £1.65 million to Labour, said Mr Miliband’s refusal to let the public have a say would ‘certainly’ cost the party votes in key seats. The multi-millionaire owner of retail business JML Ltd told a conference of Eurosceptics in London: ‘I have heard rumours that there is a majority in the Shadow Cabinet who are in favour of having a referendum. I’m sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose Labour votes in what is going to be a very tight election.’ Out of £58.5 million in donations received by Labour since Mr Miliband became the party’s leader, £40.4 million (69 per cent) has come from the trade union movement. Robin Birley, the half-brother of Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, donated £55,000 to Ukip, while Ko Barclay, the property developer son of Daily Telegraph owner Sir Frederick, gave the party £80,000, and Richard Desmond, the owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers, donated £300,000. Tories blasted over donations from hedge fund firms . Labour branded the Tories ‘the political wing of the hedge fund industry’ as the latest figures underlined their dependence on donations from City figures. Almost £2 million of Tory donations in the last quarter of last year came from hedge fund donors – and three Tory donors were named last week as having previously held accounts at the Swiss branch of HSBC. Hedge funds have defended themselves against criticism from Ed Miliband, arguing that they contributed £4 billion in British taxes last year. But Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘The Tories are now the political wing of the hedge fund industry. ‘The Tory election campaign is increasingly reliant on those who dine exclusively at the Prime Minister’s top table and a select few from the world of finance. The Tories’ plan is failing working families because their priority has been to help a few at the top.’ The biggest Conservative donors were Michael Gooley, founder of travel company Trailfinders, who gave £500,000; Lord Glendonbrook, the former owner of BMI (£334,000); and David Rowland, a property magnate (£322,000). The three donors named as having had accounts with the Swiss Branch of HSBC were Georg Von Opel, who gave £105,900; Edward Lee (£17,200) and Anwar Pervez (£8,000. Being a client of a Swiss bank is not against the law, and does not prove tax avoidance or evasion. There is no suggestion that any of the individual donors did anything unlawful. The Electoral Commission figures also reveal that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has donated more than £500,000 to the three main political parties through one of his companies. Bloomberg TradeBook, a British-registered financial markets broker, has given £240,000 to Labour, £210,000 to the Liberal Democrats and £100,000 to the Conservatives since January 2011. Including gifts in kind, the company has almost doubled its political donations in the past four years to £640,704, compared with £369,567 in the four years ahead of the 2010 election. Mr Bloomberg, whose ex-wife is from England, has called Britain his second home. Mr Bloomberg declined to comment last night.","Labour took £386,000 from PricewaterhouseCoopers in last quarter of 2014 .

"Universities are paying agencies millions to recruit overseas students who boost their coffers. Home students suffer as lectures are dumbed down to help those with poor English, academics say. And some institutions enrol lucrative non-EU students ‘regardless of their language skills’, it was claimed. A study by Times Higher Education (THE) found 106 universities spent £86million recruiting abroad in 2013 to 2014, or £1,767 per student – a 16.5 per cent increase on two years before. The Russell Group of top universities were some of the top spenders, with Sheffield, Glasgow and Cardiff each spending more than £6million from 2011 to 2014. Coventry spent the most, paying out £10.2million in commission and VAT to recruit 5,634 students, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. However, a university spokesman said: ‘By error the figures . . . included substantial non-agent related costs, and therefore do not represent the university’s spend.’ The University of Bedfordshire spent £9.5million and Middlesex University spent £8.8million including VAT. Giving money to recruitment agents is worthwhile for institutions because the average fee paid by a student from outside the EU last year was £11,289 – or £13,425 for laboratory-based courses. Fees for UK and EU students are capped at £9,000 a year. Liz Reisberg, formerly of the Centre for International Higher Education, at Boston College in the US, and now an independent consultant, told THE the situation was ‘staggering’. Of 158 universities that gave data, all but 19 used agents to enrol non-EU students. At the 124 institutions that gave a breakdown of admissions, there were 58,257 international students enrolled using agents in 2013-14. This month, a separate THE survey found more than a third of academics thought foreign undergraduates did not speak or write good English. One admitted to The Best University Workplace Survey that tutors ‘lower the level of classes so everyone can keep up – to the disadvantage of native speakers’. A Russell Group lecturer called the issue the sector’s ‘dirty little secret’. The average  fee paid by student from outside the EU last year was £11,289 a year to study in the UK . A respondent at a university in the Midlands said it tried ‘to attract as many international students as possible regardless of their language skills.’ As the survey was anonymous, there is no suggestion the complaints came from institutions that pay agencies fees to recruit internationally. Nicola Dandridge, of Universities UK, which represents the sector, said: ‘International students are subject to numerous tests to ensure they meet high English language requirements.’ The group said official guidance puts an onus on universities to ensure agents act ‘ethically and responsibly’.","106 universities spent £86 million recruiting abroad in 2013 to 2014 .

"The Obama administration said on Friday that the Internal Revenue Service sent incorrect tax information to about 800,000 Americans who enrolled in new medical insurance plans through Healthcare.gov. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Health and Human Services subagency that handles Obamacare, sent them forms that contained an error which would cause them to miscalculate the government subsidy for their insurance policies. That, the administration admitted, would change the amount of their tax refunds, or change the amount they owe. A source at the Treasury Department told Daily Mail Online that of about 80,000 people who have already filed their taxes on the basis of the flawed information, it is expected that 50,000 will have to file again. GLITCH: The IRS sent 800,000 Obamacare customers  the wrong subsidy information for their tax returns . PLAYING DEFENSE: WHite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted on Friday that most of the people who got Obamacare tax credits received the right form, but didn't dispute the more embarrassing numbers . The Department of Health and Human Services, not the IRS, announced the glitch – in a blog post. Information 'needs to be corrected,' HHS said, but new forms will not be available until next month. 'This does not mean that your tax credit was incorrect; this is purely an error in what was printed on the form,' the blog explained. Republicans were quick to pounce. 'The Obama administration has built a healthcare law so complex, so confusing, and so costly that even they don't know how to properly administer it,' Tennessee GOP Rep. Diane Black said in a statement. Officially, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a statement that 'affected individuals who have not yet filed their taxes should wait to file until they receive their corrected form.' 'For affected individuals who have already filed their taxes, the IRS and Treasury are currently reviewing the issue and will be providing additional information shortly.' A Treasury Department spokesperson stuck to that line despite the emergence of hard numbers from inside the agency. 'I’m not disputing those numbers,' a Treasury Department spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'My point is that all we’ve said is that we’ll have additional information for those people shortly.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday afternoon that the HHS snafu 'only has an impact on those who are likely to qualify for a tax credit.' 'The vast majority of people who received this form got the correct version of it,' he claimed. California's self-administered insurance marketplace had a similar problem this week that will affect nearly 100,000 people. The latest cringeworthy moment in Obamacare's history follows a 2013 launch that saw millions unable to reach the government''s marketplace website. More than 50,000 Americans will have to file their taxes a second time . CAN YOU PASS THIS TEST? The IRS has a new form for people to calculate how medical insurance subsidies affect their tax refunds . This time about 1 in 11 Obamacare enrollees for 2015 will need new tax papers from Health and Human Services. Of those who received subsidies to lower their insurance premiums, about 1 in 5 are affected. Americans for Tax Reform blamed the problem on 'the dysfunctional healthcare.gov bureaucrac.' '800,000 families are literally caught in limbo until healthcare.gov gets its act together,' the group said. With the U.S. labor participation rate at a 37-year low and the economy only beginning a tepid rebound, those people will need to wait for refunds that could make or break their families' finances. Meanwhile, the government has created a special extended Obamacare enrollment period for Americans who say they were unaware that failing to sign up by Feb. 15 could result in hefty fines.","HHS announced on its blog that nearly 1 in 5 people with insurance subsidies got the wrong subsidy information .

"The investments of one in three savers are being eroded by fund managers who charge rip-off fees for doing ‘virtually nothing’, it is claimed. Millions of middle-class Britons pay investment firms to ensure their pensions or stocks and shares Isas yield higher returns. But in up to a third of cases, managers are simply tracking their return on the FTSE stock market, which requires little effort or skill. One in three savers are apparently being charged rip-off fees by fund managers who do 'virtually nothing' except track their return on the FTSE stock market, it has been claimed (file picture, posed by models) Known as ‘closet trackers’, these funds charge high fees in return for ‘active management’ – when in fact investors are doing little more than mirroring the mainstream index. Now the City watchdog says it is gathering evidence on whether investors have been misled. The Financial Conduct Authority will then decide what, if any, action to take. The Daily Telegraph calculated that savers who invested in one of these funds missed out on up to £50,000 over a period of 30 years. Gina Miller of campaign group True and Fair, which is campaigning for more transparency in the industry, said it was ‘fraud in all but name’. She said: ‘If you take this definition of fraud – the use of false representations to gain an unjust advantage – this is fraud on an industrial scale. ‘Yet no one has been investigated, let alone charged or faced prosecution.’ Justin Modray, of investment firm Candid Financial Advice, said savers had been ‘paying over the odds for years’ on these funds, which are mostly run by banks. ‘In many cases the people running the investments are doing nothing more than what a dumb machine can do – there is no expertise involved whatsoever,’ he said. It comes just weeks after a lawsuit was filed against Sweden’s second largest fund house, Swedbank Robur, over claims it mis-sold investors ‘closet trackers’. The City watchdog said it is now gathering evidence on whether any British investors have been misled by fund managers and the Financial Conduct Authority will then decide what, if any, action to take (file picture) Critics said many firms are either too lazy or scared to actively invest people’s money properly and seek out the highest returns. Andrew Telfer, at Edinburgh-based fund house Baillie Gifford, told the Financial Times: ‘There are many fund managers who are closet indexing and overcharging for that. ‘They have been a disservice to the industry.’ Savers typically pay 1.5 per cent a year for ‘active management’ of their investments, in the belief that fund managers will pick the best shares from across the stock market. But a third of these managers investing in British companies simply copy the rise and the fall of the stock market, therefore generating mediocre returns. Miss Miller’s research found many funds were run by banks, insurers and building societies. Among the worst offenders named was the Scottish Widows UK Growth fund which has £3billion of savers’ money, and the £5billion Halifax UK Growth. A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group, which runs both funds, said such investments were ‘not actively marketed’.","One in three savers 'charged fees by fund managers for virtually nothing'

"It seems like a highly unlikely case but extraordinary footage has emerged of what appears to be an octopus attacking a crab. Believed to be filmed in Yallingup, a town southwest of Western Australia, a beachgoer is quite aptly shocked by what she has witnessed. The footage begins as the crab edges closer to a rockpool, seemingly testing the waters.

"Argument: Jeremiah Adebolajo says his brother Michael's murder of Lee Rigby was 'inevitable' and had an 'obvious' justification . The brother of one of Lee Rigby's murderers said today the attack on the soldier was 'inevitable' and the justification for his death was 'obvious'. Jeremiah Adebolajo, who like his now-convicted brother Michael is a Muslim convert, predicted another Woolwich-style attack due to Britain's foreign policy. The 26-year-old, who was banned from some of his brother's trial for security reasons, also said that Fusilier Rigby was a violent man like his sibling. 'I suggest that it won't be the last, simply because of the tactics of the British secret service and foreign policy. For every violent action is a violent reaction,' he told Al Jazeera's Investigations Unit. 'Is it justified for a Muslim to attack a member of an army that is occupying Muslim lands?' 'This is something for the scholars and I think it's obvious to most people,' he added. 'The events to me were inevitable. There was eventually going to be another attack which mentioned foreign policy as its justification.' In the interview he claimed his brother's . actions were a direct consequence of the West's 'war on terror' and . likened the killing of Fusilier Rigby to US drone strikes on Muslim . countries. He said: 'I would say, was Lee Rigby a violent individual? Are other British soldiers who go to Afghanistan and Iraq and kill violent individuals?' 'The point he's trying to make is the fact that the geographical location of the battlefield, since this war on terror, has basically disappeared. When we have people driving on roads in Afghanistan and targeted by drones, we have to ask ourselves the question, are these people soldiers? Is this a battlefield?' He told Al Jazeera his brother was not radicalised, despite associations with radical preachers and the now disbanded group al Muhajiroun. He said: 'It's a very tidy narrative to assume that we have this young Christian boy who was radicalised by these bogeymen-like figures - Anjem Choudary, Omar Bakri Muhammad - and while he went on this conveyor belt, as it were, of radicalisation and then the events of Woolwich happened. It's just not true.' Theory: Jeremiah told Al Jazeera that his brother was a violent man but so was Lee Rigby because he was a soldier . Jeremiah claimed the British security services were aware of alleged mistreatment of his brother by Kenyan police while he was in custody in 2010 and added: 'They were complicit in allowing him to be interrogated with the means of interrogation that the Kenyans chose. Questions are to be asked about why they allowed the Kenyans to torture a British citizen.' Convert: Married father-of-six Michael Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya (pictured) seeking terror training but was allowed to return to Britain and kill Lee Rigby . Jeremiah said he has been approached by an MI5 officer assigned to his brother, adding the security services were 'putting a lot of pressure' on Adebolajo and were 'really disrupting his life' right up to 'a few months before' the Woolwich attack. In 2010 Michael Adebolajo had tried to travel to Somalia but was captured in Kenya and brought back to the UK. MailOnline . can now report it was a SAS unit that ‘snatched’ him as he prepared to . enter the war-torn countries for terror training and to fight for the Al . Qaeda linked terrorism group Al-Shabaab. But he never made it across the border and Kenyan officials believe he was arrested north-east of the resort of Lamu. Sources say it was then that MI5 'tried to recruit' Adebolajo to inform them about other extremists for cash. Referring to the links to the secret services Adebolajo said during the trial: 'There's a lot more to the story but I won't mention that.' A friend of Michael Adebolajo, Abu Baraa, told ITV News that the claimed approaches by MI5 became too much. He said: 'I think he felt that MI5 were destroying his life and that his life as he knew it was over and he had no control over his own future and I think he wanted to take that control into his own hands rather than leaving it up to MI5. 'After he was brought back to Britain, he felt he was driven into a corner.' An HM Courts and Tribunals Service . spokeswoman confirmed Jeremiah Adebolajo was banned from the Old Bailey 'for . security reasons' but this was later lifted.","Jeremiah Adebolajo says Lee Rigby's murder had 'obvious' justification .

"Apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020, putting it in direct competition with rivals Tesla Motors and General Motors, according to an industry expert. Evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market, just as it did with smartphones and tablets. Images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests Apple is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years. Scroll down for video . Bloomberg has claimed that Apple could have a car ready by 2020, based on images of a test car. After the first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, further sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online, with equipment on top (shown here) According to Tim Higgins from Bloomberg, automakers 'typically spend five to seven years developing a car'. And a 2020 timeframe would underscore Apple's 'aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.' Both of those are planning to release a sub-£26,000 ($40,000) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles (320km) on a single charge. Steve LeVine, author of 'The Powerhouse,' a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday: 'Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.' This latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera-mounted cars registered to Apple in the US last week. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. And rumours range from a Street View-style mapping service to an electric car that will rival Tesla or a self-driving van to rival Google. The Californian footage was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. The Florida recording was filmed on a highway in Coral Springs and uploaded by Apple Insider. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside. The passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view, while the driver points to the camera and drives off. The Florida recording (pictured) was filmed in Coral Springs. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view . Other reports have spotted the vans in Hawaii and Wisconsin. The latest vans haven't officially been confirmed as belonging to Apple, but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are. The far-reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims Apple is developing a mapping service. With 12 cameras on top of the car, however, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. Plus, reports recently claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. This project has been dubbed 'Titan'. This Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away -  and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects. The Wall Street Journal added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago. The Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto . These reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car. An unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'  It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. Last year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) Alternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured)","Bloomberg has claimed that Apple could have a car ready by 2020 .

"Care worker Melissa Swift admitted trying to kill three of her colleagues by poisoning them with bleach . A care home worker could be jailed for life after admitting trying to kill three of her colleagues by poisoning them with bleach. Melissa Swift pleaded guilty to attempting to murder her co-workers at Goldfield Court in West Bromwich in July and August last year. The 23-year-old was arrested after 32 people showed signs of food poisoning at the home which provides care for the elderly. She had tried to spread a 'bleach-type oxidant' in her colleagues' drinks, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The fridge was in a communal area which may have been accessed by residents at the home. Swift - a former police special constable - also admitted to sending two letters threatening to kill the recipients, of which one was sent to her sister, Lulla Swift. Swift admitted three counts of attempted murder - which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison - and two counts of threatening to kill at Birmingham Crown Court today. The court heard how Swift was attempting to kill three colleagues - Amy Garbett, Billy McCann, and Sharon Moss - by poisoning them when dozens took ill at the home in August. Adrian Keeling, prosecuting, said: 'It's the case she intended to poison three of her colleagues at Goldfield Court, and made threats to kill on two other individuals.' She was arrested in August after 32 people suffered headaches, nausea and diarrhoea at the home. Police searched the home and seized 400 drinks and food items from fridges in communal and private areas. Among those who took ill was a resident in her 90s. Four people were hospitalised as a result of the incident though all made a good recovery. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Michaela Kerr, who led the investigation, said Swift's offending against 'vulnerable people in a care home setting' was 'particularly heinous'. Officers launched an inquiry when they had a tip-off regarding Swift about 'a change in her behaviour'. Swift tried to spread a 'bleach-type oxidant' in her colleagues' drinks at Goldfield Court care home in West Bromwich . DCI Kerr said: 'She told someone things like 'I feel like I'm going to hurt somebody', and 'I'm going to hurt people'.' It also emerged that Swift had been a special constable with West Midlands Police until the month prior to her arrest, when she resigned. DCI Kerr added that Swift 'deceived her colleagues and hatched a plan to cause ill to those she worked with as a result of some malice, for which we have never truly discovered the cause'. She said: 'She not only thought out a way of poisoning her workmates but also followed the plan through and administered bleach to their drinks, leaving them in the usual staff fridge where she knew they would go. 'The plan was dangerous, reckless and hugely alarming. We do know that the poisons were administered into drinks that everybody in that care home had access to.' 'There is nothing to have stopped anyone from consuming the drinks she tampered with and, given the nature of her profession and workplace as a care provider, she went against everything her dedicated colleagues worked for. 'Thankfully, no one was seriously injured as a result of what she did, but the story could so easily have been different.' Police officers remove evidence after 32 people at the home fell ill following the poisoning of drinks by Swift . Care home resident Brenda Stephenson, 89, a grandmother-of-four who has lived at the home for two and a half years, said: 'She was always really nice and polite and seemed to enjoy her job as far as I could see. 'But you never know how people really feel on the inside and she was very quiet. Nobody could believe it when she was arrested, it shocked everybody here. 'If you can't trust carers, who can you trust? She deserved everything she gets. 'We had police here going through all our fridges at the time, it was very surreal and extremely concerning. You expect carers to care for you, not to try and kill you.' Another resident Michael Peach, 72, who has lived at the care home for two years, added: 'Police emptied our fridges and they just left my loaf of bread. 'They even took my jellied eels. I am really shocked by it all.' Goldfield Court is described as 'extra care housing' for older people. There are 93 flats at the site, run by Housing & Care 21. The development includes lounges, a restaurant, a hair salon, a guest suite, an activity room and gardens for residents. Flats can be rented rented or purchased under a shared ownership scheme and start at more than £33,000 for a quarter share and £107,000 for a 75 per cent share. In its most recent inspection of the sheltered housing complex, independent regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found the site was meeting all standards. A routine inspection carried out in October last year concluded the measures in place 'protected people who lived there from the risk of harm and abuse'. Swift, who was remanded in custody, will be sentenced in April.","Melissa Swift admitted trying to poison three colleagues at Goldfield Court .

"It can be tricky to know how much money to save from one month to the next, especially when balancing budgets and having to pay out for unexpected bills. But a new  service takes the hassle out of this by securely tracking your spending habits and automatically saving a small amount for you each week. Named Digit, the service only transfers what it thinks you can afford and adjusts this amount accordingly to help you easily build up a nest egg. Each time a Digit account is opened and linked to a bank account, the service automatically sets up a savings account for that user (pictured). Once or twice a week, Digit transfers money from the bank to the Digit savings account based on how much money the user has, and how much they’ve been spending recently . Digit was designed in San Francisco and connects to bank accounts to analyse income and spending. Each time an account is opened and linked to a bank account, Digit automatically sets up a savings account for that user. Once or twice a week, Digit transfers money from the bank to the Digit savings account based on how much money the user has, and how much they’ve been spending recently. Digit securely and anonymously connects to bank accounts and analyses income and spending. Each time an account is opened and linked to a bank account, Digit automatically sets up a savings account for the user. The website uses 256-bit bank-level security, and doesn’t store bank login details. A user’s information is anonymised, encrypted and securely stored and all funds held within Digit are insured up to a balance of $250,000 (£162,750). This is typically between $5 (£3) and $50 (£32) but is never more than the user can afford. Over time, the service uses a built-in algorithm to learn more about the user’s spending habits and adjust payments accordingly. And if the user ever needs extra money, they can transfer it back at any time for free. To transfer money, users just need to send Digit a text and they will release the funds back to the account. ‘Digit automatically figures out when and how much is safe to save based on your lifestyle,’ explained the firm. ‘Digit doesn't require you to figure out an arbitrary amount to transfer every month. ‘We believe so strongly in our math and the ability to safely identify money you don't need that if we overdraft your account we'll pay the fee.’ Accounts can be accessed and managed using the mobile site or desktop dashboard.

"Almost 500,000 unemployed people have had their welfare payments suspended for between four weeks and up to three years for breaching rules. The Department of Work and Pensions said that jobseekers can have their benefits stopped if they fail to apply for enough jobs, turn down a job offer, or turn up late or fail to show for interviews at their local Job Centre. The DWP confirmed that 466,000 Jobseeker's Allowance Claimants (JSA) were sanctioned in the year ending September 2014. Work and Pension secretary Iain Duncan Smith announced today almost 500,000 people on Jobseeker's Allowance have been sanctioned for failing to adhere to the rules governing their attempts to find a new job . However, the figure was approximately 100,000 less than the previous twelve months. According to the DWP: 'Sanctions are a necessary part of the benefits system, encouraging people to engage with the support on offer. More than 70 per cent of claimants say they are more likely to follow the rules if they know they risk having their benefits stopped.' The DWP said that staff only sanction claimants as a last resort and only in a small number of cases. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The vast majority of people on benefits want to work - and take up all the support on offer to move into a job. We can see this from the record numbers of people in work and falling unemployment. 'But where people don’t play by the rules: don’t accept the support on offer, or refuse to take work, it’s only right that there should be consequences. 'Sanctions are a key part of the contract we have with jobseekers. We must not forget that it is hardworking British taxpayers who fund the welfare system, and we have a duty to them to ensure their taxes are spent fairly.' Job hunters can have their benefits stopped for four weeks if they are late for a Jobcentre interview . The newly released figures show that approximately six per cent of claimants are sanctioned in any given month. In total, between October 2013 and September 2014 the 724,000 sanctions were issued against jobseekers. Some of those jobseekers were sanctioned more than once. In the previous 12 months, there were 894,000 sanctions. The new figures show that 35 per cent of those sanctioned had failed to actively look for work. Almost one in three refused to participate in employment programmes to help with job hunting, while just under a quarter - 24 per cent - missed a meeting at the Jobcentre without good reason. However, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warned that benefits sanctions can be counter productive. A spokesman said: 'Benefit sanctions are disproportionately affecting young people under 25, and there is evidence of severe impacts on homeless people and other vulnerable groups; . 'International evidence indicates that benefit sanctions substantially raise exits from benefits, and may increase short-term job entry; but there are unfavourable longer-term outcomes for earnings, job quality and employment retention. 'There are concerns that welfare conditionality can have unintended consequences, including: distancing people from support; causing hardship and even destitution; displacing rather than resolving issues such as street homelessness and anti-social behaviour; and negative impacts on ""third parties"", particularly children.' Jobseekers can face intermediate and higher level sanctions depending on the nature and frequency of their mistakes. Intermediate sanctions can see benefits suspended for between four and 13 weeks and can be invoked for failing to show up for interviews, refusing to engage with employing schemes or failing to update a CV. The first sanction normally leads to a four week suspension, while a repeat within the same year sees benefits stopped for 13 weeks. Higher level sanctions apply if someone is sacked for misconduct from their last job, or left the job without good reason. Jobseekers who fail to apply for suitable positions recommended by Jobcentre staff can also be hit with higher level sanctions. The first higher level sanction is 13 weeks without benefits followed by 26 weeks for a second error. A third higher level sanction within 12 months attracts a three year suspension.","Almost 500,000 people had their Jobseeker's Allowance stopped last year .

"The smile on 11-year-old Tanjin's face as he plays football on the tiny island of Lampedusa hides the life-threatening journey he took to get there. He is one of 2,000 asylum seekers to land on Italy's southern port since last weekend - having risked their lives crossing the rough Mediterranean waters on smuggling boats. The Eritrean boy left his family behind and if he is sent back too, he faces being conscripted into the country's military. For that reason, the boy is likely to remain in Europe where he will continue his education. Escaped: 11-year-old Tanjin left his family behind in Eritrea and he faces military conscription if he is sent back . Refugees: Tenjin (right) is one of 2,000 asylum seekers to land on Italy's southern port since last weekend . New life: Many of the migrants who landed in Lampadusa this week risked their lives crossing the rough Mediterranean waters on rickety smuggling boats . Alone: Youngsters like Tenjin will be transferred to a reception centre on the mainland that specialises in dealing with minors who reach the country unaccompanied . Hope: Despite the harsh surroundings they find themselves in, many migrants seem happy to have escaped the horrors and conflicts of their home countries . He will now be transferred to a reception centre on the mainland that specialises in dealing with minors who reach the country alone. Several children did not survive the trip. As many as 300 migrants are thought to have drowned on the rough Mediterranean waters after being ordered to get on flimsy rubber dinghies from Libya. While Tanjin worked on his dribbling, Somali teenager Abdenajib was calling worried relatives back home. 'I am saying that I'm in Italy now, it's good. They see, I am saying that I haven't died,' he said after the conversation with his mother and sister who occupy a refugee camp in Kenya. Abdenajib acknowledges how lucky he was to survive a day and a half at sea - just days after 29 migrants had perished from exposure. And speaking through the chain-link fence at Lampedusa's migrant reception centre, the 15-year-old revealed his dream was to become a doctor. He said: 'I want help, I want to learn and education. I want to go to Norway.' Exodus: More than 170,000 migrants from the Africa, the Middle East and South Asia landed in Italy last year . Survivor: As many as 300 migrants drowned crossing the Mediterranean on flimsy rubber dinghies in Libya . Suriviors: These girls who wait anxiously for a ferry to Sicily are lucky, having survived the dangerous Mediterranean waters . Fleeing terror: Some of the migrants in Lampedusa were forced to flee the violent spread of militancy in Libya . Breaking point: Lampedusa struggled to cope with a huge influx of newly-arrived migrants as aid organisations warned the Libya crisis means thousands more could be on their way . His journey began in Kenya, from where he travelled through Uganda and Sudan before finally reaching the Libyan capital Tripoli. There, he handed over £700 to smugglers for the boat trip to Italy. Most of the migrants on Lampedusa - including Adam from Mali - were rescued by the Italian coastguard or by merchant ships. He said: 'We were in the first boat and that's why we didn't have problems because Italians took us in when the waves started coming towards us. 'As for me, I need Italian citizenship. Here, we are all tired. Since I left the north of Mali until now, there have been issues.' Mass emigration: More than 5,000 migrants - including those fleeing the Libya crisis - have arrived in Italy since the start of January alone which is a 59 per cent increase on the same time last year . Death at sea: More than 300 African migrants are believed to have died at sea this week alone, some of which are trying to escape the spread of militancy in Libya . Danger: Most of the migrants on Lampedusa were rescued by the Italian coastguard or by merchant ships . The sudden surge in arrivals has stretched the island's reception facilities to breaking point as the centre struggles to deal with three times the number of migrants it was designed to. More than 170,000 migrants from the Africa, the Middle East and South Asia landed in Italy last year and the trend since the start of the year suggests that number will be surpassed in 2015. Amnesty International said the European Union's limited coastal patrol operation off Italy was desperately ill-equipped to cope with the soaring numbers. Its spokesperson said: 'Unless the void of Italy's now defunct lifesaving Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation is filled, refugees and migrants will continue to die in great numbers at sea.'","Tanjin from Eritrea is among 2,000 to land on the Island in the last five days .

The hacks are thought to have taken place in 2010 and 2011 and led to the theft of 300,000 keys from Somalia, Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Serbia, Iceland and Tajikistan. SIM heist: GCHQ slides revealed the spy agency wanted to steal encryption keys which help keep mobile communications private . Security breech: GCHQ also planted 'malicious software' on Gemalto's computers to obtain encryption keys and boasted in a slide:  'Successfully implanted several machines and believe we have their entire network' Phone intercepts: Leaked documents given to The Intercept by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) revealed how the American agency and British-based GCHQ hacked into a Dutch company . With these encryption keys, the intelligence agencies would have the ability to collect both voice and data information - such as text messages - from a large portion of the world's communications. The keys are used to decipher the communications between mobile phones and their network providers which would otherwise be received as a 'garbled mess'. Stealing them also sidesteps the need to get permission from telecom companies or a warrant for a wire-tap - and it leaves no trace on the wireless provider's network that communications have been hacked into. The Intercept claims GCHQ planted malicious software on several of Gemalto's computers to gain access to its internal network in order to obtain these keys. It also received slides from GCHQ in which the author boasted: 'Successfully implanted several machines and believe we have their entire network.' The encrypted connection between a mobile device and its wireless network is what keeps the communications private. And all mobile communications on a phone depend on the SIM card which guards this encryption key. In some countries, the electronic chips are even used to transfer money safely. An encryption key known as a 'Ki' is burned onto them when they are manufactured and a copy of this key is also given to the mobile provider, which is how they recognise a phone on its network. When a mobile connects to its wireless provider - and the Ki's match up - it creates a 'secret handshake' which is encrypted. Even if GCHQ intercepted the phone call, it would be interpreted as a garbled mess. But by stealing the encryption keys, it can decrypt this information and essentially listen into the phone calls and intercept text messages. A document from the NSA revealed the US agency could process between 12 and 22 million keys by 2009, which could later be used to spy on targets. It predicted that more than 50 million keys could be accessed every second in the future. The GCHQ's operation to target Gemalto was called 'Dapino Gamma' and in 2011, it launched an attempt to harvest the email accounts of Gemalto employees in France and Poland. A top-secret document said one of the aims of the operation was 'getting into French HQ' of Gemalto - one of its global headquarters - 'to get into core data repositories'. It also wanted to intercept the private communications of employees in Poland which 'could lead to penetration into one or more' of the factories where the encryption keys were burned onto the SIM cards. Another GCHQ document from May 2011 indicated it was in the process of 'targeting' more than a dozen Gemalto facilities across the globe including in Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Singapore. The file also suggested GCHQ was preparing similar key theft operations against one of Gemalto's competitors - German SIM card giants Giesecke and Devrient. It also penetrated 'authentication servers' which allow it to decrypt data and voice communications between a target's mobile phone and the connection it makes with its network provider. An accompanying slide read: 'Very happy with the data so far and working through the vast quantity of product.' Oblivious: Gemalto was unaware of the hack and the spying on its employees according to its executive vice president Paul Beverly, who told The Intercept: 'I'm disturbed, quite concerned that this has happened' Line of duty: A GCHQ spokesperson said: 'All of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate' As part of the covert operations against Gemalto, spies from GCHQ who were supported by the NSA mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiple countries. Gemalto was unaware of the hack and the spying on its employees according to its executive vice president Paul Beverly. The company which brought in £1.7billion in revenue in 2013 - and provides SIM cards for billions of people - is a global leader in digital security, producing banking cards, mobile payment systems, two-factor authentication devices used for online security, hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices, electronic passports and identification cards. The Dutch multi-national, whose motto is 'security to be free' provides chips to Vodafone in Europe, France's Orange and EE in the UK. Royal KPN, the largest Dutch wireless network provider, also uses Gemalto technology. In Asia, Gemalto's chips are used by China Unicom, Japan's NTT and Taiwan's Chungwa Telecom, as well as scores of wireless network providers throughout Africa and the Middle East. The company's security technology is used by more than 3,000 financial institutions and 80 government organizations. Among its clients are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JP Morgan Chase and Barclays. It also provides chips for use in luxury cars, including those made by Audi and BMW. He told The Intercept: 'I'm disturbed, quite concerned that this has happened. 'The most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done, so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesn't happen again, and also to make sure that there's no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years. 'What I want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has, or could have, on any of our customers.' A spokesperson from GCHQ said it does not comment on intelligence matters, but added: 'All of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the Secretary of State, the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. 'All our operational processes rigorously support this position. In addition, the UK's interception regime is entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.' A spokeswoman for Gemalto said the manufacturer has so far 'made no links' between previous hacking attempts it was already aware of and the new reports. She said: 'We take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate and understand the scope of such highly sophisticated technique to try to obtain SIM card data. 'There have been many reported state sponsored attacks as of late, that all have gained attention both in the media and amongst businesses, this truly emphasises how serious cyber security is in this day and age.'","America's NSA allegedly worked with British intelligence agency GCHQ .

Brosnan, who was home with  Smith and two of his sons at the time, Dylan and Paris, could be seen distraught as he spoke on his phone while firefighters put out the blaze. TMZ report that Brosnan said in his 911 call 'I've got to go now in case I get blown up.' Investigators stayed on the scene at the 13,000 square-foot residence for hours after the blaze was put out as they tried to determine what the cause was. One neighbor, Andy Stern, claimed; 'Their last house totally burned down several years ago, then it took them several years to build this house.'

"It's coming up to two years she left her spot on The View after 10 years, amid widespread reports she was  fired. And it seems Elizabeth Hasselbeck, the co-host of Fox & Friends, is still bitter over how she departed her old stomping ground. The 37-year-old is set to appear on the Rachael Ray Show on Tuesday, but a teaser of the interview obtained by People shows she doesn't hold back when discussing her time at the panel. 'No. I've done my time,' she said. 'I did my time, I was outta there.' Scroll down for video . Never going back: Elizabeth Hasselbeck says on an upcoming episode of the Rachael Ray Show that she has 'done my time' at The View and will not go back . 'I was outta there': Hasselbeck spoke with Rachael Rat about her time at The View in an interview that will air Tuesday . 'I was thankful to have the decade that I did there … and, you know what? 'You break up with me, I'm not going to kiss you!' Ray was questioning whether Hasselbeck would ever return to the ABC panel, even if just 'for a few days', amid a major shakeup at the show. Hasselbeck said she does not watch The View anymore and is not aware of the goings-on. In January, news that new host Rosie Perez was about to be pulled from lineup leaked to the media. The leak is said to have forced ABC bosses to change their mind about how to handle Perez, who is on contract until August. Then, on February 6, Rosie O'Donnell abruptly quit. She said she needed to focus on her family in the wake of the breakdown of her two-year marriage to wife Michelle Rounds. Old times: Hasselbeck appeared on The View from 2003 to 2013, when she was said to be fired . The 52-year-old married Rounds in June 2012 and the couple adopted a baby daughter named Dakota the following year. The two split in November, though remain close it seems, with O'Donnell posting a photo of Rounds on her Instagram account on Christmas Eve. O'Donnell also has daughters Chelsea and Vivienne and son Blake from her first marriage to Kelli Carpenter, and son Parker who she adopted in 1995. O'Donnell announced in 2009 that Carpenter had moved out two years earlier, and she started dating Rounds in the summer of 2011. The View's flailing ratings have also called into question the future of the show. Hasselbeck, meanwhile, left The View in July 2013. Earlier, in March, inside sources at ABC said she was set to be fired, after viewer polling showed she did not resonate with the audience. Viewers reportedly thought Hasselbeck was too conservative. Flashback: Hosts of The View Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters and Sherri Shepherd attend an event together in New York in 2009 . Barbara Walters, then still leading the panel, said at the time the rumors were false. But ABC announced Hasselbeck was leaving on July 9, and her last day was July 10. In September 2013 she joined Fox News' Fox & Friends, where she says she remains more than happy. 'It's a great mix where we are,' Hasselbeck told Ray. 'I have to say, Steve (Doocy) and Brian (Kilmeade) are so funny and interesting and wise and smart. 'And they take such good care of me.' 'They take care of me': Hasselbeck is now a cohost of Fox & Friends, alongside Steve Doocy (left) and Brian Kilmeade (right).

"When launched in 2006, the Emma Maersk shipping container was the world's largest of its kind ever built. And now these stunning photographs show just how huge the massive vessel is. Built by the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group, the ship measured 397 m (1,302 ft)long, its beam measured 56 m (184 ft), its draught is 16.02 m (52.6 ft) and it reached a depth of 30 m (98 ft). Named after Emma Mærsk, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller's late wife, it can carry up to 170,794 gross tonnes, and can reach speeds of 25.5 knots (29.3 mph). The biggest boat: Measuring in at almost a quarter-mile long, it can carry more cargo than a 41-mile-long train . Gloomy: The vast amount of cargo seen here shows the huge capacity the shipping container has . The main engine of a PS-class vessel such as the EMMA MÆRSK produces 109,000 horsepower, equal to that of 1,156 family cars . The yawning proportions of the ship make it difficult to comprehend - but one photographer took the opportunity to try and capture the dimensions of the vessel . Her maiden voyage took her from Aarhus, stopping by Gothenburg,Algeciras, the Suez Canal, before landing in Singapore in just three weeks during 2006. She made headlines that year when she was nicknamed SS Santa because she carried tonnes of Christmas goods from China to the UK. Professional German photographer Jakob Wagner took pictures of the massive ship and compiled them into a photo series of his own dubbed Container, PetaPixel reported. He captured the life of the container - from the loading of the ship's cargo in Rotterdam, to it's 100-mile journey across the English Channel to Felixstowe, and the daily routine and sights. Making waves: Combined, the accommodation and bridge of a PS-class vessel are as high as a twelve-storey building .

Wagner successfully completed his three-year apprenticeship as a photographer in 2008. He lives in Duesseldorf, where he mainly works as a freelance photographer, image editor and photo assistant. His work has taken him to many different countries around the world - including the middle east, Carribean and China. Maersk Line is the core liner shipping business of the A.P. Moller – Maersk Group, and one of the leading container shipping companies in the world. The Maersk Line fleet comprises more than 600 vessels and a number of containers corresponding to more than 4,100,000 TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit – a container 20 feet long). Her maiden voyage took her from Aarhus, stopping by Gothenburg,Algeciras, the Suez Canal, before landing in Singapore in just three weeks during 2006 . In theory, a PS-vessel like the Emma Mærsk could transport approximately 528 million bananas in a single voyage - enough to give every person in Europe or North America a banana for breakfast .

"A report card detailing future Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's time as a schoolboy in Iraq has revealed the bloodthirsty Sunni extremist struggled with English and had to repeat his final year. Despite his current role as the head of a terror organisation that has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of the Middle East, Baghdadi's tutors describe him as a 'well behaved' student. The certificate - which addresses Baghdadi by his real name Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim  - goes on to detail his talent for mathematics and love of geography at Samarra High School for Boys, the latter of which perhaps helps to explain the brutal expansionist policies of his self-declared caliphate. Despite his progress in certain subjects, Baghdadi failed his final year in 1990 at the age of 18 or 19 and was forced to resit his exams - almost certainly alongside younger students. Leader: Passport photos attached to the top of the documents show a young man with thick eyebrows who bears a striking resemblance to the extremist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi' Engaged: The certificate - which addresses Baghdadi by his real name Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim - details his talent for mathematics and love of geography at Samarra High School for Boys . The Samarra High School for Boys certificate calls Baghdadi by his real name Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim, although it does not use his tribal suffix al-Badr. It also names his parents as being individuals named Awad and Alia - something an education official familiar with Baghdadi's background later confirmed as correct, according to the Washington Post. The document - first published by the German broadcaster ARD on Wednesday - describes Baghdadi as a student with a solid 80 per cent average score. He performed far better in some subjects than others, however, soaring ahead with a 98 per cent average score in maths, 90 per cent in geography - but only 57 per cent in English, meaning he only scraped a pass grade by just seven per cent. Interestingly for somebody who now speaks in an elaborate and difficult to master classical Arabic whenever delivering his radical sermons, Baghdadi was a fairly average Arabic student at school, scoring an 81 per cent pass grade. The Samarra High School for Boys certificate calls Baghdadi by his real name Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim, although it does not use his tribal suffix al-Badr. Pages: The document - first published by the German broadcaster ARD on Wednesday - describes Baghdadi as a student with a solid 80 per cent average score . Transformation: Since announcing himself as leader of the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi's bloodthirsty thugs have carried out thousands of brutal executions in the region . Yesterday it emerged that Baghdadi was once a secretary working in office administration. The terrorist was captured by American soldiers in 2004 in Iraq, and records from the time have revealed his life before he turned to terror. The declassified documents show that al-Baghdadi - registered under his full name of Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badr - was held for 10 months in a military prison in the south of the country. Spectacles: Yesterday it emerged that Baghdadi was once a secretary working in office admin . The terrorist's status was listed as 'civilian detainee', which means he was not then officially thought to be an insurgent. His occupation was written as 'Administrative Work (Secretary)'. He was registered as married, and an uncle is listed as being his next of kin - although all of his relatives' names have been redacted. It is believed he was detained during a raid aimed at arresting his friend, named as Nessayif Numan Nessayif, in Fallujah. The records, obtained by Business Insider, were released through a Freedom of Information Act request. Although his date of birth is also redacted, he is believed to be 43-years old-and has a wife and a young son. Friends of al-Baghdadi have previously told of how he was a talented footballer, with one former team-mate even describing him as the 'Lionel Messi of our team'. He was also remembered as a shy and unassuming young man who was interested in religious studies, before his radicalisation to a dangerous extremist. Since rising to power within the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi's brutal thugs have shocked the world with their sadistic and savage murder of thousands of people in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The terror group - believed to have more than 30,000 soldiers - have revelled in posting graphic images and videos of murders including beheadings and burning victims alive. There is a $10 million bounty on Baghdadi's head after the US State Department listed him as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist'. Making them rich: Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul (pictured) over the past few weeks . Militants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters . He was seen publicly in a slick propaganda video last July for the first time in years, sporting a long beard and black robes to deliver a sermon. Speaking in Mosul's central Mosque, Baghdadi announced that the lands his group had conquered were now part of the new Islamic State and announced himself as the 'caliph' or leader. Under his leadership, ISIS has spearheaded a militant offensive that has overrun much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland since June after seizing major territory in neighbouring Syria, and carried out a series of atrocities in both countries. During their domination in the area, the group have been pegged back in recent weeks due to a series of air strikes which have resulted in deaths and the loss of important strategic locations. It was rumored that he was killed or wounded by a US airstrike last November, but the group moved to quash this by releasing an audio recording purporting to be him, in which he encouraged militants to attack Saudi Arabia.","Terror leader was described as 'well behaved' in school report issued by staff at Samarra High School for Boys .

"A screening of hit-film Fifty Shades of Grey turned ugly when two gangs of women clashed in the cinema aisles. The screaming match took place at Barnsley's Parkway cinema during the Valentine's Day showing of E.L. James' raunchy blockbuster. The row became so heated it drowned out the closing soundtrack of the movie - which meant many disgruntled cinema-goers missed the climax. The two gangs of women clashed in cinema aisles at Barnsley's Parkway cinema (pictured) One said: 'There was a group of women, I won't call them ladies, who were talking loudly and laughing all the way through the film. 'Someone asked them to be quiet but things turned nasty and they just got louder. 'I couldn't hear any of the dialogue. I had been looking forward to seeing the film for weeks and then I completely missed the end because of those stupid idiots.' The screaming match took place at a screening of Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Dakota Johnson (pictured) Another said: 'Things got a bit heated and people were arguing and telling them to be quiet, it just spoiled the whole night. 'These were middle-aged women who were just idiots and who didn't know how to behave in a cinema.' Cinema owner Rob Younger said: 'I have been in the business for a long but I have never seen anything like this before. 'Quite clearly these people didn't know how to behave in a cinema even though they were of an age where you think they would. 'We were really shocked by the behaviour of a handful of people and they have now been banned from the building. 'We were aware of all the hype about the film and I must admit I expected the audience to get a be excited at the first showing because there has been a lot of publicity over the film. 'But you don't expect women of a certain age to behave in this way. When we have films which are aimed at small children we expect them to get a bit giddy, excited and loud. 'We gently try to calm them down and tell them they can't talk over the film like they might do at home if they were watching television. 'You wouldn't think you would have to do that with so-called adults. We spoke to them but it didn't seem to make any difference.' The heated argument between two groups of women at the Barnsley cinema drowned out the ending of the film . Police were called to the Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's Ashton Lane (pictured) on Saturday after witnesses said a group of women had got drunk before attacking a man who asked them to be quiet . On the same night, police arrested three women at a screening of the film in Glasgow after reports a man was glassed. Officers were called to the city's Grosvenor cinema after reports a group of 'drunk and rowdy' women had turned violent. Witnesses said movie-goers were vomiting in the aisles of the cinema - where alcoholic drinks are served - before the alleged attack. It is reported a man asked the group to keep the noise down when he was attacked  by one of the women. Witnesses said cinema staff were left cleaning up blood from the cinema floor after the incident. On Wednesday, police were called to the Century Cinema in Clacton-on-Sea, in Essex, after a similar incident. Police arrested a 22-year-old  on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly and for assault. Adam Cunard, the cinema's managing director, said: 'It was very unfortunate for this to happen. 'Most people understood and we have given refunds and extra tickets to future performances.'","Heated row took place at Parkway cinema, Barnsley, on Valentine's Day .

"It's a scene most parents will hope they never have to see - the sight of their child self-harming. But this nightmare scenario became a reality for Sara Matthews, 40, who walked into the kitchen in her Bristol home one day to find her seven-year-old daughter, Charlie, clutching a knife. 'I walked into the kitchen and found Charlie with a knife against her wrists, it was horrific,' the mother recalled on today's This Morning. Scroll down for video . Sara Matthews, 40, pictured on today's This Morning, left, where she revealed she once caught her daughter, Charlie, 11, pictured right, holding a knife to her wrists because she was so unhappy . Charlie told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she no longer feels suicidal as she did when she was seven as she has been transferred to a specialist school after being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome . The mother later learnt her daughter didn't just intend to hurt herself but end her life as she had left a suicide note at her primary school. Presenter Ruth Langsford, a mother-of-one, said it sounded like something from a horror movie and asked Sara how she dealt with the situation. 'I had to remain calm for her but I wanted to cry and scream,' Sara said. 'I had to calm her down and took her outside and we sat on her swing set and talked about she she felt. She kept saying she felt different, that something was wrong and she didn't fit in.' Sara and her husband Keyton, 42, had noticed that their daughter had become more withdrawn but they had no idea why - or how serious the situation had become. 'It started when she as about six, she started to say she didn't like herself, and often had emotional outbursts. Charlie said she used to feel different and like she didn't fit in but with the support of her family and medical intervention, she now 'likes being who I am' 'She found social settings were bewildering as she often misread people's expressions. This made her withdrawn and she started wanting to miss school.' Sara couldn't understand why her daughter was feeling like such an outsider as she had attended the same, small private school since she was 18-months-old so knew all her classmates well. 'I couldn't blame myself, I knew something was going on with Charlie,' Sara said. After the terrifying incident in the kitchen, Sara took her daughter to see a doctor who prescribed anti-depressants. She was also referred to a specialist who diagnosed her with Asperger's syndrome, an autistic spectrum disorder. The condition affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour and can lead to sufferers feeling anxious and depressed. Charlie told parents watching if their children are self-harming: 'One day they will come round and it will be better but it will take a while' (file photo) Thanks to the medication she was given, the support of her family and being transferred to a specialist school where they have expert counsellors, Charlie, now 11, said she's now feeling much better. She joined her mother on the This Morning sofa to tell Ruth and Eamonn Holmes: 'I'm at a much better school now, I'm enjoying school and have lots of friends. The teachers are supportive and I get a lot of attention.' For any parents of children who have been self-harming, Charlie had the following advice: 'One day they will come round and it will be much better but it will take a while.' Her mother added that it helps if the child can find something they 'love and are passionate about.' For Charlie, it was discovering a love of beauty pageants which she now enjoys competing in and supporting charities by taking part in fundraising events. Charlie, who appeared on the ITV show in a colourful, pretty party dress, said she's now realised: 'I like being who I am.' She was invited to share her story on the show after it has been revealed that the number of children ending up in A&E after suffering a mental health crisis has almost doubled since 2010. This week is Children's Mental Health Week, which aims to raise awareness of these troubled children and how they can be helped. Earlier this week, the Duchess of Cambridge recorded a video message showing her support. Kate, 33, said that she and her husband the Duke of Cambridge have seen how many children struggle to cope with bullying, bereavement, family breakdown and other issues, which can lead to depression, anxiety, addiction and self-harm. The pregnant mother-of-one said the stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help they so badly need, and this needs to change. She said: 'Both William and I sincerely believe that early action can prevent problems in childhood from turning into larger ones later in life.'","Sara Matthews found daughter, Charlie, 7, clutching a knife in their kitchen .

"The French may find our British love scenes a little passe but it's our sense of humour that attracts viewers around the world. A study found that British humour is the most popular reason why homegrown TV shows enjoy an international audience. The quality of content came second, closely followed by the love of a British accent. But our saucy scenes were not so popular with the French ranking portrayal of romance in the UK as their least favourite reason for tuning into British programmes (4 per cent). And Italians did not rate them much higher at 6 per cent. Scroll down for video . The latest series of popular Downton Abbey may be set in the 1920s, but that hasn't stopped it showing some saucy scenes between Lady Mary and Lord Tony Gillingham . But in India, they are a big hit with just under a quarter of people confessing their appreciation of a British love scene, with around 17 per cent of viewers in Mexico also a fan. The British sense of humour is particularly popular in Germany, China, the US, and Australia, researchers, who sampled viewers in 10 countries, found. The depiction of English characters and a love of original British dramas completed the top five reasons why people watch British shows. While food shows are popular at home, only 8 per cent of US viewers, 5 per cent of French and 4 per cent of Japanese say they have any interest in watching shows from British kitchens. The scenes between EastEnders' Max and Tanya were described as the soap's sexiest ever moment for their torrid affair . But around a quarter of Chinese and Indian respondents have an appetite for British cuisine. Quintessential English characters go down well with Chinese viewers - with a third declaring their love for an English gentlemen or rose - as well as Japanese and Mexican viewers. Paul Dempsey, president of global markets for BBC Worldwide which commissioned the study, said: 'The international demand for British TV shows is clear. This survey shows it is the range and quality of our programming that keeps global audiences coming back for more.' Researchers sampled over 10,000 people between the ages of 16 to 64. EastEnders . The affair between characters Max and Tanya has created some of the show's sexiest scenes. The former lovers were seen meeting for secret sex sessions all over Albert Square, with the chance of getting caught seemingly only serving to increase the passion. Sharing a steamy embrace with her estranged husband, Tanya's new husband almost catches them  in the act at the car lot where Tanya rips off her clothes and Max pulls down his trousers. But the pair manage to go undetected and ultimately, the affair lasts much of the summer. I, Claudius . The 1976 historical drama from the BBC charting the lives of the Julian emperors was ahead of its time when it came to the shocking sex scene where Claudius'  insatiable wife Messalina challenges a representative of the Guild of Prostitutes into a whore-off to see who can sleep with the most men. Eventually the call girl staggers out in a disheveled state while Messalini continues and merrily shouts 'Come back you whore! We haven't finished!' Tipping the Velvet . An uncensored BBC adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's love story between young woman Nan and a male impersonator Kitty. The coming of age drama focuses on their budding lesbian relationship and the lusty yet tender erotic scenes did not shy away from the use of sex toys. The Inbetweeners . In true Inbetweeners style, the sex scene between Will and Charlotte wasn't as much saucy as horribly cringeworthy. Hopeless virgin Will awkwardly flounders on top on top of popular Charlotte as she attempts to give him instructions until eventually giving up. Not the hottest of British sex scenes but surely one of the funniest. Downton Abbey . It may be set in the 1920s but that hasn't stopped Downton Abbey having plenty of salacious moments. But it was the shocking relationship between  Lady Mary and Lord Tony Gillingham that stole the title for sexiest scene in the programme after Mary secretly checked into a hotel to road-test her potential husband. Mary even declares: ‘It hasn’t taken me to long to get used to sharing a bed again!’ Misfits . The British sci-fi series tells of a group of damaged youngsters with supernatural powers with a twist. Featuring a girl whose power was to make anyone lustful with the touch of a little finger, and a man who could remove others' superpowers through sexual intercourse, Misfits was always going to have many graphic sex scenes to choose from. But it was when lovable loser Simon- the butt of every joke- finally hooks up with bad girl Alisha in an explosion of frustrated teenage passion that made a memorable and surprisingly touching  scene.","British humour is most popular reason why our TV shows are loved abroad .
But our saucy scenes are far less popular - particularly in France and Italy .
British portrayal of romance was the last reason French watch UK TV .
However they're a big hit in India with a quarter watching for love scenes ."
"Postcards sketched by Britain's most notorious convict Charles Bronson worth thousands of pounds have been discovered in a drawer in a London art gallery. The collection of postcards, hand-drawn by Bronson, were found buried beneath old canvases and paper scraps and will now be offered for sale at the Zebra One Gallery in Hampstead, London. The owner of the gallery, Gabrielle du Plooy believes there will be a high demand from collectors, and has pledged to donate the money raised from the sale of the postcards to the families of Bronson's victims. The Birdman Of Broadmoor was one of the pieces of work found in the drawer of an art gallery . One of the most recent images of criminal Charles Bronson taken inside Wakefield Prison in June 2004 . Two hundred of the jailbird's works were sold for more than £30,000 at an auction in Leicestershire recently, coinciding with the discovery. In an attempt to distance himself from his violent past, the criminal has changed his last name to 'Salvador', in homage to surrealist artist, Salvador Dali. He is said to spend his days in his cell, painting and sketching to pass the time during his life sentence. Speaking about the postcards, Ms du Plooy said: 'They are ridiculous but you can certainly see the influence of Salvador Dali.' The postcards were originally procured by the gallery's former owner, Ms du Plooy's father, who acquired them from Bedlam Bar in Hampstead, which is now closed. The postcards are thought to be worth thousands of pounds . Manson changed his surname to Salvador after the artist Salvador Dali, it is thought he influenced his work . 'It was a very dark and dingy bar with loads of mad artwork on the walls,' said Ms du Plooy. 'You walked in and it was quite literally bedlam - there were chains and skulls everywhere. 'We were doing all their framing for them and we were given these postcards.' 'The pieces of art are authenticated by Bronson's own signature, along with a note that reads 'a Bronson creation'. 'The postcards are also annotated with the addresses of the prisons where the sketches were drawn, along with the convict's prison number: 1314.' A lot of the artworks show words such as Insanity and Asylum . The notorious convict signs each of the postcards to make his mark . This postcard called the Beast of Dartmoor features an angry looking man . The 61-year-old criminal is currently serving a life sentence in HM Full Sutton prison in York. He has spent 36 years in solitary confinement after numerous attacks on prison staff and fellow inmates, including instigating hostage incidents. But he recently hit headlines again when one of his pieces was stolen from a gallery in east London. The hardman - who was portrayed by Tom Hardy in the film Bronson - chillingly warned the thieves: 'Pray that I never catch up with you.' Despite being drawn by one of Britain's most notorious criminals this postcard is quite sweet in design . Charles marks his postcards with the words 'A BRONSON CREATION' This design features a pony with a small bird on the end of his nose . 1974: First jailed, aged 22, for armed robbery (seven years' jail) 1975: Attacked fellow prisoner with a glass jug (nine months' jail) 1985: A three-day rooftop protest at Walton Gaol caused £100K worth of damage (one year jail) 1988: Sent back to prison for robbing a jewellery shop (seven years' jail) 1992: Released from prison but shortly afterwards found guilty of intent to rob (eight years' jail) 1994: Holds prison librarian hostage, demanding inflatable doll, helicopter and cup of tea (eight years' jail) 1998: Takes three inmates hostage at Belmarsh.

"Halle Berry has revealed in a speech at unite4:good's unite4humanity gala that she watched her father beat her mom 'day after day after day'. The Oscar winner, 48, was being honored on Thursday for her work at the Jenesse Center, the oldest domestic violence intervention program in Los Angeles. 'I'm a victim of domestic violence,' she said during her speech. 'I wasn't married to a man that beat me up, but my mother was.' Scroll down for video . Halle Berry revealed in a speech  that she watched her father, Jerome Berry, beat her mom, Judith Hawkins, 'day after day after day' when she was a child . The Oscar winner was being honored at the unite4:good's unite4humanity gala on Thursday for her work at the Jenesse Center, the oldest domestic violence intervention program in Los Angeles . Berry, who began working at Jenesse 15 years ago, said she was just five years old when she witnessed her father, Jerome Berry, abusing her mother, Judith Hawkins, according to E! Online. She said that she watched her mother get 'kicked down stairs' and saw her get hit in the head with a wine bottle. Berry, who began working at Jenesse 15 years ago, said she was just five years old when she witnessed her father, Jerome Berry, abusing her mother . 'Knowing that she wanted nothing more than for her little girls to see her be empowered and be a woman of strength, but having no way to make that happen was heartbreaking for me,' Berry said during her speech. The abuse went on through Berry's childhood, Berry said: 'She stayed for too long and her children, my sister and I, saw far too much and I've suffered the damage of being a child of domestic violence.' 'The reason I say this organization is my heart and soul is because I understand the good that it does and the lives that it changes and the impact it has on women and the children in our community,' she added. In interviews over the years, Berry has alleged her late father was a violent alcoholic who beat her mother in front of her and sister. In a 2009 interview, Berry said: 'I saw my mother battered, and could not do anything to stop it. 'My father was tyrannical, lashing out at her for no reason. I felt the effects that had on our family - I’ve experienced what these women have gone through.' Berry has been in an ongoing custody battle over her daughter Nahla with her former boyfriend, Canadian model Gabriel Aubry, since they split in 2010. Though they have joint custody over Nahla, in November 2014, Berry hauled Aubry before a judge accusing him of chemically lightening and straightening the child's curly, brunette locks. Berry said that she watched her mother get 'kicked down stairs' and saw her get hit in the head with a wine bottle . Berry, who became the first African American woman to win an Academy Award, also accused Gabriel of making racial slurs against her. In her testimony, Berry said: 'I continue to worry about the potential psychological and physical damage to Nahla that can be caused by the use of chemical hair treatments and the psychological message that it conveys to Nahla, and to implore the court to put a stop to Gabriel's attempts to alter our daughter's appearance and most probably cause her to wonder why her natural appearance is not good enough.' The mother-of-two was being honored with the Creative Conscience Award at Thursday's gala. Amy Poehler, Pink, Ewan McGregor, Aaron Paul and his wife Lauren Parsekian, Christina Applegate, Josh Hutcherson and Zendaya were also honored for their charitable work. If you or someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-(800) 799-7233.

"Allison Williams is putting her wedding plans on hold amid her father Brian's scandal. On Wednesday, the 26-year-old eldest child of the NBC Nightly News anchor spoke at a Q&A session to discuss her career with late night host Seth Meyers, when she answered questions regarding her upcoming nuptials and how her family was doing following the recent scandal. 'Current events started happening so that derailed [wedding plans] a little bit,' revealed the Girls actress. It was also revealed that the 55-year-old embattled evening news managing editor resigned from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation board of directors on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Family first: Allison Williams, who is engaged to Ricky Van Veen, revealed that her wedding plans are put on hold amid her father Brian's scandal when she spoke at a Q&A event  in New York City on Wednesday . Allison became engaged a year ago this month to Ricky Van Veen, the co-founder of hit website CollegeHumor. 'It's been a very full year. You sort of think, ""What could possibly come along that would make me not think about this?"" And then I get Peter Pan and I think, ""Okay, I will think only about Neverland and then we'll go back to planning our wedding,""' she shared. 'Then current events started happening, so that derailed it a little bit, but it has been this really beautiful through line in our lives. It's just something we haven't focused on, but, spoiler alert, we are excited!' Supportive: The 26-year-old actress received applause from an audience as she told them she couldn't wait until her journalist patriarch was back presenting the news on NBC . Brave face: 'Current events started happening, so that derailed [the wedding] a little bit' (pictured on Wednesday at a New York Fashion Week show) 'The best newsman and best father I know': Allison shared this touching photo on her Instagram account on December 2 . The actress daughter of 12-time Emmy winning journalist Brian Williams has spoken out to defend her father for the first time since he was suspended for six months for making false claims about his time in Iraq in 2003. She described her father was 'an honest man, a truthful man,' at the NYC event. 'This has been a really hard time,' she said. 'One thing this experience has not done is shake my trust and belief in him as a man. 'He's a really good man, an honest man, a truthful man — he has so much integrity and so much respect for journalism. And yes he's a really good dad. I know you can trust him because, as any good daughter does, I've tested him on that.' Allison spoke while 'looking down at the stage' and 'with a subdued tone,' a witness told the New York Post. Passionate: The Peter Pan Live! star told host Seth Meyers that she is proud of her father and that is he is a man of the utmost integrity . At the end of last year she starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live, which was aired on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month. Allison said her entire family were rallying round her beleaguered father. 'My mom has been so strong and my brother has been amazing. My dad has always been there for us a 100 percent of the time… so to be here for him is the least we can do,' she said. Referencing her father's time in Iraq in 2003, she recalled how he had promised to be back in time to take her to a 9th grade father-daughter dance. 'As the day was coming, it didn't seem like he was going to make it as he had promised… I was so upset and I got a surprise call from my dad from Iraq, and he was asking if I had a date to the dance. So that's the kind of man he is. She has spoken out to defend her disgraced father Brian for the first time since he was suspended by NBC for six months for making false claims about his time in Iraq in 2003 . Waiting to walk down the aisle: She and fiance Ricky Van Veen have been engaged since February 2014 . 'I can't wait until he's back on TV and I know many of you guys feel that way. Thank you for all your support.' she said to applause from the audience. While his daughter is looking forward to her dream wedding, Brian is still paying the consequences from the military scandal. The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation announced on Thursday that the NBC correspondent stepped down from the group's board of directors after serving as a member for over eight years. The non-profit organization is dedicated to promote military valor and heroism, consisting exclusively of the living Medal of Honor recipients. Allison starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live which was aired in December on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month, while on Wednesday she brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week . Allison has made a name for herself playing Marnie in the HBO series Girls, but a three-hour live production of Peter Pan which aired in December proved a ratings flop for NBC. The musical production only attracted an audience of 9.1 million viewers - less than half of what The Sound Of Music production the previous year had achieved. Earlier on Wednesday, Allison had brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week. The star wore a royal blue two-piece ensemble featuring giant yellow blooms, including a sleeveless crop top that showed off her taut midriff, and a heavy full skirt. Allison coordinated the look with royal blue pointed-toe pumps and wore her dark hair partially swept back. Lovebirds: Williams and fiancee Ricky were seen arriving at Los Angeles International Airport on January 9 . Her father's departure from the Nightly News has resulted in the show losing 700,000 viewers. Ratings for the network's Nightly News broadcast dipped by double-digits last Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title. Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8m viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6m by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week. Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension this week after it was revealed the anchor falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire during a mission in Iraq. Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken his place since February 10.

"This is the horrifying moment a masked woman held a foot-long  knife to a nine-year-old boy's throat during a botched corner shop robbery.

'We were not bothered about what happened to us, we just wanted to save him,' said Mr Patel. 'I wanted to save my son rather than save the money - he could have been killed. 'I didn't know if there were more people outside. They had a knife, so we didn't want to take a risk.' He claims the woman threatened him and his brother, Rajan, by saying: 'Stay here or we'll kill you' and that the knife was 'as long as his forearm'. They had been re-stocking the upper level of the shop, which  overlooks the till area, before the robbery took place at 8.45pm on Wednesday. CCTV footage shows how the boy's father Bharat, 44, bravely ignored the warning and pushed past the woman before jumping on the counter to protect his son, pictured (right) is one of the robbers .

He was trying to avoid the knife and trying to open the till, but he couldn't. He's okay, but he couldn't sleep at night.' 'I didn't know if there were more people outside. They had a knife, so we didn't want to take a risk,' said Bharat, who said the woman looked 'unfit'. The busy shop, which has been run by the Patels since 2009, was also targeted three years ago, when an employee was threatened and a laptop stolen. The family now plans to have two workers in the shop at all times for extra security. Rajan said: 'We are very lucky that everybody was safe. We're not worried about money – no-one being injured is the main point.' Detective Constable Jonny Wright said both suspects were described as being in their mid-20s and around 5ft tall. He said: 'This was a seriously distressing incident for the people involved and I would urge anyone who saw the suspects or any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time of the robbery to contact us.' Gordon Henderson, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Business crime should be taken every bit as seriously as home-based crimes. These people are serving their communities and providing a vital service. Other shopkeepers need to be reassured that something is being done.' Mr Henderson added: 'The boy will be scarred; he'll remember this for the rest of his life.'

In further signs that the London market is cooling off, the capital saw a year-on-year decline in sales in more than one fifth of its boroughs. Across London, there was an 11 per cent year-on-year increase in sales in 2014, which is the smallest uplift recorded across any region last year. The report by Lloyds Bank said the finding fits with other studies showing that the London market has 'slowed sharply' since last summer. London has driven much of the housing market recovery in recent years. Looking back over the last five years, London has seen a larger pick-up in sales than any other region, with transactions in the capital lifting by 74 per cent between 2009 and 2014. However, it was the East Midlands which saw the biggest year-on-year increase in house sales in 2014, recording a 26% upswing, according to the research. The West Midlands and the North West followed closely behind with a 25 per cent increase, while Yorkshire and the Humber saw a rise of 23 per cent. Some towns even managed to record a higher number of property sales last year than in 2007, when Britain was at the height of the housing boom. The 12 towns where sales were higher in 2014 than in 2007 were Biggleswade, Wallingford, Didcot, Alton and Romsey in the South East, St Neots in East Anglia, Hinckley in the East Midlands, Evesham, Droitwich and Malvern in the West Midlands and Melksham and Newquay in Cornwall. Margate in Kent (pictured) recorded a 46 per cent increase in house sales, according to the Land Registry . Alfreton, in Derbyshire, saw a rise of 53 per cent, according to the research which was compiled by Lloyds . Amersham, South East, minus 11% . Ealing, London, minus 10% . Leatherhead, South East, minus 5% . Southwark, London, minus 5% . Hammersmith/Fulham, London, minus 4% . Wallsend, North, minus 4% . Islington, London, minus 2% . Stamford, East Midlands, minus 2% . Richmond upon Thames, London, minus 2% . Merton, London, minus 1% . Camden, London, minus 1% . Rickmansworth, South East, minus 1% . Meanwhile, Amersham in Buckinghamshire was found to be the town with the biggest fall in sales last year, with an 11 per cent decline. It was followed by Ealing in West London, with a 10 per cent decline, and Leatherhead in Surrey which saw a five per cent drop. Andy Hulme, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: 'Low interest rates, improvements in the UK economy and Government schemes, such as Help to Buy, all appear to have contributed to the rise in home sales. 'There is a clear north versus south pattern to the housing market recovery, with sales closer to their 2007 levels in the south. Indeed, a small number of towns recorded higher sales last year than seven years earlier, but sales remained much lower than 2007 levels in most areas.' A separate report released by property analysts Hometrack found that the strong property price growth will restrict the ability of prices to increase further in the medium term. Hometrack said that average property prices in London and Oxford are now typically more than 12 times local annual earnings, which is almost double the UK average of 6.3 times wages. Going forward, Hometrack expects to see the momentum behind the housing market shift towards cities such as Liverpool, Sheffield and Glasgow, which have been slower to see property prices recover.
