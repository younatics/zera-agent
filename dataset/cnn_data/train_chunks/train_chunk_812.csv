"By . Sean Poulter . German auto giant Audi made false claims about the crash testing of several of its cars, it has emerged. Salesmen said all its models boasted five-star ratings in Euro NCAP tests. But its R8 sports car, which costs up to £100,000, as well as its A5, A7 and A8 models, have in fact never been tested. Untested: The R8 sports car, which costs up to £100,000, has not gone through a Euro NCAP crash test, despite salesmen claiming it has . There is no evidence that the vehicles are inherently unsafe, however the company, which is part of Volkswagen, has been accused of misleading drivers. The issue came to light when entrepreneur Daniel Jenkins was interested in buying an Audi R8 for his sports car rental company and was told by the dealer it was safety tested to the highest standards. Mr Jenkins said: ‘One of the main reasons for me buying the Audi R8 over its competitors was the fact Audi advised me it had a Euro NCAP rating of 5-star and it had been crash tested.’ The Euro NCAP crash test is not a legally required, but the stringent regime, which looks at how vehicles cope with a range of impacts, is considered the gold standard of motor safety. Mr Jenkins, 25, bought the car for a rental business in 2012 and it was subsequently used in a music video featuring the singer Alexandra Burke and separately by the magician Dynamo. False promises: British Audi salesmen have been claiming that all of the German auto giant's models boasted five-star ratings in Euro NCAP tests (stock image) He did not give the safety question another thought until a few months later when his father Paul, 54, was involved in a crash while taking evasive action. Despite the fact the car was only travelling at only 45 miles per hour it was cut in half after spinning into the air and hitting a tree. Mr Jenkins’ father was in a coma for three and half weeks and in hospital for many months. The crash, which happened on a road near the family home in Melksham, Wiltshire, prompted him to look into exactly what checks Euro NCAP had carried out on the car. ‘I visited the Euro NCAP website and became aware that the Audi R8 had never been crash tested or put through any programme with Euro NCAP. To find out that it wasn’t after being advised that it had been, I was extremely upset. Disappointed,’ he said. He wanted to know whether this was a one-off error and so called 50 other Audi dealerships to ask about the R8’s safety testing, to check if they were issuing the same misleading information. ‘Forty-eight of them had told me directly that it had been put through the Euro NCAP programme, that it had been crash tested, and it had a 5-star rating. I was just gobsmacked,’ he said. ‘Frankly I am just disgusted that the company could be misleading people in such a serious way.’ Salesman's lies: Other models salesmen falsely claimed had undergone the crash tests were A5, A7 (pictured) and The Audi A8 . Mr Jenkins contacted BBC Watchdog who carried out their own mystery shopping exercise at 10 Audi showrooms across the country to establish if staff were in the wrong. Eight gave misinformation about NCAP tests. Tim Shallcross, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘I find it absolutely incredible to be honest, that a company of the reputation of Audi, and their parent group, the Volkswagen Group, can allow their product to be misrepresented so badly in that way. ‘Nobody’s saying the cars aren’t safe, but if they haven’t been tested, they haven’t been tested. To say they have…that’s outrageous.’ Mr Jenkins first contacted Audi UK head office to alert them to the problem five months ago, however, Watchdog found its customer service staff are still giving out misinformation. Audi has accepted staff were in the wrong and apologised. A spokesman said: ‘Audi UK wishes to emphasise that there has not been any deliberate intent to mislead on the part of its customer-facing staff where the Euro NCAP safety test performance of the Audi model range is concerned. ‘Significant and sustained investment in active and passive safety technology across the Audi range has resulted in safety standards that do not call for embellishment or exaggeration by our customer-facing teams. ‘Audi vehicles are engineered to exceed international motor vehicle safety standards.  The company fully supports Euro NCAP’s efforts to improve vehicle safety.’ The spokesman added: ‘Audi UK accepts that this investigation has brought to light a shortfall in its communication procedures where the NCAP safety ratings of its range are concerned. We also acknowledge that we did not adequately address this shortfall when it was brought to our attention by Mr Jenkins, and on both counts we apologise unreservedly.’","British Audi salesmen claimed models had gone through crash tests .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Apartment-sharing site Airbnb won a huge court battle Tuesday when the New York Supreme Court quashed a subpoena from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office seeking user's personal information. 'The subpoena at issue, as drafted, seeks materials that are irrelevant . to the inquiry at hand and accordingly, must be quashed,' wrote acting state . Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly in court papers. The court granted the site's 'instant application to quash the subpoena as . overbroad' as well as denying the Attorney General's motion to force them to give out any information or date about their users, according to the The New York Daily News. The New York Supreme Court has quashed a subpoena from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office seeking personal information about Airbnb users . Schneiderman's office sought names, addresses, rates, . tax data of Airbnb's users for the past three years. 'This decision is good news for New Yorkers who simply want to share . their home and the city they love,' Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas told reporters. 'Now, it’s time for us to work together. Airbnb hosts and the Attorney . General share a common goal: we all want to make New York a better place . to live, work and visit. We look forward to continuing to work with the . Attorney General's Office to make New York stronger for everyone.' An Attorney General spokesman said that the decision still agreed there was evidence many Airbnb hosts could be violating tax laws. Finding a silver lining in what many view as a major setback, the Attorney General's office noted that the court sided with Schneiderman on many of his points and that it would reissue a subpoena this week addressing a technical issue. Among the victories Schneiderman's office is claiming is Connolly's decision that 'Airbnb] has failed to demonstrate that . the subpoena is unduly burdensome,' and noting that '[t]he record before the Court . indicates that there are Hosts regularly using their apartments to . provide lodging to guests who may not be complying with the state and . local tax registration and/or collection requirements.' The site called the decision 'good news for New Yorkers who simply want to share their home and the city they love' Alegislative source speaking to the News said: 'It looks like Airbnb won the battle and lost the war.' Schneiderman spokesman Matt Mittenthal said that the decision still found evidence many Airbnb hosts could be violating tax laws. 'This comes as no surprise, given that Airbnb itself removed some 2,000 . New York-based listings from its site,' he said. 'Our office is committed to . enforcing a law that provides vital protections for building residents . and tourists alike. The judge rejected all of AirBnb’s arguments except . for a narrow technical issue, and we will reissue the subpoena to . address it.'","New York Supreme Court finds Attorney General's subpoena 'seeks materials irrelevant to the inquiry at hand'

"By . Emily Crane . Qantas will make 100 of its pilots redundant for the first time in more than 40 years as part of a broader plan to cut costs. The airline is seeking 100 redundancies from the 550 captains and first officers who fly Boeing 747 and 767 planes. The redundancies form part of the 5000 jobs cuts Qantas announced in February after the company posted a half year loss of $235 million. Qantas is seeking 100 pilot redundancies as they move to retire several Boeing 747 and 767 planes . Qantas chief pilot Captain Dick Tobiano sent an email to pilots on Tuesday asking for voluntary redundancy applications, according to the ABC. Mr Tobiano said the airline had a pilot surplus following the conclusion of a number of leave without pay periods and accelerated plans to retire its 747 and 767 fleet. Qantas announced in February that its remaining 767 planes would retire in the first quarter of 2015, while six older 747 aircrafts would exit the fleet by early 2016. Australian and International Pilots Association president and Qantas 737 pilot, Nathan Safe, said the voluntary redundancies were preferable to compulsory redundancies, but he was urging Qantas to offer fair packages to its employees.

"By . Sarah Michael . Australian model Samantha Harris' found out her fiance will serve at least two years in jail on Wednesday. But it was business as usual for the 23-year-old, who posted a video to her Instagram account spruiking her new Priceline commercial just hours after her fiance was sentenced. The 23-year-old was not in court with her long-term boyfriend Luke Hunt, 28, when he was sentenced to four years over a fatal crash that killed a 78-year-old man on Sydney's northern beaches. 'Exciting!' Just hours after her fiance Luke Hunt's sentencing, Samantha Harris uploaded a video to Instagram showing her new commercial for Priceline, not acknowledging the dramatic events of the day . In the video the model smiles alongside media personality Ita Buttrose, Home And Away actress Ada Nicodemou and X Factor Australia singer Dami Im in the short clip. She made no acknowledgement of the dramatic events that had unfolded that same day, captioning the post 'Just saw my @pricelineau commercial for the first time !!!! #exciting #youbeauty2014'. Hunt was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday afternoon over the death of Kenneth Lay in 2012. Mr Lay died in hospital after the car that Hunt and Ms Harris were travelling in collided with the older man's car, which then slammed into a tree. Hunt had pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing death, and the court heard he had been speeding in the 60km/h zone, driving at 95km/h. Model Samantha Harris's fiance Luke Hunt (left) was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday over a fatal car crash in Sydney's northern beaches in 2012 . Judge Colin Charteris said the sentence sent a strong message about reckless driving and its consequences. 'There has been no real account from Hunt to explain why he was driving in such a hurry at the time of the accident,' he told the Downing Centre District Court. 'It's completely inexcusable.' Hunt had been trying to change lanes at high speed when his Commodore collided into Mr Lay's Hyundai Lantra at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St, Narraweena. Judge Charteris said the grandfather of 16 and father of seven had been obeying the road rules. Had Hunt not been speeding Mr Lay would still be with his family. However, the judge accepted Hunt's remorse and acknowledged the 28-year-old tradesman now suffers from depression. The incident occurred two years ago when he and Ms Harris, 23, were driving to the gym in Narweena . Hunt, a builder from Queensland, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving saying he ran a red or orange light . 'He wishes he had passed away in the accident ... but his regret cannot remedy what has occurred,' Mr Charteris said. Hunt has also been disqualified from driving for six-and-a-half years. Outside court, Mr Lay's daughter Christine Scott said there were no winners. 'We're not cruel people, and I hate to see somebody go to jail like that, but you can't do what he did,' she told AAP.

"By . Fiona Macrae . The Body Shop and Lush have been criticised for implying some cosmetics are still tested on animals. Understanding Animal Research, which represents medical scientists, claimed the high street shops still use ethical claims to market cosmetics – despite the fact all make-up sold in Britain is now cruelty-free. Since last year, it has been illegal to sell make-up and toiletries in the EU which have been tested on animals anywhere in the world. False marketing ploy: The Body Shop and Lush both market their products as 'non animal tested', however this is no different to any other cosmetic brand in the UK as animal testing is forbidden in the EU . Lush defended its ‘ethical’ language saying it upholds the highest standards, while The Body Shop said it continues to push for a worldwide ban. Wendy Jarrett, chief executive of Understanding Animal Research, which represents more than 100 universities, drug companies and charities, said that the animal testing of beauty products has long been banned in Britain. And since last year, it has been illegal to sell make-up and personal care products such as shampoo and shower gel tested on animals anywhere in the world. She said: ‘I think the fact that there are still cosmetics being sold in this country under the cruelty-free banner is appalling because that allows people to think that there are other products out there that have been tested on animals. ‘You can’t go to any country in the EU and buy a cosmetic product that has been tested on animals.  You just can’t do it. So, it’s really disingenuous of them to maintain this cruelty-free banner.’ Cause: Lush hosted an 'animal testing reenactment' in a London store in 2012 to spearhead a campaign to end cosmetic testing on animals . The Body Shop clearly labels many of its products with the words ‘against animal testing’ and its website highlights some of its ‘iconic cruelty-free products’. Lush proclaims it is ‘fighting animal testing’, while products made by many smaller companies display a Leaping Bunny logo awarded by Cruelty Free International. Mrs Jarrett said that a recent poll for Understanding Animal Research found that just a third of people know about the cosmetics ban. She applauded the likes of Lush and the Body Shop for their part in driving through the sales ban – but asked why the slogans and emblems are still being used more than a year later. She questioned whether they fear sales will go down if they lose the selling point that made them stand out from other stores and said: ‘We still see various logos about being against animal testing.  No doubt it is true that they are against animal testing but so is everybody. ‘You can’t by law sell products tested on animals. ‘I take my hat off to Lush and the Body Shop for doing the work to get the ban in.  I am in no way an apologist for cosmetic research but the time has come to be open with the public about the fact that cosmetic testing on animals doesn’t happen anymore.’ Banned: Since 2013, it has been illegal to sell make-up and toiletries in the EU which have been tested on animals anywhere in the world . Mrs Jarrett made her remarks at the launch of an agreement pledging more openness in animal experiments for medical research – which is still allowed by law. More than 70 companies, research institutes and charities have signed a concordat that aims to remove the secrecy surrounding the topic could see medical research labs open their doors to the public. Mrs Jarrett said that perpetuating the idea that cosmetics are being tested on animals could undermine the public’s acceptance of medical research aimed at finding cures and treatments for disease. She said: ‘I think it does muddy it because we know that people still think that when we talk about animal research, we are taking about rabbits’ eyes and shampoo’. Lush defended its use of cruelty-free language.  It said it goes further than the law by not dealing with companies that test anything on animals anywhere in the world. This includes firms that test new foods or drugs on animals. Hilary Jones, Lush’s ethics director, said: ‘We try not to pass our money and our customers’ money on to companies that do animal testing.’ Cruelty Free International also said its criteria are more stringent than the EU’s. A spokesman for the Body Shop said: ‘Whilst the ban in Europe is a great milestone, animal testing on cosmetics products and ingredients continues to take place in other countries around the world. ‘As an international brand, we support our partner organisation Cruelty Free International in calling for a complete international ban and continue to feature Against Animal Testing on all our products as part of our long standing commitment to this issue.’","Body Shop and Lush market their products as 'non animal tested'

"By . Sally Lee . The Australian government has dedicated $89.9 million in the 2014 budget to continue the search for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. The money follows government fears the mammoth search effort could continue for another two years, with the current exhaustive operation failing to uncover any sign of the doomed plane. The government also announced that $27.9 million would be given to the Defence Department to pay for its activities up to June 30 2014 in searching for the lost aircraft. Another $2 million will be spent on the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, which was established on March 30 to oversee the hunt. Australian federal budget announced: Treasurer Joe Hockey included funding for the hunt of missing Malaysian Airline Flight MH370 on Tuesday . 'The government will provide up to $89.9 million over two years from 2013-14 as part of Australia's commitment to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370,' budget papers stated. 'Further funding of up to $60 million over two years from 2013-14 will be provided to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau for Australia's contribution to the next phase of the search.' The announcement follows news MH370 searchers have said electronic 'pings' initially thought to have come from missing Malaysian Airlines flight may not have emanated from the plane at all. A senior Australian naval officer said he 'increasingly suspects' some of the signals detected last month didn't come from the jetliner's black-box flight recorders, piling further doubts over the search effort. Australian naval Commander James Lybrand said of four 'pings' picked up by the U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, two were too weak to have been from a man-made device. Scroll down for video . Sonar 'pings': U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, that picked up the signals last month, is lowered into the Indian Ocean once more . Too . weak: A total of four signals, two on Saturday April 5 and two on Tuesday April 8, were detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the . search for flight MH370. But two of them now appear to have been too weak to . have been from a man-made devic . Search teams picked up two signals on April 5 at a frequency of 33.5kHz before two more were received three days later at 27kHz. While both are significantly lower than the 37.5kHz frequency black box beacons are designed to emit, the April 5 signals are still possible, down perhaps to weakening batteries or the 'vagaries of deep-sea conditions'. Cmdr Lybrand, captain of the Ocean Shield vessel, said: 'As far as frequency goes, between 33 kHz and 27 kHz is a pretty large jump.' He did say the authorities still believe that the two April 5 signals, one of which was held for 2 hours and 20 minutes - are consistent with black-box locator beacons. Fresh doubts: Australian naval Commander James Lybrand said while both readings are significantly lower than the 37.5kHz frequency black box beacons are designed to emit, the April 5 signals are still possible, down perhaps to weakening batteries or the 'vagaries of deep-sea conditions' So what was it? Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment . Cmdr Lybrand did not give any clues as to what may have emitted the April 8 'pings' if they did not indeed come from MH370. Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment. Experts say dolphins' lower frequency vocalizations (between about 0.2 and 50kHz) are likely used in social communication while higher frequency clicks (40 to 150 kHz) are primarily used for spacial awareness. Days after the signals were detected, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was 'very confident' they were from the . black box on MH370. Embarrassing: Days after the signals were detected, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was 'very confident' they were from the black box on MH370 . 'We have very much narrowed down the search area...and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from MH370,' he said. 'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time. 'We're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires. 'I really don't want to give any more information than that at this stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.'","Budget to include $89.9 million to fund the long-term search for MH370 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Stephen Sutton, who was first diagnosed with bowel cancer aged 15, is back in hospital with tumors blocking his airways according to his family . The family of terminally ill teenager Stephen Sutton have taken to Facebook to let his supporters know his condition has 'deteriorated' and he can no longer communicate himself. The 19-year-old, who has raised more than £3.22 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust, was readmitted to hospital with breathing difficulties on Sunday. Stephen touched the hearts of the nation after posting a picture on his Facebook page where he said his 'last goodbye' to his friends and family at Birmingham Queen Elizabeth hospital. After an internet campaign saw his fundraising target of £1million smashed, he made a mild recovery and was allowed home. But last night his family posted a message on Facebook which read: 'Unfortunately in the last 24 hours Stephen's condition has deteriorated to where he can no longer communicate through this page himself. 'Unfortunately the breathlessness which had him re-admitted to hospital is due to the regrowth of tumours which are blocking his airways, and not just due to infection as we had all been hoping. 'He is currently comfortable and stable, and we will let you know of any further developments. 'Right now however, as a family, we wish for a certain amount of privacy for us to spend what time he has remaining with him. Stephen, who is now 19, raised the money through a series of inspirational blog posts which saw his fundraising total rise from £10,000, to £1million to £3million . Stephen drew up a bucket list when he was told his cancer was terminal which included skydiving. He managed to tick off 36 of the 46 tasks on the list, including raising money for charity . 'We appreciate everyone's concern, and for all the love and goodwill sent his way, and indeed ours too, we thank you deeply x.' Stephen returned to his home in Burntwood, Staffs., was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010 when he was just 15 but despite having the tumour removed from his bowel it returned the next year. Despite being told he would be unlikely to survive more than a few years, he decided to make a 46 part bucket-list of things to do before he dies. Top of his list was to raise £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Three weeks ago, his blog went viral when, with a collapsed lung and believing he was ‘a goner’, the teenager posted a picture of himself in a hospital bed giving his trademark thumbs-up sign. His message touched hearts across the world. ‘It’s a final thumbs-up from me,’ he wrote. ‘I’ve done well to blag things as well as I have up till now, but unfortunately I think this is just one hurdle too far. Stephen's trademark thumbs-up pose was coined after he sent a message from his hospital bed with the message 'a final thumbs up from me' (pictured, David Cameron poses with Stephen two weeks ago) ‘It’s a . shame the end has come so suddenly.

"By . Ted Thornhill . The judge at the Oscar Pistorius trial is set to rule on whether he should undergo psychiatric tests that could delay the trial after the double-amputee runner's lawyer claimed he suffers from an anxiety disorder linked to his disability. The chief prosecutor asked that Pistorius be placed under psychiatric evaluation and Judge Thokozile Masipa ordered an adjournment, saying she would rule on Nel's request on Wednesday morning. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel noted on Tuesday that a psychiatrist for the defense had testified that the disorder she diagnosed in Pistorius may have played a role in his fatal shooting of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home on February 14, 2013. Scroll down for video . Deep in conversation: Oscar Pistorius (left) speaks with his uncle Arnold Pistorius (right) during his trial at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday . Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius listens to the State Prosecutor during his trial at the high court in Pretoria, on Tuesday . The prosecutor has acknowledged that an evaluation of Pistorius' state of mind at a government facility could mean the trial, which began March 3, will be delayed. Nel questioned why the defense decided to ask Dr Merryll Vorster, a psychiatrist, to testify on behalf of the Olympic runner. He has suggested that the trial is not going well for Pistorius and that his lawyers are floating the idea that a disorder contributed to Steenkamp's shooting and that therefore Pistorius bears less responsibility for her death. Pistorius says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her through the closed door of a toilet cubicle. Prosecutors say he killed her in anger after an argument. Pistorius is hugged by a supporter on his arrival for Tuesday's trial . Cross-examination: Prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions psychiatrist Meryl Vorster at the Pistorius trial . In asking for another professional evaluation of Pistorius' mental state, Nel appeared to be trying to ward off any attempt by the defense to say Pistorius should be treated favorably by the court because of a mental condition linked to his disability. Pistorius' chief lawyer, Barry Roux, said at the start of defense-led testimony that the double amputee's vulnerability and disability was at the center of his case of a mistaken killing. He said Pistorius should not be sent for 30 days of psychiatric evaluation and that he wanted to call another witness to continue testimony. The psychiatrist, Vorster, met Pistorius this month, prompting the prosecutor to question whether the timing of her late entry to the stable of defense witnesses signified a change in tactics by the defense, which has said Pistorius fired out of fear that he was about to be attacked.

"By . Sam Webb . A hotel guest who witnessed two people drowning in an unsupervised hotel swimming pool thought they were 'joking' as part of an elaborate Murder Mystery weekend, an inquest has heard. Komba Kpakiwa, 31, and Josephine Foday, 22, were discovered floating in an indoor 10.5-metre swimming pool at Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield Heath on the Essex and Hertfordshire border. Hotel guest, Marcel Haniff, made the grim discovery shortly after 7.30pm on Saturday, April 27 last year. Josephine Newahun Foday, left, and Komba Kpakiwa, right, were found . drowned at the Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield, Essex . Today an inquest held at Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard the pair, who could not swim, had been guests at the hotel and were spotted in difficulties by Mr Haniff who mistakenly thought they were 'joshing about'. Mr Haniff had arrived at the hotel just hours earlier for a 25th wedding anniversary weekend celebration with his wife and was using the sauna facilities when he heard shouting coming from the neighbouring pool. He told the court: 'I saw two people in the middle of the pool - between halfway and two thirds down. 'There was a lot of splashing going on. 'The gentleman facing me, I could see his head and shoulders. He was shouting ""hey"" but it could have been ""help"". The 10-metre swimming pool at the four-star Down Hall Country House Hotel where Komba Kpakiwa and Josephine Foday were found dead . A picture posted on Twitter by a hotel guest showed the swimming pool area cordoned off by police . 'The lady, whose back was to me, seemed to jump up and put his head underwater. I regret to say I thought they were just joshing about. 'I only had them in sight for around five seconds. They seemed to be perfectly healthy - just joking and playing.' The jury heard he later returned to the pool following a short time in the sauna, but despite seeing two bodies floating on the surface he still believed the incident may be all part of an elaborate murder mystery weekend. He added: 'I started to walk down and immediately saw there were two bodies lying on the surface of the water about two thirds of the way down. Josephine Newahun Foday and her grandmother Theresa Farma. They fled Sierra Leone in 2001 . 'I thought it was these two fellas messing about. I then realised because it was so still and they were so inert there was something seriously wrong. 'I said something like: ""Bloody hell"". 'I ran out of the exit towards the reception. I saw a man with a camcorder on the way there and I think, because I had read on the internet they had murder mystery weekends, I told the receptionist ""Either someone is playing a big practical joke or a terrible accident has happened. '""You need to get down there straight away"". It was a fairly surreal feeling seeing the scene.' Ms Foday fled to England with her grandmother from their native Sierra Leone in 2001 when both her parents disappeared in the country’s civil war. Mr Kpakiwa, from Erith, Kent, was married with two children. It is understood the pair were in a relationship. The inquest heard that post mortems were carried out on both victims which gave the same result of deaths 'consistent with drowning'. Forensic pathologist, Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, who carried out the post-mortem noted a 'heavy vomit contamination' and evidence given to him suggested neither victim could swim - all supporting the drowning conclusion. Toxicology results showed neither victim had drugs or alcohol in their system at the time of the tragic accident. The jury was told a police investigation had ruled out any suspicious circumstances and water tests disproved any suggestion chemical levels in the water could have affected the pair. Health and safety signs had been placed around the pool warning of its maximum depth of 2.1 metres, but vital CCTV footage of the pool had not been working at the time of the incident. A policeman stands guard at the Down Hall Country House Hotel in Essex, where the couple were discovered dead in the swimming pool . An engineer had been called to fix problems with the CCTV on the morning on the incident - but no temporary measures, such as a lifeguard, were put in place while it was offline. Caroline Burchall, district environmental health worker for Uttlesford District Council, revealed she had written to the hotel raising 'supervision concerns' and had planned to revisit the site in May last year - just weeks after the incident occurred. She told the inquest: 'If you're going to not provide supervision, you need to carry out a risk assessment to show what provisions you will have to justify not having a lifeguard in place. 'I had understood there was supervision of the CCTV screens which was not the case.' Mrs Burchall went on to explain the design of the 'hopper pool' meant the deep end sloped into the centre of the pool at a maximum depth of 2.1 metres. - Hotel guest, Marcel Haniff . This afternoon one former hotel guest told the court how he had warned hotel bosses about the slope in the pool a year before the tragic deaths. Leonard Tabner, 67, a landscape painter from North Yorkshire, told bosses: 'If something is not done, I can see someone drowning in that swimming pool.' Mr Tabner explained how he had 'almost drowned' in the pool when he walked from the shallow end towards the deep end during a morning swim in April 2012. He said: 'The floor of the swimming pool seemed to fall away and I lost my footing. The slope was too steep and I was out of my depth. 'I almost drowned - I was very alarmed and was in a state of shock.I got out and asked to speak to a manager. 'In an ideal world I would have followed up with a letter but I had other things on my mind.'I regret that now, obviously.' The inquest also heard evidence from receptionist Lucy Whiffen, who was working on the front desk at the hotel at the time of the tragic deaths. She admitted failing to sign in Mr Kpawika and Miss Foday to the pool despite it being part of hotel guidelines - something she said happened around 40 per cent of the time if she was busy and guests were impatient. When questioned, she told the court: 'The only reason I can think is I was busy doing something at the back.' Recounting the moment she first learnt of the tragic incident, she added: 'Mr Haniff came to the desk and said two people were either messing around or dead. 'They were the word he used.' Widow Gurpeet Kpakiwa sat silently as she heard harrowing evidence about the death of her husband at Chelmsford Coroner's Court today, although no family were present for Miss Foday. The jury were told Down Hall Country House Hotel is a large hotel set in 110 acres of woodland. The luxurious hotel offers guests a 10.5-metre swimming pool, sauna and jacuzzi. The inquest, which is expected to last three days, continues.","Marcel Haniff saw the pair splashing around and shouting in the pool .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Eric Craggs, 68, of Stockton, County Durham, pictured arriving at court, is accused of asking for the 'Laserstar' device to be fitted to his car in 2009 . A driver attempted to evade the law by having a piece of equipment knowingly fitted to his Aston Martin which stops police speed guns from taking an accurate reading, a court heard. Eric Craggs, 68, is accused of asking for the device, known as a ‘laser jammer', to be fitted to the front of his car during a service in 2009. It is alleged that Craggs, of Stockton, County Durham, has been driving the car with the device activated for the last four years and has managed to evade police detection on two occasions. The device interferes with the lasers used in police speed camera devices and stops officers from being able to take a reading - instead issuing an error message. Prosecutor Andrew Walker told the jury at Teesside Crown Court today how Craggs was caught by PC Lorraine Williams after she failed to get a reading from his Aston Martin during a routine speed check in August last year. He said: ‘She aimed the camera at the front of the Aston Martin car with a view to record the speed. ‘However the device could not record a speed and displayed an error code. She tried again but again an error code showed.’ He told the court how PC Williams then noticed an object under the front number plate of the car which was part of the ‘Laserstar’ device. Mr Walker said PC Williams also remembered a similar instance with the same car in April 2011. The prosecutor told the court how Craggs asked for the 'Laserstar' device to be fitted to his car while getting it serviced at Stratstone garage in Houghton-le-Spring in 2009. He said Stratstone contracted the work to be done at Turners Alarm and Audio in Sunderland and an invoice for around £450 was sent to Craggs. Mr Walker . said: ‘Its purpose is to alert the driver of the vehicle that is being . targeted by a police laser speed meter allowing the driver to slow down . the vehicle. ‘At the same time police are prevented from acquiring the true speed of the vehicle. The pensioner, who appeared in court wearing a pinstripe suit and white shirt, denies a charge of perverting the course of justice between July 15, 2009 and August 12, 2013 . ‘The laser effectively interferes with the laser sent by the police device for typically between four and eight seconds.’ Mr Walker said Craggs denies asking anyone to fit the device and says he had no knowledge of it being there. The pensioner, who appeared in court wearing a pinstripe suit and white shirt, denies a charge of perverting the course of justice between July 15, 2009 and August 12, 2013. The trial continues.

"By . Tara Brady . The woman who sparked the investigation into Max Clifford's sexual abuse against teenage girls has broken her silence for the first time since he was jailed for eight years. The woman, named only as Jessica, was 17 at the time and an aspiring actress when she met with Clifford in the 1980s. It was decades before she felt strong enough to speak out. Scroll down for video . Silhouette of the woman who sparked the investigation into Max Clifford which led to his eight year sentence . Speaking for the first time about the encounter, she told Channel 4 News: 'I've always been so scared of him. I had dreams for years and years and years that he was going to come and kill me. 'He said he wanted to talk about a film part he was to put me up for called Absolute Beginners. 'He thought I would be brilliant for that and that he would give my name to directors. 'It was all really exciting. But after all of this he said, I'm going to do all of this for you but what are you going to do for me. An investigation has learned that Clifford retained a hold over his victims by taking naked photos of them . Several sources had claimed Clifford kept a black bin bag full of these types of photographs . 'He then told me to come round to his side of the desk and he pulled me down to give him oral sex. I didn't even really know how to do it. I was so scared.' The Channel 4 investigation also learned that Clifford retained a hold over his victims by taking naked photographs of them. Several sources had claimed he kept a black bin bag full of these types of photographs. Jessica was one of the victims he photographed during their first meeting. 'I was so stupid. I should have just ran away. I was just really scared. He took a photograph of me. And he did. In a very compromising position. And that was the first meeting.' Max Clifford gave an interview in 2000 saying he had every piece of evidence he needed to back up his scoops . Sobbing through the interview, Jessica added: 'I hate myself. I was an attractive young girl and I hated myself. 'I thought I was ugly because I thought people were able to look at me and know what I had done. 'All the bad things. I don't want revenge but I want him to think about, to contemplate, what he has done to other people.' The investigation also found that two different celebrities feature in his collection of photographs. Max Clifford pictured at Southwark Crown Court before he was jailed . One is pictured naked while the other is having sex. This week Max Clifford's wife filed for divorce after he was jailed. Clifford, 71, is the first person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree and was sentenced to eight years after a judge ruled he had groomed and degraded his victims. Now it has emerged that his 51-year-old wife Jo – who was conspicuous by her absence during the trial and was not called as a character witness – has started divorce proceedings against her husband. Mrs Clifford, who was his PA before the pair married in April, 2010, has instructed celebrity divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth, who is thought to charge £450 an hour and is known as ‘Jaws’ because of his formidable reputation. Mrs Clifford married the publicist seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz. Clifford was jailed at Southwark Crown Court on May 2 after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against four girls between 1977 and 1985. Judge Anthony Leonard said that some of the offences would have  led to charges of rape if they had happened today. Last week, one of Clifford’s  victims, Sharon Elliott, 48, waived her right to anonymity to exclusively tell The Mail on Sunday that she felt vindicated after hearing the judge’s verdict. Ms Elliott, who was indecently assaulted in a nightclub toilet by Clifford when she was an 18-year-old dancer, said: ‘The eight year sentence is a positive result for us women and when I heard the judge condemn Clifford for what he said to me, I felt I’d got justice.’ Clifford had sneered at Sharon after the assault, telling her: ‘Don’t bother telling anyone – they won’t believe you.’","Woman named only as Jessica was 17 at the time and an aspiring actress .

"By . Richard Spillett . Ivan Craddock, who sexually abused teenage girls in the 1970s and 80s, has been jailed for 13 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court . A taxi driver who raped a schoolgirl after spiking her carton of Ribena was jailed for 13 years today. Ivan Craddock, 63, drugged his 12-year-old victim and subjected her to a campaign of sexual abuse during the 1970s. He then persuaded the schoolgirl not to go to police by bribing her with cash before blackmailing her and threatening to shame her in front of her family. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard Craddock also targeted a 13-year-old and indecently assaulted a third girl at a bedsit in 1988. He tried to claim his victims, who came forward to police in February 2012, were 'liars' during his trial, but a jury found him guilty of three counts of indecent assault, two of rape and a single count of administering a noxious substance with intent. Sentencing Craddock today, Judge Simon Wilkinson said the cab driver had 'destroyed' the childhood of one of the victims and shown no remorse. He told the court: 'The first victim was as young as 12 when you first indecently assaulted her.She was as young as 13 when you first raped her. Your sexual misconduct towards her continued until she was nearly 17. 'You destroyed the later part of her childhood and you have clouded her existence to this present day. 'The second victim was indecently assaulted by you in 1988 - in order to do so you administered to her a noxious substance'. Some of Craddock's victims, who are now middle-aged women, sobbed in the public gallery during his sentencing, but he showed no emotion as he was jailed for a total of 13 years. The court heard Craddock abused one of his victims when she was aged 12 after offering to take her to Hornchurch, east London, where he bought her a carton of Ribena, which he spiked. After taking a few gulps of the drugged drink she later woke up to find herself in the car with her clothes undone, the court heard. Prosecutor Mark Williams . Prosecutor Mark Williams said: 'At least twice a week... the same thing would happen - she would have a drink and wake up having been interfered with'. In November 1977, the girl was raped by Craddock as she slept after being given yet another noxious drink. He then blackmailed the teenager by saying he would tell her family what she had done until, aged 17, she finally plucked up the courage to confront him about his abuse. Mr Williams added: 'He groomed one of his victims by earning her trust by treating her as an adult but went on to drug her and have sex with her until she was old enough to put a stop to it.' After Craddock's victims came forward, he was arrested and interviewed in June 2012 and denied the claims to officers. 'Through your evidence those victims were called liars by you', Judge Wilkinson added. 'It increased their trauma. You have shown no remorse. These victims were extremely vulnerable and there is evidence they have suffered severe psychological harm'. Craddock, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault, two of rape and a single count of administering a noxious substance with intent.","Ivan Craddock, 63, molested three girls in spate of attacks in 1970s and 80s .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Emily Crane . University students face a double whammy of financial pain after a major shake-up of tertiary education funding was announced in the federal budget on Tuesday. From 2016 universities will be allowed to charge what they like while the government's contributions will drop. The budget changes will affect anyone who accepts a higher education place after Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Federal treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia's higher education sector is being held back and cannot compete with the best in the world in his budget speech in Canberra on Tuesday . Students already enrolled at the time of the federal budget won't be affected unless they're still studying at the end of 2020. The higher education loans program will also become less generous, with graduates made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016, almost $700 less than now. Their debts will be indexed at a higher rate, capped at 6 per cent, depending on what it costs government to borrow. The changes are tipped to create a budget saving of $3.3 billion. University students say the Abbott government's 'horror budget' will leave them drowning in debt. National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said an entire generation of students will face new barriers to attending universities. 'The deregulation of fees is without a doubt going to leave students with a sharp increase in fees and that will only increase student debt,' Ms Taylor said. University students face a double whammy of financial pain after a major shake-up of tertiary education funding was announced . 'We're looking at students who will now be forking out hundreds of thousands for degrees. It's very serious – what they're really doing to passing the buck on to students.' NUS will be protesting across the country in response to the budget on May 21. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the measures would help improve the quality of university education in Australia. 'Australia should have at least one university in the top 20 in the world, and more in the top 100,' Mr Hockey said while delivering his Budget speech in Canberra on Tuesday. 'The higher education sector is being held back and cannot compete with the best in the world. 'We need to set our sights higher.' From 2016 universities will be allowed to charge what they like while the government's contributions will drop . In a small budget sweetener, universities will have to put $1 from every $5 raised from fee hikes into scholarships for disadvantaged students. Funding will also be expanded to cover the funding of all students taking diploma and sub-bachelor courses. It's expected expanding places will lead to the government subsidising an extra 80,000 students by 2018 at a cost of $820 million. However, it will still bank $1.1 billion from cutting an average 20 per cent from student payments. The Australia's top research institutions and private higher educators were thrilled with the changes. The higher education loans program will also become less generous, with graduates made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016 . ANU vice-chancellor Ian Young, chair of the Group of Eight, said the moves reconciled access and equality and made growth affordable for universities. The Council of Private Higher Education chief Adrian McComb says the measure delivers everything the sector wants. The group representing all universities was more circumspect about the changes, saying it was disappointing the likely increase in student fees was being offset by a significant drop in government contributions. 'In combination (with lower indexation) that represents a reduction of around $1.9 billion over the forward estimates,' Universities Australia chief Belinda Robinson told AAP.","Major shake-up of tertiary education funding announced in budget .

"By . Dan Bloom . A startling image is circulating online that appears to show a baby abandoned outside a betting shop. The photo, posted on Twitter by a user from Lewisham, south east London, depicts a pram with a child's arm clearly visible outside a branch of Jenningsbet. The image sparked fears that the child's mother or father had gone inside to place a bet - while one resident claimed they had seen an abandoned pram outside the same shop before. Shock: The image, posted to Twitter on Tuesday, appears to show a pram left at the door with a child inside . The image was taken in Lee High Road and posted on Tuesday lunchtime by Twitter user @AshDuncs, who wrote: 'Only in Lewisham would you see this.' It shocked fellow Twitter users and led one to claim she had seen the same thing a few years earlier. Twitter user @kayleighwallsy, who lives in nearby Abbey Wood, said: 'I saw a buggy parked up outside here before with a screaming newborn in... Absolutely disgusting if you ask me.' Police and social services said they had received no reports of potential child neglect. Neighbouring shop owners also said they had not heard of the incident though one, who asked not to be named, claimed: 'I wouldn't put it past some of the people who live here'. Jenningsbet managing director Greg Knight said: ‘I don’t consider it to be an issue that’s anything to do with us. Is this an abandoned baby? The photo raised eyebrows, but police and social services were not alerted . Busy: The photo was taken in Lee High Road in Lewisham, south east London . ‘If I . thought there was an issue we could get involved with I would call . social services, but it just looks like a parenting issue to me, and . something that sadly you see all too often. '‘We don’t know if it was one of our customers. It could have been anywhere along that parade. There’s a front door there too so it could’ve been a flat upstairs.’ The photo comes weeks after a mother was arrested on suspicion of neglecting her two-and-a-half year old daughter, who was found abandoned in a pram in Carlisle, Cumbria. The 41-year-old was questioned as her daughter was placed temporarily in the care of social services. Police were called on the night of March 28 by the occupants of a house, who said a woman had rung their doorbell and then disappeared. They contacted police who found the pram with the girl inside when they arrived. In November 2012, meanwhile, a girl was left outside the door of a betting shop in Bognor Regis, West Sussex - still tethered to the other side of the door. Her mother appeared to leave the girl outside a branch of Ladbrokes for two to three minutes, where she struggled to free herself before the woman came out.","Photo taken outside branch of Jenningsbet in Lewisham, south London .

"By . Julian Robinson . A grandmother was stabbed and strangled to death in her home by her neighbour for just £30, a jury was told. Within an hour, Christian Darko had spent £4 on lottery tickets, £6 on cigarettes and £20 on electricity top-ups using the stolen cash, Teesside Crown Court heard. Jurors were told that Mrs Doughty's granddaughter later found her dead in her Middlesbrough flat the same afternoon. Christian Darko, 41, is accused of murdering Rose Doughty, pictured, the day after her 72nd birthday . As she came downstairs crying and calling . for an ambulance, she passed Darko, who asked her whether everything . was OK, the prosecution claims. Christian Darko, 41, is accused of murdering Rose Doughty the day after her 72nd birthday. Jurors were told Darko accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing after admitting manslaughter, but he denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Opening the murder trial, prosecutor Nick Dry said Darko killed Mrs Doughty for £30 in her flat in Netherfields, Middlesbrough. 'He was her downstairs neighbour and a man to whom she'd only shown kindness,' Mr Dry said, adding that Darko had been asking her for money for his electricity meter. He said Darko visited her flat, directly above his own, on the morning of November 23 last year. He was seen going into her home of about 20 years at 10.10am, leaving about a minute later. Rose Doughty's grandaughter found her dead in her flat, the court heard. Mrs Doughty lived in Fosdyke Green, pictured, in the Netherfields area of Middlesbrough . Mr Dry told the jury: 'It is likely, say the prosecution, that by that time Rose Doughty was either dead or dying, stabbed and strangled by the defendant who then returned to steal from her.' He changed his clothes and spent £20 on an electricity top-up, £6 on cigarettes and £4 on lottery tickets, the jury heard. He then spent hours at another resident's home, saying he was 'in trouble'. Mrs Doughty's granddaughter found her dead in the flat that afternoon. As she came downstairs crying and calling for an ambulance, she passed Darko, who asked her whether everything was OK, said Mr Dry. He said Mrs Doughty died from strangulation, with stab wounds to her face, neck and abdomen which contributed to her death, and bruising consistent with being struck. The daughter of 72-year-old Rose Doughty has paid tribute to her kind, loving, straight-talking mum. Teesside Crown Court heard how Mrs Doughty was doted on and visited daily by her children and grandchildren. Jacqueline Brown said in a statement read out at Teesside Crown Court yesterday: 'I called my mam 'dozy Rosie' because of some of the things she'd come out with. 'She made me cry with laughter. She was so kind-hearted. Everybody loved her. She loved the kids. Their friends would come round and call her nana. She was a lovely woman.' She said the mother-of-four and grandmother-of-11 left the radio on for the birds when she left her flat in Netherfields. Her mother spent most of her time in the flat, loved Facebook as it kept her up to date with family and friends, and played games on her laptop. Ms Brown said at the time of her mother's death, her health and confidence had been improving after she underwent treatment in hospital. 'She seems to have been healthier now than she had been for years,' added Ms Brown. 'She was really enjoying life.' When police visited him, Darko said another neighbour lent him £10, and he didn't mention his trips to Mrs Doughty's flat. When . CCTV revealed his movements he was arrested on suspicion of murder. He . replied: 'Can I ask the reason why? What have I done?' He . told police medical staff he suffered from depression. He said he went . to Mrs Doughty's flat to borrow a heater with a knife in a bag. He said he couldn't remember why he had the knife or what exactly he did to her. A grey hat was found on a bed in her flat carrying Darko's DNA. Her blood was found on the hat and on gloves found in Darko's home. Mr Dry said the jury would hear from psychiatrists and psychologists about Darko's mental state: 'That will be the ultimate issue for you to decide in this case.' Teeside Crown Court, pictured, heard Christian Darko spent the stolen £30 on lottery tickets, cigarettes and . topping up his electricity meter . The defence say he had an 'abnormality of his mental functioning' from depression and a learning disability, added Mr Dry. He . said it would be suggested that this 'substantially impaired his . ability to form a rational judgment at the time he killed Rose Doughty'. Mr . Dry said: 'It is the prosecution's case that a clear picture emerges . from the evidence of a premeditated murder for gain, the defendant . acting with obvious purpose, taking what he wanted when his repeated . requests were denied, spending what little Rose Doughty had to take and . then attempting to cover his tracks.' The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Christian Darko accused of strangling and stabbing Rose Doughty to death .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A mother-of-three was left with a crushed pelvis and a broken spine after a woman who was five times over the drink-drive limit mowed her down in her own front garden - while she was on the school run. Agnieszka Chrzaszcz, 28, had gone to pick up her children from school in Winklebury, Hampshire when she ploughed into Laura Percival, as she was carrying her four-year-old daughter. Mrs Percival, 26, managed to throw her child to safety but took the full brunt of the blow, as Chrzaszcz's car flung her against her own front door. Laura Percival, 26, pictured left, was left with a broken pelvis and spine after Agnieszka Chrzaszcz, 28, pictured right, ploughed into her while on the school run in Winklebury, Hampshire . The victim sustained four spine fractures, a crushed pelvis and a perforated bladder and is still struggling to walk eight months on. Now Chrzaszcz has been jailed for three years after admitting causing serious . injury by dangerous driving - and leaving Mrs Percival unable to walk further than 100metres. Mrs . Percival - who has undergone ten operations since the crash - said: 'We . have got what we wanted. We wanted to see justice done. 'It is not going to change anything but at least she is in prison for what she has done. 'I . do not think it will give me closure because I have got to live with . what happened and will see the scars for the rest of my life. But I have got to be strong and try my hardest.' The court was told that the incident, which the judge described as 'truly frightening', unfolded in September last year when Chrzaszcz walked to pick up her son from Winklebury Infant School. Prosecutor . Simon Edwards said the Polish mother then climbed into her Honda . Civic car which she had left by the school the previous day - despite having drunk half a bottle of vodka the day before. Mother-of-three Mrs Percival, who has undergone ten operations since the crash, still suffers with a fractured pelvis and has no idea whether it will ever fully heal . The damaged Honda Civic, which was driven by Chrzaczsz while she was five times over the legal drink-drive limit. The car collided into Mrs Percival as she was leaving the house with her daughter Freya, 4. Mrs Percival managed to throw her daughter to safety but took the full brunt of the blow . She . then reversed into three cars, before careering across a grassy area where she collided with Mrs Percival. Brave . Mrs Percival, who was carrying her daughter Freya, four, managed to throw her youngster to safety but was crushed against her own front door. Although most of her injuries have healed, Mrs Percival still has fractures in her pelvis which mean she struggles to walk on crutches. Even . if she does recover from her pelvic injury, doctors have warned she will be more susceptible . to osteoporosis, because of the weakness in her bones. Mrs Percival, pictured here with her youngest child Corey, can now only walk about 100metres. She said the three-year jail term meant justice had been done . She . effectively lives in a hospital bed set up in her front room and can . barely manage the 100-metre walk to collect her children . Freya, now five, and Harley, seven, from school. Mr Edwards told Winchester Crown Court . that Chrzaszcz had drunk half a bottle of vodka and cans of lager with . Polish friends the night before the incident. The defendant then jumped out of her car and shouted ‘no police, no ambulance’ even though Mrs Percival was hurt. The injured mother now has to live in a hospital-style set up in her home. Even if she makes a full recovery, Mrs Percival could be more susceptible to osteoporosis because of the weakness in her bones, caused by the crash . Mr Edwards said: 'The defendant got out. Witnesses described that she smelled strongly of alcohol, was visibly drunk, and could not focus. 'Witnesses approached her and tried to prevent her from walking off. In fact, that was entirely unnecessary because she was too drunk to walk off.' Officers arrested Chrzaszcz at the scene but she threw up blood when she arrived at the police station. She was then taken to hospital before where she gave a reading of 392mgs of alcohol per 100mls of blood. The legal limit is 80mg. Chrzaszcz was given a three-year jail sentence at Winchester Crown Court, above, after pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving . Later in interview, Chrzaszcz showed remorse but also claimed that she had fainted at one point before the collision, the court was told. Louise Howard, mitigating, said Chrzaszcz was drinking a litre of vodka just to function at the time of the crash. She has written a letter of apology to Mrs Percival following the incident - but the victim had found it too difficult to read. Miss Howard said: 'She understands the consequences of her actions, and the impact it has had on Laura Percival and her family.' Sentencing, Judge Keith Cutler said Chrzaszcz’s sentence had been cut from a possible five due to her early guilty plea and her remorse. He praised Mrs Percival for her quick-thinking in throwing her daughter away from the reversing car. The defendant, who moved to the UK from Poland nine years ago and has no previous convictions, was also disqualified from driving for three years. Judge Cutler told Chrzaszcz: 'This court has listened with horror to your actions. 'For parents of the school to realise that one of their pupils’ mothers was so unfit through drink must have been truly frightening.' Mrs Percival said she cannot bring herself to open Chrzaszcz’s letter. She . said: 'It’s there but I do not want to read what she has got to say . because whatever it is, it is not going to change anything.' After the case, PC Andy Green, from Whitchurch Road's policing unit, said he was pleased with the sentence. He said: 'This is the most serious non-fatal traffic collision I have had to investigate in nine years of policing. 'I’m very happy with the sentence. It reflects the seriousness of the injuries Laura has sustained and the ordeal she and her family have had to endure.'","Angieszka Chrzaszcz, 28, drove home from the school run after drinking half a bottle of vodka the day before .

"By . Mark Duell . Mourners have arrived at their loved ones’ graves to find their headstones plastered in yellow notices - claiming they were ‘unsafe’. Shocked owners of 488 graves at Worting Road Cemetery in Basingstoke, Hampshire, were warned they were liable if ‘anyone was injured’ by the gravestones. They now face paying for repairs in one year or their memorials could be removed. Among those told their gravestone was unsafe is the family of David Ridgers, who has been buried there for 24 years. Yellow sign: Claire Ridgers-Smith (left) with her sister Davee Ridgers and her son Charlie Ridgers, by David Ridgers's gravestone at Worting Road Cemetery in Basingstoke, Hampshire . His family believe a recent safety test made the grave unstable as the stones were ‘grabbed’ and ‘shaken’. Local resident Claire Ridgers-Smith, 25, who was just two when her father passed away in 1990, was shocked and angry when she spotted the notice on a visit. She said: ‘We visit dad constantly and his gravestone has always been in very good condition. 'The grave certainly wasn’t unstable before they checked it by grabbing it and shaking it. My mum was incredibly upset.’ The family appealed to Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, raising concerns the grave was damaged during the test, and the borough agreed to fund the repairs. Around 10 per cent of the 4,822 graves tested at the cemetery, which has more than 10,000, failed memorial stability tests. Notices: The owners now face paying for repairs in one year or their memorials could be taken down . The notice says: ‘Your memorial has been identified as being a potential risk to others as it has failed a memorial stability test. ‘As the owner of the grave, you are responsible for the repair and maintenance of the memorial and may be liable should an accident occur or if anyone is injured. 'We visit dad constantly and his gravestone has always been in very good condition. My mum was incredibly upset' Claire Ridgers-Smith, whose father David died when she was aged two in 1990 . ‘If no action is taken to repair this memorial within the next 12 months, the authority may lay the memorial down.’ Tim Boschi, head of community services at Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, said they had contacted families and advised them to repair the gravestones. This was in the interests of ensuring the cemetery remains ‘safe’ for visitors and those who work there. He said: ‘We are committed to ensuring the cemetery remains safe for all visitors and those who work there. We, therefore, have a periodic programme of memorial safety inspections. Sign: Stunned owners of 488 graves were warned they were liable if 'anyone was injured' by the gravestones . ‘The testing of the graves was carried out by an independent company that specialises in memorial safety and checks for stability without using excessive force. 'It is the grave owners’ responsibility to ensure their memorials are stable and in a good state of repair' Tim Boschi, Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council . ‘All those memorials found to be in an unstable condition have been temporarily supported in order to minimise the risk. ‘It is the grave owners’ responsibility to ensure their memorials are stable and in a good state of repair. ‘We are contacting families where memorials have been found to be unsafe, and are advising them to contact a monumental mason. ‘We appreciate the distress and upset that this might cause, but we need to take this approach so that the cemetery remains a safe place.’","Owners of Basingstoke graves warned they are liable if 'anyone is injured'

"By . Richard Spillett . An MP has hit out at claims White Dee's appearances on a Magaluf bar crawl will aid her recovery from depression - branding her jaunts to Majorca 'the most outrageous back to work programme I’ve ever heard of'. The Benefits Street star is continuing to claim handouts despite announcing plans to join revellers at a second 'Carnage Magaluf' night next month. She'll appear at the event unpaid in a move her agent says will help her shake off the depression that prevents her from finding paid employment. White Dee has agreed to appear at another Carnage Magaluf night in June after she was pictured downing shots in the party resort last month . Her agent says the trip is one of a number planned for Dee over the summer to 'get her used to going to work' Dee enjoys a laugh back home in James Turner Street, Birmingham yesterday ahead of her planned trips abroad . Agent Barry Tomes said: 'Like anyone who goes to work, she has to get used to being away from her street, from her kids, and that is what she is doing now.' But MP Simon Danczuk has blasted the arrangement, which he says undermines public faith in the benefits system. Mr Danczuk told MailOnline: 'This is the most outrageous back to work programme I've ever heard of. 'We need to restore public confidence in the welfare state and cases like this show why so many people believe it isn't working. 'If she's fit enough to be doing promotional work in Magaluf then she's surely fit enough to get a job. They should stop her benefits now.' Single mother-of-two Dee, real name Dierdre Kelly, sparked public anger by downing shots and cocktails as she 'headlined' her first night at the party resort last month. During her last trip to Majorca, she was spotted kissing a young fan on a sun lounger . After she was a huge hit with revellers, bar crawl organisers Carnage Magaluf have now booked her to appear at another night next month . She was photographed sipping champagne during the trip, but later claimed she 'hated the stuff' It was announced this week that the . 42-year-old will appear before party-goers on another 'Benefits . Street-themed night' on June 27. But . - as the trip is being funded by her agent Barry Tomes - Dee will . continue to claim the estimated £10,000-a-year she gets in handouts including . Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Mr Danczuk contrasted White Dee's case to that of Rochdale's Sheila Holt, who was given a public apology from the government after she was sent a letter by benefits bosses demanding she find work - despite being in a coma following a heart attack. He said: 'It's frankly insulting that I have a constituent in a coma that the Government are hassling while White Dee is galavanting around Europe and making a mockery of the system.' Labour MP Simon Danczuk has called for Dee's benefits to be stopped to restore public faith in the system . The TaxPayers' Alliance has also called on authorities to ensure state support is only going to those who need it. Campaign manager Andy Silvester said: 'ESA is rightly there to help some of the most vulnerable people in society who are in need of extra support. 'Of course no-one in receipt of ESA should be denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves, but rigorous systems need to be in place to ensure that those receiving taxpayer-funded benefits genuinely require them. 'The authorities need to make sure that nobody is making unnecessary claims on the welfare system.' But Dee's agent, Mr Tomes, has claimed the holidays will benefit the taxpayer in the long run. He said: 'This is not someone with a broken foot, this is a condition she's had for several years. I guarantee by the end of this I will have her working and she will be paying tax.' The Department of Work and Pensions has refused to say whether it will investigate the arrangement, insisting it never comments on individual cases. But a spokesman said: 'If we receive information or evidence which suggests a claimant is being paid in kind for work, the Department has powers to treat this as earnings and this may affect their entitlement to ESA.' A four-night stay in June at the hotel where Carnage Magaluf takes place currently costs around £650, with the cheapest return flights from Birmingham to Majorca for that weekend going for around £150. When Dee's food and drink are factored in, it is estimated she could be enjoying what amounts to a £1,000 holiday while continuing to claim benefits. But Mr Tomes added: 'This is not payment in kind. It is the same as if a friend of Dee's invited her to London for the weekend, that wouldn't affect her benefits. 'She is not claiming Job Seekers Allowance so she does not need to sign on, she has to go to a doctor once a month. 'I've talked to the doctor to check it is safe to take her away and we've been in contact with the Department of Work and Pensions and told them what we are doing.'","Reality TV star set to return to Majorca to headline 'Carnage Magaluf' night .

"By . Thea Jourdan . My seven-year-old daughter Imogen couldn’t have been more delighted when it was her turn to take Spencer Bear home for the weekend. Eyes shining, she hugged the cuddly toy that doubled as her class mascot, handing me a large cloth bag stuffed with spare clothes for him and a diary where we were supposed to record his experiences. She’d been looking forward to playing host to Spencer Bear for weeks and already had a whole range of activities lined up for him, from tree-climbing to chicken-feeding and bouncing together on the trampoline. Imogen couldn't wait for a weekend of fun-filled activities to share with Spencer bear . A dab hand with my smartphone, Imogen was snapping pictures of herself and Spencer before we even got in the front door. It couldn’t have been a more innocent extra-curricular activity. But, as I was soon to discover, even this simple game had been sullied by the most toxic trait of modern parenting: elbow-sharp competitiveness. Most mums will be able to tell you that Spencer — or another close cuddly relation — is now the undisputed king of classrooms across the country. Used as educational tools by primary schools to encourage pupils’ writing and story-telling skills, toys such as Spencer go home with a different child every week, along with a diary for their hosts to fill in. It seems like a perfectly harmless idea, and it probably was when it originated in the U.S. a decade ago. But just one peek in Spencer’s diary revealed what he had got up to on his previous away-days — and simple picnics it was not. This was a toy who had been given a taste of the high life. A teddy with a taste for the high life: a school bear enjoys itself in Greece . It was clear that some of my fellow school-gate mums had whipped themselves into a frenzy trying to match the picture-perfect lives of their bear’s previous hosts. There was Spencer taking riding lessons, dining out in fancy restaurants and indulging his taste for Premier League football from the touchline. Was that a helicopter I saw parked behind him? What a charming hat to keep the sun off his face in Barbados! And the other mums’ homes were almost uniformly spotless, their children immaculate, whereas I hadn’t had time to have my hair done, let alone have the house redecorated. Further investigation revealed the same story across Britain: teddies were being treated to sun loungers and sports cars by parents everywhere from Cheshire to Cornwall. Then came the most high-flying weekend I . could dream up at such short notice: a jaunt to a National Trust . stately home for high tea, followed by the sailing club to show Spencer . how to set a spinnaker . Even a quick flick through my friends’ Facebook pages brought up countless pictures of different mascots from schools around the country enjoying a lifestyle that would rival that of the Beckhams. Teddies were climbing Machu Picchu, sunning themselves aboard luxury yachts and availing themselves of exotic canapes in every far-flung corner of the world. How could our Spencer Bear ever live up to the standard set so high? Still, I was determined to try. A new photoshoot got underway. Imogen had her face scrubbed and her hair scraped back into a tidy bun before we posed her with Spencer at her ballet lesson. Forget the playroom, strewn with Lego. That week she did her homework, with Spencer by her side, in the freshly polished drawing room. Then came the most high-flying weekend I could dream up at such short notice: a jaunt to a National Trust stately home for high tea, followed by the sailing club to show Spencer how to set a spinnaker. Come Monday morning, and a last-minute panic, it was bye-bye to Crunchy Nut Cornflakes in an Ikea bowl and hello to porridge, fresh fruit and Wedgwood tableware.

One teacher tells how competitive parents at her school became, despite the instructions being to draw pictures or write a sentence about doing a simple task such as posting a letter or going to the park. ‘We had ticket stubs from rugby internationals, postcards, photos and trips to all sorts of places.’ Another mother confesses: ‘We ensure the photos are angled so the kitchen looks good and you can’t see the missing unit or messy worktops.’ Emma Citron, a consultant clinical psychologist and a specialist in child and adolescent development, thinks that the poor job market has also made parents snap into a more competitive, aggressive ‘survival mode’. She says: ‘They are worried that their children aren’t going to succeed, so there is a mad scramble to buy them popularity and status. I’ve rarely felt so stressed, and I’m . not alone: internet forums are filled with mothers driven to the brink . by the visit of their class bear . ‘The bear is seen as a useful way to show where you are in the social pecking order and get a foothold for your child up the ladder.’ Samantha Turnbull, 52, a teaching assistant at a state primary school in Wokingham near Reading, says that her school bear is just as likely to go on a cruise as share a TV dinner. But with a mix of pupils from affluent middle-class families and others on benefits, the bear serves only to emphasize the difference. ‘It’s sad to look through the bear’s diary and see lots of blank pages from some families, alongside glossy pictures of the teddy having a whale of a time with children who have a lot of material possessions,’ she says. And if the teachers are noticing the social divide, you know the children are, too. Indeed, evidence gathered by the Times Educational Supplement suggests that some schools are now phasing out the bears to avoid putting a strain on parents. Nadine Field, a consultant psychologist based in Buckinghamshire who specialises in family life, says that competitive parenting has always existed, but has changed from emphasising academic prowess — the kid with a genius IQ — to wealth and status. ‘Competitive parenting is now more about material possessions — “My car is bigger than yours.” The answer is to reassure children that they are special and unique. There will always be people who are richer than you, but a loving family is the most important thing, not electric gates.’ Yet Sara White, 44, a primary school teacher in Central London, thinks a total ban would be a shame. ‘In my experience, kids love the bear and identify with it,’ she says. ‘As well as being a useful educational tool, it really helps teachers gain a window into their home life, which can be very revealing. ‘It may be clear that the child’s learning development is not supported, and we can offer extra help at school. Or that a child’s mum is doing their homework for them. That is really obvious, too.’ Well-traveled: A teddy on a trip to Hawaii shows how far parents are willing to go to beat each other in the battle of the bear . But some parents have already started a backlash against the one-upmanship. One teacher told the Times Educational Supplement that her class bear had been returned on Monday with a photo and a caption reading: ‘The bear wandered aimlessly around B&Q, looking at taps.’ ‘The bear is seen as a useful way to . show where you are in the social pecking order and get a foothold for . your child up the ladder.’Emma Citron . Another parent revealed that the bear had ‘enjoyed the afternoon spinning around the washing machine to clean off the ingrained dirt it had accumulated during the school year’. And, to my horror, I discovered that my own husband, worn out from my efforts to posh up our lifestyle, had punctured my carefully crafted image of domestic bliss. After I had dropped the bear back at school, he told me that he had stuck in some pictures I hadn’t authorised. Spencer was down the pub having a pint and a curry, before indulging in a fry-up beside a digital clock which revealed it was 3am. I was furious. What would the other oh-so perfect mums think when they saw Spencer with a pint of bitter between his chunky paws? So I’m already planning next year’s teddy bear outing. With a little preparation, and some cleverly Photoshopped pictures of exotic locations, Spencer’s next visit to the Jourdan household will beat all those other yummy mummies hands down.","What should be an innocent activity has become a social divide .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Caroline Loweth, 48, has been jailed for life after being found guilty of knifing her partner to death on October 27 last year . A woman who told police her partner died when he accidentally fell on a knife while peeling vegetables has been jailed for life after being found guilty of his murder. Caroline Loweth, 48, knifed John Fletcher to death at their flat in Wolverhampton city centre on October 27 last year. The 53-year-old relief pub manager died of a single stab wound to the heart. Loweth denied murder and Wolverhampton Crown Court heard she dialled 999 and told an ambulance operator Mr Fletcher had slipped and impaled himself while preparing their lunch. But a jury took 10 hours and 45 minutes to return a unanimous guilty verdict yesterday. During the trial the court heard Loweth had a history of violence and had previously stabbed Mr Fletcher on four separate occasions before his death. Mr Fletcher had reported one incident but withdrew the complaint when he decided to give the relationship another chance. Speaking after the verdict, Detective Sergeant Harry May, from West Midlands Police, said: ‘During this investigation it became quite clear that John Fletcher had suffered many extremely serious injuries at the hands of his partner. ‘Fuelled by alcohol, Loweth would regularly lose her temper and stab John. ‘In one of these attacks John was stabbed through his bowel and had to undergo intensive surgery to save his life. John Fletcher, 53, died of a single stab wound to the heart after being knifed by his partner at their home in Wolverhampton city centre . ‘The sad fact is that if he had followed through with these previous complaints he may still be alive. ‘Today our thoughts go out to John’s family who are all devastated by his tragic murder. ‘John was a good man who was loved by all who knew him and this has made his killing all the more difficult for them to deal with.’ During the two-week trial the jury heard the 999 call Loweth made after she stabbed Mr Fletcher. She told the operator: ‘He was peeling some vegetables and has fallen on a knife. All this happened when I was out of the room.’ But a Home Office pathologist said Mr Fletcher’s injuries were consistent with being deliberately stabbed with a six-inch knife. Dr Olaf Biedrzycki said a blow with ‘approaching severe’ force was needed to inflict the fatal wound. He said the blade damaged a rib as it plunged up to five inches into his chest. Loweth was jailed for life and told she would serve at least 17 years before being eligible for parole. Detective Inspector Kim Madill, from the West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit, said: ‘We take all reports of domestic abuse very seriously. ‘We often find that men are reluctant to report abuse and where weapons are being used the abuse can escalate and become life threatening, long before they seek help.’","Caroline Loweth, 48, told police her partner fell on knife while peeling veg .

"By . Leon Watson . An Amatix employee holds a smart gun by the company at the Armatix headquarters in Munich . Prototypes of a James Bond-style pistol that can only be fired if its owner is wearing a watch have been unveiled by the company making it. The slick smart gun from Amatix uses a watch that transmits an identifying radio frequency that prevents everyone but its wearer from firing. Its makers claim the innovation, which was shown today at the Amatix headquarters in Munich, Germany could held curb gun violence. The gun is one of several competing for a $1 million prize from the Smart Tech Challenges Foundation, a group started by tech investors in response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, where 26 were killed in 2012. The Smart System's futuristic . appearance hides its simple logic: wear the watch and you can fire the . gun. Don't wear the watch and the pistol is a useless hunk of metal. A light on the gun glows green when it can be fired and red when it's locked. According . to the company website, the gun deactivates itself as soon as its out . of range of the watch such as when its been stolen by an intruder or . knocked out of its owner's hand. 'Technology has been proven to solve today's greatest social challenges, and curbing gun violence in this country is one of the greatest challenges we face,' billionaire tech investor Ron Conway told CNN. Conway, who's pumped millions in companies like Twitter, Facebook, BuzzFeed and more, is one of the investors behind Smart Tech Challenges Foundation. A panel will assess the gun safety solutions devised by companies including Armatix and offer cash rewards to fund the brightest and best. The gun is implanted with an electronic chip that allows it to be fired only if the shooter is wearing a watch that communicates with it through a radio signal . If the gun is moved more than 10in from the watch, it will not fire . A light on the gun glows green when it can be fired and red when it's locked . 'We are going to find that entrepreneur who wins this contest and hopefully build that idea into a huge company,' said Conway. While only the Armatix gun works with its watch, another entry is a device that can be inserted into any Glock pistol and warns the owner any time the gun is moved or used. Another entry is a fingerprinted-activated gun lock devised by Carmen Lobis, the grandfather of Sandy Hook victim Benjamin Wheeler. Conway told CNN his group's contest seeks to find the 'Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page of gun safety.' However, the gun has not received universal approval. Gun owners and National Rifle Association . members have expressed fears the new technology will be mandated and will encroach . on Second Amendment rights . Earlier this month a gun store owner in Rockville, Maryland, who said he would sell the nation’s first smart gun was forced to back down. Andy Raymond, the co-owner of Engage Armament, a store known for its custom assault rifles, had to endure a day of protests and death threats. He said that offering the Armatix iP1 handgun was a 'really tough decision' after what happened to the Oak Tree Gun Club near Los Angeles, which was also lambasted for offering to sell the gun.","Smart gun unveiled by Amatix in Munich, Germany .

The teenager then opens her mouth and screams, while Jair continues to gaze at the camera phone . The first photo shows Kirsty Middleton, 16, and her friend, Jair Townsend, smiling at a camera phone while lying on a bed at a house in Basildon, Essex.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Killed: Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot and killed by FBI agents in May, more than a month after the Boston Marathon bombing . The FBI agent who fatally shot Ibragim Todashev in his small Orlando apartment last year has a troubling, controversial history as a former officer for the Oakland Police Department in California, the Boston Globe reports. Not much was known about the agent who killed the Chechen friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev because the FBI declined to identify him, but it has now been revealed that the agent’s name is 41-year-old Aaron McFarlane. According to the Globe, McFarlane retired from the department at the age of 31 after he was the subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs investigations. Authorities have said the agent was justified in shooting Todashev because he lunged at the investigators inside his apartment. Now a Muslim civil rights group is demanding an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and state officials into what it calls the 'checkered history' of the FBI agent recently cleared in the fatal 2013 shooting of Ibragim Todashev, an acquaintance of one of the accused Boston Marathon bombers. 'If the DOJ and the State Attorney's offices did not know about the agent's history, how can the public trust the thoroughness and reliability of the investigation?' Hassan Shibley, director of the Florida chapter of the Council on Islamic-American Relations (CAIR), wrote in a letter this week to the civil rights office of the Department of Justice. Shibley also sent letters to the FBI director and the State Attorney in Orlando asking if they knew about the agent's past. Self defense: Ibragim Todashev, pictured with his wife, was in the middle of being questioned when he was shot dead and a new report reveals that he tried attacking the FBI agents with a pole before he was shot . Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed . martial arts fighter, was killed in Orlando in May while FBI agents and . Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with . suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Officials originally said Todashev . lunged at an agent with a knife while he was being questioned. They . later said it was no longer clear what happened. Authorities . say Todashev befriended the late Tsarnaev brother while living in . Boston and agreed to cooperate with the FBI’s investigation as officials . narrowed in on the brothers last year. During the May 22 interrogation, . however, he reportedly turned violent and lunged towards officials, . prompting shots to be fired. The Boston Globe identified the agent who finally killed him as Aaron McFarlane, 41, formerly with the Oakland Police Department in California. Two . investigations, one by the FBI itself and one by the Florida Attorney . General’s office, exonerated the FBI in the shooting death, claiming the . agent, never identified, had been acting in self-defense, when Todashev . allegedly ran at him with a raised broom handle. According . to the Globe on Wednesday, and old newspaper clippings and court . records included in a CAIR press release, the FBI agent, while a police . officer in Oakland, invoked his constitutional right not to answer . questions under oath as a witness in a police corruption trial, and was . also the subject of two settled police brutality cases in 2003. 'How . credible and thorough are the DOJ and State Attorney's investigations - . which relied heavily on testimony given by individuals who may have . engaged in police misconduct, civil rights abuses, and evidence . falsification?' Shibley wrote in his letter to the DOJ. Federal . prosecutors have said in court filings that Todashev named Tsarnaev as a . participant in an earlier triple homicide in Massachusetts. The filings . were made in the case against Tsarnaev's brother, surviving bombing . suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Cleared: Florida prosecutors have chosen not to pursue charges against FBI agents involved in the killing (seen in May after his death) Connections: FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Earlier this year a Florida prosecutor cleared the FBI agent of any criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting. According . to the Globe, McFarlane appears to have a checkered past at Oakland’s . Police Department - a police department that has such an extraordinary . record of corruption and brutality, that since 2012 it has been operated . under the supervision of a federal court 'compliance director,' whose . job is to see that officers don’t brutalize residents or violate their . civil rights. The paper also . reports that during his four years with the Oakland Police, he was the . subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs . investigations. 'McFarlane . had worked at the troubled Oakland department from 2000 to 2004, during . the biggest police corruption scandal in the city’s history,' The Globe . reported. He later pleaded the Fifth to avoid incriminating himself . during testimony related to the probe. In . one case of alleged police brutality, the department awarded $22,500 to . a man who accused the police of assault and false imprisonment. In an . other, a man was was paid $10,000 for alleged 'force and civil rights . violations.' The brothers Tsarnaev: Tamerlan (left) died in a gunbattle with police in the days after the Boston bombing and Dzhokhar (right) faces 30 federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty . Scene: The one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing happened last month . The Globe also . identified Curtis Cinelli and Joel Gagne as the two Massachusetts State . Police Troopers who were in the room when Todashev was shot. Neither trooper was involved in the Todashev shooting, according to the Florida or FBI investigations. Dzhokhar . Tsarnaev — the younger brother of the slain suspected bomber—will be . tried later this year for his role in the April 15, 2013 bombing. If . found guilty, prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty. According . to the filings, Todashev told investigators Tamerlan Tsarnaev . participated in a triple slaying in Waltham on September 11, 2011. State . Attorney Jeff Ashton, who had jurisdiction over the shooting, concluded . that Todashev was writing a statement after a long interview when he . suddenly attacked the agent and officer. Neither . Ashton's office, the Department of Justice nor the FBI responded on . Wednesday to requests for comment. All three agencies kept the . identities of the agent and officer secret.","Federal law enforcement agent who fatally shot a 27-year-old acquaintance of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev last year has been linked to other violent outbursts .

Six-time Olympic champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has again been on the sharp end of abuse from disgruntled football fans after Chelsea supporters took to social media to vent their fury at referee Chris Foy. Foy sent off Willian and Ramires, as well as Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, in Saturday's 1-0 loss at Aston Villa as the Barclays Premier League leaders' title challenge faltered.

When a secretary refused to open the doors, he pounded on the front entrance and screamed 'let me in!' 'Let me in! Let me in! I'm God, I'm f***ing God!' a witness recounted to WBAL-TV. The man returned moments later - this time with a landscaping truck he had stolen- careering up the sidewalk and front steps of the TV station and ramming the doors several times before finally smashing through driving inside. Scroll down for video . Smashed: This is the doorway that a man smashed his landscaping truck through at the offices of WMAR-TV outside Baltimore, Maryland, Tuesday afternoon . Smashed: This is the stolen dump truck that smashed through the lobby of Baltimore TV station WMAR-TV on Tuesday . An image from the surveillance video at WMAR-TV shows the moment the truck crashed through the lobby . Police say that after locking himself in a second-floor editing room in the building, he turned on a TV and watched the commotion he had just caused unfold live on local and national broadcasts. Just before 5pm, Baltimore County police officers sent a dog into the room where the man was holed up. The man was subdued so that officers could arrest him. Police had initial reports that the man was heavily armed - possibly with several guns. Heavily-armed SWAT teams quickly swarmed the area and began clearing the building. Terrified staffers fled the building through a back door. Everyone was believed to be safe and accounted for within an hour of the incident. However, four hours after the attack, SWAT officers discovered one lone staffer who had taken cover and was cut off from the rest of the employees. The TV station is on lockdown. The TV news channel, an ABC affiliate, has not been able to get on air, but that hasn't stopped the staff from tweeting about the incident. Brian Keubler, a WMAR reporter, wrote that he watched at the man ran up to the front doors of the TV station and pounded on the doors. He screamed that he was God and yelled 'Let me in!' Frightening: Brian Kuebler, a WMAR-TV reporter, tweeted out live updates of the harrowing incident at his station . At least three heavily-armed SWAT teams have entered the building to search for the man, who is believed to be barricaded inside . SWAT officers arrived in force after police received reports that the suspect was heavily armed . Evacuating: SWAT officers have evacuated the building of all employees, according to WMAR-TV executives. SWAT officers are still searching for the suspect . Then, he got into a landscaping truck and rammed the doors at least three times before breaking through into the building. So far, a head count in the TV station has revealed that none of the employees are missing or injured, Kuebler wrote. Helicopter video from WJZ-TV shows a hole in the front of the building, large enough for a vehicle to enter. Drivers were still able to enter a neighboring shopping center, although a section of the road was blocked to traffic. Two schools near the TV station are on lock-down as officers hunt for the suspect. A stretch of busy York Road in Towson, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, has been closed - disrupting traffic flow in the region. Despite the show of arms, police arrested the suspect without incident .","The man crashed through the front doors of WMAR-TV about 11.45am when a security guard refused to let him in .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A British schoolboy has become the youngest person ever to trek to the South Pole. Lewis Clarke, 16, broke the world record at 6pm yesterday following a gruelling 700-mile journey in temperatures as low as -50C. He celebrated his incredible feat with a bowl of spaghetti bolognese - accompanied by a sprinkling of fresh parmesan. Successful: Lewis Clarke, 16, from Bristol, has become the youngest person ever to trek to the South Pole . He ate the popular dish - his first proper meal in nearly seven weeks - in the warmth of a heated tent. The GCSE student, . from Bristol, spent 46 days in sub-zero temperatures and 120mph blizzards during his attempt to clinch the world record. He travelled on skis for an average of eight hours and 18 miles a . day, before reaching the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station a few hours later than expected. He is now expecting to have his record officially verified by Guinness World Records. Challenging: The GCSE student spent 46 days in sub-zero temperatures and 120mph blizzards during his bid to clinch the world record. He is now expecting to have his feat officially verified by Guinness World Records. On his arrival, Lewis said: 'I'm really happy, but mostly relieved that for the first time in 48 days I don't have to get up tomorrow and drag my sled for nine hours in the snow and icy wind. 'Today was really hard. The closer I got to the Pole, the slower I went. My legs had had enough. 'But now I'm here and I've had some spaghetti bolognaise and I am sitting in a heated tent.' Lewis, who was raising money for youth charity The Prince's Trust, began his epic journey on December 2. He had been planning the expedition . for three years and began a tough training regime a year ago, starting with a two-week polar training course in Norway. Accompanied by experienced polar guide, Carl Alvey, he was forced to pull his own supplies during the trek - with the exception of three organised food drops. He has also encountered a range of problems over the past 46 days, including blisters, a broken ski and coughs caused by the high altitudes, . Speaking . during the Pole expedition, Lewis said: ‘I used to love snow, hate hot . places and hot weather, and wear shorts in the middle of winter. Now I'm . not too sure. ‘I've been through the entire list of Polar problems. I knew it would be hard, but it's harder than I ever thought it would be. Winning man: Lewis, who was raising money for The Prince's Trust, began his epic journey on December 2 . ‘I think sometimes about how few people have done this. Only 300 in 100 years. That's pretty cool.’ By reaching the South Pole, Lewis has become the youngest person to ski the full 700 miles from the Antarctic coast to pole (Hercules Inlet route) - beating Sarah Landry, of Canada, aged 18, in . 2004. The schoolboy has stayed overnight at the Pole and has been offered a tour of the Amundsen Scott Polar Research base today. He is expecting to fly back to Union Glacier base camp later today and will be back in the UK on January 24.","Lewis Clarke, 16, has become youngest person ever to trek to South Pole .

"By . Simon Cable Showbusiness Correspondent . Prince William has been compared to the Nazis and the Taliban over his calls for the destruction of the royal ivory collection. David Battie, the longest-serving expert on the Antiques Roadshow, claimed the Duke of Cambridge’s proposal was no different to dictatorships that eradicate artworks for political or religious reasons. William said he would like the Royal Family’s 1,200 ivory artefacts to be destroyed to reinforce his message that trade in the tusk material is immoral. Criticism: Prince William, pictured left wearing the logo of the wildlife foundation Tusk, received an open letter from antiques expert David Battie (right) saying ridding the Royal Family of its ivory would make little difference . But in an open letter to the prince, 71-year-old Mr Battie said the items – some more than 200 years old – should be left untouched to help future generations learn about historic societies. The BBC star, who works for art auctioneers Sworders and was previously employed by Sotheby’s, wrote: ‘Your highness, I have nothing but admiration for your principled stance, your obvious love of wildlife in general and of the elephant in particular, but I really don’t think that destroying the one will preserve the other.’ He said earlier societies’ creations allow us to ‘build up a picture of their world’, adding: ‘Destroying their works of art erases them from the historical record. ‘Such iconoclasm has not been much admired by succeeding generations … to witness a few: the Mongols, the Nazis, Khmer Rouge, the Roundheads, Mao Tse Tung and the Taliban.’ The letter, published in the Antiques Trade Gazette, added: ‘I do not think that this wholesale destruction would move the progress of the campaign one iota.’ It was primatologist Dame Jane Goodall who last month revealed Prince William had said he would ‘like to see all the ivory owned by Buckingham Palace destroyed’. Illegal: Prince Charles and Prince William are show items confiscated by customs officers last year . Much of the Royal Collection was presented to the monarchy by foreign countries, but is now held in trust for the nation. William and was at the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London last month, where his father warned the imminent extinction of some species would have ‘dire consequences for humanity’. Prince Charles told international leaders the ‘appalling’ illegal ivory trade was ‘annihilating our threatened wildlife’. The Royal Collection includes an ivory throne on which Queen Victoria was photographed when she became Empress of India in 1876. One of the oldest artefacts is a leather and ivory fan celebrating the recovery of King George III from an illness in 1789. It was given to Victoria on her Golden Jubilee in 1887 and presented to Queen Mary in 1911. There is also an ivory cup decorated with rubies, emeralds and turquoise, bought by George IV in 1823. Legacy: This ivory throne was presented to Queen Victoria in 1851 and displayed at the Great Exhibition . Critics point out Prince William’s plan also threatens a portrait of his own grandmother – a miniature of the Queen as a toddler, painted on ivory in 1928. Renowned art critic Brian Sewell last night said he agreed with Mr Battie, adding: ‘The Prince has been very foolish and not thought this through… Destroying the ivory in the Royal Collection is not going to have any effect at all.’ The idea was also condemned by art broker David Harper who labelled it ‘bonkers beyond belief’. Dr Brendan Moyle and Dr Dan Stiles, who have conducted studies for charities such as Save The Elephants, suggested previous attempts to suppress the trade by destroying stockpiles have actually driven up the price of tusks.","In open letter David Battie, 71, said destroying ivory wouldn't save wildlife .

"By . Alex Greig . A Detroit father accidentally killed his one-year-old daughter while backing a car from the driveway of the family's eastside home.The heartbroken family of Jean Foster, who was almost two years old, say they are struggling to come to terms with losing the youngest member of their family. Detroit police Officer Keisha Beasley-Dorsey says that the baby's father didn't realize the child was behind his car when she was struck and rolled over about 5:30 p.m. Thursday May 8. Tragic: Baby Jean Foster was accidentally run over and killed by her father on their driveway . Sergeant Michael Woody tells The Detroit News that the girl's older brother yelled for their father to stop and administered CPR on his sister after she was hit. Despite his desperate efforts, baby Jean was pronounced dead on arrival at a Detroit hospital. Woody says it was not immediately clear if the girl made it out of the home on her own or if someone let her outside. Her father had been washing the car outside the family home on the 19100 block of Waltham near 7 Mile and Hoover on Detroit’s east side before the accident. Little Jean was the baby in a family of eight children. The family has yet to finalize funeral arrangement for the beloved baby and is seeking donations to cover the cost. Affectionately nicknamed 'Miss Jean,' the little girl was a beloved member of her family. Her favorite song was 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams, and she'd dance and giggle every time she heard it, Jean's family told The Detroit Free Press. Vibrant: Jean Foster was affectionately known as 'Miss Jean' and loved dancing to Happy by Pharrell Williams . 'She had the biggest smile and was very vibrant,' said her sister Terrika Foster, 29. 'She really had a personality of her own.' 'This is one of the most saddest days that I can recall,' Detroit Police Captain Darwin Roche told Fox 2. Officers were deeply moved by the loss and have been checking in with the family daily to support them. 'We’re trying to make sure that her arrangements will be taken care of, but unfortunately, we didn’t have life insurance for her,' Terrika Foster said. The family has started a Give Forward fundraiser online to raise money for funeral costs for Jean Foster. In an effort to prevent tragic accidents like this one ever occurring, starting in 2018 rear-view cameras will be required in all new vehicles. The law is expected to save the lives of more than 100 children every year.","Jean Foster, one, was backed over and killed by her father .

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . Loss: James Embry, 57, passed away in prison following a hunger strike - but his family was not told . Relatives of a man who died of a hunger strike in prison and was buried in a pauper's grave have revealed the devastating moment they learned of his death in the newspaper. James Kenneth Embry, who had been in and out of prison after struggling with alcohol and drug abuse and mental health issues, died after a five-week hunger strike at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville in January. After his death, prison officials said no family had visited him in prison or claimed his remains and he had been buried in a pauper's grave. It wasn't until his step-daughter Hope Keown - who described Embry as a fantastic father before he vanished from their lives - read an article while sat in her kitchen that she learned of his death. 'We didn't even know he was back in prison,' Keown, 35, told the Associated Press. She . and her mother, 58-year-old Mae Embry of Owensboro, Kentucky, didn't . believe what they were reading at first, then broke into tears as the . reality set in. They struggled to tell other relatives. 'Kenny . was very strong willed so it breaks my heart that he resorted to . starving himself,' Keown said. 'I think he wanted to live the good life . and be a family man. He just didn't know how to shake his demons.' Embry's hunger strike had included a nine-day stretch in which he . lost 32 pounds from his six-foot frame, dropping down to just 138 . pounds. He eventually died from dehydration and starvation. Scene: Officials at the Kentucky State Penitentiary said that no relatives had visited him in prison or claimed his remains, so his body was buried in a pauper's grave. His family learned of his death in a news article . It came after Embry was hit with a nine-year term for multiple drug crimes in 2010 and given multiple disciplinary infractions. Then a . fight with another inmate in 2013 had led him to request a cell in solitary . confinement because he feared for his safety. In May 2013, Embry requested to stop taking anti-anxiety medications. In December, he was denied a request to resume them. Four . days later, he began refusing meals. He did not make clear why he began . the hunger strike, but he expressed suicidal thoughts and told a prison . psychologist: 'I have nothing left to live for.' His death prompted . an internal investigation by corrections officials and a separate . investigation by state police. A doctor was fired and others were investigated. Heartbroken: Hope Keown said her stepfather was 'the best ever' before they drifted apart . The . case exposed lapses in medical treatment and the handling of hunger . strikes, and the local prosecutor is considering whether a grand jury . should hear the case. Keown said that her stepfather had not always been so troubled. She recalled the good times, such as when a sober Embry helped with homework and folded laundry. He had drifted in and out of jails since 1978, serving short sentences for drug offenses and assault, but between stints behind bars, Embry had two sons and a daughter, married Mae Keown Embry and moved in with her and her two daughters. Embry entered Hope Keown's life when she was nine years old. 'When my stepdad was on his medication, he was the best ever!' said Keown. When he was sober, Embry was a hard-working man who was big on family dinners, helping with homework and teaching his stepchildren life skills, from changing a tire and saving money to washing dishes and folding laundry, Keown and her mother said. Embry purchased the crib and changing table for Keown's first child when she was 19. 'That was probably one of the last moments I really shared with him,' she said. But after a while, Embry 'grew bored and started partying with a certain group of friends that mom made clear was just a bad group of friends,' mainly people he had met in jail, she said. That's when he brought out 'Spider Red', the nickname he gave to the side of his personality fueled by alcohol and drugs - and the nickname he felt compelled to get tattooed on his right arm. Family members said Embry had battled for years with mental illness and addiction. As much as all of that drove them apart, it also fuels their anger at how his life ended in a tragic death while in the state's care. 'This man needed treatment,' Mae Embry said. 'Just because he's mentally ill, you don't throw him out with the dishwater.' He didn't like taking anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications and would start using drugs and alcohol, then land in jail. Things got worse when his father, Herman Embry, died in 2001 while James Embry was in jail. Officials wouldn't grant him furlough to attend the funeral. 'I think that changed him,' Keown said. 'I think he started to lose hope.' The marriage ended more than a decade ago, and Embry's family lost touch with him long before he began his final prison sentence. No dramatic moment led to the split, the family said. Instead, after the divorce, different lifestyles simply pushed him out of his loved ones' orbit. Mae Embry and Keown are now dealing with regrets and hope to make some amends by trying to move his remains to a family plot. 'Just because you're divorced doesn't mean we stopped caring about him,' Mae Embry said. 'It's just, sometimes when someone is like that, you need to move on with your life.'","James 'Kenny' Embry, 57, died at Kentucky State Penitentiary in January and was buried after officials said no one claimed his remains .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Text messages show Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev joking with a friend not to text him hours after the FBI released Tsarnaev's photo as a suspect in the deadly attack. Dias Kadyrbayev texted Tsarnaev shortly after the FBI publicly released photos of Tsarnaev and his brother as suspects in the deadly 2013 attack. Tsarnaev responded that he had seen the news, then texted, 'Better not text me my friend,' then 'Lol.' Friends: Boston bombing suspect Dzokhar Tsarnaev's friends Azamat Tazhayakov (left), Dias Kadyrbayev (center)and Robel Phillipos (right) are currently facing trial. Pictured above in Boston court on May 13 . Charges: Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are being accused of removing Tsarnaev's (above) backpack containing fireworks and laptop from his dorm room after the bombings . In another text, Tsarnaev told Kadyrbayev he could go to his room and 'take what's there' followed by a smiley face. Some of the messages had been released previously, but a complete transcript of Kadyrbayev's text messages in the days after the bombing was released by prosecutors Thursday. Kadyrbayev and another friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, are accused of removing a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth several days after the bombings. A third friend, Robel Phillipos, is accused of lying to investigators. None of the men are accused of participating in the bombing or knowing about it ahead of time. Other details of Kadyrbayev's relationship with Tsarnaev were revealed in court today by FBI special agent Steven Schiliro. Agent Shiliro interviewed Kadybayev after the attacks and the college-student told him that he and Tsarnaev had a dream to open a Starbucks together in his home country of Kazakhstan. Schiliro says Kadyrbayev asked about joining the FBI and even joked about 4:20 - 'the time of day people who smoke marijuana celebrate smoking marijuana.' Tazhayakov and Phillipos declined to testify this week during a hearing over statements they made under questioning by federal agents. U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Woodlock said Thursday he would not throw out their statements. Not cooperative: Another friend Robel Phillipos (pictured), is being accused of lying to investigators . Kadyrbayev had been expected to testify Friday, but Woodlock said that will be postponed until after testimony from an expert witness. The judge did not rule on Kadyrbayev's request to suppress statements he made to investigators; his suppression hearing is expected to resume in two weeks. Prosecutors and the men's attorneys are arguing over whether the statements were voluntary and can be used as evidence in the upcoming trials. Prosecutors have said the men willingly spoke to federal agents after being told of their right to remain silent and to contact a lawyer. Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl, has argued that his client, who is from Kazakhstan, did not have a complete command of the English language and did not fully understand the waiver forms he signed. Retail aspirations: It was also revealed in court today that Kadyrbayev and Tsarnaev dreamed of opening a Starbucks together in Kazakhstan . Also on Thursday, prosecutors disclosed that a lawyer claiming to represent the friends called the state police barracks while they were being questioned, but the men were never told about the call. In the court filing, prosecutors said a state trooper took a call from a man who identified himself as an attorney and said he didn't want the men answering any questions. The trooper said he told a federal agent about the call, a conversation Kadyrbayev's lawyer argues should have triggered 'numerous legal consequences' that mean the statements should be suppressed. The filing included an email exchange from Wednesday between the trooper and one of the agents who questioned Kadyrbayev. According to the trooper, the lawyer said he was contacted by the state's public defender agency and told to call the barracks. Had no clue: None of Tsarnaev's friends are being accused of knowing about the attack before it happened. Tsarnaev (right) is pictured above with Tazhayakov (left) and Kadyrbayev (center) The trooper said he 'had no idea whether the caller was an actual attorney or some crackpot who was calling due to the media coverage.' The trooper said he told the attorney that one of the agents had just told him that Kadyrbayev, who was being questioned at the time, had been 'cooperative and had agreed to speak with them of his own free will.' In their filing, prosecutors say agents involved in the questioning recalled being told of the conversation 'after the defendants had made all the admissions they made that night regarding entering Tsarnaev's dorm room and removing items.' Two bombs placed near the finish line of the April 2013 marathon killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and is awaiting trial in November. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, also a suspect in the bombings, died following a shootout with police several days later.

"By . Alex Greig . A billionaire hedge fund manager has accused his former fiancée of crying poor while living in the lap of luxury. British socialite Annabelle Bond is in the throes of a legal battle with Warren Lichtenstein, who says Bond, 44, 'lavishes herself with fur coats and horses.' Bond and Lichtenstein broke off their engagement in 2007 when Bond was five months pregnant with Lichtenstein's child, and since then have waged a bitter battle across several continents. Lavish: Annabelle Bond's ex-fiance has accused her of living a life of luxury while 'crying poverty' Bond is now attempting to compel U.S. courts to enforce a judgement made in Hong Kong which awarded her $570,000 in child support for six-year-old Isabella, plus legal costs, reports the Telegraph. Lichtenstein, seeking to prevent the ruling being enforced, filed an affidavit in the New York Supreme Court pointing out that Bond is the daughter of a billionaire Sir John Bond, former chairman of HSBC bank and Vodafone, and dating a millionaire, Andrew Cader. 'At the same time that she is crying poverty in this case, she nonetheless lives in the most expensive section of Hong Kong, has two full-time maids and is driven about in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover,' reads the affidavit. Bitter battle: Lichtenstein is attempting to prevent a Hong Kong court ruling forcing him to pay Bond $600,000 for their daughter being enforced . She is also an avid traveler, according to the document, and globe-trots for a large part of each year. According to Stanley Arkin, Lichtenstein’s lawyer, Bond has already been to Los Angeles and Aspen, Colorado, twice this year, as well as to Austria, Japan, Malaysia and St. Barts. She also lives rent-free with Cader, who 'owns an equestrian estate in New York, a mansion in St. Barts, a home in Aspen, a sailing yacht, a 15,000-bottle wine collection and a private jet.' And Arkin also pooh-poohed the 'incredible assertion that Sir John — one of the richest men in the world — could not afford to continue making £2,000 per month allowance payments to [his daughter] due to his pending retirement,' reports Page Six. According to the Telegraph, Annabelle Bond has been distressed at the portrayal of her by Lichtenstein as a 'frivolous jetsetter.' Wealthy connections: Annabelle Bond's father is billionaire Sir John Bond (left) and her boyfriend is millionaire Andrew Cader (right) She was awarded an OBE in 2006 for her services to mountaineering and charity.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Las Vegas dancer on trial for the murder of his ex-girlfriend cried in court on Thursday as he showed the jury how she had died in his arms while he was trying to talk to her. Jason Omar Griffith claims he had been trying to defend himself as he and Deborah Flores Narvaez struggled during an altercation at his home in December 2010. He accused Ms Flores, a dancer from the racy Fantasy revue, of being abusive and said he feared she was reaching for a gun when he grabbed hold of her. On trial: Dancer Jason Griiffith demonstrates in court on Thursday how he and ex-girlfriend Deborah Flores Narvaez struggled on the night she was strangled . Ms Flores had gone to his studio apartment to watch Dexter, the TV series about a serial killer, on the night she disappeared. Her dismembered and decomposing body was found encased in concrete tubs inside a vacant house, in January 2011. Describing her as violent and possessive, he claimed that the dancer had threatened him and assaulted him. Griffith told the court no one had taken . him seriously when he tried to report Ms Flores for stalking and . harassing him after they began a relationship earlier in the year. On the night that she died, Griffith claimed that he was trying to stop her reaching a purse, which he thought contained a gun. 'I think she's reaching for the gun in her purse, but I have no way to know. I was telling her to stop. I pull her back toward me,' he said. Horrific: The dismembered body of dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez was found encased in concrete in 2011 . Violent: Griffith claims that his ex-girlfriend was abusive and possessive, and that he feared she was reaching for a gun . Griffith, a dancer in the Cirque du Soleil, showed the jury how Ms Flores' head had become wedged in his elbows as he fell backwards on the floor of his studio apartment. 'She says, ""I'm going to [expletive] . kill you. I'm going to [expletive] kill you"",' Griffith said, adding that she was kicking him with the high heels of her boots and threw her head back against his nose as he held her. Claiming that he was pleading with her to stop, Griffith said: 'I thought she was listening to me, because she wasn't moving anymore. She wasn't scratching me, or gasping for air.' Moments later, he claimed, he realized she wasn't breathing at all. Their fight had allegedly been because Ms Flores wanted him to stop seeing another dancer. He said she had claimed to be pregnant, but a medical examiner said there was no evidence to support this. Self-defense: Griffith has claimed he was trying to protect himself during an argument with Ms Florez . Accused: Griffith, pictured in court on Thursday, is facing charges over the murder of Deborah Flores Narvaez . Jurors were also played 14 calls that Griffith made to 911, accusing Ms Flores of assault. The dancer claimed the police response had been that 'a beautiful girl cannon be dangerous'. On . Friday, the prosecution is due to question Griffith about the . differences in what he told the jury and the denials he made to police . after Ms Flores disappeared. The . 35-year-old has acknowledged lying to police, and said he hid details . of the killing from everyone, including his housemate Louis Colombo, who . testified that he helped dispose of the victim's body. Griffith has pleaded not guilty . to first-degree murder, and his defense, Jeff Banks, says the dancer was acting in self-defense. Last moves: Sonya Sonnenberg, the victim's roommate, says Ms Flores had gone to Griffith's home to watch the TV series Dexter on the night she disappeared . Offended: Celeste Flores Narvaez, refuted claims in court on May 8 that her sister had been the aggressor in the relationship . 'They will show you pictures, and they . will be gruesome and they will be shocking,' Banks said during the opening statements on May 8. 'But that does . not change the fact ... that he was scared and he was afraid that she . was violent, and Jason Griffith was defending himself on December 12, 2010.' Griffith is accused of choking Ms Flores and asphyxiating her with a plastic bag over her head before trying to dispose of her body in tubs of cement. The jury has already heard from Ms Flores’ roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg, who testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith’s house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer - and never returned. After finding her dismembered body in a vacant house, police finally cracked the disappearance-turned-homicide case when they gave Griffith's housemate, Colombo, immunity from prosecution. Colombo told police he left the house after seeing Griffith put his hands around Flores' neck as they argued. When he returned, he could see Flores was dead. A friend, Kalae Casorso, told police that Griffith admitted to her that Ms Flores was in the huge tub of cement he and Colombo tried to store at her house.","Jason Omar Griffith is accused of murdering Deborah Flores Narvaez .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Houston, Texas has topped the list of dog attacks against postal workers, with 63 mailmen being bitten on their rounds in the city in the past year. After 5,581 of its employees were attacked in the past year, the postal service has started pleading with customers to take more responsibility for their pets. Overall, Texas had five cities in the top 30 list of highest recorded attacks, including two in the top 10. Dangerous dogs: This map, above, shows the top 10 cities with the highest number of attacks on postal workers. Houston, Texas, leads the way with 63 recorded attacks . For Dallas, a steep rise in attacks moved the city up from ninth place on the list last year with 27 attacks, to the number one worst city this year. Houston, Texas 63 . Los Angeles, California 61 . Cleveland, Ohio 58 . San Diego, California, 53 . Chicago, Illinois, 47 . Baltimore, Maryland 46 . Dallas, Texas 45 . Denver, Colorado 41 . Columbus, Ohio 39 . Kansas City, Missouri 33 . 'Houston has typically been in the top 10 for as long as we have been keeping track of dog attacks,' Dionne Montague, a USPS spokesperson based in the city, said. 'It's all dogs, since all dogs can bite. It's not one particular breed,' she added. Being bitten while at work has a negative impact on postal workers, who in some cases start to become nervous about doing their rounds. 'You have the physical injuries and mental injuries to deal with, because emotionally you are now scared almost to do your job,' Montague told the Houston Chronicle, adding that the majority of attacks on staff were from pets. In one case, a woman postal worker who was attacked by a pit bull last month is still recovering from her injuries. Houston Humane Society spokeswoman Monica Schmidt said part of the problem was because of stray dogs in the city. 'Some . irresponsible pet owners are letting their dogs roam freely, and there . are also unaltered pets that typically have a higher prey drive,' she . said. 'Houston’s . ever-growing stray dog situation is also one of the most prominent . components that have Houston leading the nation in dog attacks on postal . workers.' With the safety of their workers a priority, the postal service has the right to demand that dog owners collect their mail from the post office if their dog is considered dangerous. The problem of dangerous dogs taking a swipe at the mailman is widespread, with 62 cities across the U.S. making it to the top 30. The high number is because several cities tied on the same number of attacks. After Houston, the cities with the highest recorded number of dog bites were Los Angeles, Cleveland, San Diego and Chicago, with 61, 58, 53, and 47 attacks respectively. To protect their staff, and to ensure customers still get their mail delivered, the USPS has created a set of guidelines for dog owners, to encourage them to be responsible. 'There’s a myth we often hear at the postal service: ""Don't worry, my dog won't bite,' Linda DeCarlo, Manager of Safety at USPS, said. Owners are advised to keep their pet in a separate room while opening the door and to be careful about letting children take mail from the post worker when a dog is present, in case the family pet sees it as a threat. Postal workers weren't the only ones to be attacked last year. About 4.5 million Americans were bitten by dogs in the U.S., including more than 2 million children, according to figures released as part of National Dog Bite Prevention Week. The high number of bites also led to $483 million in insurance payouts.","5,581 mailmen across the U.S. were bitten on their rounds last year .

"By . James  Nye . A helpless dog owner watched from five-feet away as her beloved two-year-old Chihuahua-pug mix Paco was ripped to shreds and eaten by a brown bear on the front porch on Monday. Having moved to Sitka, Alaska, only in January, Paula Myers had bemoaned to friends she hadn't yet laid eyes on one bear. Now, after having witnessed her treasured pet's vicious death, the health professional has vowed to shoot the bear dead if it comes back to her property again. Tragic: Paco the Chihuahua-pug mix was eaten alive on Monday in front of his terrified and shocked owner in Sitka, Alaska . Friends: Paco and Prissy, his pug friend at home with Paula Myers - who lost her beloved pet on Monday . 'I had not seen a bear yet,' Myers said Wednesday to the Anchorage Daily News. 'I had no idea it would be 5 feet from my house, eating my dog.' The shocking run-in occurred on Monday evening at 6pm when Myers returned home and opened the doors to let Paco, who weighs six-pounds and her other pug named Prissy outside as she took her groceries inside. She then heard Prissy 'scream' and rushed onto her decking to see Paco pinned under a brown bear's paw just five-feet away. The bear, which is estimated to be three or four-years old, 'had just put his huge paw on the little dog and ripped him to pieces.' 'I screamed and screamed at the bear,' said Myers, who rushed inside to get a gun, but couldn't find it as her mind went blank from the horror of the situation. Instead she called state troopers and waited for them to arrive as the bear sat in front of her home eating Paco for 10 minutes. Recent move: Paula Myers is a healthcare professional and recently moved from Oklahoma to Alaska - and prior to Monday told friends she was looking forward to seeing her first bear . 'That bear had no fear of me whatsoever. He never even acknowledged my presence,' Myers said. 'It was horrifying,' Myers said. 'The worst part was how helpless I felt.' Troopers arrived and scared the bear away and later found the remains of Paco. Myers told the Anchorage Daily News that she thinks her dog thought the bear was a large dog. This was because he had never set eyes one before because she brought him with her from Oklahoma in January. She thinks that Paco approached the bear and lay down to submit to it. Before: Paco (left) and Prissy watch the front of Paula Myers' home - where the attack took place and play on the floor at home . 'I really think the whole thing was just accidental,' she said. 'But once a bear has found a food source, he comes back.' That evening the bear returned and Myers and her partner Brad Langdorf fired shots from a pistol in its direction to scare it off. They called troopers back and then called out representatives from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Myers denies that she and her partner have been naive in their attitudes towards living in Alaska. She told the Anchorage Daily News that she knows Sitka, an island community with 9,000 people, is prone to bears. However, the incident shook her so much that she contemplated leaving the state altogether but she says now she has decided to stay, fight and 'put her war paint on.' She has bought a shotgun and is ready to 'never, ever let that happen again.' Fearsome: The bear (not pictured) that ate Paco has not been found yet, but Paula Myers has purchased a shotgun should it return . However, since her harrowing account was published on Wednesday, Myers has been responding vigorously to criticism she has received online. Thanking the large majority of well-wishers, upset for her loss, Myers has choice words for the 'hard asses' Small: The little Chiuahua only weighed six-pounds and may have thought the bear was another larger dog to play with . 'I knew there were bears here when I chose to live here. Just because it's Alaska doesn't mean that me and my tiny dog do not have the right to feel safe in our own home,' said Myers on Facebook to commenter's online. 'A close encounter with a bear is much like labor, no matter how much you read or how many women describe it to you it does not become real until you have experienced it.' Venting her fury at another commenter, Myers said that she is prepared to fight for her property against the encroaching bear and is not afraid to use lethal force. 'I will burn the entire forest on my 2 acres if that's what it takes to live here safely,' said Myers. 'I did not disturb this bear, he is a rogue and came into my yard and killed my dog within 5 feet of my porch in broad daylight. 'If he returns to my house again I have already made the decision and preparation to blow his f****** head off.' Currently the bear has not been located, although Alaska Fish and Game are waiting to see what the bear will do. They have said their options are to use a stun gun to scare it off or to drug it and transport it elsewhere on the island.","Paula Myers watched in horror as her six-pound Chihuahua, Paco, was eaten alive by a brown bear just five-feet in front of her on Monday .

"By . Emma Innes . For much of human history, people have attempted to find the elixir of life. And now, scientists believe they have found a chemical that could eventually get them one step closer to unlocking the secret to eternal youth. They discovered that a supplement used by bodybuilders could increase life expectancy. A supplement used by bodybuilders could increase life expectancy, new research suggests (file picture) A study revealed AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate) increases the life expectancy of roundworms by up to 50 per cent. And, scientists say this finding is offering new hope of an anti-ageing drug for humans. The supplement is used to reach peak athletic performance and it can also help treat erectile dysfunction. But now, researchers say the chemical - which is involved in the metabolic pathway that generates energy - seems to delay ageing in a similar way to being on a diet. The discovery, reported online in the journal Nature, could suggest new strategies for the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases. Dieting has been shown to improve longevity and stave off diseases in a range of organisms - including humans. One study found reducing calorie intake by only 10 per cent could make people live longer. And now, it seems AKG mimics dieting by helping people burn fat. Drugs or . gene therapy that disrupt nutrient or energy metabolism can also provide . similar benefits, but although several chemicals that regulate ageing . have been found, the details of how they work are unclear. The . latest experiments on the tiny lab worm Caenorhabditis elegans showed . AKG delays ageing - and determines the mechanism by which it imparts . these effects. AKG can increase the life expectancy of the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (pictured) by up to 50 per cent . The worm - the first animal to have its entire DNA mapped - has been widely used in studies of ageing and lifespan. Worms are useful for studying ageing as they only have a life expectancy of two to three weeks so the effects of supplements can be established quickly. Despite its small size, more than a third of the worms’ genes are also the same as humans’ - and many mutants are already known to lengthen lifespan. The researchers said AKG acts on an energy producing protein to produce a body state that is the same as being on a diet. Taking AKG extends lifespan in the worms by regulating energy metabolism - and this could offer a target for therapeutic intervention. Professor Jing Huang, of the University of California in Los Angeles, said: ‘Metabolism and ageing are intimately linked. ‘Dietary restriction consistently extends lifespan and delays age-related diseases in evolutionarily diverse organisms. ‘Similar conditions of nutrient limitation and genetic or pharmacological perturbations of nutrient or energy metabolism also have longevity benefits. Here we show AKG extends the lifespan of adult Caenorhabditis elegans. ‘Our analyses uncover new molecular links between a common metabolite, a universal cellular energy generator and dietary restriction in the regulation of lifespan suggesting new strategies for the prevention and treatment of ageing and age-related diseases.’ While it could take years to extend lives dramatically the study raises the prospect of humans one day simply popping pills to live longer. She said: ‘Longevity molecules that delay ageing and extend lifespan have long been a dream of humanity. ‘Metabolites such as AKG that can alter C elegans’ lifespan suggest an internal mechanism may exist that is accessible to intervention. ‘Whether this can translate into manipulating the ageing process in humans remains to be seen.’","AKG increases the life expectancy of roundworms by up to 50 per cent .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A father who saw his son fatally shot by Los Angeles police on live television has filed a $20 million wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the city. The suit filed on behalf of parents Billy Beaird and Christal Benjamin on Thursday alleges officers violated the Constitution and state law when they fatally shot Brian Beaird, 51, who was unarmed. Beaird, an injured veteran, was shot on December 13 after police officers pursued him for nearly an hour for allegedly reckless driving. The chase ended when his Corvette hit a car in an intersection, seriously injuring the other driver, and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Bill Beaird, left, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles after he witnessed his unarmed veteran son, 51-year-old Brian Beaird, right, being fatally shot by LAPD officers last year . Heartbroken: Mr Beaird sobbed as he spoke about his hurt outside the police station last year . Beaird's father watched live as his son, a disabled veteran, staggered out of the Corvette, briefly raised his hands, was fatally shot multiple times in the front and back, and fell to the ground. The lawsuit alleges that officers were inadequately trained, used excessive force and committed battery and negligence. It states that the shooting is the 'fruit of the LAPD's longstanding unconstitutional customs and practices with respect to the use of deadly force' and criticized the department for a rising number of police shootings recently with little consequence for most officers. 'This has contributed to a culture of impunity, subject to which officers believe that they can open fire without consequences,' it states. Killed: Footage shows the moment that Beaird exited his car before he was shot multiple times by cops . Chase: Police had chased his car for nearly an hour and claimed he had been driving erratically . Los Angeles police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said the department doesn't comment on pending litigation. Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement in December that he was 'very concerned' after reading a preliminary report on the shooting. Beck has placed three officers on leave until the investigation ends, when they may receive discipline or further training. After the shooting last year, Bill Beaird said that he had turned on the TV after his panicked son called him while on the case. He insisted he had done nothing wrong. 'Pull over,' Bill Beaird told his son, 'he said he was going to do it, but he didn't do it.' He then watched in horror as the crash and shooting unfolded - initially thinking he son has only been hit by a Taser gun. Crash: The chase only came to a stop when he hit another car, pictured. The driver suffered injuries . 'I just can’t seem to get over this,' he said. He added that his son suffered from severe paranoia after brain tumor surgery that caused him to be discharged from the military - a condition that fueled his impulse to speed away. Attorney Dale Galipo, who is representing Beaird's parents, said the shooting is indicative of a larger problem nationally that needs to be addressed. Galipo said there have been more than 10,000 police shootings in Los Angeles County over the last 30 years but 'not one criminal prosecution of a police officer for a shooting. And that is why many members of the public think the system is unfair.' He added: 'If anyone other than a police officer had done that shooting (of Beaird) that would be first-degree murder. They would be in jail without bail.'","Brian Beaird, an injured veteran who reportedly suffered from paranoia, was shot multiple times following a high-speed chase last year .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Published: . 18:29 EST, 15 May 2014 . | . Updated: . 00:21 EST, 16 May 2014 . A Florida mother has been found guilty after a jury ruled she was sane when she shot dead her two teenage children. After a day of closing arguments on Thursday, the jury returned their verdict on Julie Schenecker, a military wife who killed her 13-year-old son Beau and 16-year-old daughter Calyx in Tampa in 2011. Schenecker, 53, was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder after prosecutors argued that she was sane at the time of the shootings. Guilty: Julie Schenecker, right, listens to the closing arguments as the trial into the double murder of her children comes to a close on Thursday . Sentenced: Schenecker cries and puts her head in her hands as the judge sends her to prison for life . Before sentencing her to life in prison, without parole, the judge said: '[It's] almost too much to comprehend what brings us here.' Schenecker and her family cried as the guilty verdict was read out. The prosecution had earlier claimed the murders had been planned because of anger at her family, and because her children were becoming 'mouthy'. The children's father, Parker Schenecker, said: 'Today's decision, for many reasons, gives my family a great sense of relief. 'While this decision doesn't bring my children back, it does give my family an opportunity to move forward.' His wife, who has suffered years of mental illness, had detailed the killings in a journal, which was found at the murder scene. Closure: Parker Schenecker, pictured in court on Thursday, said the verdict won't bring his children back but it will help the family move on . Victims: Calyx, 16, and Beau, 13, were shot dead by their mother in Tampa in 2011 . Emotional: Schenecker's mother Pat Powers, center, breaks down as her daughter is found guilty of two counts of murder . In her journal, one entry read: 'I . offed Beau on the way to practice. I accidentally shot the window then . shot him. One in the side of the head and one in his mouth because he . became so mouthy just like Calyx.' Another entry, about her daughter, . read: '[I] walked up without [Calyx] reacting, and shot her in the right . temple. Then shot her in the mouth, her sassy little mouth.' Both sides had presented several mental . health experts as witnesses during their trial, as the defense argued . that Schenecker had been legally insane. In Florida, the defense would have . needed to prove Schenecker had involuntarily committed the murders . because of mental illness for her to have been declared legally insane. Taken away: Schenecker looks at her family as she is led out of court. Before she left, she apologized . Trial: Parker Schenecker examines evidence at the trial of his wife. Prosecutors claimed Juilie Schenecker killed their children in anger at him . They would also have needed to prove that she did not know the difference between right and wrong at the time of the killings. In his closing arguments, prosecutor Jay Pruner said Schenecker had a 'long standing plan to kill her children,' WFLA reported. He claimed that she had planned for her husband, Patrick, to return home and find his whole family dead. She had planned to kill herself after murdering her children, but passed out through a combination of pills and alcohol before she was able to. Plea: Schenecker, pictured being led into the courtroom on Thursday, had tried to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, but a jury found she was sane at the time of the killings . Pruner suggested her motive was anger and resentment toward her . husband, saying she intended him to come home and find his family dead. Schenecker, . who had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity at the start of the . trial, faces a life sentence after the possibility of a death penalty . was ruled out. As she was sentenced to life in prison with no parole, Schenecker addressed the court, saying: 'I shot my son and daughter, I don’t know why,' Fox 13 reported. She apologized for the killing and, through tears, said: 'I know my children are I heaven. I want people to try to find comfort and meaning, as I do, that they are in no pain.' 'I'm prepared and accept your sentence. 'I apologize, I apologize to everyone in this courtroom who I have broken, the lives I have destroyed. I hope they can collect themselves as best as possible. All of us. Not just this courtroom - anybody who knew our family, Calyx and Beau, our children's friends, teachers, coaches, our relatives, aunts, cousins, grandparents, uncles, nieces, nephews, everyone has been so deeply affected and I understand that there are people affected by this that maybe just read about in the paper, maybe a child looked at their mommy and said, ""Mommy are you ever going to shoot me?"" I know that this could happen, and I apologize for what happened, what I did. I take responsibility. I was there. 'I know I shot my son and daughter. I don't know why. But I have a period of time to try to understand that. 'Your honor, the judicial system in the U.S. is the best in the world. We don't lash our women 125 times for driving when they're not supposed to drive. I'm proud to stand here in front of you, as I understand you might be prior service as well. And to serve my country, and I proudly said the first code conduct as a soldier, in 83, I said - I said, I'm an American fighting man [sic], serving in the forces which protect our country and our way and our way of life, an I’m prepared to give my life in their defense. I said that proudly, it changed, we’re no longer by men, we’re fighting in the forces which protect our country. 'It’s our trust and I believe in you and what you’ve done. You’ve run a great court. I have no experience, from what I’ve seen, you control the court tremendously well. I thank my attorneys who supported me, and I trusted them and they worked so well. And all those people behind me on my team, put in many, many hours on this case. I will never be able to repay all these people, I have no way to repay, but to say thank you. So thank you to the entire American judicial system. I am not playing you're honor, and that is heartfelt. 'I have one more... I know our children are in Heaven. I want people to try to find comfort and meaning as I do that they are in no pain. And they are alive and enjoying everything and anything Heaven has to offer, Jesus protecting them and keeping them safe until we get there, and their loved ones follow us to join them.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A fleeing suspected car thief bit off more than he could chew Tuesday when he crashed into an alligator that happened to be crossing the road. The unlucky reptile and 22-year-old Calvin Rodriguez collided as Rodriguez was trying to outrun the police in a stolen Honda Civic in Port St. Lucie, Florida. He wouldn't have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't that that pesky gator. Calvin Rodriguez, 22, was arrested after crashing a stolen Honda Civic into an alligator . Officers say they had lost Rodriguez's trail as they pursued him Tuesday night. He had two pals with him in the car at the time. But they found him - and his stolen ride - smashed into a guardrail a short time later. He told officers that he lost control after crashed into the reptile. 'It’s pretty unimaginable that police officers would be at that point in time looking for these suspects and that an alligator unfortunately just happens to cross the road and assist us in catching these criminals,' Detective Keith Boham told WPTV.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A New York City minister who was the subject of an investigation about misspent 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina charity funds has agreed to repay $1,231,105 million in restitution. The Rev. Carl Keyes took hundreds of thousands of dollars from his congregation to buy an 18th-century farmhouse on seven acres in rural New Jersey, a BMW and travel. Rev. Keyes and his wife, the Rev. Donna Keyes, who jointly led the Glad Tidings Tabernacle in Manhattan, signed a legal judgment Wednesday settling a probe by the New York attorney general into a series of questionable church financial transactions. The Rev. Carl Keyes pictured speaking to an audience in Harrisonburg, Va. about his life experiences relating to his organization, Aid for the World in 2010 . Those deals included an illegal loan the couple took from the church in 2008 to buy a house in Stockton, New Jersey, near the Delaware River, and $500,000 the church loaned to an anti-poverty charity controlled by Carl Keyes, called Aid for the World. Some of that money, the attorney general's office said, was used to buy the minister and his wife a BMW. According to the settlement, which was scheduled to be officially announced Thursday, other funds were used to finance family trips to California, West Virginia, Africa and Florida, where the couple's sons went to college. Glad Tidings former executive director, Mark Costantin, agreed to repay $482,000 he still owed Glad Tidings on $1.2 million in loans he'd taken from the church, some of which were used to pay off the mortgage on his house in Chester, New York. 'Carl and Donna Keyes and Mark Costantin abused the trust of their congregants and used Glad Tidings Tabernacle as their personal bank,' said Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. He said the law forbids officers and directors, including ministers, from taking any such loans — 'much less loans to finance personal expenses and lifestyle choices.' Three former members of the Glad Tidings' board agreed to pay $50,000 in penalties for neglecting their oversight duties. Rev. Carl Keyes (center), founder of Aid for the World, seen ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in 2009 . The attorney general's office began its investigation after the Associated Press raised numerous questions about Carl Keyes and two charities he controlled, including one that had received $4.8 million in donations intended to help victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The AP reported in articles in 2011 and 2012 that Keyes had diverted some of that money into his cash-starved church, then used funds from the church and the nonprofit groups to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal credit card bills and other debts. Keyes used one big donation, meant for his disaster-relief charity, Urban Life Ministries, to clear a mortgage on another New Jersey home. The AP also found that Keyes had embellished stories about relief work he performed in New York in the months after the 9/11 attacks. In some cases, he took credit for things that other people had done. Using a combination of internal documents and public records, the AP also chronicled how the church disposed of $31 million it made by selling off its historic Manhattan church in 2007. That report included detail on some of the loan transactions that were the subject of Wednesday's settlement. After the AP began asking questions, Keyes filed eight years of tax returns for Urban Life Ministries and three years for Aid for the World. State investigators said Costantin helped arrange for the church to lend nearly $1 million to the Keyes couple for their farmhouse purchase. The investigators added that Costantin signed paperwork in which the church gave up its right to claim ownership of the property if the loan wasn't repaid. No payments were made, the state said, and when the Keyes sold the house last year, they kept all the proceeds. A similar arrangement, approved by Keyes, took away the church's ability to collect on the loans to Costantin, the state said. New York law bars the officers and directors of nonprofit and religious organizations from taking any loans from their organizations. As a result of the legal settlement, Glad Tidings Tabernacle, now located in Harlem, has been placed under the temporary stewardship of a board appointed by an Assemblies of God umbrella organization. New York Assemblies of God District Superintendent Dr. Duane Durst said the organization planned to examine the church's finances carefully. The legal judgment requires the Keyes to pay $1,231,105 in restitution to Glad Tidings, which includes borrowed money plus interest. The Keyes couple and Costantin have been permanently barred from acting as fiduciaries of any New York nonprofit or religious corporation. The agreement allows Donna Keyes to continue to serve as senior pastor at Glad Tidings. The attorney who represented the ministers and Costantin, Maurice Heller, declined to comment. He said the settlement doesn't require his clients to admit guilt, but forbids them from making public statements contesting the allegations.","Rev.

"By . Associated Press . A 58-year-old man has been freed from jail on bond after appearing in court on charges he held his sister captive inside their Connecticut home for years. Arthur Gauvin was ordered on Wednesday to wear a monitoring device and stay 100 yards from the victim and her family. He said nothing as he left the courthouse after posting $125,000 bond, according to The Connecticut Post. Arthur Gauvin, pictured in a recent mugshot, allegedly kept his own sister a prisoner in the home they shared in Connecticut . Police say Gauvin's 56-year-old sister was found last month inside their Seymour home. The frail, malnourished woman was covered . in urine and human feces when police conducting a welfare check found . her, according to Paul Satkowski, deputy chief of the . Seymour police. A lock was on the outside of her bedroom door and the . room's windows were blacked out with paint. Police went to the house after an anonymous caller expressed concerns about the woman's welfare. Neighbors told police that they had suspicions about the way the woman was being treated, according to recently-released court documents seen by The Courant. Neighbors told officers last month that a few years ago, the woman broke through a window at the squalid home and crawled to a nearby house 'begging for food'. The neighbors who reported the incident asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Arthur Gauvin . was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment . and cruelty to persons. The brother and sister lived in the same house . with other relatives including children. Gauvin also is charged with threatening a family member who was preparing to speak with police. Police say Gauvin's 56-year-old sister was found covered in human waste last month inside their home in Seymour, Connecticut . Veteran police officer Lisa Wexler . described a frail, starving woman covered head-to-toe with feces and . urine who sat in a room so foul officers couldn’t breathe. They had to . leave and call in a colleague wearing a hazardous material suit with an . air pack to explore the room. 'Your . eyes immediately watered. The smell … awful. We had to change uniforms . after leaving because the stench was in them,' Wexler said. 'I . served on the New Haven police force for 22 years before retiring and . coming here last July. I never saw anything like this in my years with . New Haven. I was absolutely shocked.' The . woman was recovering at Yale-New Haven Hospital from . what police said was neglect by her caretaker - her brother, Arthur . Gauvin. 'Officers and . detectives have determined the motive for Gauvin keeping the victim . locked up inside the house was so he wouldn’t lose the house to the . state of Connecticut,' Deputy Chief Paul Satkowski said. The window to the tiny room where the 56-year-old woman lived was blacked out so neighbors couldn't see in . Detectives learned that the victim had . owned the house once, and that ownership was transferred to Arthur . Gauvin seven years ago. He was required to care for his sister for a . total of nine years before the state would begin providing her any . services, Satkowski said. The exact details of the home ownership issue are still being sought by investigators, he said. Satkowski, . at the post-arraignment news conference, said officers had been called . to the home for minor issues in 2010 and 2012, and found no evidence of . anything wrong. Officers saw and talked with the sister both times, and . she appeared normal, and conditions in the home were not unusual, he . said. The tiny bedroom - its sole window . painted black, nailed shut with boards and locked tight from the outside . - was 'kept like a dungeon,' he said in the news release distributed . after Gauvin’s arrest. Gauvin, . who police said has no previous criminal record, was arrested twice on one night last month. The first time was on charges that he imprisoned and was . criminally cruel to his sister. The . second time was on threatening and witness tampering charges because he . allegedly warned his daughter, who was waiting for him in the police . station lobby, not to talk to police or he would kick her and her young . daughter out of the house. The . younger woman, 33, told police later she had often questioned her . father’s poor care of the victim, saw continued mistreatment of her and . was 'petrified' by her own father’s threat that he would toss her and . his own six-year-old grandchild out of the home if she cooperated in the . investigation. An officer in a hazmat suit was brought in to explore the room the woman was kept in after responding officers were forced to leave because the smell was so bad . The . daughter and grandchild lived in the home with Gauvin and the . imprisoned sister. Police also said two young men, friends of the . daughter, rented space in the basement because they had no other place . to live. Satkowski said . the state Department of Children and Families had joined police in . reviewing the case. Nancy . Phillips, who lives nearby and had bought a dog several years ago from . Arthur Gauvin, said she walked by the Eleanor Road home about a year ago . and saw a woman standing in the bedroom, looking out the window. Phillips said she thought it might be Gauvin’s sister and asked people . in Gauvin’s yard how 'the girl in the bedroom' was doing. Not . long after that, when Phillips next walked past the house, she said the . bedroom window was painted black and the air conditioning unit in the . window was gone. 'I should . have said something,' Phillips said, sitting in a parked car . outside the Gauvin home before leaving on an errand. 'I always saw him . sitting on the front steps, drinking. Never saw her again.'","Arthur Gauvin was ordered on Wednesday to wear a monitoring device and stay 100 yards from the victim and her family .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Americans who support the death penalty would rather see states bring back the hangman's noose, the electric chair, the gas chamber, the firing squad - or even the guillotine - than stop executions if lethal injection is no longer available. A new NBC News poll found 59percent of Americans support the death penalty for people convicted of murder. The findings reveal that the botched execution of Oklahoma murderer Clayton Lockett on April 29 has not dampened public support for capital punishment. No change: The botched execution of Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett hasn't dampened public enthusiasm for execution . Should the U.S. bring back other execution techniques if lethal injection is not available? If anything, it's made Americans believe more primitive methods of execution are more humane than lethal injection. All 35 states with the death penalty use either a cocktail of drugs or a single drug for executions. Those drugs have become harder to get in recent years as drug makers stop production - either for financial reasons or because they don't want to be associated with executions. NBC News found large support for other means of execution. Some 20percent say they would favor bringing back the gas chamber, 18percent would favor a return of the electric chair, 12 percent the firing squad and eight percent say hanging should be an option. The results of NBC's poll of 800 Americans reveals: . 'The lethal injection is someone’s very gross interpretation of killing someone humanely,' Frisco, Texas-native Kuni Beasley, 58, told NBC. He called for return of the hanging gallows. 'It's very quick. You don't have to worry about drugs and it's very efficient. Better than a firing squad - a firing squad is messy. There is no such thing as killing someone humanely. 'But if hanging is done properly, it's more humane than lethal injection because there are fewer things that can go wrong.' Afterall, Mr Beasley said, 'that's how they killed Saddam Hussein.' Gladys Pringle, an 82-year-old from Port Royal, Pennsylvania, thinks the U.S. should look even farther back in history to find execution methods. 'It would be quick and with a firing squad no one knows whose bullet actually killed the person, so it’s easier on them,' she said. 'The most humane way is the guillotine but I can’t see that coming back.' The NBC poll asked questions of 800 registered voters between May 7 and 10. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46percent.","59percent of Americans support the death penalty .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Busted: Reche Caldwell was arrested after police found him to be in possession of five pounds of MDMA . Former NFL wide receiver Reche Caldwell was arrested Tuesday with five pounds of the drug Molly, police said. The 35-year-old former New England Patriot was pulled over just north of the Busch Gardens Amusement Park in Tampa, Florida, when police busted him with well over $170,000 worth of the party drug also known as MDMA. Molly is made from the amphetamines often found in ecstasy that give users a feeling of extreme euphoria. It is often marketed by dealers as a 'pure' version of the drug often in the news for causing overdoses at raves and music festivals. This arrest only adds to his legal troubles after an undercover sting exposed him earlier this year as one of three people running an illegal gambling ring in the city, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Caldwell was pulled over Tuesday afternoon and police quickly discovered the massive stash estimated by TMZ to be worth just under $180,000. The former receiver derisively called ‘Ricochet’ by San Diego Chargers fans for routinely dropping passes during his four seasons with the team was charged with possession of a controlled substance and booked into Hillsborough County Jail. His bail was set at $2,000, but the former million dollar earner has not been able to pay it, the Times reported. Caldwell was also arrested along with a handful of accomplices in January and charged with illegal bookmaking and other related crimes. They notably also discovered about one gram of MDMA, in the gambling house, according to Bay News 9.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hundreds of killers and thousands of drunk drivers were released back into the U.S. by immigration officials in what critics are calling stark evidence the Obama administration has not focused on serious criminals in its immigration enforcement. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released 36,000 immigrants from custody last year, 116 of whom had convictions for homicide, 43 who carried convictions for negligent manslaughter, 14 for voluntary manslaughter and one who's conviction was classified by the agency as 'homicide-willful kill-public official-gun' As the immigrants were in the process of being deported, ICE could have held them in detention until they could be removed from the country, according to data from the Center for Immigration Studies reported by The Washington Times. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released 36,000 immigrants from custody last year, many of which carried homicide or drunk driving convictions . 'This would be considered the worst . prison break in American history, except it was sanctioned by the . president and perpetrated by our own immigration officials,' Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, told reporters. 'The administration's actions are outrageous. They willfully and knowingly put the interests . of criminal immigrants before the safety and security of the American . people.' At the Center for Immigration studies, policy studies director Jessica Vaughan called the numbers evidence the administration had failed to target dangerous criminals. 'We keep hearing from the administration . that they are focused like a laser on enforcement against the worst of . the worst, convicted criminals, as their top priority. On the other . hand, they are releasing, at a rate of about 100 a day, aliens from . their custody with criminal convictions, and many of them are serious . criminal convictions,' Vaughan said. ICE officials claimed many of the releases were mandated by court order . ICE said many of the released were under electronic monitoring, had posted bond, or were required to check in with officers regularly. There have also been court decisions forcing release, such as a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants could not be held longer than six months if their home countries refused to take them back. Approximately 75 per cent of convicted murderers released in 2013 were 'mandatory releases' according to ICE. 'Others, typically . those with less serious offenses, were released as a discretionary . matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding . the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and . prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to . public safety or national security,' ICE stated. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he and Smith requested ICE release numbers but have so far been denied the information. Critics say the releases are evidence the Obama administration has failed to focus on dangerous criminals . 'These criminals should be locked up, not roaming our streets,' the lawmakers said in a joint statement. In its yearly budget request, ICE asked for funding for more than 30,500 detention beds per day, a drop from the 34,000 numbered in current law. Among the 36,007 ciminal aliens on the agency's roles, there were a combined 15,635 convictions for drunk driving, 9, 187 convictions for 'dangerous drugs,' 2,691 for assault, 1,724 for weapons offenses, and 303 for 'flight escape.' In 2013 ICE also released thousands of immigrants, calling it the result of sequester budget cuts. They later clarified it was actually the regular budgeting process that led to the releases, as they had been holding more than 34,000 detainees for too long to support.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released 36,000 immigrants from custody last year .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A Phoenix man starved his dog to death and sent a graphic image of the emaciated canine to an ex-girlfriend to try to win her back, authorities said Thursday. Luis Moreno, 38, was arrested Wednesday after he turned over his pit bull terrier named Wiggles to animal control as a stray when the ex-girlfriend refused all advances, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said. Moreno and his girlfriend adopted Wiggles in 2008, according to deputies. But by 2012, couple broke up, and Moreno kept Wiggles. In the name of 'love': Luis Moreno, 38, starved to death his dog named Wiggles in an attempt to get back with his ex-girlfriend. Near the end of Wiggles' life, he sent this picture of the emaciated dog to his ex . Abuser: Moreno was arrested Wednesday and is facing both animal cruelty and domestic violence charges . He began calling and texting his ex-girlfriend, trying to reconcile and when his advances didn't work, Moreno resorted to using Wiggles as bait, deputies said. Moreno at one point sent a text message that read: ""Wiggles is dead, I hope your happy b**** [sic],"" authorities said . The ploy worked and his ex called in concern for the dog, but he told her Wiggles was fine. When that bid failed to get him a date, he sent yet another message to his ex saying the dog was sick. She offered to help pay for medical treatment, but Moreno refused her offer - asking her out on a date instead. Unsurprisingly, Moreno's ex turned him down again. As a last-ditch effort, Moreno sent the woman a picture of Wiggles emaciated and lying on the ground. 'It is sick and bizarre what some people do to animals, how they use and abuse them' Sheriff Joe Arpaio said. After giving up on any reconciliation with his ex, Moreno turned Wiggles over to animal control and said the dog was a stray. Wiggles was in such bad shape that the dog had to be euthanized. Moreno is facing domestic violence and animal cruelty charges. It was not known if he had an attorney.","Luis Moreno, 38, and his girlfriend adopted pit bull terrier Wiggles in 2008 .

Bee bearding, whether for endurance or sheer weight of bees, is a worldwide phenomenon, with competitions held every year to see if the previous record can be beaten. The bees are usually attracted onto the body by trapping and attaching the queen bee somewhere. Worker bees then home in on the queen's pheromones and quickly swarm around the person where she is placed.

But according to the Houston Chronicle, a neighbor told prosecutors they say her run and crash the stroller, with no baby in it, into a curb on purpose. Attorney George Parnham believes his client's mental state should be a mitigating factor in sentencing even if she is convicted . She then allegedly called 911 to report the child missing. After speaking to her neighbors, authorities finally confronted Modarresi who took them to the baby's grave. Parnham promised to convince jurors his client was unstable with evidence from psychological evaluations, records of two suicide attempts in her teens, and on psychotic episode on the flight home from her native Iran that forced the plane to perform an emergency landing in Qatar. Her mental health could be a mitigating factor in sentencing. If convicted of capital murder she will automatically be sentenced to life in prison.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Clueless star Stacey Dash has reportedly begun talking with Fox News executives to become a network contributor. Dash, 47, is best known for her portrayal of valley girl Dionne Davenport but she has been making a name for herself in the political realm over the past few years. Her Republican beliefs caused a firestorm for the actress during the 2012 election when she publicly announced her support for Mitt Romney. Scroll down for video . New role: The specifics about Stacey Dash's possible role on Fox remain unclear but she could either be a contributor or she may be given her own show . Coming back: Though Dash's big political debut came in 2012 when she tweeted her support for Mitt Romney, she was brought back into the fold with an appearance on Fox and Friends in early April . Dash has made several visits to Fox News as a guest commentator in the past two years but now she may become a more permanent fixture on the network. ‘I just think that the Democrats and the liberals have taken advantage of show business but California and show business is the purest form of capitalism, and that's a fact,’ she said during an appearance on Fox and Friends in early April. She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs. ‘For the federal government to just throw a big blanket over a big entire country and say ""We're all a bunch of babies and now we're all warm and cozy"" is just a bit ridiculous,’ she said. The New York Post reports that Dash is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series. The basic plotline of the show, which has the tentative title of 'Stacey Dash is Normal', follows Dash's life as a Republican single mother living in Hollywood. Vote Romney: The Clueless star took to Twitter to show how she would be voting come November 6 . Enough! The actress lent her support to Romney's message to women by re-tweeting his posting . O Beautiful: Stacey Dash (left) tweeted her . support for Mitt Romney (right, on the campaign trail), posting this sexy picture with her endorsement . Dash became a conservative darling in 2012 when she started speaking out about politics after post revealing that, unlike many African American voters, she was supporting Romney. ‘I believe that if you stand for something you have to stand for it, you can't hide behind it or it won't get done,’ she told the Fox and Friends crew last month. She said that her career has not been negatively impacted as a result of her Republican beliefs, perhaps because she said that there were more conservatives in Hollywood than many would expect. ‘If you make movies and the movies make money, they're going to make the movie. You know for example, if Obamacare were a movie they would not make a sequel, let's just say that,’ she joked. Trio of trouble: Alicia Silverstone (left), the late Brittany Murphy (center) and Stacey Dash starred in the 1995 high school comedy Clueless . During an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan at the time, she used a line made famous by Martin Luther King Jr, saying that she chose her presidential pick 'not by the color of his skin but the content of his character'. The interview came after she received a barrage of social media attacks for calling a vote for Romney 'the only choice for your future'. While many took issue with Dash, then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan reached out to her to thank her. 'He said thank you so much for your support, and that I was brave and that they support me and I thought that was so generous and kind, lovely,' Ms Dash told CNN's Piers Morgan. She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to now endorsing his opponent is 'because of the state of the country'.

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . The death of Julia Roberts' half-sister in February was a suicide, coroner's officials said today. An . autopsy and toxicology tests determined that Nancy Motes drowned in a . bathtub after taking several drugs that have not yet been publicly . identified. Los Angeles . coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey said the drugs will be listed in a full . autopsy report that could be released as early as next week. Suicide: Julia Roberts' sister Nancy Motes, pictured with the star above, died of a suicide . Harvey said 37-year-old Motes left behind a suicide note and that it will be turned over to her family. Motes was the younger sister of actress Julia Roberts and actor Eric Roberts. A . receptionist for Julia Roberts' publicist, Marcy Engelman, said . Engelman was out of the country and unavailable to comment and that no . one else was available. The coroner's official ruling comes a week-and-a-half after Roberts gave a eulogy at her half-sister's memorial service. Witnesses said the superstar had some 'harsh' and 'bizarre' words for Nancy Motes on May 3, according to the National Enquirer, and shocked mourners as she let loose all the anger she felt toward her sister whose suicide note detailed their strained relationship. The source said: 'Julia said that, as her sister, she just wanted to ""wring"" her neck because she didn't wait to see the joy that comes with the morning.' Nancy Motes' ashes were buried in a local ceremony on Saturday attended by a small group of relatives and friends including mom Betty Lou . The already shocked mourners 'were even more stunned when she said that she actually admired Nancy for what she did' the source revealed. She said her sister 'took control and ended her pain when she had no other tolls to cope with it...She said that she admired that she had the strength to do what she did, to end her pain,' said the source. The revelations is one of many to come out of the memorial for Motes. The previous involved Motes' grieving fiance's insistence that Roberts never should have been there in the first place. And he wasn't even invited to the Smyrna, Georgia gathering. 'Just so you all know ""America's Sweetheart"" is a B----!!' Days before her suicide, Nancy went on a Twitter rant against the three-time Golden Globe winner, whom she claimed fat-shamed her . Grief: John Dilbeck, seen here with late fiancee Nancy Motes, claims he wasn't even invited to her funeral on Saturday . John Dilbeck, the fiance, told RadarOnline that he, along with many of Motes' friends, were not invited to the funeral held in Smyrna, Georgia. 'It really hurts,' he told the website. 'I was very frustrated and hurt by it. I needed to voice being hurt, because Nancy's voice is being silenced.' Motes would not have even wanted Roberts at the ceremony, Dilbeck said. 'No one was really expecting it, but Julia gave a little speech at one point during the ceremony,’ a source told MailOnline of the star's eulogy. Roberts has been hit with harsh criticism since Motes died from a drug overdose in February, but on Saturday, she showed her true feelings by attending the hour and twenty minute service in the blazing Georgia heat. Prayers: Julia walked arm in arm with her mother Betty Lou as they were blessed at a Los Angeles church in April. There was no church service for Nancy, as friends say she was not very religious . With the rest of the mourners already assembled, the Oscar winner pulled up in a white SUV with her mom, her sister Lisa and a driver. Wearing a black dress, a beige cardigan, beige handbag and black over-sized sunglasses, she jumped out of the car and tightly hugged friends and family. After greeting all of the other guests, she made her way down to the shaded burial area, covered with a green tent, helping her elderly mother, 79, who is battling cancer. Brother Eric Roberts was not spotted at the ceremony. The devastated pair then took their position at the front of the congregation. After the ceremony, Julia, 46, was one of the last to leave the New Symrna Cemetery, staying back to casually chat with old friends who she hadn’t seen in years. Julia embraced and comforted a number of other mourners, before getting back into the SUV and heading to a nearby hotel for a low key wake, where she also said a few words. Final trip: Nancy was found dead with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her and left behind a five-page letter describing her difficult relationship with Julia. She was cremated in Los Angeles after her death and her ashes were sent to Smyrna . 'She kept it brief, but it was absolutely heartfelt and very moving': Julia returned to her Smyrna, Georgia hometown on April 11 for the memorial service and gave a 'harsh' and 'bizarre' eulogy .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . John Galliano, the disgraced former head of Dior, has landed himself a new job with Russian perfumery and beauty chain L'Etoile, starting May 22, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant. The cryptic announcement was made on L'Etoile's Russian website yesterday, with a large faux newspaper spread headlined: 'John is Back!' - which originally fueled rumors that the controversial designer was to be their creative director. Not so fast, says his spokeswoman, who revealed that specific details of his upcoming projects will be released in the next few days, but confirmed Mr Galliano has been quietly consulting for the brand for some months, according to WWD. Back? John Galliano (pictured in January) has scored a job at Russian beauty company L'Etoile in what could be his first solid contract since he was fired from Dior after an anti-Semitic tirade in a Paris bar in 2011 . L'Etoile is the largest perfumery chain in Russia, said to be similar to U.S. beauty franchise Sephora, and boasts 750 beauty stores which sell cosmetics and fragrances, Dior among the labels they carry. Mr Galliano, 52, has been making tentative footsteps back into the spotlight since his infamous public meltdown in 2011, in which he was filmed in a series of racist and anti-Semitic outbursts in a Paris cafe. The Gibraltar-born British designer, who was ousted from his position at the helm of Dior and his own self-named label, blamed his shocking behavior on his addiction to alcohol and says he has been 'trying to make amends' ever since. Breaking news: The announcement first broke yesterday on L'Etoile's Russian homepage (pictured), causing many to speculate that he had scored the esteemed position of creative director . Seen recently: Mr Galliano, pictured in New York last month (left) and last year (right) has been keeping a very low profile in the years since his public meltdown . Reflecting on the anti-Semitic rant, Mr Galliano told Vanity Fair last year that he threw up when he saw the video. 'It's . the worst thing I have said in my life, but I didn’t mean it.' he told . the magazine. ‘I have been trying to find out why that anger was . directed at this race. 'I now realize I was so f****** angry and so discontent with myself that I just said the most spiteful thing I could.’ Rock bottom: Mr Galliano at a Paris court house in June 2011, where he was charged with hurling the racist and anti-Semitic slurs - behavior he later blamed on his alcoholism . Comeback: Only a few weeks after he entered rehab, Kate Moss asked Mr Galliano to design her wedding dress (pictured), an honor he later said 'saved' him . After a stint in rehab and two years of keeping his head down, he took on a month-long residency at Oscar de la Renta's studio in January of 2013, a move perceived by many to be his ultimate 'second chance' in the fashion world. Mr Galliano received rave reviews for the collection that he co-designed with Mr de la Renta; many of its highly-praised looks including Galliano signatures that had not been seen on runways since his former heyday. 'I very strongly felt that when people fall, you should try to lift them up,' said Mr de la Renta, 81, of taking Mr Galliano under his wing. 'I think everyone in life deserves a second chance. I'm not sure about a third or fourth.' Rave reviews: Mr Galliano first re-appeared for a 'second chance' with the industry, following a stint in a rehab, when he joined Oscar de la Renta to create his Fall 2013 line (pictured) He was then widely-tipped to take on a more permanent role at the Italian fashion house following the storming success of the show, but it wasn't to be. Last month it was reported by The New York Post that he and Mr de la Renta had failed to reach an agreement, with 'money the biggest factor.' Mr Galliano, who also went on to design costumes for Stephen Fry's stage adaption of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, then made a more public re-appearance in October last year, when he served as guest fashion editor for the December issue of British Vogue. The eccentric designer posed with long-time friend and supporter, supermodel Kate Moss, in a spread for the issue, roughly two years after he designed her stunning wedding dress. Top of his game: Mr Galliano (pictured at his Dior show in 2010) once enjoyed a highly successful career at the helm of the French fashion house, as well as his own self-titled label . Flamboyant: He was well known for his outlandish final runway looks and eccentric nature, but has been keeping a low profile since embracing sobriety and attempting to 'make amends' for his ways . Mr Galliano - who was asked to design the ivory gown mere months after he had been shunned by almost everyone else in the industry. 'Creating Kate’s wedding dress saved me personally because it was my creative rehab. She dared me to be me again,' he said. His next big step with L'Etoile won't mark the first time the legendary designer has worked with perfume brands. During his career at Dior, he was said to be 'instrumental' in the Addict franchise and the adoption of Charlize Theron as the face of J'adore, amongst other accolades.","His exact role is yet to be determined, but it could be the designer's first permanent contract since he was ousted from Dior in 2011 .

Recipients who weren't expecting took to Twitter to voice their hilarious reactions to the 'baby news', with one person writing: 'Shutterfly just sent me a ""congratulations on your new arrival"" email. They know something I don't??' What to expect when you're not expecting: Hundreds of Shutterfly customers were left bemused after receiving e-mails congratulating them on being a 'new parent' - even though many were not expecting . Another person who got the e-mail tweeted: 'Shutterfly sends email congratulating me on new baby. I have no recollection of this event. I hope I didn't leave a baby at the hospital.' And yet another joker wrote: 'Congrats to all of those impregnated by @Shutterfly this morning.' Clearly embarrassed by the error, Shutterfly issued an apology shortly thereafter. 'Earlier this morning, we unintentionally sent an e-mail to some of our customers,' it read. 'We deeply apologize for this intrusion and any offense this may have caused. 'Our intention was to email customers who have recently purchased birth announcements with us, and it was sent to a larger distribution in error.' Luckily it seems most customers found humor in the mistake, with only a few - including one who wrote: 'Guess they're trying to tell me my biological clock is ticking' - expressing their annoyance.

Shady Grove Fertility, which has locations in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., was forced to apologize after sending out a Mother's Day e-mail to a group of patients who were still trying to get pregnant. Unsurprisingly, the women who received the message were none too happy to be reminded that they were not yet mothers. One woman expressed her frustration on Facebook, writing that she was 'very upset' about the error. 'It was bad enough that it was Mother's Day,' she wrote. 'And then I recently had a D&C for a miscarriage on 4-26. Talk about kicking you while you're down.' Reactions: Hundreds of customers were confused and entertained by the accidental e-mail . The clinic sent out an apology explaining that the e-mail was 'intended for patients who have already conceived and graduated from the practice,' and expressing deep regret for any offense caused. 'As you can understand, within this context, the message was very insensitive and hurtful to many,' read the letter. 'We want to personally extend our deepest apologies and assure you that we would never intentionally send a note like this to our patients struggling to conceive.'","Shutterfly has since issued an apology, explaining that the e-mail was intended for shoppers who recently purchased birth announcements .

Jordan Adlard, 26, was drunk at his cousin's barbecue when he jumped 20ft from an oak branch onto the outdoor toy, which catapulted him sideways into a fence. But Mr Adlard, from Helston, Cornwall, continued his everyday life with a sore back for more than a week before doctors discovered a compression fracture in his spine. Scroll down for video .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ukip faces fresh claims of hypocrisy after it emerged its small business spokesman employed seven illegal immigrants in his restaurant. Immigration officials raided the Manchester restaurant, set up by Amjad Bashir with his two sons Tayub and Mudassar, last year. It follows revelations that the anti-EU party had leaflets printed in Germany, hired eastern Europeans to hand out flyers and used an Irish actor in poster campaign opposing immigration. Amjad Bashir, Ukip's small business spokesman, is standing for the party in next week's European elections. HIs restaurant in Manchester was raided by immigration officials last year . Mr Bashir is standing for Ukip in next week’s European elections and he appeared on stage alongside Mr Farage at a rally last week designed to reject claims the party is racist. The Zouk Tea Bar and Grill in Manchester was raided on June 1 last year, The Times reported. The family have denied any wrongdoing and party leader Nigel Farage said they are appealing and he was not going to ‘prejudge’ the case. Three days after the raid Mr Bashir reportedly resigned as a director of the company which owns the restaurant a sister branch in Bradford. However he remains a major shareholder and has continued to take a role in the running of the restaurant. Mr Bashir, 61, is second on Ukip’s list of candidates for the Yorkshire and the Humber region in this month’s European elections. The Home Office confirmed seven people were arrested ‘for a variety of immigration offences’ and a civil penalty notice was served after the raid. Mr Bashir appeared at a Ukip rally with leader Nigel Farage last week in a move designed to prove the party is not racist . Tayub Bashir told The Times that they were appealing against the notice and had not yet paid a fine. He said the restaurant conducted immigration checks on all employees and vigorously denied any wrongdoing. Mr Farage told BBC’s This Week: ‘His son is the director and runs that business and they had an argument and a row with the immigration people which they are appealing. I’m not going to prejudge that.’ However, Lib Dem MEP Edward McMillan-Scott said: ‘Forget the obvious hypocrisy; employing illegal immigrants is exploitative and against the law. ‘Not only are Ukip whipping up ill-feeling towards immigrants, they are supporting a man who has made money off the back of illegal workers.’ It is the latest episode which has left Ukip exposed to criticism for appearing to act against its own anti-immigration policies. Ukip claimed its poster campaign was a 'hard-hitting reflection of reality' - but it later emerged that it had used an Irish actor to represent a British builder put out of work because of immigration . This week it emerged the party has been printing anti-EU election leaflets - in Germany. Mr Farage's party has campaigned to protect British jobs, slash immigration and pull out of the European Union. But . instead of using a British firm to help the party's campaign it took . 'full advantage of the European single market' to place its order . abroad. It follows the revelation the party had hired Eastern Europeans to hand out its anti-immigration . flyers ahead of next week's European elections. Latvians . were employed by a company called Fast Leaflet in Croydon, south . London, to hand out flyers for Mr Farage's party.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Nearly 10 per cent of the criminals kept in open prisoners are murderers, the Government has admitted. The revelation comes amid heightened fears over the security at open prisons after the armed bank robber known as the 'Skull Cracker' walked out of one while on day release. Michael Wheatley went on the run for four days after absconding earlier this month. He was eventually recaptured and charged with robbing a building society at gun point. Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . Wheatley, who earned his Skullcracker nickname for 'pistol whipping' bank staff with imitation guns, was allowed to stay in open prison despite being given 13 life sentences in 2002 for bank raids and having a history of prison escapes. Now it has emerged that Wheatley is far from the only dangerous criminal kept in open prison. In a Parliamentary Written Answer the Coalition said more than 350 murderers and 70 people serving sentences for manslaughter are in open prisons, which have minimal supervision. In December 2013, figures showed that 363 murderers were housed in such institutions, almost 10 per cent of the 4,092 inmates in open prisons across England and Wales. Other prisoners include those convicted of attempted murder, wounding, assault and attacks in children. Wheatley, who was eligible for release after eight years, went on the run for four days earlier this month after leaving Standford Hill open prison on day release and failing to return. He was arrested, together with another man, in Tower Hamlets, east London, after allegedly robbing a branch of the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Kent Police issued this mugshot of 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley, after he went missing while temporarily being allowed out of prison earlier this month . The notorious armed robber had a history of absconding since being jailed in 1984 for nine years following a series of shop raids. In 1988 he escaped while on a hospital visit and went on to commit nine break-ins. In 1989 he was jailed for 16 years for break-ins and robberies, reduced to 11 years on appeal. Three years later, while on a day release to an optician, he went on the run again and went on to commit several armed robberies. And in 1993 he was jailed for a further seven years and in 2002 given the 13 life sentences, with a minimum term of eight years. Last summer he was transferred to open conditions, but was returned to a proper prison in December after concerns were raised about his behaviour. In February his probation officer approved his return to an open prison before he disappeared on May 3. Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, West Yorks, said people would be 'shocked' that murderers were serving sentences in prisons where 'they are basically free to … walk out of the gates'. He said: 'Most people thought that the people who were in open prisons were no real threat to anyone, who would not go up to anyone and do anyone any physical harm. 'The prison authorities try and create the impression that these cases are one-offs when you need a one-off inquiry, but this is not a one-off situation, it is general practice. I don’t believe that all of those 363 murderers are safe, fully rehabilitated, no danger to the public.' Jeremy Wright, the prisons minister, said all inmates housed in such conditions were 'suitably risk-assessed' before they were released into the community under 'appropriate licence conditions'. Harry Fletcher, an adviser to the probation union Napo, insisted that 'open jails are needed to help rehabilitation'. He said: 'However, prisoners should only be allocated following a full risk assessment. In this case staff seem to have been worried about further offending and absconding. 'There is a history of running away while on day release. The issue is a failure of government to provide enough secure places and pressure on staff to move prisoners through the system.'","More than 400 killers are in open prisons - including 363 murderers .

The distraught wife of a sergeant major broke down as he was convicted of sexually assaulting a lesbian soldier, screaming: ‘You promised me you didn’t do it.’ Warrant officer Timothy Jones, 40, was yesterday found guilty of attacking the 21-year-old after a debauched party on Army barracks.

He assaulted the lesbian soldier after a 12-hour drinking session at Buckley Barracks in Hullavington, Wiltshire, in May last year. Fuelled by vodka, port, whiskey, Jägermeister and beer, soldiers from 9 Theatre Logistic Regiment partied at a barbeque before seven continued drinking shots in the bedroom of the female private’s girlfriend. There, they danced, undressed and Jones swung his top over his head and ‘snogged’ a young male soldier who was known to have suffered from psychological problems. The female victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also kissed her lover, a corporal with the regiment. After telling the other males to leave the room, Jones locked the door and texted a friend: ‘I’m lying between two lesbians, what should I do LOL?’ The female private later woke up to find he had undressed her from the waist down and was sexually assaulting her. She was in pain and froze for five minutes before waking her girlfriend and breaking down in tears, telling her what Jones had done.

Jones told officers during an initial military police interview that the girl’s arm or leg might have touched him during the night. Four months later, he changed his story, claiming she got on top of him while he slept. He insisted he was ‘shocked’ and ‘sickened’ by the allegation and initially accused her of honey- trapping him. At court, he said he was just ‘clumsy’ and an ‘old fool’ but that he was not a ‘middle-aged pervert’. After five hours of deliberation yesterday, a panel of five male soldiers found Jones guilty of one charge of assault by penetration. As the verdict was announced, he shook violently and wept. He sat down and cradled his head in his hands while shouting: ‘I didn’t do it!’ Jones earlier told the court that being reported for sexual assault had ‘destroyed’ his family, adding: ‘My wife has gone through hell.’ Mrs Jones, who has attended much of the trial, has supported her husband since he was reported and cried throughout his evidence on Wednesday, at one point fleeing the court room in tears. The couple, who have been married for seven years, have a daughter who turned four last week. Jones also has a teenage son from a previous relationship. Jones joined the Army when he was 16, inspired by his grandfather who served in the military. During the early years he was a driver, before being posted around the world, where he mentored young soldiers. In April 2012, Jones was made sergeant major, in what he described as the ‘happiest day of my life’. Yesterday, he signed the sex offenders’ register but was not remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on June 12.","Warrant officer Timothy Jones, 40, found guilty of attacking 21-year-old .

"By . Dan Bloom . A driver fleeing police managed to escape despite flipping his Ford Focus upside down onto a roof. The man was being pursued after failing to stop for a routine check in Benfleet, Essex, when his black Ford Focus flipped over a grass verge, crashed through a tree and landed on a bungalow. When the car slid to the ground, the driver clambered out and vanished - despite police . searching with dogs and a helicopter and saying he may have been badly injured. Flipped: The force of the impact destroyed the car's tyres and left it on its roof after sliding down off the roof of the bungalow (pictured behind) - but despite being chased by a helicopter, the man evaded capture . Police had chased the man after he failed to stop at around 7pm on Wednesday. Paramedics were also called and firefighters had to make the bungalow safe after large parts of the roof were splintered away. Police said they have since visited the driver's home but have still not apprehended him. Grace Ayres, 83, who lives near the bungalow, said: 'It sounded like a bomb going off. 'Everyone in the street came out to look. A policeman knocked on my door and asked if they could search my garden.' Bernard Connor, 72, added: 'The car must have been flying. How he got out I do not know. It’s a good job there were no pedestrians around at the time though.' Evading capture: The driver, possibly injured, escaped through his door before police could detain him . The bungalow was empty at the time of the crash, because the previous occupant had moved into a care home four months earlier. Another neighbour, photographer Jo Tennant, said: 'It’s pretty shocking that this happened on this road which is usually really quiet.' A neighbour opposite the bungalow, who asked not to be named, added: 'I just heard it, I didn’t see the car, just heard a great whack. 'Two police cars then went down the road past it, they obviously didn’t know what happened, then they went back and he had gone.' An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police are looking to identify the whereabouts of the driver of the car which failed to stop for the police and then he lost control of it and crashed. Chase: Police used a helicopter and sniffer dogs, but a day and a half later the man had still not been found . 'Officers tried to stop the driver of a black Ford Focus which had been driving along London Road shortly before 7pm on Wednesday evening. 'He failed to stop and lost control of the car, flipping it over within minutes. 'The male driver, the only occupant, ran away from the scene. Police searched with the police helicopter scouring the area for the driver who may have been seriously injured.

"By . Sally Lee . Australian scientists have made a break through discovery where they can control the growth of seafood and cancer cells - which may ultimately lead to a cure. This finding was based on the knowledge that an Ecuadorian dwarf community is immune to both cancer and diabetes. Researcher was undertaken since it was identified that their cells lack a receptor necessary for a growth hormone to enter. A group of Ecuadorians with Laron syndrome are completely free of diabetes and cancer. The research helped the recent discovery of ways to control cell growth by Australian scientists . Professor Mike Waters has been working towards this for 20 years, when he started with the biotechnology company Genentech to clone the receptor. 'People without the receptor don't die from cancer or diabetes,' said the professor who's now the research leader at University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience. Since then Mr Waters has been trying to understand how it works and more importantly, how to switch it on and off. The finding could create a hormone-free method of farming larger seafood such as lobsters . The professor and his team explained the process in an article in the journal Science published on Friday. 'We have discovered how growth hormone works at the molecular level,' he said. Research leader Professor Mike Waters of the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience . 'This means we can control the processes of growth. We can stop them. We can start them.' So far it's taken 45 years but the research could lead to a drug that stunts the spread of many forms of cancer. A by-product of the work is a potential hormone-free improvement to fish farming: 'We can put the active receptor into fish or lobster or prawns.' If the receptor is left in the 'on' position, the seafood will grow bigger faster. This is experimental work and has not yet been used commercially or on land animals. In medicine, it could be possible to emulate the cancer immunity of the dwarves, known as Laron dwarfs. This could be done by developing a drug to switch the growth receptor off or remove it completely. So in simple terms - stop the cancer growing and spreading, or kill it. This could also lead to a new class of fine-tuned treatments with limited side effects, according to study co-leader Dr Andrew Brooks said. The discovery could have implications for other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, blood disorders, osteoporosis and obesity. Controlling cell growth could lead to a drug that can cure cancer .","A team of Australian researchers from University of Queensland recently found a way to control cell growth .

"This is the terrifying moment a crazed knifeman followed a disabled pensioner through a deserted car park before stabbing him repeatedly with a kitchen knife. James Atkinson, 40, was jailed for 14 years today after he plunged the blade into terrified Geoffrey Franklin eight times, Plymouth Crown Court heard. CCTV footage shows how 64-year-old Mr Franklin's was slashed repeatedly in the abdomen before his attacker left him for dead. Atkinson was 'hearing voices' and acting like a 'zombie', the court heard. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: James Atkinson, 40, followed frail  Geoffrey Franklin before stabbing him eight times . Callous: The attacker slowly walked away from his victim, who lay in a pool of his own blood . Jailed: Atkinson, left, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison today for the stabbing of Mr Franklin,  right, but was told he would be held beyond that if he is still a threat to the public . Mr Franklin only survived the random attack in the Devon city after passers-by saw him slumped on the floor and called for help. Atkinson was told today he would never be released from prison while he posed a risk to the public. Telling the court what had happened to him Mr Franklin said: 'It all happened so quickly. I was just walking along the street minding my own business - the wrong place at the wrong time. 'He didn't say a word he just stabbed me in the side. As I turned to challenge him he stabbed me again in the abdomen. 'I just hope he is kept under proper supervision so that he does not do this to anyone else. The next person will be dead.' The court heard Mr Franklin was walking to a friend's house on July 23, 2011 when Atkinson walked up from behind him at a street corner. CCTV footage showed to the court captured the drug addict following Mr Franklin before stopping a few steps behind him to produce a knife. Mr Franklin, who walks with a stick and has a false eye, was seen battling in vain to fight Atkinson off before being stabbed eight times in the abdomen. The footage ended with Atkinson calmly walking away as his stunned victim clutched his stomach in disbelief before collapsing. Chain of events: CCTV shows Atkinson silently following his victim in a dark Plymouth car park . Lucky to be alive: The 40-year-old followed closely before he jumped in front of the disabled man and stabbed him repeatedly . Tenacious: Mr Franklin tried to fight back against the younger man despite his severe injuries . Hurt: Atkinson then walked away while his victim collapsed to the ground and nearly died . Prosecutor Alistair Verheijen told the court that Mr Franklin suffered a 15cm-long gash which exposed his bowel as well as multiple wounds to his chest and back. He added: 'One passerby comments that his guts were hanging out.' Survival: Mr Franklin spent two weeks in hospital and admitted today: 'I'm lucky to be alive . Mr Franklin had part of his small intestine removed by surgeons but was able to leave hospital two weeks later. Atkinson, of Plymouth, denied wounding Mr Franklin with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury after a trial in October 2012. His sentence was delayed 18 months while experts assessed his mental health. Robert Linford, defending, said Atkinson suffered from a personality disorder and was so heavily intoxicated on the night of the knifing he was hearing voices and acting like a 'zombie'. He told the court: 'To a greater or lesser extent, all three psychiatrists link this man's offence to his mental disorder.' Judge Paul Darlow handed Atkinson a 14-year prison sentence but said he would only be allowed out when he is deemed not to be a serious threat to the public. He told the thug he was lucky not to have killed Mr Franklin, adding: 'The attack resulted in his near evisceration. He required life-saving surgery. 'He was a complete stranger to you and you had no reason to attack him.' Mr Franklin, a former Debenhams worker, lost his eye in 1976 and suffers from a long-term illness that effects his balance. He added after the sentencing: 'I am lucky to be alive. I am just glad that two passersby called an ambulance. 'There was an ambulance nearby. Another ten minutes and I would have been dead. It could have happened to anybody. I just happened to be walking down the road. 'Some of my wounds still give me trouble. I am a bit more cautious, but I still go out. It has been horrendous waiting for this case to come to an end. I am so grateful that it has.'","James Atkinson jailed for 14 years for car park attack on Geoffrey Franklin .

"By . Jill Reilly . The Japanese Prime Minster has vowed to lift a ban on Japanese military fighting overseas in a move that will raise tension with China. Signalling a potential landmark change in a security policy long constrained by a pacifist, post-war constitution Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged that Japan would stick to a peaceful path and not again become a 'country that wages war'. 'Japan has walked the path of a peaceful country for nearly 70 years since the end of World War Two. That path will not change. Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe  has vowed to lift a ban on Japanese military fighting overseas in a move that will raise tension with China . 'But we cannot protect our peaceful lives simply by repeating that we are a peaceful country. Our peaceful lives may suddenly confront a crisis. Can anyone say that won't happen?' Abe said at a nationally televised news conference. 'I think that we, the government, must confront this reality head on,' he said, explaining why the review was needed. Pointing to growing tensions due to China's increasing assertiveness and North Korea's nuclear threat, Abe called for a review of a decades-old interpretation of the constitution that has banned Japan from exercising its right of collective self-defence, that is deploying its military to aid friendly countries under attack. A lifting of the ban would be welcome to Japan's ally the United States, but the proposal drew criticism from China, whose ties with Tokyo have been strained by a territorial row and the legacy of Japan's past aggression. Protesters hold placards during a protest against the Japanese government's plans to lift a ban on using self-defence . The protestors urged the Prime Minister to protect war-renouncing Article 9. The placards read 'No need right of collective self-defense' Protesters hold placardThe placard, second right, reads: 'No need for collective self-defense' 'We've noted that Prime Minister Abe has taken a series of unprecedented actions in the areas of military and security, which leads us to believe that Japan, as far as history is concerned, has started on a negative path,' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry. Southeast Asian countries embroiled in territorial rows with Beijing in the South China Sea could take a different view. 'The Japanese military can somewhat bring 'balance' to the region that is now under a 'threat' from a rising and increasingly aggressive Chinese,' said Benedict Exconde of the Yuchengco Center of the De La Salle University in Manila. 'Countries in Asia, especially those whose citizens suffered from the horrors brought about by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War Two such as South Korea and the Philippines, should not worry about this move by Japan because the country has long veered away from its imperialist past and is drifting more toward being an active regional power that maintains close partnerships with its friends,' he added. Critics say the proposed changes would gut Article 9 and are a stealth attack on the constitution that would skirt formal amendment procedures that would be tougher politically . Abe also said Japan should strengthen its ability to respond to so-called 'grey zone' incidents - low intensity conflicts that fall short of a full-scale attack. Concerns about such clashes have increased due to the tense feud between China and Japan over tiny disputed islands in the East China Sea. But Abe said the government would not adopt a recommendation by his private advisers that Japan also lift its ban on taking part in U.N.-led collective security operations, in which nations join together to propel an aggressor against one state. In their report issued earlier, Abe's advisers urged sweeping changes in a security policy long based on the principle that Japan has the right to defend itself with the minimum force necessary, but that combat abroad exceeds the limit imposed by the constitution's pacifist Article 9. Critics say the proposed changes would gut Article 9 and are a stealth attack on the constitution that would skirt formal amendment procedures that would be tougher politically. Protestors against the proposed change lined the street near Abe's office, shouting 'Don't destroy the constitution.' The constitution has never been formally revised since its adoption in 1947, although successive governments have stretched its limits, which if taken literally ban the maintenance of any armed forces at all. The Japanese surrender at Tokyo Bay, 2 September 1945. Admiral Bruce Fraser signs the surrender for Great Britain . Abe, who took office for a rare second term in 2012, has made clear his desire to loosen the limits of the U.S.-drafted charter long considered overly restrictive by conservatives. The Daily Mail edition on Monday, September 3, 1945 . Abe's handpicked advisers said Japan's increasingly tough security environment meant the nation could not defend itself fully under the current interpretation of the constitution. 'We have reached a situation in which we cannot sufficiently maintain our country's peace and security or realise peace and prosperity of the region and international society under the current interpretation of the constitution,' report said. Abe said if the review concluded a new interpretation of the constitution was needed, he would like to embody the change in a cabinet resolution followed by revisions to relevant laws. But doubts remain about how far and how quickly Abe can proceed. His Liberal Democratic Party's junior partner, the New Komeito, is wary, some in the LDP are also cautious, voters are divided and the LDP's deputy leader is worried about the impact on local polls this year and next. Critics say even small changes would open the door to more drastic moves later. 'Considering the nature of collective self-defence, to say it would be 'limited' is impossible,' said Kyouji Yanagisawa, a former defence official who worked for Abe during his first 2006-2007 term as premier. The advisers cited examples of actions Japan should be able to take. Among them were protecting a U.S. warship under attack in waters near Japan; mine-sweeping in sea-lanes in a conflict zone; and intercepting a ballistic missile headed for America. They also recommended legal changes to allow action in other cases where the military has been constrained by legal concerns, such as rescuing Japanese overseas and using weapons in U.N. peace-keeping operations.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Singer Morrissey, who claims he has been asked to appear on an episode of the Archers . Morrissey has revealed he has been approached to appear on The Archers. The former Smiths frontman is a vegetarian and vocal opponent of the livestock industry and has been known to ban meat products from venues at which he performs. Morrissey, 55 next week, is ‘fascinated’ by the offer, according to the website he uses to air his views. The singer, pictured, is understood to have been approached about a potential idea for a storyline for the rural soap, which has had a number of celebrity cameos over the years. The most recent visitor was cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins who made an appearance to coincide with Sport Relief in March. The Duchess of Cornwall was on air three years ago and Princess Margaret featured in the show 30 years ago. The BBC declined to comment, though it usually remains silent on plot developments in the Archers. Morrissey’s website explained to fans unfamiliar with the show: ‘The Archers is the most popular show on Radio 4 and is considered a British institution.’ But a BBC radio publicist got into the spirit by posting a message on Twitter which echoed the lyrics of Smiths hit Ask, which said: 'We don’t comment on future plots so please don’t ask us ask us ask us.' The singer, whose Smiths albums have included Meat Is Murder, issued a new single this week called World Peace Is None Of Your Business ahead of his first new album for five years being released. The former Smiths frontman, is said to be fascinated by the offer according to his website . He won acclaim last year for his memoir Autobiography and has told how he is going on to write a novel. Just days ago he was mobbed by fans as he appeared at a gig in California and had to leave the stage. Last year the long-time Archers editor Vanessa Whitburn stepped down from the show and has been replaced by Sean O’Connor, who had previously worked on EastEnders and Hollyoaks as well as spending time as a theatre director and film producer.","Former Smiths frontman says he has been asked to appear on The Archers .

"By . Amanda Williams . The deaths of two people who drowned in a luxury hotel swimming pool could have been avoided if a lifeguard was on duty, a grieving family have claimed. Married Komba Kpakiwa, 31, and his secret lover Josephine Foday, 22, were discovered floating in a swimming pool at Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield Heath on the Essex and Hertfordshire border. Chelmsford Coroners' Court earlier heard that the pair, who could not swim, had . been guests at the hotel and had been spotted in difficulties by a guest . who mistakenly thought they were 'joshing about' and were part of a Murder Mystery weekened. Today a jury at Chelmsford Coroners' Court concluded the pair had drowned as a result of an accident. Josephine Newahun Foday, left, and Komba Kpakiwa, right, were found . drowned at the Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield, Essex . Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray confirmed she would send a report to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and Institution of Occupational Safety and Health to warn of the dangers of 'hopper' pools which slope in from all sides towards the middle of the deep end. Outside of the court, grieving sister Angela Kpakiwa, who is in her 40s from Bedfordshire, slammed a lack of a lifeguard covering the hotel poolat the time of the tragedy. She said: 'I am personally against a hotel like that without a lifeguard. 'We feel their deaths could have been avoided if there had been a lifeguard or if they had acted on the concerns raised a year earlier.' Ms Kpakiwa was joined at the inquest by her two brothers, Tamba and Sahr, who confirmed the family are pursuing an apology from the hotel and are considering legal action. Co-op worker Mr Kpakiwa had treated student nurse, Miss Foday, to a weekend at the luxury hotel to celebrate her 22nd birthday. The 10-metre swimming pool at the four-star Down Hall Country House Hotel where Komba Kpakiwa and Josephine Foday were found dead . A picture posted on Twitter by a hotel guest showed the swimming pool area cordoned off by police . One hotel guest discovered the pair floating in the water - but thought they might be playing a 'practical joke' as he had read online that the hotel hosted Murder Mystery weekends. He told the receptionist: 'Either someone is playing a big practical joke or a terrible accident has happened.' Hotel staff dragged their lifeless bodies from the water around 8.10pm on Saturday, April 27 last year, but despite CPR from paramedics they were sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The three-day inquest heard how a former guest had warned hotel bosses about the dangers of the 'hopper pool' - which slopes in from all sides towards the middle of the deep end - after 'almost drowning' there a year before the tragic deaths. Leonard Tabner, 67, a landscape painter from North Yorkshire, gave hotel bosses the tragically prophetic warning: 'If something is not done, I can see someone drowning in that swimming pool.' Hotel deputy general manager at the time, Craig Vines, told the inquest he was never passed the complaint. Josephine Newahun Foday and her grandmother Theresa Farma. They fled Sierra Leone in 2001 . Mr Vines said that the hotel had been full with around 200 guests, including a 75 person wedding party and three private functions, on theday of the tragedy. The inquest was told the pool had been installed in 1987 and had been used by tens of thousands of people over more than two decades without serious incident. Swimming pool design expert, Andrew Ebben, told the inquest that the pool had an 'unusual profile' before raising concerns over the steep gradient leading into the deep end. Jurors visited the scene of the deaths on Wednesday morning to inspect the pool and a CCTV camera that covered the water area. Post mortems on both Mr Kpakiwa and Miss Foday revealed both victims' deaths were 'consistent with drowning'. Forensic pathologist, Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, who carried out the post mortem, noted a 'heavy vomit contamination' and evidence given to him suggested neither victim could swim - all supporting the drowning conclusion. Toxicology results showed neither victim had drugs or alcohol in their system at the time of the tragic accident. The jury was told a police investigation had ruled out any suspicious circumstances and water tests disproved any suggestion chemical levels in the water could have affected the pair. Health and safety signs had been placed around the pool warning of its maximum depth of 2.1 metres, but vital CCTV footage of the pool had not been working at the time of the incident. An engineer had been called to fix problems with the CCTV on the morning on the incident - but no temporary measures, such as a lifeguard, were put in place while it was offline. Widow Gurpeet Kpakiwa sat in dignified silence as she heard three days of harrowing evidence about the death of her husband, although no family were present for Miss Foday. Mrs Kpawika declined to comment after the inquest. Uttlesford District Council, which is the health and safety enforcing authority for the hotel, has undertaken a full investigation into the accident and is currently considering legal action. A spokesperson for Down Hall Country House hotel tonight said: 'We wish to express our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Komba Kpakiwa and Josephine Foday for their loss. 'The hotel acknowledges that the jury sitting at Chelmsford Coroners Court has returned a conclusion of accidental death.'","Komba Kpakiwa, 31, and Josephine Foday, 22, discovered floating in pool .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Harry Hankinson, 62, a shoplifter dubbed Britain's most prolific thief is back in jail after committing his 521st crime . Britain’s 'most prolific shoplifter' has been sentenced to 16 months in jail and given an Asbo banning him from his local high street today after committing his 521st crime. Between February and March this year, Harry Hankinson stole almost £600 worth of meat and alcohol from two supermarkets, and a handbag, two purses, a designer watch, clothing and perfume worth . almost £3,000 from Selfridges, Marks and Spencer and House of Fraser in Manchester . The thefts meant he breached a four-month suspended prison sentence he was given last June for stealing £900 worth of goods. As Hankinson, 65, was led away, Judge Peter Davies said he had 'never experienced in all my life sitting at the bar and bench' a defendant who had kept 'coming back for more' on so many occasions. Hankinson began his life of stealing in 1970 after falling out of a window and claiming a bump on the head made him a kleptomaniac, changing his personality and making him addicted to theft. During the next 44 years of offending he preyed on numerous high street shops - even taking his unsuspecting wife on a shoplifting expedition during a sightseeing coach trip. The latest spree means he now has a total of 235 convictions for 521 offences, 432 of them for theft. If caught in any retail outlet outside Bolton he must leave if asked to do so. The order will run for two years after his release. He must also pay a £120 victim surcharge. Hankinson was jailed for 16 months and given an Asbo banning him from his local high street after admitting stealing handbags, clothes and a designer watch worth a total of £3,000 from stores including Selfridges . After being told of Hankinson’s catalogue of convictions Judge Peter Davies said: 'He is an indiscriminate thief and he shouldn’t be let near the shops. 'It has affected the community of traders and everybody agrees he shouldn’t go around thieving. He is a risk to retailers - I have never seen anything like it. 'This is a truly exceptional case, he has had every spindle opportunity not to commit these offences. Now he is stealing high value items.' He told Hankinson 'It’s theft, it’s dishonesty and you are indiscriminate, targeting retail premises whether well known, international stores or ordinary traders. Hankinson claims suffers from kleptomania which compels him to steal, but psychiatric evaluations have found no evidence to back this up . 'Some of the victims of your thefts are institutions that can cover the loss but that doesn’t take away the fact that you are a pest, you keep coming back for more. 'Everything that has been done for you has failed, you keep coming back for more. I think there is no other way of protecting these traders, . 'One look at your antecedents means that it is totally hopeless. You say this is impulsive that you can’t help yourself. 'You must go to custody and you have to stay in custody for a long time. This is exceptional. This is your occupation, you target shops, a watch for £1,900, purses, they are high value items. 'I take into account your guilty pleas but I also take into account there is no psychiatric diagnosis that diminishes your responsibility.' In 1996 Hankinson's offending became so prolific his long-suffering wife Linda, then 46, spoke out to condemn an 18 week stretch he received for stealing cigarettes, spirits and groceries as being too short. She said: 'He should have got at least 18 months. The only way he will stop is by being in prison. If he’s in there long enough he might stop and think and get some proper help while he’s locked up. 'When he’s out after short stretches its just too easy for him to go and do it again. I can’t tell you much about him because I don’t really know him, he’s been in and out of [prison] so much. The person who’s suffering out of all this is me.' In 2008 Mrs Hankinson was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to Ripon, North Yorks, for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch. On a previous occasion Hankinson asked Body Shop staff to point out some perfume for him, then walked off with the £42 gift set they recommended . Today the court heard how in February this year Hankinson stole meat from Sainsbury’s worth £110, alcohol from Aldi worth £91, clothes worth £172.96 from Marks and Spencer and a designer watch worth £1,900 from Selfridges in Manchester. He also stole a handbag and two purses from the store totalling £570. Hankinson, of Halliwell, Bolton, admitted seven charges . of theft when he appeared before Bolton magistrates in April, as well as admitting stealing alcohol from Tesco worth £389 on 5th March this year. He was bailed, but went out and stole £335 worth of perfume from House of Fraser in Manchester the following day. Prosecuting David Toal said: 'In summary on the front page alone of his antecedent record there are offences involving theft and dishonesty between 1995 and 2014, they are almost exclusively for shop lifting.' In Hankinson's defence, Bob Elias said he should be made subject of a day-time curfew between the hours of 9pm and 6pm during shop opening times. Mr Elias added: 'He seemed to think that would stop him going to shops. He has a compulsion, he doesn’t drink alcohol . 'He tells me he has no reason to leave the house as food is brought to him.. He returned to Selfridges - it suggests a compulsion in the theft not the profit.'","Harry Hankinson, 62, is a shoplifter dubbed 'Britain's most prolific thief'

After more than five years, it didn't seem real. 'I have nightmares, wondering what Claudia might have gone through. Had she been calling for me? I just don’t know.... All you can do is live hour by hour, day by day and keep on hoping.' But when she saw Mr Snelling's face on the news, she said he did not 'look like someone capable of doing anything.' 'I want justice but I don't want anyone's life to be wrecked,' she said. 'This man may be totally innocent.'

"By . Tara Brady . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has inspected aircraft from the Korean People's Army in the latest in a series of visits to air force units in recent weeks. Kim inspected the Korean People's Army's Air and Anti-Air Force Unit 447 - believed to be located in the central province of South Pyongan. The young leader took a tour of the unit's flight training room and watched airmen under training, according to the Korean Central News Agency. Scroll down for video . Air Force Un! Kim inspected the Korean People's Army's Air and Anti-Air Force Unit 447 . Kim said after the tour that 'airmen should make it part of their life and habit to undergo training with the help of modern piloting training equipment while flying aircraft a lot.' 'It is necessary to intensify training in order to shed less blood in battle,' Kim also said, calling for the intensification of training on combat flight mission performance under the worst conditions. The leader's latest visit to the air force may be aimed at stressing the country's war readiness amid ongoing tension with South Korea. Among those who accompanied the young leader to the air force unit are Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the General Political Bureau of the military as well as Ryom Chol-song, a vice propaganda director of the same bureau.

A photo, published in the official North Korean daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun, showed for the first time the luxury Russian IL-62 jetliner that carries Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju on official engagements around the secretive country. At first glance, the aircraft bears some similarity to the U.S. President's personal jet. It has North Korea's official name and flag as well as a star symbolising Kim on its tail, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported quoting the North's paper.

The South Korean newspaper observed that Kim appears keen to show that he does not suffer the same pathological fear of flying as his father, Kim Jong-il, who travelled as far as he could get on a special armoured train. He has even tried his hand at the controls, it was claimed, although he is not known to have an qualifications as a pilot.","Kim inspected the Korean People's Army's Air and Anti-Air Force Unit 447 .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Manchester United run the risk of alienating the Class of ’92 for good with their ongoing prevarications over the make-up of Louis van Gaal’s backroom staff. United have delayed the confirmation of Van Gaal’s appointment until next week while they continue to talk to Ryan Giggs about his role in the new set-up. The Welshman is still considering his response to Wednesday’s chats with Van Gaal in Amsterdam. Giggs is known to have reservations about how United have handled the whole affair since David Moyes was sacked last month. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal name Holland's World Cup squad . On hold: Incoming boss Louis van Gaal's appointment has been delayed . Uncertain futures: Ryan Giggs and Phil Neville . His former team-mates Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are said to be increasingly unhappy about being kept in the dark, too. The three United legends — who worked with Giggs during his spell as interim manager — thought they would receive phone calls from the club on Thursday but the trio were still waiting. An Old Trafford source said: ‘They just want to know one way or the other. If it’s bad news and they aren’t being kept on, then the least that should happen is they should be told. ‘To keep them hanging on, after the way they have served the club, is unfair.’ Talking tactics: Van gaal is preparing his Holland squad for Saturday's friendly with Ecuador . In limbo: Giggs and Scholes were at Old Trafford to watch the Under 21s on Wednesday . Waiting game: Paul Scholes, Neville, and Giggs have still not discovered their fate . Neville was told after last Sunday’s game at Southampton his future — and that of his colleagues — would become clear this week. United chief executive Ed Woodward had hoped to confirm Van Gaal as new manager on Thursday but it is understood Giggs, who wants to stay, is still considering the offer of a senior role. With Van Gaal in charge of the Dutch national team for their friendly against Ecuador in  Amsterdam on Saturday, it is not expected that anything will now be finalised until after the weekend — even though United sources have stressed there is ‘no significant problem’ with the process. Meanwhile, Southampton’s England defender Luke Shaw has been telling friends this week that he is ‘definitely’ moving to Old Trafford, despite the fact that a fee has not been agreed between the clubs. Old Trafford bound? Southampton defender Luke Shaw has been tipped with a move to United . Woodward outlined the exact scale of the financial impact Moyes’ difficult eight-month reign had on the deposed Premier League champions. United finished seventh in the Premier League, meaning they will play no European football next season. In a conference call with investors on the day United’s latest quarterly accounts were released, Woodward revealed the cost of the failure as £30million. ‘Due to the television deals, we estimate our loss of European football will cost us in the mid-£30m region,’ said Woodward. Fronting up: Ed Woodward says missing out on European football will cost United £30million . ‘The club’s expectations are to absolutely get back into the Champions League and you will see that in the transfer market. ‘In the 2013-14 season we finished in a very disappointing seventh which means we will not play European football next season. ‘Be assured everyone at the club is working to ensure that next season is to the top standards of Manchester United. ‘We made a managerial change in April and are grateful to Ryan Giggs for holding the reins during the period and the exemplary manner he conducted the role,’ added Woodward. ‘We are now focused on bringing in a new manager and expect an announcement in due course.’ In terms of Van Gaal’s appointment, United are also aware of the need to be respectful towards the Dutch FA, whose plans for the World Cup in Brazil have been rather overshadowed by the saga. Partly because of this, United are not expected to announce anything on Friday, with Holland’s game against Ecuador so close. United announced January-March revenues of £115.5m — up 26 per cent. The three-quarter results also saw the club’s debt down 4.3per cent to £351.7m. United continue to blossom financially, with sponsorship and broadcasting income both making big leaps in the results.","Giggs is considering his options after talks with Dutchman on Wednesday .

"By . Phil Medlicott, Press Association . Former England and Manchester United striker Michael Owen is confident Luke Shaw is ready for the challenge of being a Red Devils player. United are trying to sign 18-year-old Southampton defender Shaw, who has been included in England boss Roy Hodgson's squad for this summer's World Cup. The left-back already has over 50 Barclays Premier League starts and a senior international cap to his name. Making a move? Southampton full-back Luke Shaw (right) has attracted the attention of the Premier League's top clubs including Manchester United . And when asked about the prospect of Shaw joining United, Owen, who made such a memorable impact at the 1998 World Cup as an 18-year-old, said: 'I think it's always good to keep progressing up the ladder and to play at the highest standard. 'And once you have had the experience that Luke Shaw has had in the Premier League, I think you are certainly ready for that challenge now. 'Having had the first-team experience he has, and now going to a World Cup, I'd say he is more than ready to join a really big club - if Southampton let him go.' Should the move to United go through this summer, Shaw will be joining at an interesting time for the club. Incoming: Current Holland boss Louis van Gaal, seen here in training with the Dutch national team, is expected to take over at Manchester United after the World Cuip . Which way to go: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino could also depart Southampton with Tottenham interested in the Argentine's services . The Red Devils are set to undergo considerable change as they look to bounce back from a disappointing 2013/14 season following the retirement of boss Sir Alex Ferguson, with a permanent replacement - Louis van Gaal, it seems - for Ferguson's successor David Moyes coming in and the squad being overhauled. Owen feels the Shaw transfer would be a good one for all parties concerned. 'United have obviously had a poor campaign by their standards and we talk about rebuilding, but it has only been one season - there is still an awful lot of quality there,' the 34-year-old said. 'They are a huge club with a huge stadium, and I presume they are going to get a huge manager as well. 'I wouldn't have thought they will be coming seventh again next season, put it that way - I think they will be right back in the mix. 'But they . are going to have to buy quality players like Luke Shaw, and . particularly in defence, because they have lost Nemanja Vidic and Rio . Ferdinand, and there is talk about Patrice Evra as well. 'They are going to be hard to replace, but someone like Luke Shaw would go a long way towards that. 'So the only losers would be Southampton - but then again, I'm pretty sure there will be a huge fee involved!' Takes one to know one: Former United Manchester United striker Michael Owen believes Luke Shaw could become a star at the Red Devils . The future: Luke Shaw made his England debut against Denmark earlier this year, and Owen tips the Three Lions' youngsters to shine at the World Cup . Star in the making: A teenage Owen took the World Cup by storm for England at France '98 . Shaw is part of a 23-man England World Cup squad that has plenty more youth in it, with the likes of Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling also included. While approving of Hodgson's selection and pleased it features several younger players, Owen has also been keen to stress he believes those chosen have been on merit, regardless of their age. And he is feeling positive about what the group can achieve at the tournament in Brazil. He said: 'I think a lot of the players we will be pinning our hopes on are youngsters - and that is maybe just a coincidence. 'They have all come off a great season for their clubs, are full of confidence, and I'm hoping one or two of them will star in this tournament. 'I think England are going to surprise a few - I think we could do well.'","Red Devils preparing £27million swoop for Southampton full-back .

'It's . not excluded that Seedorf continues as coach, if we can find an . agreement on what type of relationship he should have with the club.' Seedorf replaced Massimiliano Allegri as the manager after ending his playing career at Botafogo in Brazil. Local . media reports have claimed he is almost certain to leave in the summer, . despite recent good form that has seen them win six of their last eight . games and stay in contention for a Europa League spot going into the . final day of the season. Milan . host already-safe Sassuolo on Sunday and are currently on 54 . points, a point behind Parma and two behind sixth-placed Torino, who . occupy the last Europa League place and play at Fiorentina. Hope: AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi (centre) has not ruled out that Seedorf could stay on . Milan . need to beat Sassuolo and hope that Parma do not win at relegated . Livorno at home and Torino lose at Fiorentina, as the latter drew both . their matches with Milan this season and have a superior goal . difference. Should Torino . draw, Milan will need to beat Sassuolo by four goals or more to overtake . Giampiero Ventura's surprise package and seal a European spot. They . also need Hellas Verona, who are ninth but level on points with Milan . do not win at Napoli. Should Parma not win and Torino, Milan and Verona . all finish on 57 points, Torino would take sixth spot due to their . better mini-league record against the other two. However, . even qualifying for Europe might not be enough to save Seedorf, as . Milan Chief Executive Adriano Galliani was caught on camera during last . weekend's 2-1 defeat at Atalanta describing the Dutchman as 'mad' for . not playing Adel Taarabt instead of the off-form Keisuke Honda. Playing days: Seedorf made 300 appearances in a 10-year spell as a player with the Italian giants . While . carrying out his community service in an old peoples' home, Berlusconi . recently said that he had met 'lots of people who could keep the Milan . dressing room under control'. If . the 38-year-old Seedorf is sacked, former AS Roma and Zenit St . Petersburg coach Luciano Spalletti is reportedly the front-runner to . replace him. According to . reports, Milan are also considering Fiorentina manager Vincenzo . Montella, Parma coach Roberto Donadoni and Filippo Inzaghi, currently . managing the club's youth team, as possible replacement.","The AC Milan president has said that a decision will be made at the end of the season .

"By . Emma Sword, Press Association . Former Premier League footballer Marlon King has been jailed for 18 months for dangerous driving after a crash which left a motorist with a broken arm. The much-travelled former Watford, Wigan and Sheffield United striker had pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving at Nottingham Crown Court in March. Sentencing King at the same court, Recorder Paul Mann QC said: 'I do not regard your case as merely impulsive or silly behaviour. Sentence: Marlon King has been jailed for 18 months after his dangerous driving caused an accident . Jailed: King arrives at court before his driving was described as 'arrogant' and 'aggressive' by the judge . 'It was aggressive. It was arrogant.' The court heard King had been eating an ice cream at the wheel when he caused a three-car pile up on the A46 in Nottinghamshire last April. The judge also handed King a three-year driving ban. The court heard that King committed the offence on his 33rd birthday while driving a white 2011 Porsche Panamera. He was eating an ice cream he had bought from a McDonalds just moments before the crash, which happened at around 3pm on April 26. King was seen weaving in and out of traffic before he undertook Martin Beck, whom he perceived as travelling too slowly in the outer lane of the A46, the court heard. The former footballer slammed on his brakes in frustration, forcing Beck to perform an emergency stop in his black VW Polo. As Beck came to a halt, another driver in a silver Vauxhall Astra who had pulled out behind him, collided with the stationary Polo. The 'concertina effect' forced the Polo into the back of King's Porsche. Previous: King has a string of criminal convictions and has twice been jailed in the past . Mr Beck . had to be cut out of his car and airlifted to hospital after the . collision at Winthorpe, near Newark. He spent three weeks in hospital . and required surgery for a fractured and dislocated forearm. Mark Bush, who was travelling in the Astra, was also taken to hospital for cuts and bruises. The . court heard that King drove off from the scene but was flagged down by . another motorist who feared Beck had been killed by the collision. King returned to Beck's car, where he blamed the driver for the collision. The . judge told King: 'You were so pumped up with road rage, you had to . start accusing him of being to blame for these collisions'.","Marlon King has been jailed for 18 months for dangerous driving .

"By . Katy Winter . A couple who had their first date at a theme park nine years ago have got engaged at the foot of their favourite ride. Stephen Kelly, 25, surprised his girlfriend Danielle Manton, 25, by popping the question at Thorpe Park - where they have visited on her birthday every year since their first date when they were seventeen. Danielle was stunned when Stephen got down on one knee at the bottom of their favourite ride - Nemesis Inferno - surrounded by her closest friends and family. Stephen got down on one knee at the foot of their favourite ride Nemesis Inferno, surrounded by friends and family . A delighted Danielle said yes and the pair hope to hold their reception at Thorpe Park . Stephen says of his choice of venue: 'Thorpe Park is such a special place for us, it just felt right to do it then and there' Stephen and Danielle had their very first date at Thorpe Park at the tender age of 17 having met in college . Stephen and Danielle, pictured here on their first date, have revisited the park every year since on Danielle's birthday . The couple from Poole, Dorset, met in psychology class at school and bonded over their love of roller-coasters. Eventually 17-year-old Danielle plucked up courage to ask Stephen to visit Thorpe Park with her for her birthday. Danielle, who has two daughters with Stephen, said: 'I met Stephen at school and instantly fell in love with him - I really wanted to ask him on a date, but didn't have a clue how to do it, or where to go. 'I suggested Thorpe Park, my favourite place in the world and he said yes, I was so excited I could hardly contain myself - we arranged to go for my birthday. Danielle, pictured with Stephen on their first date, both aged 17, said she fancied him from the moment they met . 'I spent the car journey with my stomach in knots, not because I was scared of the coasters, but because I was sat next to him. 'We arrived, and the first ride we went on was Nemesis Inferno - we got together at the end of that day - just after riding Nemesis Inferno for the last time.' Since that day the couple have returned to the park on the 11th of May every year, now with their two daughters, Bella, four and Connie, eight-months-old. Stephen, who waited until he had completed his apprenticeship as a carpenter before proposing, planned the stunt in secret and invited the couple's closest friends and family to meet them as they came off the ride. Stephen said: 'Danielle had no idea at all, I've been waiting so long to propose - it had to be in the right place at the right time. Stephen, Danielle and their two children Connie (L) and Bella at a friends wedding. The pair waited until they could afford to get engaged . The family now make their annual pilgrimage to Thorpe Park together, and Bella even helped her father with the proposal . 'I thought about doing it at the theatre, but Thorpe Park is such a special place for us, it just felt right to do it then and there. 'My daughter was there and she told Danielle to close her eyes and open her hands, when she opened her eyes I was down on one knee.' Stephen and Danielle are now hoping to hold their wedding reception at the park - which nine years later remains one of their favourite places. Danielle said: 'I fell pregnant with my first daughter Bella when I was still at university and it was really hard - without my great friends and Stephen I wouldn't have been able to get through it. 'We have always struggled with money and being able to afford to get engaged is a massive step for us. 'When Stephen proposed I couldn't believe this amazing thing was happening - we are both incredibly happy and excited to get married.' A spokesperson for Thorpe Park said: 'We were thrilled to hear that Thorpe Park has played such a romantic part in Danielle and Steve's engagement and we're speaking to them about their wedding day plans and a honeymoon in our new Thorpe Park hotel.'","Stephen and Danielle met at college at the age of 17 .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . ‘I’ve heard it said I must be gutted to have been brought up in a place like Peckham. Rubbish.’ Rio Ferdinand – ‘Rio: My Story’, 2006. Next to Leyton Square on Peckham Park Road in Southwark, south-east London, there is a blue circular plaque, discreetly placed on the side of a building. 'Rio Ferdinand,' it says in white letters. 'Peckham’s football legend, who lived on the Friary Estate.' Moving on: Rio Ferdinand will leave Manchester United on a free transfer this summer . Say cheese! Ferdinand takes a selfie upon arrival at the Changi International Airport . Blue for the red: A plaque commemorates Ferdinand's rise from the Friary Estate in Peckham, south London, to the top of the football world . Happy memories: Ferdinand lifts the 2008 Champions League trophy with Ryan Giggs after beating Chelsea . The plaque overlooks a patch of grass and a fenced concrete playground with buildings covered in brightly coloured murals. Ferdinand used to call it ‘The Adventure’. ‘That adventure playground was the hub of the estate,’ recalled Damien Mills, who was in the same school year as Ferdinand at Camelot Primary School on nearby Bird-in-Bush Road. ‘Everybody left their kids there, but we were all safe because they always knew where we were. ‘There were lots of single parents and it was a good place for us to go after school before everyone got called in for dinner. 'You could always hear Rio’s mum calling: ""Ree-oh!” Everybody knew her voice.' Fun time: A play area inside the Friary Estate where Ferdinand spent some of his childhood . New boy: Ferdinand shows off his United shirt with then manager Sir Alex Ferguson after joining from Leeds for £29.1million in July, 2002 . Ferdinand was born on November 7 1978 in King’s College Hospital, Camberwell, and lived with his mother Janice and younger brother Anton in a two-bed flat in Gisburn House until he was 14. The Ferdinands' father, Julian, a tailor, moved to the nearby to the Yellow Brick Estate when Rio was nine and Anton was two. His parents never married. The Ferdinands’ council flat overlooked a patch of grass Rio used to call ‘Wembley’. The fading blooms of red roses mark it now, along with a sign saying ‘No Ball Games’. Not that this would have stopped Rio and Anton. Andy Morgan lived two doors along on the second floor of Gisburn House. He remembered the boys as ‘very civil and well-mannered’ - even when they were racing other kids from the estate across the car park. Mr Morgan told Sportsmail in 2010: 'We always thought Anton might be the better player, because he would always win their races. He just looked so natural.’ The young Rio was afraid of dogs, but Mr Morgan let him play with his mongrel, Ranger. He too recalls Rio’s mother calling her son's name as darkness fell, the signal that another day’s play was to end. Champions: Ferdinand shows off the 2006-07 Premier League trophy with Cristiano Ronaldo . Home ground: Ferdinand grew up on the Friary Estate in Peckham, south London . On target: Ferdinand scores a rare goal against Liverpool in a 2-0 win at Old Trafford in 2006 . ‘She was very strict,’ said Mr Morgan. ‘They were never in a lot of bother.’ Ferdinand has said he ‘learned all about life’ during those early days on the Friary Estate. He had to, after all. ‘You became street-wise but you got a sense of real values as well,’ he said in his 2006 autobiography. Mr Mills agrees. ‘I think, in a way, it helped Rio,' he told Sportsmail in 2010. 'There used to be a real community spirit. The older kids played football with the younger ones, and we aspired to be like them.’ Yet Ferdinand's upbringing was quite different from the lifestyle he and wife Rebecca have been able to give their children Lorenz, eight, Tate, five and Tia, three. The Friary estate would be scarred by the death of Damilola Taylor in a stairwell on Blakes Road, less than a mile from where the Ferdinands grew up, in 2000. Early doors: Ferdinand began playing youth football while living at Gisburn House . Passion: Ferdinand celebrates scoring the winning goal in Sir Alex Ferguson's last home game as United boss . Home sweet home: Ferdinand lived at 18 Gisburn House in Peckham as he began his football career . Ferdinand also knew and was at school with Stephen Lawrence, the 18-year-old who was stabbed to death waiting for a bus in Eltham, six miles south of Peckham, in April 1993. The North Peckham estate received a £290million investment in 2007 and the high-rise blocks are gone, but this is not the Peckham of Del Boy and Rodney. Mr Morgan, who has lived in Gisburn House for more than 40 years, described stepping over piles of rubbish to get out of the door. There are plenty of public sports facilities – basketball courts, concrete five-a-side pitches and climbing frames - but few kids playing on them these days. ‘The estate’s not the same now though, the warmth has gone,’ said Ferdinand in his autobiography. ‘Everyone keeps to themselves and it’s lost its heart. There’s hardly any kids playing outside there any more. It’s weird, almost eerie.’ Mr Mills added: ‘There were a lot of opportunities for Rio to go down the wrong path. We all know guys who didn’t make it; who just had too many other distractions. Captain planet: Ferdinand lifts the FIFA World Club Cup after victory over Ecuador's Liga de Quito in 2008 . Learning curve: Ferdinand believes living on the Friary Estate taught him to become 'street wise' Snap shot: Ferdinand takes photographs after arriving in Singapore . ‘For people outside the area, you think of Del Boy and Rodney, but I think a lot of the problems are the same as in any area of poverty. ‘It was too easy to get side-tracked and there were people who were as good as Rio, or better, who didn’t make it because they didn’t have that focus.’ Ferdinand certainly had focus, but he cannot have had much spare time, either. He represented Southwark in gymnastics at the London Games and attended the Central School of Ballet in Farringdon four times a week for four years, doing jazz dance, contemporary and modern ballet. He was also in a drama club at Peckham Settlement, a local resource centre. Aged 10 he represented Bloomfield Athletic and then spent a year at QPR before playing in midfield a little closer to home at Eltham Town. By the time he was 14 – and a pupil at Bluecoat School in Blackheath where he would achieve GCSEs in English, maths, drama, PE and science – the Ferdinands had moved to a three-bed flat in Latona Road, the other side of ‘The Adventure’. Janice married Peter St Fort in 1993 and when Rio’s half-sister, Sian, was born, the family needed a bigger home. The Latona Road flat was, however, nothing compared to the four-bed £300,000 detached house in Mottingham near Bromley that Ferdinand was able to buy the woman he called ‘Super Mum’ when he was 19. ‘All our possessions fitted into the front room,’ he said. Final bow: United's 1-1 draw with Southampton was Ferdinand's last game for the Old Trafford club . Moving on up: Ferdinand's family now live in this detached house in Kent . Hard man: Ferdinand is escorted from the pitch by Robin van Persie after being cut by a coin thrown from the crowd during a Manchester derby in 2012 . By then, Ferdinand had left Peckham behind and was making waves as a classy central defender for West Ham United. His move to Leeds United in November 2000, when he became the world’s most expensive defender, was only three years away. But although Ferdinand moved away from the Friary Estate he had called home throughout his childhood, ‘Peckham’s football legend’ has never forgotten his roots. They, too, have never forgotten him. The shop where Rio used to buy sweets after school and the butchers where his mother would buy meat are still there. People talk about Ferdinand fondly, and with considerable pride. There is a folder in Peckham’s prize-winning library chronicling the newspaper articles that chart Ferdinand’s progress. There have, of course, been considerable peaks and troughs during Ferdinand's career as a professional footballer but, for many, he remains the boy who raced home from school and dreamed of emulating Diego Maradona. ‘We’re really proud of what he’s done and always hoped he would make it,’ said Mr Mills. ‘Nobody in Peckham really realised you could be a pro footballer.' And it all started on an adventure playground in Peckham.","Rio Ferdinand has been told his Manchester United career is over .

"By . Bianca London . He's tasked with sampling the calorie-laden culinary delights on MasterChef week after week so really it should come as no surprise that John Torode might gain a few pounds here or there. However, it seems that 48-year-old John has enjoyed a few too many taste tests over his time on the show, revealing that he thinks he'll have piled on a staggering stone by the end of the season. Speaking on This Morning about the tenth series final, which will see cooks Jack, Luke and Ping battle it out for the title tonight and tomorrow, he said: 'I watch it now and think ""I know that, at the end of the series, I'll be a stone heavier.' Piling on the pounds: Masterchef judge John Torode revealed on This Morning that he puts on a stone by the end of the series . 'I saw myself on TV the other day and I've got this big fat belly in my chef's outfit and thought ""God, you're unattractive"",' he added. His perceived weight gain is hardly surprising considering how much food he is tasked with sampling. When asked how many plates of food he's eaten over the ten series, he replied: 'I reckon it's close to 10,000 because there was one series we did when we actually ate 2,490 plates of food in one series.' And whn quizzed on how he attempts to keep the weight off, he told Phillip that he 'cycles like hell'. It hasn't stopped him! Despite his complaints about his weight gain, John tucked into some culinary delights on the show . He works out: John told Phillip and Holly that he keeps the weight off by 'cycling like hell' - he even arrived at the ITV studios on his bike . Anyone who is a fan of Masterchef might have noticed that John's weight does seem to fluctuate a tad. Since 1999, when the show first began John has obviously got a little older and wiser and his body shape has changed here and there too. How he is today: John, 48, says that he looks at himself at the end of a series and realises he has gained a stone . Creeping on? John, pictured, left, in 2012 and, right, in 2011, says he recently saw himself on TV and thought 'God, you're unattractive' That's A LOT of taste tastes: When asked how many plates of food he's eaten over the ten series, John, pictured, left, in 2010 and, right, in 2009, replied: 'I reckon it's close to 10,000' Foodie feast: John, pictured, left, in 2008 and, right, in 2007, reveals that there was one series we did when he and Gregg ate 2,490 plates of food in one serie . Back in the day: John, pictured, left, in 2006 and, right, back in 1999, is the star of a new show that will see him revisit childhood haunts in Australia, along with the people and places that influenced his cooking and inspired him to become a professional chef . Meanwhile, co-star Gregg Wallace, who once described himself as the ‘fat, bald bloke on MasterChef who likes pudding’, has lost two stone on his latest diet and become an ambassador for WeightWatchers as a result. Super slimmer: . Meanwhile, co-star Gregg Wallace, pictured, left, now, and right, two . years ago, has lost two stone on his latest diet and become an . ambassador for WeightWatchers as a result . And perhaps it's not just John's judging duties that have lead to John's extra pounds. They say that being in a relationship leads to weight gain, so maybe John's girlfriend actress and chef Lisa Faulkner is partly to blame? Faulkner has described her relationship with Torode, which blossomed after the pair pair met on celebrity Masterchef in 2010 and split from their former partners, as 'really new, really lovely'. She told the Mail last September: 'John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until... Is being in a relationship to blame? The chef was granted a divorce from his wife Jessica in February, clearing the way for his romance with actress Lisa Faulkner, right . 'I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different. 'I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.' Faulkner's ex-husband Chris Hoghill, who played Tony King in EastEnders, moved out of their marital home in early 2012. The pair share custody of an adopted daughter, Billie, who is six. Torode has four children, two with his ex-wife Jessica and another two from a previous relationship. Lisa has previously insisted that there were no sparks between her and Torode when they first met filming Celebrity Masterchef. 'When I met John he was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,' she said. 'All I could think was, “That sauce hasn't worked.” I didn't see anything but food for three months. 'After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.' Since first going public with their romance in November 2012, Faulkner and Torode have not sought to downplay their romance, but neither have they exactly flaunted it. They have been photographed together at celebrity events just a few times and both still live at separate London addresses. Faulkner began acting at 19 in the film The Lover after leaving school at 16 to model. Roles in Brookside, Holby City and Spooks followed. Since taking the MasterChef crown she has reinvented herself as a cookery expert, publishing two recipe books, the second of which features her daughter throughout. 'Cooking anchors me and calms me,' she has said. That makes her an ideal match for Torode, who began his kitchen career in his home town, Melbourne, aged 16 before moving to London in 1991 and clinching jobs as sous chef at some of London's most fashionable restaurants. After first appearing on television in 1996 on ITV1's This Morning, he joined Greg Wallace to present a revamped MasterChef on BBC One in 2005. And it seems that his waistline looks set to expand even more. He has just returned from a road trip for his new television series, John Torode’s Australia, which sees him eating his way across his native country. Back to his roots: John Torode cooks on Sydney's harbour with the iconic opera house in the background . Over 10 episodes, he will revisit childhood haunts, along with the people and places that influenced his cooking and inspired him to become a professional chef. His foodie trail covers five states - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania – as the presenter catches up with family and friends and recreates some of his favourite Aussie dishes. ‘It was a tremendous adventure’, he says, ‘What’s important about this series is that it’s about me and my culinary journey - what shaped me to become what I am. It’s sort of like This Is Your Life in food.’ The series kicks off in Sydney, Australia’s biggest and most multi-cultural city, where Torode’s career as a chef took off. After cooking some of his favourite Vietnamese dishes, exploring China Town and finding out more about the city’s Lebanese community, viewers will see him catch up with acclaimed Aussie chefs Neil Perry and Peter Gilmore at their respective restaurants, before firing up the grill for a Torode family reunion barbecue.","Masterchef judge, 48, was speaking on This Morning .

"By . Katy Winter . Forget bagging a bargain, research has found that supermarkets are the hottest new place to pick up a date. Britons are going wild in the aisles with one in eight (13 per cent) saucy shoppers admitting to exchanging numbers with a fellow trolley-pusher. Six per cent have dated someone they met in the supermarket, whilst staggeringly, two per cent of those questioned said they had married someone they met at the supermarket. Britons are going wild in the aisles with one in eight saucy shoppers admitting to exchanging numbers with a fellow trolley-pusher . Supermarkets were deemed a fertile ground for the love bug with almost a quarter (23 per cent) of those surveyed saying a person’s shopping basket was a good indicator of their personality. Nearly two thirds (63 per cent) admitted they would be more attracted to someone if they shared similar shopping and eating habits, such as a fellow health nut, foodie or frugal shopper. A fifth (20 per cent) claimed the broad cross-section of people in a supermarket made it a great venue for meeting people, while one in eight (13 per cent) said it was easy to break the ice in a supermarket. Nearly one in ten (9 per cent) reported that supermarkets make the perfect pick-up joint as they were more relaxed than bars and clubs, while two per cent admitted that they didn’t get out much so it was a good place to meet people. Supermarkets were deemed a fertile breeding ground for love with almost a quarter saying a person's basket was a good indicator of their personality . According to insight revealed by the Shopitize app, 6:38pm is the best time to bag a beau with most singles hitting the shopping aisles in the early evening. Women looking to hone in on a hunk in the supermarket should shop in Sainsbury’s on a Saturday as this is the most popular day and supermarket for guys hitting the aisles. Men looking for a filly in the freezer aisle should venture out on a Tuesday, where there is a greater percentage of women compared with men. The most female-friendly supermarket was Morrisons; 60 per cent of all the shoppers were women so men searching for love should check-in. Pizza is month-on-month one of the top five most purchased items by both men and women, illustrating that those looking for a date should definitely be perusing the peperoni to improve their chances of finding love. UK leading Psychologist Dr David Holme commented: 'Lust-fuelled moments in darkened clubs and bars are the worst times to be selecting a partner for life. 'In contrast, in the clear light of the supermarket aisle, the contents of our trolley will say more about our personalities and habits than interrogation by a dating website. 'Anxious approaches and trite chat-up lines are not needed when you can offer to help pass goods or give advice in an unpretentious easy atmosphere, free from deafening DJs or hundreds of prying eyes. 'In the relaxed supermarket isles, we are more likely to engage naturally with prospective partners than be subject to the artificial barrage of people ‘on the look out’.”","The wide range of people in supermarkets is why a fifth feel they are a good place to pick up a date .

"By . Lucy Elkins . Living with heart fears: Caroline and baby Zara . From . the moment her boyfriend Rob proposed, Caroline Stroud dreamed about . her big day and starting a family with the man she loved. But a year . after she said yes, Caroline was questioning whether she should call it . all off. It wasn't that she no longer loved her fiance - rather that, . aged just 30, she  had been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition. Although . she had no symptoms and was fit and well, the condition meant her heart . could stop suddenly at any time - and any children she had might also . have the life-threatening condition. Caroline discovered she had the heart problem only because her otherwise healthy father had suddenly become ill. Many . others are living under the same threat, they just don't realise it. About half a million people have a faulty gene which puts them at risk . of a heart defect that could lead to a sudden premature death, says the . British Heart Foundation. 'It . is an estimate, but it may be even more common than that,' says . Professor Peter Weissberg, a cardiologist and medical director of the . charity. 'There . are dozens of types of these conditions but all are potentially deadly . because they put the patient at increased risk of having a chaotic heart . rhythm and a cardiac arrest, where the heart stops pumping.' The . most common is hypertrophic myopathy, which causes the heart to thicken . and affects 100,000 Britons. Others include long QT syndrome, which . affects the heart's electrical activity. Each year about 600 healthy people under 35 die suddenly, often as a result of an undiagnosed inherited heart disorder. Yet these conditions can cause problems at any age. The problem is that there are rarely tell-tale symptoms. 'The . biggest clue to whether someone is at risk is to examine their family . history and see if any relatives suddenly died under 35,' says Professor . Weissberg, adding that by the time people reach their 50s 'coronary . heart disease is the bigger threat'. 'Sometimes . you hear of people who have had two or three relatives who drowned - we . now know that cold water can trigger a misrhythm of the heart, leading . to sudden cardiac arrest with these inherited conditions.' While . there was no history of sudden death in Caroline's family, in November . 2008 her father Barry, 60, became inexplicably breathless and generally . unwell. Caroline . persuaded him to go to the doctor. At the surgery he became grey and . breathless again and tests showed his heart was beating so erratically . that he was at risk of cardiac arrest; he was rushed to hospital and . defibrillated to get his heart working properly again. Without this, he . could have died. Caroline Stroud of Folkestone Kent with father Barry Staines, who has inherited heart condition ARVC . Tests . revealed that the problem stemmed from an inherited heart condition, . arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) - essentially a . fault with the proteins that hold the heart muscle cells together. 'These . act like a molecular glue - if there is a fault with this, the heart . can enlarge,' explains Professor Hugh Watkins, a consultant cardiologist . based at Oxford University. Scans . showed that Barry's heart had started to enlarge and, as there was a . good chance of him having a cardiac arrest, he needed to have a . mini-defibrillator implanted in his body to jolt his heart into beating . properly again if this happened. The news was a shock. Caroline says her father 'always seemed healthy. He was slim and seemed strong physically'. Barry . got help just in time. But his diagnosis threw up bigger issues for his . children. Caroline and her brother Chris, 33, and sister Jo, 38, were . offered screening to see if they had the faulty genes. (Normally, genetic testing is also offered automatically to the relatives of someone who dies suddenly under 35.) This involved a straightforward blood test, but having it wasn't a straightforward decision. 'Part . of me didn't want to know,' recalls Caroline, now 35. Not least because . for her father's condition, until someone reaches the point of needing . an implant, as he had, there is no treatment. Genetic . testing has made a big difference, says Professor Weissberg. 'Before we . had the tests five or so years ago, we could only look at a family . history and say ""It looks as if you have the faulty genes"" when maybe . the person didn't.' Not everyone who tests positive will necessarily be . at risk of cardiac arrest or even have heart problems. 'What . we call the event rate (the number of cardiac arrests or actual . problems caused) is low, so you may have this genetic defect but have a . normal lifespan,' says Dr Sanjay Sharma, consultant cardiologist to the . charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY). Yet . having the test means treatment can be given or lifestyle advice . offered to help prevent the condition becoming life-threatening. 'Something like long QT can be simply treated with medication to regulate the heart rhythm,' says Professor Watkins. Another . option is having a defibrillator implant. The difficulty for those . facing gene tests is that a positive result - even if you have no . symptoms - can bar you from certain careers, such as in the Armed . Forces. It can also cause a lot of anxiety. 'Some . people - especially young men - decide they would rather not know but . tend to change  their minds when they have families of their own,' says . Professor Watkins. Before they had the tests, Caroline and her siblings (their mother died 20 years ago from cervical cancer) received counselling. 'If . we had the faulty genes, there was no way of knowing when or if the . condition would start to cause changes to the heart,' says Caroline. 'There's no treatment even if we tested positive.' Before they had the tests, Caroline and her siblings received counselling . A defibrillator would be given only if the heart was showing signs of damage. 'But we were all agreed we had to find out.' Caroline . had the blood test early in 2010. The results showed she has both the . faulty genes involved in her father's condition. Her brother and sister . had only one, so their hearts wouldn't be affected. 'No . amount of counselling prepares you for getting a positive result,' says . Caroline. 'I tried to hide my distress from Dad because I didn't want . to make him feel guilty - but I was very, very upset. 'It . changed the way I felt about getting married and having a family. I . didn't want to lumber Rob with all this and I was concerned about . handing it on to our children.' She and Rob were due to marry that year, . but she told him she would understand if he wanted to call it off. 'Luckily, he told me not to be so silly.' Caroline now has a heart . check-up every six months. She still goes to the gym but exercises more . gently. 'I've bought a heart monitor and my doctor has said I mustn't . let my heart go over 150 beats per minute. A hard workout used to be my . favourite way to relax and I miss it.' The . advice to stick to light exercise is because a third of all cardiac . arrests in people with inherited conditions occur during or just after . intensive physical activity. When . Caroline became pregnant last year, she was concerned about the birth . 'but they kept a close eye on my heart rate and I was fine'. Her . daughter Zara is now four weeks old and Caroline and Rob face having to . get her tested for the defective genes. There is a 50 per cent chance . she will have them. 'It's . difficult because I don't want her to spend her life worrying about . this,' says Caroline. But she and Rob, who run a financial advice . business in Folkestone, Kent, still think they will have her tested.Meanwhile, . Caroline is appearing in television adverts starting this week to . highlight the need for more research into heart problems. 'We . need to find the people with faulty genes and treat them early - we may . one day develop treatments to halt these conditions,' says Professor .

"By . Emma Innes . A child with severe cerebral palsy has learned to sit up unsupported, to walk with a frame and to crawl unaided after joining a special school where his brain is ‘retrained’. Sonny Pikett, seven, had problems eating and could not control his head, roll over or sit up until he became a student at PACE in Buckinghamshire. The charity, which offers specialised education for children with motor disorders, helps to ‘retrain’ the brains of children like Sonny so as to bypass the damaged areas and teach others parts to substitute for them. Sonny Pikett, seven, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was just a few weeks old . Sonny’s mother, Louise Taylor, 38, from Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, said: ‘It really works and Sonny has come on so much. ‘For me personally, it is remarkable. He’s so much more active and he enjoys social interaction whereas before he was almost scared. ‘He is now much happier and he enjoys going to school.’ Sonny was born two months early, at just 30 weeks gestation, and when he was born he was unresponsive. He had to be delivered using forceps after Miss Taylor unexpectedly went into premature labour. When he was delivered he was not breathing properly – he was in respiratory distress. Until he was three, Sonny was unable to sit up unaided, crawl, walk or hold up his own head . As a result, he was rushed to the hospital’s special care baby unit and was put on a respirator. It is still not known why he was born so early but he had to spend seven and a half weeks in hospital before he was able to go home. Miss Taylor said: ‘We are very lucky to have him – he is a wonderful lad.’ She added: ‘We knew from a very early age that he would be disabled – we were told when he was seven weeks old that he had brain damage and would probably have cerebral palsy.’ Cerebral palsy is a general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination. These conditions are caused by a problem in the part of the brain responsible for controlling muscles. The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or if it is damaged before, during or shortly after birth. Causes of cerebral palsy include an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy, a difficult or premature birth, bleeding in the brain and gene mutations. It is thought that in the UK about one in every 400 people is affected. Symptoms include muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, uncontrolled body movements and balance and co-ordination problems. Symptoms vary in severity from one person to another - some only have minor problems while others are severely disabled. Some patients also have seizures, swallowing problems, difficulties with communications and learning difficulties. There is no cure but patients can benefit from physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Source: NHS Choices . Sonny failed to meet any of his developmental milestones and had problems eating and drinking, had a squint, was unable to control his head and could not walk, talk or sit up. He was also hypersensitive to touch and to loud noises meaning he became distressed if he was exposed to loud sounds and when he touched something unexpectedly. When he was three years old, Sonny started attending PACE in Aylesbury after Miss Taylor was told about it by a health visitor and it was recommended by another parent. The charity provides an innovative education for children with motor disorders, such as cerebral palsy. The centre provides a rounded education for children while making the most of the plasticity of children's brains. It attempts to 'retrain' children's brains while they are still very malleable so that some of the undamaged parts learn to take over the function of some of the damaged parts. It does this through repetition - encouraging children to carry out the same movements again and again until they are able to do them. The centre also offers physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help with the children's development. Miss Taylor said: ‘Within five minutes of going to PACE we were hooked. ‘Straight away we knew it was the right place for Sonny. We knew we wanted him to be there because of the positivity – At PACE they immediately offered to try and help Sonny and we liked that about it.’ She added: ‘Sonny is probably not going to be able to live a totally independent life, but we feel much more positive about the future. ‘When he was first born we were given details of a bleak and uncertain future but he is now highly motivated and has made massive achievements since he started to attend PACE and we feel this will continue as he gets older.’ Sonny attends the centre full-time and has come on in leaps and bounds. Miss Taylor told MailOnline: ‘He has become so strong by doing the activities daily. When he was three, Sonny started attending a special school called PACE. Here specialists have worked on 'retraining' his brain so that the parts that are undamaged take on some of the function of the damaged parts . ‘It has improved him so much and I believe it will continue to do so.’ She went on to explain that he is still unable to talk but that he can communicate by using a picture and word book. She said he used to get frustrated when people couldn’t understand him but that he is now much happier and that he is also able to move around on his own by crawling or using a walking frame. She explained that he also no longer becomes distressed by loud noises and that he can sit up and hold his head up independently. He also now has much greater use of his hands which used to be clenched. Miss Taylor said: ‘Every child with cerebral palsy has the right to this sort of intervention. Sonny is now able to sit up unaided, to hold his head up, to crawl and to walk with a frame . ‘I don’t know where we’d have been if Sonny hadn’t gone to PACE – thanks to the school he will now be able to lead as independent a life as is possible for him.’ She added: ‘PACE has helped us to understand cerebral palsy – now I understand why he used to react in certain ways. ‘There has been such a transformation – people always notice the huge changes in him when they haven’t seen him for a while. ‘They really have made a huge difference to him.’ Miss Taylor does not believe that Sonny will ever be able to live independently but she is confident that he will continue to improve at PACE. She said: ‘I believe that he may well be able to speak and to become physically stronger. Sonny's mother, Louise Taylor, says that the change in Sonny has been amazing since he started at the school . ‘I don’t think he will ever live independently but I do hope he will have some degree of independence.’ Miss Taylor is now supporting a new campaign and parliamentary inquiry focused on getting a better deal for children with cerebral palsy across the whole country. The campaign is being organised by Action Cerebral Palsy which is a consortium of charities working with children with cerebral palsy, including PACE. One of the primary objectives of the campaign is to call for more consistent access to early and intensive support - such as that offered by PACE and which Sonny is lucky enough to have access to. Sonny's parents do not believe that he will ever be able to live independently but they hope he will continue to improve while he is at PACE . Amanda Richardson, Chair of Action Cerebral Palsy said: 'We see every day the amazing progress that children with cerebral palsy can make, given the right support. ‘But we are fully aware that only a small proportion of the 1,800 children born with cerebral palsy every year receive the early and intensive intervention that can transform their lives. ‘By joining forces, we aim to get a better deal for all children with cerebral palsy.' The campaign is also fighting for the earliest possible diagnosis for people with cerebral palsy and better training for professionals working with children with the condition.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Since time immemorial people have been encouraged to ‘forgive and forget’ in order to live a happy life. But now seems there is also scientific truth to the old adage because forgiving a wrong makes it easier for a person to move on, a new study claims. Researchers also discovered that people always remember hurtful details if they have not forgiven a perpetrator - even if they are asked to forget an incident. Forgive and forget: A new study has found that forgiving a wrong makes it easier for you to forget it and move on with your life. Previous studies have shown that learning to forgive others can have positive benefits for an individual's physical and mental health . Volunteers read 40 hypothetical scenarios of wrong doing such as infidelity, slander and theft and decided whether they could forgive the fictional perpetrator. Two weeks later they were asked to recall certain events accompanied with a neutral cue work written in green and forget others denoted with cue words written in red. If participants had forgiven an act they were more likely to forget it when prompted to do so. They always remembered a scenario they had not forgiven – even if they had been asked to forget it. The findings of the study suggest that forgiveness may help intentional forgetting by helping people supress details of hurt. Dr Saima Noreen, of the University of St Andrews, Scotland said: ‘It is well established learning to forgive others can have positive benefits for an individual's physical and mental health. ‘The ability to forget upsetting memories may provide an effective coping strategy that enables people to move on with their lives.’ Overcoming strong negative emotions against an enemy and quashing impulses for vengeance - processes that are critical to forgiveness - are seen by psychiatrists as a function of executive control. Research suggests that this mental function is also involved in our ability to dismiss something when we are motivated to forget it. Dr Noreen examined whether this cognitive mechanism might link forgiveness and forgetting. Moving on from hurt: 'The ability to forget upsetting memories may provide an effective coping strategy that enables people to move on with their lives,' the experts behind the experiment said. A stock image is shown . She and her team recruited volunteers to read 40 hypothetical scenarios containing wrongs including infidelity, slander and theft and asked them if they would forgive each transgression if they were the victim. Less than two weeks later the volunteers read a few of the scenarios again, but this time each was accompanied by a neutral cue word written in either red or green. After learning these pairings, the participants were presented with some of the words and instructed to recall the related event when it was green and to avoid thinking about it if red. The technique is often used in memory research and trains people to forget specific information or details. The researchers wanted to see whether forgiveness might affect the forgetting process. The experiment revealed that when the participants had forgiven a hurtful act, they were more likely to forget it when they had been asked to do so. Holding a grudge: The experiment revealed that when the participants had forgiven a hurtful act, they were more likely to forget it when they had been asked to do so. But they always remembered a scenario they had not forgiven (illustrated with a stock image), even when they had been told to forget it . But they always remembered a scenario they had not forgiven, even when they had been told to forget it. The findings, published in Psychological Science, suggest forgiveness may facilitate intentional forgetting by helping people to suppress details about wrongdoings perpetrated against them. So, while true forgiveness may be difficult to accomplish, it could make forgetting – and moving on with life - easier. ‘This research is only coming into fruition and it is likely the relationship between forgiveness and forgetting is bidirectional and far more complex over longer periods of time,’ Dr Noreen said. ‘We hope in time that new fields of enquiry may combine forgetting and forgiveness based interventions that might, in turn, give rise to powerful therapeutic tools that will enable people to “forgive and forget” more effectively.’ Previous research has shown excusing people for wrongdoings can actually boost your health.  People who let go of their anger were less likely to see spikes in their blood pressure.","In a University of St Andrews study, volunteers read hypothetical .

"By . Mark Prigg . Microsoft has slashed the price of its Xbox One games console by $100 in a bid to become the living room gadget of choice and catch up to arch rival Sony. However, in order to lower the price, Microsoft has dropped its revolutionary motion sensor Kinect from the cheapest bundle. The new price of $399, the same as a PS4, begins June 9, and Microsoft says it is also allowing entertainment apps like Netflix to be used on both the Xbox One and the older Xbox 360 console without having to pay for an Xbox Live Gold membership, which costs $60 a year. Scroll down for video . Although the Xbox One was a hit with some fans, it has been outsold by Sony's Playstation 4. Microsoft hopes the price drop will boost sales. Microsoft said last month that sales of Xbox One had slowed to 1.2 million in the quarter through March, compared to the 3.9 million it sold in the holiday quarter. The total of 5.1 million was behind Sony's 7 million in sales of the PS4. Both launched in November. The membership will continue to be required for multiplayer game mode, but it will also provide discounts on games and free games. Phil Spencer, who was named head of Xbox in March, said unbundling Kinect was important to reaching more fans. 'Value is important,' he said in an interview. 'Making sure you have an opening price point that can reach as many people as possible is critical.' Microsoft said last month that sales of Xbox One had slowed to 1.2 million in the quarter through March, compared to the 3.9 million it sold in the holiday quarter. The total of 5.1 million was behind Sony's 7 million in sales of the PS4. Both launched in November. Spencer added that it no longer made sense to reserve apps such as Netflix and YouTube to paying subscribers since such apps are widely available on DVD players and other Internet-connected devices. It comes as the firm is moving into entertainment. Microsoft's Xbox One (left) and Sony's Playstation 4 (right) are in a bitter battle for dominance of the living room - with the PS4 winning so far in terms of sales. Weeks ago Yahoo and Microsoft both revealed plans to create their own TV shows in the ever-expanding battle for the living room. Yahoo has unveiled plans for four shows, while Microsoft is believed to have 12 in development. They will go up against Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, all of whom are also commissioning their own shows in a bid to change they way we watch TV. Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer has unveiled plans to break into television-style original video with the launch of two original comedy series and an internet channel that will stream live concerts. The expansion makes Yahoo the latest technology company to mount a challenge to Netflix . Amazon last month unveiled a $99 TV box to take on Apple, Google and Roku - and it doubles as a games console. At an event in New York the firm launched the Fire TV box, which runs a special version of Google's Android software. The small box fits under a TV, and comes with a remote with a built in microphone for voice recognition. It allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps. To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Microsoft has signed up comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Green for its projects. It hired former CBS boss Nancy Tellem to head up its new TV studio, which will produce shows to be watched on the firm's Xbox games console as well as its mobile devices. The studio now has six series lined up - including a science-fiction thriller called 'Humans' about humanoid robot workers - and more than a dozen projects in development, according to Bloomberg. Yahoo is seeking to order web series’ that will position it to compete with offerings from other streaming video goliaths in a bid to bolster advertising revenues. The web portal is set to order four new shows with per-episode budgets of as much as a couple million dollars, a source told the Wall Street Journal. CEO Marissa Meyer’s sweet spot appears to be half-hour comedies with 10 episode seasons ‘led by writers or directors with experience in television,’ the paper reported. Sagging revenues and four straight . quarterly losses have created a sense of urgency among executives . looking to have deals lined up before a major advertising conference . later this month. Actress Sarah Silverman is among those believed to have signed up to Microsoft's TV shows. It is believed the firm has six projects approved, with a dozen in development. ‘They want to blow it out big time,’ said the Journal’s source. Meyer believes the key to upping the advertising rate ante is adding television-caliber content to compete with the likes of Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, a person close to the negotiations explained. ‘They're looking at the same type of shows that Netflix and Amazon are eyeing,’ said the source. Having those shows lined up by the April 28th ‘NewFront’ event – in which internet companies pitch their advertising dollar worthiness similar to the way television networks present their primetime lineups – is key to that strategy. Yahoo is competing against an ever-increasing number of cable networks and other sites for the original content and viewers’ eyeballs, but is fixated on the potential premium advertising rates charged for video has for boosting the bottom line. Recent successes such as ‘House of . Cards’ and ‘Orange is the New Black’ helped drive a subscriber surge of . 2.3million in the fourth quarter of 2014 alone, the company announced earlier this year. Yahoo currently trails far behind other online video providers. Financial terms of Yahoo's deals to license the new series weren't disclosed. However, Yahoo doesn't plan to charge viewers to watch the series . Yahoo trails far behind other streaming providers, but it wants a piece of that pie, and the revenues that could be reaped through international syndication deals, according to the Journal. The ability to stream video from Amazon, HBO Go, Hulu and Netflix straight to televisions through Blu-ray players, game consoles, set-top boxes like Roku and other devices has no doubt fueled their growth, as has the ability use apps specially designed for handheld devices. Amazon Prime has also added multiple scripted and animated shows to its subscription-based Prime service, and only sweetened the deal with the recently-released Fire TV box meant to stream the content directly on to televisions. Vizio televisions currently use a Yahoo-based interface for apps, including direct video streaming competitors, to extend their usefulness – but it is not clear if the search giant would look to leverage that partnership. Also available is the Yahoo Sceeen app, which allows users the ability to watch Yahoo videos on Apple handheld devices. A Yahoo Screen website is also available for those interested. Yahoo declined to comment about it's video ambitions when reached by MailOnline. 'House of Cards': The Kevin Spacey-starring Netflix series has become the standard for online television shows . Yahoo is up against stiff competition without the ability to easily stream video content to televisions. Binge-watching has replaced appointment viewing, and web series have reached a level of critical acclaim with Kevin Spacey starring in ‘House of Cards.’ The site has produced original video series in the past, such as the Morgan Spurlock-directed ‘Failure Club’ reality show, and has also recently ramped up video production across its news and sports divisions. This is not an entirely new frontier. Recent moves to hire veteran journalists Katie Couric and David Pogue, as well as a rumoured $300million acquisition of video provider News Distribution network have also hinted at Yahoo’s ambitions. Meyer and chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt have reviewed more than 100 projects over the past few months, but are looking for shows that can hit the ground running, according to the Journal.","The new price of $399 begins June 9 - but bundle has no Kinect sensor .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It was meant to reveal the ocean’s deepest secrets, but a one-of-a-kind submersible vehicle now lies in a watery grave. The Nereus’ journey deep into the Kermadec Trench to the north east of New Zealand ended when the robotic vehicle crumpled under the pressure of the water, just over 6 miles (10km) below the waves. Scientists believe that part of the vehicle imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it - as great as 16,000lbs per square inch. Crushed dreams: The Nereus' journey deep into the Kermadec Trench to the north east of New Zealand ended when the robotic vehicle (pictured) crumpled under the pressure of the water, just over 6 miles (10km) below the waves . Its mission was to undertake high-risk, high-reward research in the deepest parts of the ocean, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, which built and operated the multi million pound research vehicle. The institute's chief scientist Timothy Shank, said: 'Nereus helped us explore places we've never seen before and ask questions we never thought to ask.’ ‘It was a one-of-a-kind vehicle that even during its brief life, brought us amazing insights into the unexplored deep ocean, addressing some of the most fundamental scientific problems of our time about life on Earth.’ Researchers aboard an expedition ship called the Thomas G. Thompson explained that they lost contact with their robot seven hours into a nine hour mission on Saturday May 10. That sinking feeling: Scientists believe that part of the vehicle imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it - as great as 16,000lbs per square inch. It was lost in the  Kermadec Trench (pictured) - one of the earth's deepest oceanic trenches - to the north east of New Zealand (pictured) Before the catastrophe, the robot had taken samples from the sea floor and samples of sea life. Ken Kostel, of the institute, said: 'We'd just completed collecting a sea cucumber for the respirometer and were getting Nereus ready to head to the underwater elevator. ‘Then the camera feeds abruptly went dark, and we lost communication with the vehicle.’ The submersible, which was designed to operate autonomously as well as be controlled remotely by humans, was connected to the surface by a fibre-optic cable.  It also had a system whereby it would gently float to the surface if the cable failed. However, the back-up could not be used and a member of the ship’s crew saw white objects in the water. ‘The rescue boat went in and three crew members began scouring the surface with nets as more and more white dots appeared. By then we knew. Nereus was gone,’ Mr Kostel said. The submersible was lost 30 days into a 40-day mission aboard the research ship, which was carrying out the first systematic study of a deep-ocean trench as part of the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Hadal Ecosystems Study (HADES) project. The Kermadec Trench (illustrated) runs northeast from the North island of New Zealand to the Louisville Seamount Chain. It is the second deepest oceanic trench in the world and formed by subduction - a geological process in which the tectonic plate is pushed beneath the Indo-Australian Plate . Nereus had completed a number of deep and dangerous missions, including travelling to the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, which is thought to be the deepest point in the ocean at over six miles (11km) below the waves. Since its launch in 2008, it had also shed light on the world’s deepest known thermal vents at Cayman Rise in the Caribbean. Larry Madin, the institute’s director of research, said: 'Extreme exploration of this kind is never without risk. 'The unfortunate loss of Nereus only underscores the difficulty of working at such immense depths and pressures.’ Nereus brought back specimens of animals previously unknown to science on its first HADES trip. It also collected seafloor sediment to help experts reveal the physical, chemical and biological processes that shape the deep-ocean ecosystems in ocean trenches, which are unlike almost any others on the planet. All aboard: Nereus is hoisted back on board the research ship to see what treasures it had recovered on its HADES cruise. It brought back specimens of animals previously unknown to science and seafloor sediment samples .","The Nereus imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it in the Kermadec Trench to the north east of New Zealand, experts said .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is believed to be finalising a deal to by headphone maker Beats Electronics for $3.2bn. The firm, founded by music producer Jimmy Iovine and the hip-hop star Dr Dre, is best known for its distinctive headphones. It is claimed a deal could be announced within days - and mark Apple boss Tim Cook's biggest ever acquisition. Scroll down for video . Dr. Dre, who founded Beats electronics with record producer music producer Jimmy Iovine. The firm could now be sold to Apple. Apple will acquire Beats’ streaming music service, which launched this year, and its audio equipment business, which includes its brand of headphones and audio equipment, according to a report in the Financial Times. The Beats management team will report to Mr Cook, said people familiar with the deal. Apple and Beats declined to comment. However, Apple boss Tim Cook said last month Apple was 'on the prowl' for more acquisitions, after buying 24 companies in the past 18 months and he was not averse to large acquisitions. The potential $3.2 billion deal would mark Apple’s largest acquisition of another company ever. It is believed Apple is also interested in Beats expertise in developing wearable products and it edges closer to a much anticipated iWatch launch, . Beats has also partnered with a host of celebrities, including Lady Gaga, to create endorsed  earphones.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . For more than 40 years, mystery has surrounded a tiny mummy that lay among exhibits at an Egypt centre in Wales. Experts were so baffled by its unusually small size and its delicate design that some even suggested it was a fake, created in the 19th century. Now CT scans have revealed not only is the case a genuine Egyptian artefact, it contains the rare remains of a mummified foetus thought to have been just 12 weeks into development when it died. A CT scan has revealed what appears to be a foetus, pictured, in the centre of a tiny Egyptian mummy. The majority of the interior is taken up by folded strips of material. Within this material is a darker area, about 3-inches (10cm) long, that researchers claim is a foetus, in the foetal position with the placental sac . The 20-inch (52cm) mummy is part of . the Wellcome collection at Swansea University’s Egypt Centre and is . thought to date back to the 26th Dynasty – around 600BC. It is made of cartonnage - . layers of linen stiffened with glue - and is shown wearing a yellow and . blue striped wig and wide collar. This, coupled with its red face, suggests it belongs to a male as was customary for mummies of that time. The researchers said it is carefully, though not over elaborately, painted and features inscriptions on the front and back. But . experts who have tried to decipher these inscriptions said they are . meaningless and for decades, many people believed it was a fake. The size of the foetus inside the case suggests the child would have been between 12 and 16 weeks into development when it died. The 20-inch (52cm) mummy is part of . the Wellcome collection at Swansea University’s Egypt Centre and is . thought to date back to the 26th Dynasty - around 600BC. On . 28 April, Swansea University’s Paola Griffiths from the Clinical Imaging . College of Medicine analysed the artefacts using a CT scanner. This revealed the majority of the interior of the case is taken up by folded strips of material, thought to be linen bandages. Within . these bandages is a darker area, about 3-inches (10cm) long, that the . researchers claim is a foetus, in the foetal position with the placental sac. Experts also identified what could be the foetus' femur. The . length of the femur, together with the size of the dark patch, is . consistent with that of a foetus 12 to 16 weeks into development, continued the . researchers. Another . dark patch suggests an amulet was also placed in the case, and and there . are several areas with dark circles resembling strings of beads or . tassels. The Egypt Centre said it was not unusual for strings of beads to be placed loose in mummy wrappings of this date. The mummy, pictured left, is held at Swansea University’s Egypt Centre and is thought to date back to the 26th Dynasty - around 600BC. It is shown wearing a yellow and blue wig and wide collar. This, coupled with its red face, suggests it belongs to a male. The scan on the left reveals the position of the foetus within this case . The researchers said the case, pictured, is carefully, although not over elaborately, painted and features inscriptions on the front and back. But experts who have tried to decipher these inscriptions said they are meaningless and for decades, many people believed it was a fake . The mummy, officially known as W1013, arrived in Wales in 1971, but nothing is known about how Henry Wellcome acquired it. On 28 April Swansea University's Paola Griffiths, pictured, from the Clinical Imaging College of Medicine analysed  the artefacts using a CT scanner . The mummy is made of cartonnage - layers of linen stiffened with glue - and is shown wearing a yellow and blue striped wig and wide collar. This, coupled with its red face, suggests it belongs to a male as was customary for mummies of that time. The body is decorated with a pattern of rhombus shapes perhaps imitating the bead net typically placed over some other mummies. It has also been suggested this pattern is reminiscent of feathers, or even the stars of the night sky. The researchers said it is carefully, although not over elaborately, painted and features inscriptions on the front and back. But experts who have tried to decipher these inscriptions said they are meaningless and for decades, many people believed it was a fake. In 1998, Singleton hospital X-rayed the cartonnage case but the results came back inconclusive, further fuelling these claims. ‘In contrast to the usual practice in the west today, it seems that the foetus could often be treated with care in ancient Egypt,’ explained Carolyn Graves-Brown from Swansea University. ‘For example, two coffins holding foetuses were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun and in New Kingdom - c.1550-1070BC- Deir el-Medina, a part of the Eastern cemetery seems to have been set aside for child burials, but also foetuses and even placentas in bloody cloths. ‘The placenta was believed to represent the twin of the self and so was disposed of with care too.’ ‘We can imagine that the probable foetus within W1013 represents someone’s terrible loss; an occasion of great grief and public mourning.’ The body, pictured, is decorated with a pattern of rhombus shapes perhaps imitating the bead net traditionally placed over some other mummies. It has also been suggested this pattern is reminiscent of feathers, or even the stars of the night sky .","The 20-inch case is made of cartonnage - layers of linen stiffened with glue .

"Most teens have a little dabble with alcohol here and there - a cheeky swig of dad's beer or even a house party gone wrong - but that's all part and parcel of adolescence. And Liz Badcock was no different. At 13 she began to get interested in the effects of booze but sadly, that interest turned toxic when she left home. Her life turned into a bottomless pit of drink and drugs until, at her lowest, Liz, now 40, was downing two litres of vodka a day and throwing back 2-300 mg of Valium. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Liz Badcock tells how a life of drink and drugs was finally brought to heel when she discovered - by sheer chance - she was pregnant . Telling her story on This Morning, Liz, from Melksham, Wiltshire, explained: 'At 13 I sratred drinking. It was around, in the house. 'School friends would drink when their parents weren't in, that kind of thing. 'But when I left home it tipped over. I realised it [alcohol] made me feel different. 'I was happy and confident, which I wasn't normally and I loved that - and everyone always told me I was the life and soul.' Happy times: Liz Badcock, right, with her husband Phil left. The couple worked together to help Liz overcome her addiction to drugs and booze and were thrilled to discover she was pregnant with their son, Harry . By 20, she was living in a flat-share and partying so hard she became reliant on alcohol, drinking lager for breakfast. At 23, Liz was was prescribed diazepam for panic attacks, and didn't confess to the GP at the time that she drank as much as she did. She then quickly became addicted to the pills too. Despite working as a PA, she drank throughout the day and Liz admits that the wild highs and lows of a life dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs left her suicidal. Liz Badcock tells her story of drink and drug addiction on This Morning. The 40-year-old hit rock bottom when she discovered she would never have kids - but that wasn't actually to be . She tried to cut her wrists and take overdoses but was always found in time. Life took a slight turn for the better when at 26 she met Phil, an IT manager at work. The pair quickly moved in together and it wasn't long before Phil realised how serious Liz's addictions were. 'I drank at work, drank first thing in the morning, took diazapam and basically abused it because it got rid of my hangovers.' says Liz. Phil explains: 'We moved into my house together and after a few weeks I noticed she was drinking lots of bottles.' 'I was very clever at hiding it,' adds Liz. 'There were so many lies and I used to hide bottles in the middle of a bean bag as you couldn't hear them clink. 'I remember feeling rock bottom when I had a fall down the stairs - by then I was drinking two litres of vodka a day and taking 2-300 mgs of valium.' After the pair married in 2003 Liz promised to cut back on her drinking but it didn't last long. In fact she was soon running up huge bills by secretly buying pills online - there was only one thing Liz wanted more than pills and drink and that was a child. She suffered from endometriosis, a severe and painful womb condition, and had never been able to become pregnant. She and Phil had failed attempts at IVF and Liz was told she would probably never be a mother. That was to be the tipping point for Liz - she began drinking so heavily that she lost her job and Phil convinced her to go into rehab. It was there that she discovered her liver was in a dangerous state. 'I was basically killing myself with alcohol. I was in rehab for four weeks. They wanted me to stay longer but I insisted I wouldn’t relapse if I went home. Three weeks later, I was drinking and taking pills again.' Liz told Paula Greenspan in an interview with The Mirror. But there would be an amazing peice of news that would finally help turn Liz's life around for good - the news she had always longed to hear- that she was in fact going to be a mother. On a visit to her GP in 2011 she was asked to do a pregnancy test. She did not think for a second it would be positive but when it was she was overjoyed. Mum's the word! Liz with husband Phil and baby son Harry whose birth helped Liz finally kick her drink and drug habit . When I was told there was a life growing inside of me it made me reevaluate my whole life,' she explains. 'I was very concerned about what damage might have been done to my baby and I knew I had to give up everything.' Phil adds: 'There was a lot of joy but a lot of concern but Liz stopped drinking.' In June 2012 Liz gave birth to couple's son Harry and Liz has now turned her life around. 'I now feel like the richest person in the world and being a mum is the best drug I could ever have.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . The suspect: Homeless teen Maria Garate was arrested and charged with assault of a four-year-old girl and her father with a deadly weapon, police said . A crazed homeless teen who mercilessly beat a young girl and her father inside a California Walmart with a crowbar screamed that the child deserved the attack. Maria Garate, 18, walked into the San Jose store just before 11.00 a.m. Tuesday and bashed the girl in the head with the crowbar before her father intervened and was also attacked, authorities said. The young girl’s injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, store employees told KBCW, but Garate has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Garate is said by police to have walked into the Walmart with a crowbar and approached the father and daughter browsing the purse section without warning. She then whacked the four-year-old girl and then her father as he stepped in to protect her during the frenzied attack, said cops. ‘The female entered the store and, for no apparent reason, she drew a crowbar that she had carried from her person and struck the child at least twice in the head causing pretty serious injuries,’ A San Jose Police spokesperson told the station. Employees were eventually able to subdue the teen until police arrived, but said she writhed around on the ground and screamed the four-year-old ‘deserved it.’ Where it happened: The attacks is said to have occurred in the purse section of this San Jose Walmart . Police have not established a motive for the attack or said if Garate knows her victims. They were taken to a nearby hospital and released after being treated for their injuries. The teen lives in a nearby transient community known as ‘the Jungle,’ sources told the San Jose Mercury News. She is no stranger to authorities, but cops would not say why they came into contact with her in the past. Police also did not say if drugs were a factor. MailOnline was unable to reach a police department spokesperson for further information. Garate is being held in Santa Clara County Jail.","Maria Garate walked inside the store with a crowbar and attacked the father and daughter without warning, police said .

The remains will be sent to the chief medical examiner's office to confirm the identity. Fayetteville Police Chief Harold Medlock said that Holbert had been a person of interest in the case since Bordeaux disappeared. Bordeaux was 23 when she was last seen on the early morning of April 14, 2012, at Froggy Bottoms bar in Fayetteville, where she had gone to sing karaoke. At the time, police believed she left the bar with a man she met there the week before, a person identified as a registered sex offender. She was reported missing two days later when she didn't report to work. Arrest warrants obtained on Wednesday by The Fayetteville Observer . say that Holbert and Bordeaux arrived together at the now-closed bar . and were there for several hours before getting into a fight in the . parking lot.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez now faces charges from a July 2012 double homicide in Boston. Hernandez has been linked to a total of three killings and is already being held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd last year. In the 2012 case, victims Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, were shot as they sat in a car in the city's South End. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . More charges: Aaron Hernandez has been charged with two additional counts of first-degree murder in connection with a 2012 double murder in Boston . A grand jury moved forward Friday morning with the indictment for the July 16, 2012 killing of the the lifelong friends shot to death as they sat waiting at a red light. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said during a Friday morning press conference that he expects the former Patriot to be arraigned on the additional murder charges early next week. Investigators believe that Hernandez was driving the SUV used in the shooting and likely fired the shots that killed Abreu and Furtado. Hernandez is seen in surveillance footage with friend Alexander Bradley entering the nightclub Cure at about 12.30 a.m. on July 16, 2012 and quickly guzzling two drinks, according to an affidavit cited by WCVB. Abreu and Furtado entered just before him. He and Bradley leave after about 10 minutes and exit a nearby parking garage in a Toyota 4Runner, the affidavit says. Abreu and Furtado leave the club at about 2.10 a.m. Hernandez's SUV is seen driving slowly past the two men twice as they walked to the parking garage, the document says. He is believed to have followed them down Shawmut Avenue to the light where they were eventually shot to death. 'Aaron Hernandez fired a .38-caliber revolver multiple times from the driver’s side of his vehicle in to the passenger side of the other vehicle,' Conley explained, adding the victims were 'stalked and ambushed in the city they call home.' Both men were shot multiple times - Abreu died from a bullet to the chest, Furtado was killed by a shot to the head. The six shots fired from the SUV with Rhode Island plates, according to witnesses, were not caught on camera. A third person was wounded in the attack but survived, according to reports.That person is said to be key to the prosecution's case and may even testify in court. 'Things happened so fast,' the passenger told Fox 25. 'I was trying to defend myself. They were shooting everywhere inside the car, front to back. They just came to kill. That's it.' The witness said he recognized Hernandez's face after he was arrested last year for Lloyd's death. Gunned down: Daniel Abreu (left) and Safir Furtado (right) were shot dead by Aaron Hernandez, authorities said . Investigators initially believed the drive-by shooting was gang-related, sources told the Boston Globe. Initial reports suggested Abreu and Furtado were gang members, but Conley made it clear that they were not. Aldo quashed were rumors they knew Hernandez prior to the night they were killed. 'These men were ambushed and executed as they drove home,' said Conley. 'Neither of [the victims] were involved in gangs, guns or violence of any kind. 'Their chance encounter inside a club triggered a series of events that culminated in these murders.' Neither had a criminal record, they both worked for a cleaning company, family told Fox 25. The case . remained unsolved until recently, but they believe evidence links . Hernandez to those murders after they observed him on nearby surveillance footage and a nightclub bouncer contacted police saying he had knowledge that the two incidents... were related,' according to the Boston Herald. Last year, Abreu's sister lamented the lack of leads in the investigation to WBZ. Killed for silence: Odin Llloyd was killed to keep him from talking about the other two murders, authorities believe . 'It’s really frustrating, I think about it a lot and I cry. The only thing I can do is pray to God,' said Neusa Abreu. 'I don’t know if [Hernandez] was abused as a child or had a rough life. I’m not sure what the issue is and why this had to happen,' she added. Investigators' focus shifted towards the former All-Pro after he was linked to the murder of Odin Lloyd. It is believed Hernandez may have killed Lloyd because he was concerned the semi-pro football player was talking about the double murders, law enforcement sources have said. Investigators told the Globe that they believe Hernandez enlisted the help of two childhood friends from Bristol, Connecticut, to help kill Lloyd in an effort to keep word of the star player's involvement in the other two murders from spreading. Friday morning's indictment brings full circle investigators' suspicions Hernandez was involved in the two deaths, whispers first made public earlier this year when court documents in the Lloyd case were unsealed. 'There is ... probable cause to believe that Aaron Hernandez was operating the suspect vehicle used in the shooting homicides ... and may have been the shooter,' a 2013 warrant made public by WCVB reads. Investigators have since located the handgun used to kill both men and the silver Toyota Hernandez was driving the night they were killed. The SUV was discovered in the garage of a Bristol home owned by one of Hernandez's uncles. The double murder occurred only one week before the start of the Patriots training camp for the 2012-2013 season. Hernandez played in 10 games that season, scoring five touchdowns while catching 51 passes for 483 yards, raising the possibility that he played after shooting two people dead. His contract with the team was terminated after he was arrested at his home in suburban North Attleboro in June 2013 on live television. Ernest Hernandez, believed to be one of Hernandez's accomplices in the murder of Lloyd, is expected to be arraigned for the murder Friday afternoon. Carlos Ortiz will be arraigned May 27 on murder charges for Lloyd's death, the Globe reported. Lloyd's body was discovered by a runner in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home. It is believed by prosecutors that Hernandez and his accomplices drove Lloyd to the park and killed him. Hernandez's legal team has not made any comments on the additional charges. He is being held in Bristol County Jail without bail.","Aaron Hernandez will be arraigned on two additional first-degree murder charges early next week .

But when these nine beagles were given free rein in a beautiful garden, they had no idea what to with themselves. These adorably young pups had spent their entire lives locked away in in the confines of a laboratory in Nevada, where they were . heartlessly used as test subjects - and never once allowed to run around . or play. Scroll down for video . Nine beagle puppies used for laboratory testing tread precariously onto the grass as they are released into the open for the first time in Las Vegas, America . But just this week, the beagles were released from their cages into the outside world - and felt the grass beneath their paws for the first time. In an amazing video which recorded the moment, volunteers from the Beagle Freedom Project are seen carefully releasing the puppies into the Las Vegas garden - where they are given their very first taste of freedom. With no experience of the outside world, the dogs are seen tentatively making their way across the grass, dazzled by their new surroundings. The footage shows four of the puppies looking so scared that they even start looking . for a spot to hide. The puppies are seen cowering behind bushes, trees and even an old wooden pen. But the footage, filmed in a garden in Las Vegas, shows the puppies slowly starting to embrace their new-found freedom. One of the beagles strides excitedly through the grass after he is released from the laboratory in Nevada for the first time by volunteers from the Beagle Freedom Project . The puppies, who have had no contact with the outside world since they were born, jumped up to greet one another as they ran around the garden . Within minutes, the dogs have come together in solidarity, frantically wagging their tails as they jump up to greet one another. The incredible footage also shows one of the volunteers giving names to the dogs for the first time. Previously know by just a number, the hounds were named after members of the Rat Pack and other entertainers, including Frankie, Dean, Sammy and Joey. The puppies spent their lives in cages (left) and were understandably apprehensive when they were taken by volunteers out into the fresh air (right) After spending some time in the garden, the beagles started tucking into bowls of water and food under the guidance of the volunteers . Dean - named after Dean Martin - is the first to be released, apprehensively looking around him as the volunteer places him onto the grass. Meanwhile inquisitive Sammy - named after Sammy Davis Junior - snuck under the pool fence so he could take a quick dip in the pool.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A glossy pair of stockings was enough to seduce Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate. And teamed with a well-cut dress and spritz of perfume, they are the perfect ingredients to make a lady feel her best. Dustin Hoffman was seduced by the stocking wearing Mrs Robinson in the 1967 film, The Graduate . The stockings are laced with the chemicals which are designed to increase sexual attraction . But now women can skip one of those . steps – with the introduction of scented stockings that claim to give . extra sex appeal. The Hush Hush range by hosiery firm Ballerina, available at Lovehoney.com for £19.99, is laced . with female pheromones believed to send men as wild as Hoffman in the . 1967 film. A spokesman for Ballerina said: ‘Pheromones send out subconscious signals to the opposite sex.’ But while pheromones are emitted in our sweat glands, style mavens may be relieved to know the stockings’ ones are synthetic. And it is not just the chaps who respond to pheromones. A study found women rated men as more attractive if a cloth soaked in male sweat was hidden nearby. Stockings have had a special sense of allure since The Graduate, where Hoffman played misanthropic young man, fresh out of college and with no direction in life. He finds himself seduced by the older Mrs Robinson, a friend on his parents, and gets drawn in to a short, if tawdry, affair. In one particularly intimate scene, Mrs Robinson - played by Ann Bancroft - slowly pulls on a pair of stockings while Hoffman watches on.","Hush Hush range by hosiery firm Ballerina laced .

Reports from advertising industry firm AdAge claims Apple is expected to launch its iTunes Radio streaming-music service in the . U.S  in September. It has also claimed that brands such as McDonald's, Pepsi and Nissan will be main advertisers through the service. Apple's iTunes Radio was announced at its  WWDC event in June and the release was tipped as being sometime in the 'Fall'. It was initially rumoured to launch at the same time as the company's new iOS 7 software in October. The site also confirms that the iPhone 5C will be slightly thicker than the current iPhone 5. Last week rumours emerged that the iPhone 5S will come in black, white and gold. A . gold option had first been suggested in May when leaked parts of the . new iPhone were shown to be markedly different from those in the current . model. Techcrunch columnist MG Siegler said he had heard by 'multiple sources' there will be a gold iPhone 5S. The current iPhone is only available in black and white. Rumours have additionally claimed that the low-cost version of the iPhone - dubbed iPhone C - will come in a range of colours including blue, yellow, red and green. Apple is expected to officially unveil its next-generation handsets at an event on the 10 September. Sources in Asia are said to have confirmed that the new iPhones, rumoured to be announced on 10 September, will be called the iPhone 5S and the iPhone C. The C is said to stand for 'colour' and a number of artists have created concept images of what the plastic handset could look like, pictured .

If the rumours are true, the iPhone C will not be the first time Apple has used plastic in its designs. The early iPhone 3G and 3GS had plastic cases but were susceptible to scratches. Apple Daily's video suggests this has been fixed and the company will use more durable plastic in future models. Elsewhere Japan's Nikkei newspaper claims the iPhone 5C and 5S will launch on September 20 in Japan - 10 days after the launch event. If this is confirmed, it's likely the phone will also launch in major markets such as the U.S and the UK at the same time. A Japanese website was among the first to claim that the successor to iPhone 5 will be called the iPhone 5S, and that the low-cost iPhone will be known as the iPhone 5C.

"By . Associated Press . An eight-year-old girl is being hailed for her quick, calm thinking after she grabbed the steering wheel and drove the family's SUV when her mother fell unconscious on their highway ride to school. Abby Porter and her mom, Shelly, were on Kanas 66 headed to her school in Riverton early on Wednesday when Shelly had a medical emergency and passed out behind the wheel, Galena Police Chief Larry Delmont said Thursday. With her mother slumped over, Abby - a second-grader whose father sometimes lets her steer their tractor and lawn mower - leaned over and took the wheel. Scroll down for video . Abby Porter, eight, bravely grabbed the wheel of her mom's car while they were driving down Route 66 after she passed out at the wheel . The little girl managed to do a U-turn on Route 66 to head in the direction of her father's home with her sick mother . She told WOAM: 'I thought I was trying to panic and then I got the idea to grab the steering wheel.' Delmont said at some point, Abby even executed a U-turn on the four-lane highway, 'because she was going home to her daddy'. 'That's at 8:37 in the morning, and there is a lot of traffic, a lot of trucks,' Delmont said. Officer Jimmy Hamilton noticed the SUV going about 20 mph and weaving a bit between the two lanes, and suspected someone was driving under the influence. As he got closer he noticed the woman slumped over in the driver seat and saw Abby at the wheel. The vehicle was also closing in on an intersection. Hamilton tried to get in front of Abby's car to slow her down, but she kept switching lanes to avoid bumping into his car. Hamilton got alongside her and told Abby to put the vehicle in park, but she didn't know how. He then told her she needed to bump into him to stop the car, but Abby said she didn't want to because she was afraid. Write caption here . Officer Jimmy Hamilton saved the day by cutting in front of the car with his patrol vehicle and bringing it to a halt. Right, the little girl's father thanked him for his efforts . He convinced Abby bumping into his car was OK. 'I never saw her cry,' Hamilton said. 'It was just the expression on her face and the tone of her voice, you could tell she was scared. But she stayed with it.' Hamilton said he positioned his car in front of the SUV, 'and she just steered right into my rear bumper, and I started applying slow pressure on my breaks until both vehicles stopped'. Emergency crews got Abby's mother to the hospital, but Delmont said he didn't know what caused her to lose consciousness. The police department in Galena, a town of about 3,000 residents about 150 miles south of Kansas City, planned to present Abby with a plaque for 'outstanding bravery in a life-threatening situation'. The little girl was keen to get to school after her brave actions - because she had a spelling test to ace. The department also plans to honor Hamilton.

"By . Damien Gayle . Tyler Schaefer and his father, Cody: The pair, who found £10,000 in a hotel room last year, won't be able to keep the cash because of an obscure law . A 10-year-old boy who found $10,000 hidden in a drawer in a Kansas City hotel room won't get to keep it even though no-one has come forward to claim the cash. Tyler Schaefer and his father Cody, from Rapid City, South Dakota, failed to comply with the tortuous requirements of a 1939 Missouri law that stipulates how to claim lost money. After finding the money, in non-consecutive $100 bills still bound in money wrappers, in May last year, Tyler and Cody immediately handed it over to police. But, according to the law, they then had to file an affidavit with a state court within 10 days stating where and when they found it. Other steps included tacking a list to the courthouse door and four other public places in the city, as well as publishing adverts in a local newspaper for three consecutive weeks. So, despite the fact that Mr Schaeffer and his son's discovery generated news headlines across America and beyond, more than meeting the spirit of the law, they failed to comply with the letter of it. Now experts say that it is unlikely that the family will be able to keep the cash, which is still sitting in a safe at the Kansas City Police Department. The police said no one has come forward to claim the large sum of money and they suspect that's because it is tied to something illicit. If an owner hasn't come forward after four more years, reports The Kansas City Star, police will hand the money over to the state treasurer's office, where it will be kep in trust forever if an owner doesn't come forward.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A California teen who fathered a baby with his high school teacher has filed a civil lawsuit against the convicted child molester and the school district where she worked. The lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of the now 18-year-old student alleges that the Redlands Unified School District and Citrus Valley High School were negligent and complicit in the victim’s abuse at the hands of 29-year-old Laura Whitehurst. ‘Children in California, children in Redlands should not be a sex toy for their teacher,’ said one of the boy’s attorneys, John Manly. Legal battle: The teenage father of former Citrus Valley High teacher Laura Whitehurst's baby, pictured here in court last July, filed a lawsuit claiming negligence . Whitehurst was arrested last July and charged with 41 counts of sex and oral copulation with a minor. Faced with a 29-year prison sentence, the former AP English teacher pleaded guilty to four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and two counts of oral copulation with a minor in exchange for the dismissal of the other charges against her. Whitehurst was sentenced to a year in prison in August, but was released last month after serving only six months. She will remain on probation for five years and must register as a sex offender for life. The plea deal also mandates that Whitehurst undergo counselling. The 29-year-old former educator gave birth last June to a daughter fathered by her student, who shares custody with her. In the 40-page lawsuit unveiled this week, the attorneys for the victim, named John BB Doe in the complaint, claim that Whitehurst's superiors had reason to believe that the woman was sexually abusing her students, but failed to alert their families and police, Courthouse News Service reported. The suit also alleges that Whitehurst’s colleague, soccer coach Sarah Seevers, knew about her illicit affair with the 16-year-old but kept mum. Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students . ‘School staff knew Whitehurst was in a . sexual relationship with the boy and they had a duty to help to protect . kids,’ said attorney Vince Finaldi. Redlands . Unified School District officials said Thursday that the allegations in . the lawsuit are ‘simply untrue,’ insisting that they contacted police . in July immediately after hearing about the relationship from the boy’s . mother. However, according . to a police search warrant, the school district acting on a tip began . looking into allegations of sexual abuse involving Whitehurst, but did . not report it to law enforcement due to lack of evidence. School . officials did question Whitehurst and the 16-year-old student about the . allegations, but the two denied any impropriety. After the woman's arrest, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst. According to the civil complaint, the relationship between Whitehurst and the student started in 2012 and lasted about a year. The . English teacher began driving the 16-year-old home from functions, . holding hands with him, and on a trip to Disneyland she told the boy she . wanted to kiss him. Soon after, the two began having sex together at the teacher's apartment, often without protection. When . Whitehurst found out she was pregnant, she insisted that her underage . lover accompany her to OB/GYN appointments because she had a ‘high-risk’ pregnancy, the lawsuit claims. Sex offender: Laura Whitehurst, a Redlands . teacher who had an affair and a baby with a 16-year-old student, pleaded . guilty to six sex counts in July . Punishment: She agreed to a sentence of one year . in jail, five years of probation and a lifetime registration as a sex . offender and sex offender counseling - but she was released last month . Admission: Whitehurst was arrested after the mother of the boy - now 18 - reported their alleged . year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police . The . teen said the teacher even called the high school principal to . excuse his absences so he could go to the doctor with her. The . lawsuit recounts how Whitehurst sent her paramour photos of her naked . body and baby bump with a message, ‘Good night daddy, I love you so . much.’ The victim, who is . now 18 years old and attends college, said the woman plied him with . alcohol and claimed that her pregnancy was a 'miracle' and the product . of  'divine intervention’ because she had thought she could not . conceive a child. On the boy's 17th birthday, Whitehurst gifted him with a Bible and took him to church, he said, . ‘Physically, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the manipulation I was subjected to,’ the young father said in court last summer, according to the Los Angeles Times. The lawsuit claims the plaintiff suffered psychological and emotional damage, and a financial loss. ‘His life is forever altered,’ Finaldi said, according to Redlands Daily Facts. The . teenage victim seeks unspecified punitive damages for negligence, . fraud, sexual battery, assault, harassment and intentional infliction of . emotional distress. In July, Whitehurst told investigators she and the father of her child began having sex at her apartment after a Disneyland trip in 2012. Another victim was a 14-year-old freshman during the time of their alleged relationship. 'The victim, now 20, told police that he and Whitehurst had sex in her classroom before school, as well as at her apartment and in her car,' a police news release stated. A third victim to come forward said . he was 16 when he had sex with Whitehurst when she was his English . teacher at Redlands High School. With child: Whitehurst, 29, gave birth in June to a baby who was fathered by a student, then aged 16 . The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as . 22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about . their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of . kissing him during a school field trip. 'I didn't have anything to say . really,' he said. 'I was like, ""Oh really, that's crazy,"" and a couple . of days later, we ended up actually kissing.' He . said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and . he spent the night. They . continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as . if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they . both knew what was going to happen, he said. 'When . it happens, you're kind of like, . all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is . into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was. 'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not . scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a . good time when it was going on.' 'Former flame': Michael Cooper, now 22, said he had sex with the teacher when he was just 16. He said that she told him she had dreamed about kissing him and they later had sex at her home . 'Lovers': Images show Cooper, then 16, and Whitehurst, then 23, at the time of their 'relationship' in 2007 . But . in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and . calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They . eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said. He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship. Cooper . has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to . press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to . encourage other victims to come forward. Whitehurst said that they had a . relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha . Crawford said during a phone interview. Safe space: Whitehurst taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley high School, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser . 'Bad teacher': Whitehurst, left in a yearbook picture, allegedly had sex with three teenage students . The . mother of the alleged victim, who is now 18, became . aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the . Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police. Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father. The educator graduated from Redlands East Valley High School and taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser. In 2010, Whitehurst was also an assistant soccer coach. She previously was a volunteer soccer coach for American Youth Soccer Organization in Redlands.

"By . Louise Cheer . Pixie the puppy was dumped alone and in agony after being shot with an air rifle by sadistic thugs. But despite having her leg amputated, the five-month-old kelpie is now making a good recovery after she was found by two teenagers in Woodridge, about 80km north of Perth. The dog is just one of 261 cases of animal cruelty seen by the RSPCA, in Western Australia. Officials say that there has been a significant increase in attacks in Western Australia since November. About two weeks ago Pixie the kelpie had her leg amputated after she was shot with air rifle . Other examples seen in just two weeks include a duck and cat who had been shot with crossbows, and a horse injured by a shotgun. Unfortunately the duck had to be euthanised, but the cat and the horse are on the mend. More...

Researchers say getting it DRUNK can double its speed - but only if it can show off to other fish . RSPCA chief inspector Amanda Swift said these attacks had a long-term and devastating effect on animals. The five-month-old was found with an injured leg by two teenage girls who were riding quad bikes about 80km north of Perth . 'No excuse or reason is acceptable for the deliberate cruelty to animals that we are seeing and those that are caught will find themselves in trouble with the law,' she said. Since November, there has been a 105 percent increase from 127 cases in the previous six-month period in WA. Incidents included dogs, cats, sheep, chickens and wildlife being been bashed, tortured, kicked or struck. Unlike some cases, Pixie had a happy ending. After being taken in by the RSPCA, X-rays revealed she had a pellet from an air rifle lodged in her left shoulder blade. She had to have her leg amputated but - to the astonishment of the RSPCA - was able to walk again just two days after surgery. She is now living with Quinns Rocks couple Terry and Sandra Williams. The couple had not planned to welcome another dog into the house after the death of their beloved 14-year-old dog Oops died. But when they heard Pixie's story they contacted the RSPCA and met her the next day. 'We knew then that she was the dog for us, she was just adorable,' Mr Williams said. 'She had all the usual naughty puppy traits, but had a very lovely nature and it was amazing to think that only 12 days prior to us seeing her that she had been found alone and in pain by two young girls who rescued her.' The Williams said Pixie was settling in well into her new home. 'Once she had settled in she got up to mischief,' Mr Williams said. This duck found near Albany in WA unfortunately did not survive after being shot by an arrow within two weeks after Pixie was found . Found in Perth, this cat luckily survived after it was shot with an arrow - one of the incidents RSPCA WA has been called to since a surge in animal cruelty numbers . 'She learned very quickly how to get up onto the kitchen bench from the couch and help herself to her dog treats. 'We were surprised how intelligent and affectionate she is and it looks like she was house trained at some point.' RSPCA WA did put out a call for witnesses to find out who shot Pixie with an air rifle, but no one has come forward. Seven cases of animal cruelty are about to go before the courts across Australia that the RSPCA classes as 'disturbing'. The RSPCA is holding its biggest fundraising event, the Million Paws Walk, across the state on Sunday. A shotgun caused the injuries to this horse found in Baldivis, south of Perth, on April 29.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. The extremely rare archive boasts almost 200 posters issued between 1914 and 1916, which hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting. They highlight the increasingly menacing tone used in the run-up to compulsory conscription in 1916 after Britain suffered so many losses on the Western Front. Hidden history: A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. These two posters from 1915 (left) and 1914 (right) hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting . Haul: Arthur Maxted inherited the collection, including this pair from 1915) from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. He kept them in his attic for 30 years and only realised their true value recently . Arthur Maxted inherited the collection from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. Mr Maxted has kept the posters in the loft of his home in Kent for the past 30 years, forgetting all about them, and only realised their true importance recently when he started researching and documenting the collection. Now, 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000. 'The posters were collected by my maternal grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war,' said 72-year-old Mr Maxted. 'It is a mystery as to why he kept hold of them, as they were not of any monetary worth back then. Collection: 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters, such as this one which urged men of all backgrounds to enlist, are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000 . Justice: These two posters feature Britannia and urge men to recall the deadly December 1914 raid by the Imperial German navy on Scarborough (left) and the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1198 lives (right) Anger: This poster (left) also recalls the sinking of the Lusitania as well as other wartime atrocities, while a 1917 design sought to remind men that others, including women and children, were doing their bit . 'My aunt passed them on to me about 30 years ago and they spent many years in my loft. 'It was only recently that I started to document them and realised they might be quite valuable.' The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops. They were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings. Change: When it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled and recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer . Mission: The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops, and were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings . The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain’s declaration of war against Germany. Many thought the war was an opportunity for adventure with friends - but when it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled. Recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer. Tragedy: Another poster with its focus on the Scarborough raid, this time showing a damaged home and a little girl left alone to care for a baby . Messages included ‘Why aren’t you in khaki? You’ll be wanted. Enlist at once’, ‘Don’t stand looking at this - go and help!’ and ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’. Others targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army. One read: 'To the women of Britain. Some of your men folk are holding back on your account. Won’t you prove your love for your Country by persuading them to go?' Target: Many posters, such as these two from 1915, targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army . Appeal: This 1915 poster (left) was also geared towards women, telling them their the safety of their children depended on men going out to fight, while another played on the insecurities of fathers who wanted to make their children proud . By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. The collection, which is only missing eight posters, is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'With an inevitability of war approaching and a shortfall in soldiers, Parliament authorised an increase in the army of half a million men in August 1914. 'As a result the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee was formed to boost the recruiting effort and part of the drive included creating posters which were put up in public places. Positive: The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain¿s declaration of war against Germany . 'Interestingly, the posters show how over time the methods and messages used to recruit men changed. 'Many of the early posters depended on patriotism. 'Early . recruits viewed the war as a great adventure which was not to be . missed, particularly as the general view was that it would all be over . by Christmas 1914. 'Initially . these methods of propaganda provided a steady stream of new recruits . but by November 1914 there was a marked decline in numbers. 'As . it became clear the war was not going to be over as quickly as first . thought, more sophisticated and sinister methods were employed. Output: By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. This poster from 1916 (right), bearing the message 'Forward', was the last printed before forced enlistment was introduced . Collection: Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions with the collection of posters. They are expected to reach £20,000 when they go up for auction on July 9 . 'The messages were much more direct and even targeted the wives and children of potential soldiers, such as the now famous ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’ 'This collection is almost complete - it includes every poster issued by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee apart from about eight. 'A collection like this is incredibly rare and serves to remind us of the iconic images used to recruit soldiers for this historic war.' The posters will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9. At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up - many of them as part of 'Pals battalions' from the same workplace, football team or friendship group. However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits. Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service. The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers. Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal. Married men were subject to conscription following the passing of a second Act in May 1916, and in 1918 a further law raised the age limit to 51. Conscripted men were not given a choice of which service, regiment or unit they joined. However, if they expressed a preference to join the Navy then it had first refusal on whether to take him. Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Spared jail: Commando Adam Karmali, 33, bit the head off a pigeon during an all-day drinking session, a court has heard . A Royal Marine bit the head off a pigeon during an all-day drinking session, a court has heard. Commando Adam Karmali, 33, sunk his teeth into the bird as he drank lager with friends near the banks of the River Taff in Bute Park, Cardiff. He was caught after police carried out forensic tests on the headless pigeon's body - and discovered his DNA on its neck. Now, the soldier has been handed a 12-month community order after admitting a charge of 'not taking all reasonable steps to ensure the needs of an animal he was responsible for were met'. Karmali, who lives in Wimborne, Dorset, had been visiting the Welsh capital with friends when he captured the pigeon in the park, Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard. He then posed for pictures with the live bird’s head in his mouth, before biting it off and spitting it on to the ground. A female passerby was so horrified that she phoned police, who arrived to find the headless pigeon lying in the grass, the court heard. Officers later carried out forensic tests on the pigeon - and discovered Karmali's DNA on teethmarks around the bird's neck. Mike Curry, prosecuting, said: 'This was a sickening offence carried out while drunk. 'Karmali captured a pigeon and put it in his mouth and as the group took pictures he bit its head off. 'A . witness was so appalled police were contacted, the remains were . recovered and a DNA match was discovered which led him to being . arrested.' When interviewed by police, Karmali . told officers he had drunk around 20 cans of lager and had thought it was a 'prank' at the time. 'Sickening offence': Karmali (left) sunk his teeth into the bird (file picture, right) as he drank lager with friends near the banks of the River Taff in Bute Park, Cardiff. He was caught after police discovered his DNA on its body . Monique McKevitt, defending, said that biting the head off a pigeon was 'clearly an unacceptable and repulsive act'. But she said that Karmali faced being expelled out of the forces if he was given a prison sentence for the crime. 'There will be . internal disciplinary procedures not only for the act itself but for . bringing the Royal Marines reputation into disrepute,' she said. Sentenced: After capturing the pigeon in the park, the soldier posed for photos with the live bird's head, before biting it off and spitting it on to the ground. Above, Karmali is pictured with a shark in Australia two years ago . 'He would never normally behave that way and he feels extreme remorse and shame.' Magistrates’ panel chairman Robert Cozens told Karmali that biting the head off a pigeon was punishable by prison. However, he agreed that the Commando should be spared jail because it would end his career. Sentencing Karmali, Mr . Cozens told him: 'We have taken great consideration over this and we . consider the serious and pretty awful offence as having passed the . custody threshold. Guilty: He has now been handed a 12-month community order and told to complete 150 hours' unpaid work . 'However, we have heard from your Captain you have a good military record and that this is out of character. 'Because of your early guilty plea and the remorse you have shown we have brought your sentence down a level.' Karmali was also ordered to complete 150 hours' unpaid work.","Adam Karmali, 33, posed for photos with the pigeon's head in his mouth .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . The names of alleged student rapists at Columbia University have been shared by students in on-campus bathrooms - less than a month after 23 students collectively filed federal complaints against the university for mishandling sexual assault cases. Four students' names were written inside a Hamilton Hall bathroom stall and leaked to the Columbia Lion last Thursday by a tipster. The paper says that those names were listed in 'four distinct styles of handwriting, which suggests multiple authors.' Scroll down for video . List: The names of four alleged student rapists appeared inside a Hamilton Hall bathroom at Columbia University, pictured . The alleged rapists' names were quickly removed by facilities staff, who deemed it 'graffiti,' according to the report. However, the same names were found written in a Lerner Hall bathroom stall on Monday that appeared to be written by only one person, the Lion reports. Though a tipster sent in an image of the list at 5:30pm, the names had been removed within the hour. Less than 24 hours later, an identical list of alleged rapists' names appeared inside women's bathrooms on both the second and sixth floors of Butler Hall, the Lion reports. The sixth floor Butler Hall list was reportedly written in the same silver marker as the Lerner Hall list. As of this writing, the names are reportedly visible in the sixth-floor stall. The list of alleged rapists appeared in bathrooms inside Lerner Hall, left, and Butler Hall, right . Flyers of the rapists' names were also distributed in toilet paper containers and photos of them were leaked to Jezebel. The flyers list one 'serial rapist,' as well as three rapists 'found ""responsible"" by the University.' The students include 'a musician, a prominent writer for a campus publication, and a varsity athlete' and are current students, Jezebel says. Jezebel's information coincides with a statement that campus news site Bwog released Monday, which says a member of their editorial staff agreed to resign over allegations. 'On May 7, allegations that a member of our staff had violated Columbia University’s Gender Based Misconduct policy were brought to our attention by an anonymous tip,' it says. 'As a reiteration of our continued work against rape culture, we have taken steps to ensure that the makeup of Bwog’s staff, without question, reflects this. Accordingly, we asked this staffer to permanently and immediately resign from their position, and they agreed.' The lists come just weeks after 23 Columbia and Barnard students filed a 100-page federal complaint against the University on April 24, citing Title IX, Title II and Clery Act violations, the Columbia Spectator reported at the time. In the wake of the allegations, nearly 100 faculty and staff members signed a letter on Bwog that supported the students' complaints.","The names of alleged student rapists have been shared by students in bathrooms at Hamilton, Lerner and Butler halls .

"By . Louise Cheer . The hunt is on for a violent duo who are terrorising motorists by impersonating police, using a red and blue flashing phone app to trick drivers into pulling over, and then assaulting them. The pair, thought to have carried out three roadside attacks, attach the device to the car. All three attacks have been carried out in the Gold Coast area over the period of 12 days. The phone app, similar to the one pictured on the right, is meant to give the illusion of the red and blue flashing lights on top of a police car . The most recent was on Enid Ave at Southport on Thursday at 4.30am. Earlier incidents happened on Christine Avenue at Varsity Lakes on May 11 about 4pm and another on Bundall Road on the Gold Coast on May 3 about 10pm. More...

Mr Hicks pulled over on Enid Ave and wound down his window when a car behind him started flashing red and blue lights. He thought it was a police officer performing a random breath test. Terry Hicks (pictured here late last year) fought off his attacker early Thursday morning after he was pulled over by a man posing as a police officer . Before the 24-year-old could turn around to see his male attacker he was hit three times in the neck with a Taser-like weapon. The attacker also yelled 'obscenities' at him. But Mr Hicks caught the man off guard when he plucked up the courage to fight back and make his escape. 'I leaned back over the passenger side and kicked the man through the driver’s side window,' he said. 'He stumbled back and I repositioned myself in the driver’s seat. 'I shifted into drive and drove away at a fast pace and I called 000.' The car that pulled Mr Hicks over was a white 4WD dual cab utility with a silver bull bar. In the incident on Christine Avenue, an off-duty police officer was left unharmed when he was pulled over by a blue Holden Commodore sedan as the driver sped off before he approached the officer's vehicle. A red and blue strobe light was attached to the grill of the stolen Commodore. This followed an incident on Bundall Avenue where a 54-year-old woman and her male passenger were pulled over after a siren sounded and they saw red and blue flashing lights. A man approached the driver's window and started yelling at her before a second man approached the car. The passenger then had a brief conversation with both men before he was punched in the face by one of them. Queensland Police are on the hunt for at least two men in relation to the three incidents . The pair then took off in a silver blue car. The 64-year-old passenger had bruising and swelling to his eye. Mr Hicks said these attacks made him lose faith in society. 'It has made me distrust any red and blue lights I see and I don’t think I would be too comfortable going past the same area in a while,' he said. 'I went to hospital after this and I was luckily to receive no injuries except slight bruising to the neck. 'I don't understand how someone could come out and do this to someone and do this for no reason. 'The officers and doctors said luckily I did what I did or I would have received more fatal injuries.'","Impersonators are attaching the device to the front of the vehicle .

"By . James Chapman . Education Secretary Michael Gove dismissed claims state schools are 'amoral' as nonsense . A private schools boss has been condemned by Michael Gove for claiming state schools are turning out ‘amoral’ children. The . Education Secretary reacted with fury after Richard Walden, chair of . the Independent Schools Association, suggested many state school pupils . end up with no sense of right and wrong. Mr . Gove told the Daily Mail he was speaking ‘nonsense’ and said private . school heads increasingly fear their sector is threatened by . fast-improving state education. Mr . Walden claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a . ‘moral compass’ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better . academic results. Too many . state school staff operated in ‘a climate of fear’ which meant they . failed to provide children with an enriching education, he added. Fee-paying . schools devote more time to extra-curricular activities, a broad . curriculum and personal, social, health and economic development – . meaning their students were able to ‘distinguish the good from the bad . and the true from the false’. Mr . Walden, head of £6,867-a-year Castle House School in Shropshire, which . caters for two to 11-year-olds, made his provocative claims in a keynote . speech to fellow heads at his association’s annual conference in . Warwickshire. ‘Schools are . turning out too many amoral children because teachers cannot find the . time to teach the difference between right and wrong,’ he said. ‘It . seems that the only results that matter are those which have created . added value in terms of raising a pupil’s statistical level from one . stage to the next, and parents are increasingly buying in to this . notion.’ But Mr Gove . insisted: ‘This is nonsense. State schools are getting better in every . respect – from delivering a more rigorous education to ensuring children . leave school with the right values. ‘Only . a few weeks ago, the head of the independent King’s College School in . Wimbledon admitted state schools are improving so fast they are . increasingly becoming a threat to private schools. ‘When . I visit a school which gets great academic results it is always the . case that everything else about the school is also brilliant; the sport, . the community involvement, the best drama. Wasting talent, by telling . millions of pupils that academic success is not for them, would be truly . amoral.’ Richard Walden claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a ¿moral compass¿ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results (file picture) The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) questioned the . values being instilled by private schools – claiming they had turned . out many pupils who had gone on to work in the City and helped cause the . financial crash. Russell . Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, said: ‘I don't think there is . evidence to support an amoral generation emerging from our schools. In . many ways, the coming generation has higher standards than our own. Indeed, one has only to look at sectors with high proportions of . publicly-schooled people – like those who led us into the financial . crash – to doubt the truth of this proposition. ‘Values . are not just found in the curriculum but in the way you teach the . curriculum, in the behaviour policies and code of conduct, in the way . adults treat children and each other. Teachers in state schools would . love time for greater breadth and extra- curricular activity, but they . are teaching strong values nonetheless.’ A . Department for Education spokesman said: ‘All schools should provide a . broad education and have a duty to promote the wellbeing of their . pupils. Our reforms will reduce the number of tests that children take . and have given teachers the freedom to use their professional judgement . to tailor lessons. ‘We are . also giving all schools more freedom to offer extra-curricular . activities that will build character. These include sports matches, . debating competitions, cadet training and inspirational careers talks . from outside visitors. We want more schools to take up these freedoms.’","Education Secretary hits back at independent school head Richard Walden.

"By . Mark Duell . A mother today revealed her shock at how her 'micro' pig - who weighed just 7lbs when she bought him four years ago - has grown at such a rapid rate that he is now a whopping 21-stone beast. Donna Davidson, 46, of Leicester, bought Taz when he was tiny - but he kept on growing, to tip the scales at more than 300lbs and only just fitting in her small garden. Now, Leicester City Council has declared that Taz is officially classed as a farmyard animal - and after receiving complaints from neighbours, officials have told Miss Davidson that Taz has to go. Whopping size: Donna Davidson, of Leicester, watched Taz grow over four years to weigh more than 300lbs . Early days: When Ms Davidson bought Taz he only weighed 7lbs - and was sold to her as a 'micro-deluxe' pig . Under threat: The 46-year-old woman has been told by Leicester City Council that Taz the pig has to go . She said: ‘When I bought him he only weighed 7lbs and was sold to me as a micro-deluxe. He was smaller than my Jack Russell. It's clear now that's not the case but I still love him. ‘In fact, the bigger the pig, the more there is to love. I'll never give him up. I don't look at him like an animal - he's a part of the family. I treat him like he's one of my children.’ Miss Davidson is looking for a new council home for her and her son, 20, and his brother, 21, but she cannot go on the waiting list for most authorities as she does not already live in the area. Another stumbling block is that many private landlords are concerned that her other pets - three dogs, two ferrets and two tortoises - might be a threat to any animals on nearby farmland. But Miss Davidson has vowed to never give up Taz and refuses to leave him behind. The pampered pig even has toys and loves his children's music box which plays a song that he goes to sleep to. Animals at play: Taz, pictured as a baby with Syril the dog, is now 'part of the family', his owner insisted . Having a rest: Taz with Ms Davidson's son Thomas, 20. The pig now only just fits in her small garden . She added: ‘Looking for a new place to live for all of us is a nightmare. I've applied to every single council in Leicestershire and had no luck so now I'm searching further afield. ‘I'm hoping I might have a better chance . somewhere rural places in the middle of nowhere that will let me keep my . animals. I'm an animal lover and I've got to keep us all together. 'The bigger the pig, the more there is to love. I'll never give him up. I don't look at him like an animal - he's a part of the family' Donna Davidson . ‘There's not an animal on this planet that I don't like but I've loved pigs since I was a small child. He's got a baby's music box with colourful buttons and he presses them at night to get a song. If the music finishes before he's asleep, he pushes the buttons again. He absolutely loves music.’ A council spokesman said: ‘We visited this tenant after a complaint about animals at the property and advised her that keeping farm animals is a breach of her tenancy agreement. We will revisit next week to assess the situation. 'Our focus is on encouraging this tenant to find a suitable home for the pig and we have not yet started eviction proceedings. We are trying to rehome the pig.’","Donna Davidson, 46, bought Taz four years ago when he weighed 7lbs .

"By . Australian Associated Press . An Adelaide man has been refused bail after allegedly attacking a cabin crew attendant on a flight to Sydney. Andrew Nankivell, 30, is accused of launching the drunken assault during a flight from the Gold Coast on Thursday night between 7:30 and 7:45pm. The incident caused the pilot to send an emergency radio transmission and police arrested Nankivell at Sydney domestic terminal after the aircraft landed as scheduled. Andrew Nankivell, 30, could face up to 10 years in prison for launching a drunken assault on cabin crew during a flight from the Gold Coast to Sydney on Thursday night . The butcher and father of one from Findon, in Adelaide's west, appeared at Sydney's Central Local Court on Friday afternoon charged with assaulting the cabin crew staffer, endangering aircraft safety and offensive and disorderly behaviour on an aircraft. The offences, if proved, carry a combined jail term of more than 10 years. Federal police allege Nankivell was disruptive on the flight after becoming intoxicated, before he became abusive towards members of the crew and launching an assault against the attendants. Magistrate John Bailey heard that he has a number previous convictions for alcohol and violence-related offences. He refused a bail application that would have allowed Nankivell to travel back to Adelaide, where he has joint custody of his six-year-old daughter. 'The accused has been charged with some serious offences,' Mr Bailey told the court. 'Acting like that within an aircraft puts other people at some risk and it's a matter of some great concern. 'I've no doubt this came about because of the intoxication of the accused. 'If we look at his record interstate there are matters of violence on his record, there are also matters in relation to alcohol.' The case was adjourned until June 25. The incident has come after a number of other recent mid-air drama's, including the restraining and arrest of a man on a Virgin Australia flight to Bali from Brisbane. Matt Christopher Lockley, 28, sparked fears of a hijacking after he began banging on the door of the cockpit, mistaking it for a bathroom in late April.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They are best known for singing about combine harvesters and cider. Now The Wurzels have been inspired by a more recent feature of rural life – wind turbines. And with a lyric that runs: ‘They’re noisy, they’re ugly and no one wants them here’, the so-called Scrumpy and Western group have made it clear just what they think of them. The Mendip Windfarm Song, the band’s first single in three years, was written after developers revealed proposals for a 220ft turbine close to The Wurzels’ base in Norton St Philip, Somerset. West Country rockers The Wurzels have released their first single in years - a protest song about a wind farm . A spokesman for the group, formed by the late Adge Cutler in 1966, said the protest song – available to download on iTunes – highlighted the proliferation of turbines across the countryside. The song is also a tribute to Wurzels’ founder who died 40 years ago this year. He was responsible for great songs as the 1976 number one hit ‘Combine Harvester’, and the number three hit ‘I Am a Cider Drinker’. Adge died after falling asleep at the wheel of his MGB sports car which overturned on a roundabout approaching the Severn Bridge. The Wurzels have decided to return to Adge’s style of involving observations of life in the Westcountry with ‘The Mendip Windfarm Song’. The Mendip Windfarm Song, the band's first single in three years, was written after developers revealed proposals for a 220ft turbine close to The Wurzels' base in Norton St Philip, Somerset . It is aimed at highlighting the . proliferation of proposals for wind turbines across the Westcountry, and . the UK, which the cider-fuelled songsters say are 'disregarding the . views of the local communities they are imposed upon'. The singers tell how one 'warm and misty morning a note dropped through my door, with a proposal for a wind farm thing'. It goes on: 'They wind farms they be all across the Mendips. You’ll see them from Wells and Stanton Drew?.they are noisy, they’re ugly and no-one wants them here.' And they plead: 'I understand the argument for greener energy, but save our countryside for you and me' as a cow adds its own mournful mooing plea in the background. A spokesman for the group, formed by the late Adge Cutler in 1966, said the protest song - available to download on iTunes - highlighted the proliferation of turbines across the countryside . Sil Willcox, a spokesman for the band said: 'Renewable energy has to be considered as an important part of the make-up of our energy solutions. 'However imposing these cost inefficient turbines on communities after they have been opposed by local parishes and refused by planners seems very unfair and undemocratic. 'It seems that the Government have lost their will to support onshore wind farms and the general public are unhappy to fund the huge subsidies we are forced to pay to finance them. So why are the inspectorates still allowed to overturn local views and decisions?' The Mendip Windfarm Song is available to download on iTunes from May 11.","The Mendip Windfarm Song is the band’s first single in three years .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A homeless man who murdered someone he had met only the previous day and provided accommodation for him and his dog has been jailed for at least 17 years. Phillip John Smith was convicted of murder and arson in February after a trial in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The court heard Smith was living on the streets in June 2012 when he met Damien Noakes, who offered him a couch at a friend's Mosman Park unit in Perth's west, where he was then living. Mr Noakes allowed Smith to bring his dog with him and they spent the first night together drinking. Phillip John Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 17 years without being eligible for parole . The next day, they caught a train to Fremantle where they hocked goods to get more money for alcohol. When they returned to the unit, they continued drinking and Smith became teary and emotional. 'You think it was because you were talking about your daughter,' Justice Stephen David Hall said during sentencing on Thursday. 'The deceased told you to snap out of it and stop crying. You said that he took you by the ears and shook your head. 'You accept that this was probably well intended but you say that from that point until some point later that evening you have no memory of what happened.' Smith then launched a violent attack on Mr Noakes, using a blunt instrument to hit him repeatedly on the head, face and arms. He also repeatedly stabbed him in the back and neck, and cut the achilles tendon on his left leg. Smith testified that his next memory was standing over the deceased covered in blood. He then set the unit on fire and left. When Mr Noakes' body was found, the knife was still in his neck. Justice Hall said there was no evidence to suggest Smith was acting in self-defence or the victim was armed or threatened him in any way. 'This was not a premeditated murder; you did not plan to kill the deceased,' Justice Hall said. 'It was essentially motiveless. 'It was a frenzied attack.' Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 17 years before being eligible for parole.

"By . Sally Lee . Richard Simpkin has been mastering the art of selfies with celebrities long before social media and the invention of camera phones. The Sydney born photographer has an impressive collection of self portraits with the rich and famous - having met the likes of Michael Jackson, Michael Hutchence, Kylie Minogue, Audrey Hepburn and Oprah Winfrey. But after 25 years on the job, he's calling it quits. Almost famous: Richard Simpkin has brushed shoulders with celebrities for 25 years including the king of pop Michael Jackson in 1996 . 'It's been a lot of fun and a great adventure but I'm glad I don't have to do it anymore,' he said. 'Celebrities today are not what they used to be. I think they're more like throw away plastics now. 'The word celebrity has lost its value and it's cheapened over the years.' It all started when 15-year-old Simpkin's friend showed him photo of her father with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1989. 'I went and bought myself a camera straight away and knew I was onto something,' he said. 'From then on, I got a 20 year head start from everyone else and taking photos with these big names.'

The star snapper reminisced on some of the most memorable moments and said Michael Jackson was one of his best. Having said that, the 40-year-old is also getting a taste of fame.

"Australian men now have the third highest life expectancy in the world, according to a new report published by the World Health Organisation. That doesn't necessarily give blokes bragging rights over Australian women - with women still outliving their male counterparts by an average four-point-one years. But one leading Australian researcher has warned that planned cuts to health funding could spell an end to Australia's life expectancy rates. Third highest life expectancy: Australian men born in 2012 are expected to live until the age of 80.5 years, placing them just below Iceland and Switzerland on the rankings . The figures, which show increased life expectancy across the world, are for children born in 2012. Iceland tops the table at 81.2 years for men, while Japanese women are expected to live the longest at 87 years. For people in richer countries, fewer people dying from heart disease and stroke before their 60th birthday can be credited for longer life expectancy rates. In poorer countries, the increase can be credited to fewer children dying before their fifth birthday. Iceland - 81.2Switzerland - 80.7Australia - 80.5Israel - 80.2Singapore - 80.2New Zealand - 80.2Italy - 80.2Japan - 80Sweden - 80Luxembourg - 79.7 . Japan - 87Spain - 85.1Switzerland - 85.1Singapore - 85.1Italy - 85France - 84.9Australia - 84.6Republic of Korea - 84.6Luxembourg - 84.1*Portugal/New Zealand - 84 . The main reason for Australia's high placing is it's quality of life, according to Professor Sharon Friel, director of the Menzies Centre for Health Policy at the Australian National University. 'Australia has very good social conditions, relative to other countries - which are very important to people's health and wellbeing,' Professor Friel told Mail Online. Additionally, Professor Friel credits Australia's good quality drinking water, very good sanitation, abundance of fresh food availability and the way our built environments are designed for the high quality of life. But paramount to Australia's quality of life is it's universal healthcare system. 'Access to healthcare is commonplace across Australia - so we have been the envy of the world partly for that reason,' she said. Doing well, but possibly not for much longer: Professor Sharon Friel has warned that despite their current high placing, Australia could drop if planned preventative health funding cuts were to go ahead . Professor Friel believes the government should be celebrating the social policies that have supported people in a way that's good for their health and leading to longer life expectancy rates. However, she's warned that if the Federal Government goes ahead with planned cuts to health funding, these figures might not hold up in a few years time. 'Internationally the evidence tells us the focus on primary healthcare and preventative health is the most effective and financially efficient way to do this,' she said.","Australian men ranked third place for life expectancy, living to 80.5 years .

"By . Kate Lyons . A Brisbane woman who indicated on her Centrelink form that she was in a 'friends with benefits' relationship with her housemate will be able to keep receiving Centrelink payments, a tribunal has ruled. The welfare agency tried to deny the 46-year-old woman her carer's allowance, because it believed she was in a romantic and financially dependent relationship with her housemate, with whom she admitted she sometimes had sex. This decision was overruled today by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Brisbane, who decreed that 'friends with benefits' did not count as a relationship and therefore the woman should have received her payments in full. A woman was refused Centrelink payments to pay for the care of her sick mother, because she wrote on the Centrelink form that she was in a 'friends with benefits' relationship with her housemate . The woman, known as Ms T, claimed an allowance in 2012 when she became the carer for her sick mother. Centrelink ruled she was ineligible because it believed that Mr D, her housemate, was Ms T's live-in-lover, meaning their combined income put her over the threshold to receive payments. Ms T appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal claiming that while they sometimes slept together, she and Mr D were not exclusive and she often met other men through online dating sites for 'physical companionship'. She told the court that at the age of 46, with two failed relationships in her past, she wanted to 'enjoy her life', reported the Sydney Morning Herald. The tribunal ruled in favour of the woman, who claimed that since she and her housemate weren't committed she should keep receiving payments . Tribunal member Peter Wulf said that since Ms T and Mr D had separate rooms in the house, were financially independent and had no joint assets, there was no reason to believe they were in a relationship. 'Importantly, it was noted that at no time did Mr D support Ms T,' he said. He added that Ms T's openness about seeing other men also indicated the couple were not in a de facto relationship. 'When considering a normal de facto relationship it would be unusual, in the tribunal's opinion, for such actions to occur with such regularity.' However, Mr Wulf said Centrelink's confusion was understandable, because when filling out her forms Ms T indicated that she was part of a couple. In the section of the form where the applicant can indicate if they are married or de facto, Ms T wrote: 'friends with benefits.' The tribunal, which met at the Commonwealth Law Courts in Brisbane (pictured) ruled that Ms T should be paid the full amount, because she wasn't in a committed relationship with her housemate and he did not support her financially .","Woman, 46, applied for carer's benefits when her mother became sick .

"By . Sarah Michael . Queenslanders have reported seeing a large, flaming ball of light tear through the night sky before crashing to earth near Townsville on Thursday night. Astronomers are trying to locate the mysterious space object, which had a blue and orange tail and came down in the north Queensland city about 6.30pm (AEST). Residents from Cunnamulla, in state's southwest, and people located more than 1000km away in Townsville in the north, have reported seeing the object. Townsville residents saw a mysterious space object with a blue and orange tail (pictured bottom right) tear through the sky and crash to earth on Thursday night. This photo was taken at 6.52pm loosing east from Teltra Hill in Mount Isa . Kim Vuga, a 45-year-old public servant, was on the back veranda at her home in the southern Townsville suburb of Kelso when she saw the object hit the earth. 'It was like the sun falling out of the sky with a big flame behind it,' Ms Vuga told MailOnline. 'A big ball of fire which was really bright with the biggest, reddest fire flame behind it. 'It was quite amazing, it was like an atomic bomb effect [when it hit], everything lit back up again.' Ms Vuga said she knew the exact south-west direction from her home to the spot on earth where it impacted, but she did not know the distance. 'I didn't hear anything so that's another clue as to how far away it was,' she said. 'It's fallen out of the sky into a rural area.' Townsville resident Terry Robinson said it was an awe-inspiring sight, the ABC reported. 'It was pretty big and this thing hit like a bomb. It was huge,' he told the broadcaster. 'I don't know how big it was. In the sky, it looked like half a dozen jumbo jets were falling out of the sky at the same time.' Sunshine Coast astronomer Owen Bennedick is trying to locate the object, which he believes is a satellite not a meteor. 'It was probably a satellite re-entering the atmosphere, because of the multiple colours that were seen and how big an area it was actually seen over,' Mr Bennedick told MailOnline. 'It was big so that means it was going slowly.' Mr Bennedick, from Wappa Falls Observatory in Yandina, said meteors can travel at speeds of up to 100km per second, but satellites only travel between 5km and 7km per second. He is appealing to witnesses to come forward with information. 'If it actually hit the ground and made a flash then people within I would suggest 5 to 7km would hear it,' he said. 'If it hit the ground it would make a fairly hard bang.' Police said officers in Townsville had received just one report about the incident, and had made inquiries to ensure it wasn't an aviation accident. Beyond that, they can't shed any light on the mystery. Witnesses can contact Mr Bennedick on 0427467944.","Townsville residents saw ball of light fly through sky on Thursday .

"By . Sara Smyth . Hundreds of British tourists are being flown home from Kenya by their travel operators after the Foreign Office warned of terror threats. As many as 400 Britons travelling with Thomson and First Choice are thought to be affected by the change in official safety advice over visiting the country. The holiday companies said they were cancelling flights to Mombasa – Kenya’s second largest city – until at least the end of October. British tourists in the Kenyan coastal resort of Mombasa, pictured have been told to pack up and leave . Holidaymakers are being advised to avoid the tourist areas in Mombasa, pictured, due to a growing terror threat . According to reports they have about 400 customers in the country who have been told to pack up mid-holiday and travel back to the airport in an organised convoy under armed guard. Last night, a source at a Thompson beach resort in Kenya confirmed that British tourists were preparing to leave the complex yesterday and will be flying home today. The Foreign Office has warned against all non-essential travel to Mombasa Island, on which part of the city of Mombasa lies. Holidaymakers are also being advised to avoid the surrounding area, but not including the tourist areas of Diani or Moi international airport which serves the city. Tourists said British travellers booked with other companies were not being evacuated. The Foreign Office advice reads: ‘There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. The main threat comes from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group that has carried out attacks in response to Kenya’s military intervention in Somalia. ‘There has been a spate of small-scale grenade, bomb and armed attacks in Nairobi (especially the area of Eastleigh), Mombasa, and North Eastern Province. Earlier this month, a bombing at a bus shelter in Mombasa killed three people and injured a further 16 . ‘You should take care in public places where people gather, and exercise a heightened level of vigilance.’ Andy Coughlan, a musician from Swansea, was on a luxury holiday with his wife Irena, 53, to celebrate news that her breast cancer had gone into remission. The couple, who arrived on Tuesday morning, said they were disappointed and don’t understand why their dream holiday has been cut short. Although their hotel is outside the new alert zone, they are being evacuated. ‘We’re absolutely devastated,’ Mr Coughlan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘Ren had been seriously ill for a long time and this was the first time after all the chemo that she was ready to travel. ‘She said she wanted to wait for her hair to grow back. As soon as it did, we were on our way here. Now we have to turn around and go back again, and it seems for absolutely crazy reasons.’ It is thought that al Qaeda-linked Somali group al Shabaab was behind the attack . Mrs Coughlan said: ‘We were supposed to be going on safari today, but instead we’re being told to pack and go back to England. ‘I can’t believe it’s happening. I’ve been looking forward to this holiday for such a long time.’ In the last few days the Kenyan government has pledged to step up security for tourists following a number of terrorist-related incidents. The Foreign Office said they estimated that around 5,500 Britons currently in the area would be affected and no one else should travel to the area until further notice. In its advisory, the Foreign Office said: ‘We advise against all but essential travel to Mombasa Island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek in the north to Tiwi in the south. If you are currently in an area to which we now advise against all but essential travel, you should consider whether you have an essential reason to remain. If not, you should leave the area.’","Up to 400 Britons travelling with Thomson and First Choice are affected .

"By . Adam Duggan . Its nickname, the City of Churches, doesn't exactly conjure up images of a fast-paced 24/7 city but it seems international visitors can't get enough of Adelaide. The city has just been voted the best city in Australia - the latest accolade for the South Australian capital. Adelaide narrowly beat Hobart, followed Melbourne in third - with Sydney ranked seventh among reviewers, just beating top-end city Darwin. Scroll down for video . Not just churches anymore: Despite being known as the 'City of Churches', many international publications have started placing Adelaide on lists of places to visit . Last year, Adelaide came in ninth on Lonely Planet's top 10 cities to visit in 2014 - the only Australian city to be included, and beating Auckland as the best city in the Asia-Pacific region. Declaring Adelaide as 'effortlessly chic', the travel guide company noted the city's recent attempts at rejuvenation. Every commendation Adelaide has received in the past 18-months is quick to note the city's proximity to Australia's famed Barossa Valley - one of the country's key wine regions. 'Like a perfectly cellared red, it’s ready to be uncorked and sampled,' the Lonely Planet list claims. Barossa Valley: South Australia's Barossa Valley is a key Australian wine region and lies only 40 minutes outside of Adelaide . Who knew Adelaide was famous for the beaches? The beaches of South Australia have been highlighted as worth visiting by several publications . Adelaide (South Australia) - 4.15/5Hobart (Tasmania) - 4.11/5Melbourne (Victoria) - 4.02/5Brisbane (Queensland) - 4.00/5Perth (Western Australia) - 3.99/5Canberra (ACT) - 3.96/5Sydney (New South Wales) - 3.94/5Darwin (Northern Territory) - 3.88/5 .

Meanwhile, two US publications - New York magazine and the Chicago Tribune - wrote glowing reviews of the South Australian capital in 2013. 'Adelaide has eclectic cuisine, idyllic beaches, Shiraz wineries, and kangaroo-spotting galore—but with a fraction of the tourists and for a whole lot cheaper,' Alexa Tsoulis-Reay wrote in a New York magazine article titled 'Adelaide Instead of Sydney' in October of last year. The magazine's main claim that Adelaide trumps Sydney as being the best city: it has 'a fraction of the tourists' and is 'a whole lot cheaper' than visiting the eastern Australian capitals that dominate tourism tables in terms of actual visitors. Another controversial claim in the magazine is that Adelaide is Australia's equivalent to US hipster capital Portland. Despite the latest poll, by tourism website Wotif.com, many Australians would disagree, claiming that Melbourne - with it's coffee culture, laneway bars and active live music scene - would certainly be considered the 'hipster capital'. Kangaroo's everywhere: The Chicago Tribune noted South Australia's Kangaroo Island as a key region to visit Adelaide . The Festival City: Adelaide's Festival Centre is a key part of the city's rejuvenation process . Similarly, the Chicago Tribune featured Kangaroo Island as another key region to visit Adelaide. 'Just offshore, Kangaroo Island teams with kangaroos, penguins and sea lions, and from June to October its waters are inhabited by southern right whales,' wrote Peter Ferry in April, 2013. While magazines, tourist guides and hotel booking website may be ranking Adelaide as Australia's most popular city, the claim would definitely be refuted by official tourist figures by Austrade agency Tourism Research Australia. Despite coming first in the Wotif.com survey, South Australia comes in fifth based on actual tourist traffic to the state. Having come in second-last in this survey, Sydney (and New South Wales) can breathe a sigh of relief - in terms of actual tourist figures, it's still number one. Sydney still number one: Despite coming in seventh on Wotif.com's hotel ranking list, New South Wales is still the number one state in terms on actual tourist numbers - followed by Queensland (Brisbane Town Hall pictured left) Third and fourth: Victoria (Melbourne's Flinders Street Station pictured left) and Western Australia (Perth's Swan Bells pictured right) are ranked third and fourth, according to official tourism figures .","Quality of hotels make City of Churches best-ranked city in Australia .

"By . Kate Lyons . Sarah Monahan, the Hey Dad! actor who accused Robert Hughes of sexual assault, has described how late model Charlotte Dawson was one of the few people who stood by her after she came forward with public accusations against the actor. Ms Monahan, 37, was six-years-old when she joined the popular television programme and alleges that Hughes began exposing himself to her when she was 10. The 65-year-old actor is due to be sentenced today for 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991. Scroll down for video . Sarah Monahan has blasted her 'faux friends' for deserting her after she went public with accusations against Robert Hughes in 2010 . Sarah Monahan revealed that late model Charlotte Dawson contacted her in February, less than two weeks before she committed suicide, to wish her well for Robert Hughes's trial . Ms Monahan revealed in a blog post on Tuesday, Faux Friends And Real, that for the last four years she felt 'completely alone, except for Simone [Buchanan]'. 'But everyone else? Not a peep. Not a tweet, text, email, poke or even old fashioned snail mail,' she wrote. 'Funny though, how people keep popping their heads up, to say how much they care; when there's an interview opportunity.' Ms Monahan went on to reveal she had support from some of her more famous friends, including entertainment reporter Peter Ford, Kyle and Jackie O producer Matt Simpson, and model Charlotte Dawson, who committed suicide in February. 'Charlotte Dawson used to regularly send me messages, privately. The last message I got from her was on the 10th of February. It was the first day of the trial… Charlotte remembered… and let me know she was thinking of me,' she wrote. Robert Hughes is due to be sentenced today for 10 counts of sexual assault . Ms Monahan wrote this week that she has felt completely alone except for the support of Simone Buchanan (pictured here with her son Tane), who played Ms Monahan's sister on Hey Dad! Ms Monahan revealed allegations of Hughes's abuse in 2010 to Woman's Day, and then again on A Current Affair. Her interviews reinvigorated public interest in the case, but led to criticism that she had gone to the media and not the police with the story. She appeared on A Current Affair again in April this year after Hughes had been convicted of 10 child sexual assault charges. In the most recent interview she told A Current Affair that she 'got away lightly' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict. Ms Monahan, who currently lives in the U.S. where she is a a member of the Texas State Guard. She also works with US-based agency Minor Consideration, which advocates on behalf of child actors. At the sentencing submissions for Robert Hughes in Sydney’s Downing Centre Court on May 3, Ms Monahan’s victim statement revealed the she may never be able to return to Australia as a result of the abuse she suffered at Hughes' hands decades ago. 'I have come to hate the word dad,' her statement read. 'I learned that anyone in a position of power was free to do as they pleased. I have flashbacks to Robert... He made me think the world was a cold, evil place. 'I'm 37 years old and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.' Ms Monahan (front right) joined the cast of Hey Dad! at the age of six, and claims she was just 10 when Robert Hughes started exposing himself to her .","Sarah Monahan wrote a blog post slamming 'faux friends' who are only interested in her to get media attention .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A deputy headteacher could be struck off after being accused of ‘chatting up’ a sixth form pupil by asking her if she liked ‘bald older men’ after she said she fancied Hollywood actor Bruce Willis. A disciplinary hearing yesterday heard that science teacher Alun Rees was ‘creepy’ and that he offered the female pupil private maths tuition – even though it wasn’t his subject. The 48-year-old drove the girl, known only as pupil A, home after the session and allegedly asked her what kind of men she ‘goes for’. The General Teaching Council for Wales was told how she replied that she liked Bruce Willis and George Clooney and the teacher said: ‘You like older bald men then?’ Hearing: Deputy headteacher Alun Rees, described at a hearing as 'creepy', allegedly asked the female pupil if she liked bald, older men after she admitted fancying Bruce Willis, left, and George Clooney, right . Rees is also accused of touching a female pupil in a swimming pool while on a school trip to Barcelona. The hearing in Cardiff was told that Mr Rees picked up a girl and swung her around in the swimming pool. Another pupil claims that when they returned from the trip he commented on her tan, asking if it was all over her body. Mr Rees is also accused of rubbing his foot against a girl's leg while on a school choir trip to Barcelona. In addition a female colleague has claimed he told her her underwear ‘turned him on’ and then asked if she wanted an affair. The alleged incidents involving Rees are said to have taken place at the Llantarnum School, pictured in Cwmbran, south Wales . Presenting officer Lousha Bryl told the hearing: ‘One mother said the way Mr Rees looked at her daughter was peculiar, a bit creepy and lechy. ‘She told her daughter to stay away from Mr Rees.’ Mr Rees was working at Llantarnam School in Cwmbran, South Wales, at the time of the alleged incidents and was investigated by the police following the allegations in 2003 before being dismissed from his post. He denies inappropriate comments, conversations and physical contact with pupils from the 1,400 student school. He admits making inappropriate comments to English teacher Rachel Gregory but denies unacceptable professional conduct. The hearing, in Cardiff, continues.

"By . Hugo Duncan Economics Correspondent . Francois Hollande has been warned that high taxes are holding the French economy back as output flat-lines in 2014 . France was last night told high taxes are holding back the recovery after the economy ground to a halt. Official statistics agency Eurostat said output in France stagnated between January and March following just one quarter of growth at the end of last year. The bleak figures came as the International Monetary Fund warned that tax rises have ‘weighed on the capacity of the economy to grow’. In its annual health check on the French economy, the global watchdog said ‘very large’ cuts to public spending are required to put the country’s finances back on a stable footing. The damning assessment came just a week after Socialist President Francois Hollande claimed that the economy is ‘turning’. Dominique Barbet, an analyst at French banking giant BNP Paribas, said: ‘France is trailing the rest of Europe.’ French public spending is among the highest in the world and due to hit 57 per cent of national output this year. The six million State workers make up one fifth of France’s total employed ranks and their salaries account for a quarter of public spending. But they take an average of nearly a month off beyond annual leave – more than twice the rate in the private sector. Wage freezes in the public sector and the threat of job losses have provoked a wave of protests around the country and Mr Hollande has the lowest approval rating of any French President on record. His Socialist party faces defeat at the hands of Marine Le Pen’s far right National Front in next week’s European elections amid widespread voter apathy and a backlash against the mainstream parties. Mr Hollande’s popularity has been hammered by his failure to keep an election pledge to bring down unemployment and revive Europe’s second largest economy. Socialist Hollande has the lowest approval rating of any French president in history and is facing certain defeat by Marie Le Pen's far-right party at the next election . Unemployment in France is still above 10 per cent with more than three million people out of work including nearly a quarter of under 25s. Stagnation in the first three months of the year contrasts with growth of 0.8 per cent in both Britain and Germany. The Spanish economy grew by 0.4 per cent but output sank 1.4 per cent in the Netherlands, 0.7 per cent in Portugal and 0.1 per cent in Italy. ‘The French economy was dogged by ongoing weakness of consumer spending and business investment, revealing a sustained lack of confidence in the country’s economic outlook,’ said Chris Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit. The IMF, which is run by former French finance minister Christine Lagarde, said the French national debt has ballooned following ‘decades’ of excessive public spending. It said the attempt to plug the gap by raising taxes ‘has reached its limits’ and called for spending cuts and economic reforms to pick up the baton. The Washington-based Fund said it is ‘critical’ that the government shores up its finances so it has the money to ‘respond more flexibly in the face of future shocks’. And in a chilling warning over the crisis facing French youngsters, it added: ‘Cutting spending has become critical to help put social safety nets on a sound footing for future generations.’ Mr Hollande hiked taxes when he came to power in 2012 having vigorously campaigned against austerity across Europe. IMF president Christine Lagarde said decades of of excessive public spending has bloated France's debt and said the government had to stop raising taxes to pay for it . But earlier this year he was forced to lower taxes and outline plans to cut €50billion (£41billion) of public spending in a desperate effort to revive the economy and eliminate the deficit. The IMF yesterday said the new course of tax and spending policy ‘was appropriate’ but said it will be ‘very challenging’ and result in cuts that were ‘remarkable by historical standards’. ‘The planned reductions in taxes mean that the cutbacks to spending will need to be very large if public finances are to be brought back to balance over the medium term as they should,’ it said. The Fund also warned that the ‘recovery in economic activity is likely to remain subdued’ in France with growth of just 1 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent next year. But independent economists think it will struggle to even reach this. By contrats the IMF is expecting growth of 2.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent in Britain and 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent in Germany. It said the ‘major risks’ in France are that the government fails to deliver on its pledge and instead resorts to cuts to investment, higher taxes or more debt.","French growth has ground to a halt because of high taxes, IMF warns .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Hangovers are worst at the age of 29 as we don't have the same stamina as when we were younger but still try to party hard, a new study reveals. The average hangover lasts nine hours 45 minutes and reaches its peak at 9.45am, according to research by Redemption. The study for the alcohol-free bar movement in London claims that two-thirds of Britons go to work hungover on Monday and take an average of six sick days every year due to hangovers. Hangovers are worst at the age of 29 and last for an average of 10 hours and 24 minutes as we don't have the same stamina as when we were younger but still try to party hard, research suggests . Its research suggests 29-year-olds mistakenly think they can hit the town as they did when they were younger but end up with hangovers that last an average of 10 hours and 24 minutes. The study surveyed 2,000 Britons over the age of 18 across the country, over half of whom were between the ages of 25 and 44. The research found that the prospect of work on a Monday morning does not stop people indulging on a weekend drinking session. A staggering two thirds of Britons go into work hungover at the start of the week, while half admit they have gone in still being drunk. On average, Britons have six sick days a year due to hangovers, as they don't have the energy to work after a night out. The research also claims there is a north-south divide when it comes to coping with hangovers. Those from Glasgow are the strongest and people living there experience relatively short-lived hangovers of six hours, while Bristolians suffer the most, experiencing hangovers that last on average 10 hours. People have been searching for the best hangover cure for centuries, but Redemption's study found that a third of Britons believe having sex is the best solution. The study of 2,000 people nationwide also found 10 per cent of people have woken up in A&E following a heavy drinking session, while half confessed to being sick on a big night out . The research also looked at whether . people regretted their drunken antics and found one in in 10 have posted . messages or images that they regret on Facebook. A third of people admitted to regularly removing drunk photos of themselves from the social network. Perhaps . more worryingly than over-sharing, more than half of Britons have been . sick during a drinking session, with one in ten have woken up in . A&E. One in five have 'sexted' someone they shouldn't have while drunk and another five per cent have said they have slept with their boss. Ten per cent of people confessed to getting naked in public and a further 6 per cent to wetting themselves, having binged on alcohol. Chris Murray, a shop assistant from Portsmouth, admits feeling hungover on Monday morning when he turns up to work. The 29-year-old said: 'If I go out over the weekend I'm definitely still feeling the affects of the night out when Monday morning comes around. The research looked at whether individuals regretted their drunken antics and found a third of people admitted to regularly removing drunk photos of themselves from Facebook . 'When I'm out on a Saturday night, I don't start to feel better until 7pm or 8pm on Sunday evening. 'And even on Monday morning I still feel a bit rough. If I went out on the Sunday night I wouldn't be able to work the next day - I'd have to phone in sick.' The research was conducted by Redemption, an alcohol-free bar movement with the aim of finding out how far alcohol is ingrained in British culture. Catherine Salway, founder of the temptation-free bar, said: 'People have asked me if I am mad to be . starting an alcohol free bar movement and this research shows just how . radical the idea is - alcohol is totally ingrained in British culture. 'With Redemption we are aiming to . challenge that convention, poke fun at our national pastime of . overindulgence, and offer people an alternative: having fun without . alcohol - a night off rather than a night in.' The pop-up bar, which serves exotic alcohol-free cocktails and healthy raw food instead of conventional bar snacks, launched in Netil House in Bethnal Green, East London this summer and will open permanently in September.","The average hangover lasts nine hours 45 minutes and reaches its peak at 9.45am, according to research by an alcohol-free bar movement .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Nowhere else in your life are you forced to spend time with such a variety of people as you are when at work. Yet a psychologist claims that each colleague can be put into one of five personality types, including the Ball Breaker, who would ‘sell their own mothers to get ahead’ and the Mother Hen who is the office gossip. Each type was compiled using psychological profiling based on various research carried out by The Chemistry Group, but which one are you? Alasdair Scott, psychologist at Berkshire-based The Chemistry Group, has created a guide that reveals what the five types of office workers, including The Ball Breaker who shout at colleagues and will 'stop at nothing to become successful' Alasdair Scott, occupational psychologist and business analysts at the Berkshire-based firm has created a guide that reveals the signs to look out for, how to stay in the good books of the different types, and highlighted some key psychological traits. The first type is The Ball Breaker, according to Scott they ‘are the ones who will stop at nothing to become successful; they’ll sell their own mothers if it means they’ll get ahead.’ The best way to work well with Ball Breakers is to show them respect, but not to reveal any weakness, and above all Scott claims it’s important to make yourself ‘invaluable’ to them. Psychologically speaking, these types are low on the agreeableness scale and very high on emotional stability. They’re low on empathy and mildly extraverted. The Ball Breaker . How . you can recognise them: 'These guys are the ones who will stop at . nothing to become successful; they’ll sell their own mothers if it means . they’ll get ahead,' said Scott. How to work . with them: 'The softly, softly approach would seem like a good antidote . to these guys, but don’t be fooled. 'Try not to show too much weakness, . be thorough and resolute and ready to hold your corner. Plan your . approach to work, keep up your pace of work and make yourself invaluable . through your own insight. What not to do: Show them up in big meetings, win at their expense - they might catch you out later. Personality . make up: These guys are low on the agreeableness scale and very high on emotional stability. They’re low on empathy and mildly extraverted, . meaning that they’re out for solo success and not really a team player. The Mother Hen . How . you can recognise them: 'Guy or girl, they’re the ones you can always . rely on for a pick-me-up chat and a cup of tea. 'They’ve been in the . business for years and are probably in a support or admin role.  They . never socialise with you but subtly know all the gossip in the office.' How to work with them:  Always say hello . to them in the morning and offer to make them a cup of tea.  Invite them . to the pub after work and insist they come. What . not to do: 'Meddle with their systems or set way of doing things. 'They’ve been in the company for years and won’t welcome a young . whippersnapper changing things.' Personality make up:  They’re highly extraverted with average . emotional stability. 'This means they’re warm and approachable and . will welcome any interaction. Scott said this type are low on openness, meaning that . they like their set way of doing things. The Socialite . How you can . recognise them: 'Always booking after-work drinks, will be thinking . about the Christmas party in July and seem to know everyone around the . office,' explained Scott. 'They appear to do minimal work but everyone still loves them.' How . to work with them: 'Take five minutes to say hello in the morning, ask . questions and interact with them. Keep them occupied with . people-related tasks as was this won’t feel like work to them.' What . not to do: Ignore them or their social events. Try and avoid them if you’re busy or have a tight . deadline, continued Scott, 'otherwise you’ll be doing that report in the small hours after . those drinks you’ve been forced into.' Personality make up: They are . high on extraversion, low on emotional stability and high on openness.  Socialites are 'the life and soul of the party' and will want everyone to join . in. 'He added work is probably where their main . social circle is. 'They may be slightly needy and will seek constant . social stimulation.' The Guy with 'Bernard’s Watch' How you can . recognise them: Bernard’s Watch was a British TV show in the late 90s and early 2000s in which a young boy could stop time using a magic pocket watch. They’re the ones we’d all like to be. They’re in the . office first and leave last and according to Scott this type have 'already been to the gym and done . the school run, but still look amazing.' They’re able to . be in a thousand different places at once. How . to work with them: 'They’re quick, so you’ll need to be able to keep . up' said Scott. He said to plan work around their movements. What . not to do: Scott advised not to keep this type waiting or run over time. 'They run an . efficient ship and you’ll need to be just as organised to work with . them.' Personality make up: . They are motivated self-starters and full . of energy; nothing is too much for them and they’ll take anything on. They’re low on detail and will figure things out along the way. The Creative . How . you can recognise them: 'Think ‘Apple tech geeks’ and you know who these . guys are,' said Scott. 'Their hair is messy; they probably have a beard and wear . flared jeans and their desks have seemingly unrelated knick-knacks on . them.' How to work . with them: Give them space to think, suggested Scott. 'Provide them with coffee and . constant stimulation to help their creative process.' What not to do: People should avoid disrupting the creative process or 'waving the rulebook in their faces.' Personality . make up: They are high on openness and low on conscientiousness. They’re unlikely to conform to conventional rules or working practices . and thrive in teams that go against the grain. On what seems like the opposite end of the scale are The Mother Hen types. These are colleagues who have been in the business for years, mainly in an admin or support role, and know all of the office gossip. People can get on their good side by saying hello and making them tea, but shouldn’t ever ‘meddle with their systems’ or tell them how to do their job. They’re ‘highly extraverted with average emotional stability’ but low on openness, meaning they like their set way of doing things. Socialites are the life and soul of the party and will want everyone to join in, claims Scott. 'Work is a social event for them and it's probably where their main social circle is' The Socialite will be the person that organises all the work events including the Christmas party. Scott’s profiling describes this type as being ‘high on extraversion, low on emotional stability and high on openness.’ Adding: ‘They are the life and soul of the party and will want everyone to join in. Work is a social event for them and it’s probably where their main social circle is.’ But this can make them needy. If you’ve got a team member who is always early for work, goes for a run or the gym before work and still looks unfazed then they might beThe Guy with Bernard’s Watch' type. Bernard’s Watch was a British TV show in the late 90s and early 2000s in which a young boy could stop time using a magic pocket watch. According to Scott: ‘Don’t keep this type waiting or run over time. They run an efficient ship and you’ll need to be just as organised to work with them. They’re quick, so you’ll need to be able to keep up.’ This does make them motivated, but low on detail and prefer to work things out along the way which can lead to mistakes. More laid-back types fall under The Creative category. Creatives are described as ‘Apple tech geeks’ with messy hair. Men may also have beards and wear flared jeans. Colleagues can spot them because they’re desk is covered in ‘unrelated knick-knacks’ and they always ‘need space to think.’ Scott claims these people don’t like sticking to the rules and will find ways to go against the grain. This makes them high on openness and low on conscientiousness.","A psychologist has created five personality types for office workers .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . and Daily Mail Reporter . You might be only a pretty face, but it seems that’s all you need to get on in today’s world of work. A study has found beautiful people do better in their careers – even after their youthful good looks have begun to fade. At each career stage studied, pretty people held more prestigious jobs than plain Janes. Destined for success? Sociologists found that beauty played a role in what job a person got and how successful they were, even when taking into account IQ, level of education and parents' education . The researchers said attractive sorts may gravitate to good jobs because they are more confident. Alternatively, the plain may be penalised by employers. The . British and Italian team used decades of data on more than 8,000 men . and women who left school in Wisconsin in the US in 1957. This . included information about employment at various points in life, school . photos that were used to rate their looks and information about their . education and their parents’ social class. Those . rated the most attractive on leaving school tended to have better jobs . and more prestigious careers, even when close to retirement. The finding held even when other factors, such as intelligence and education, were taken into account. Researcher . Gundi Knies, of Essex University’s Institute for Social and Economic . Research, said good looking people may benefit from a ‘beauty premium’. She . added: ‘We found facial attractiveness is important in determining . people’s occupational prestige at the beginning of the career as it is . in the middle or at the end.’ The study tracked the career outcomes of more than 8,000 people and found the best looking were more successful throughout their whole lives . 'Or, in other words, the so called beauty premium is stable throughout people's employment history and pretty people are doing better even as they age.' Writing . in Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, Dr Knies said . employers may be drawn towards attractive staff. It is also possible the . good looking have the confidence to aim higher. Previous studies have shown that attractive people are usually hired sooner, get promotions more quickly and earn up to four per cent more than their colleagues who are less aesthetically pleasing. The latest findings, published in Research in Stratification and Mobility, offer a fresh perspective to the study of social inequalities and could improve understanding of whether looks affect employment. Together with colleagues from the University of Milan Biococca, Dr Knies relied on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which graduates from the local university in 1957. A panel of experts assessed their high school yearbook photos and awarded each a beauty score and then tracked their careers by analysing their employment history. Those with the highest beauty scores were found to have the better jobs and more prestigious careers over those with lower scores, despite other differences in socioeconomic background, parent education and even their own IQs. 'Our facial features are largely genetically determined and the research raises a number of questions regarding the processes that underlie the reproduction of social inequalities, said Dr Knie. 'For example, do beautiful men and women have higher occupational prestige because employers discriminate against plain people? 'Or is it that beautiful men and women choose more prestigious occupations, for example, because they enjoy a higher self esteem and are more self confident.'","Sociologists from the University of Essex said beauty plays a role in what job a .

Backhanded compliment: Miss Schifrin says her boss is a 'brilliant writer' and her 'respect for him is boundless' Just days earlier, Ms Shifrin penned a 1,500-word blog outlining her reasons for her resignation, which she called Journalism is Dead (To Me). She wrote: 'I work for an awesome company that produces news videos.

'Oh, and to let my boss know I quit.' On her blog, Miss Schifrin, who is from New York, explains further: 'I got a job [...] for an animation company where I was free to make jokes and put my personality into my writing. I loved it! I found the perfect combination between comedy and journalism. I was having my cake, eating it AND going in for seconds. 'I dropped everything for work.

'I'm gone': The video ends with her switching off the light and leaving the office . 'But as the workload increased, I found I could no longer keep up. I tried. I came in earlier, I stayed later, I worked on weekends. Scared I wasn’t pulling my weight, I went to my boss and told him how I felt. '""Make deadlines, not art,"" was his response. 'After I admitted that I could not hit the deadlines needed to put out our long-form, satirical news pieces, I was moved to our serious stories.' But she says she didn't find that fulfilling and decided to leave for a different career. She adds: 'Running away from something is never the solution. Unless your problem is a mugger. Then yes, run. GO! NOW!

"By . Fiona Macrae . Next time you fly, here’s the perfect excuse to switch off your work laptop, put down the crossword and settle in with a drink and an in-flight movie. Travelling by plane can make it more difficult to think, according to Britain’s foremost aviation doctor. Professor David Gradwell advises fliers to sit back and relax rather than keeping busy by doing puzzles or catching up on important work. Not at our best: Britain's top aviation doctor says it is best to relax rather than trying to work while flying . This is because the air pressure on board planes is lower than it is at sea level, making it harder for the brain to make use of oxygen in the air, so diminishing its performance. Typically, when a plane is cruising . at 40,000ft, the air pressure in the cabin will be equivalent to that . found outside at 6,000 to 8,000ft. There is no evidence that wearing compression stockings prevents the development of DVT, says a leading expert . Professor . Gradwell, of King’s College London, explained: ‘Learning is a bit . impaired at 8,000ft so performance of recently learned tasks is a bit . impaired at 8,000ft. You don’t want to make the biggest decision of your . life.’ However, if you are well-practised in a task, it is unlikely your performance will be affected. Professor Gradwell, the UK’s first full-time professor of aviation medicine, said: ‘If you regularly do a crossword, you are going to be fine. But if it is something that is new to you, you are probably not going to do it as well.’ This explains why commercial pilots’ thinking is not impaired. They get used to carrying out tasks in a . simulator at ground level before they might have to carry them out . during a flight. Professor Gradwell also said his . advice could become even more pertinent if internet access becomes . widespread on planes, meaning businessmen and women are more likely to . use flying time to work. ‘Those looking forward to having . emails in flight might want to think twice about sending that email to . the bank manager,’ he said. The former RAF medic also insisted that most people’s fears of deep vein thrombosis are groundless. The condition, dubbed ‘economy class syndrome’, has caused anxiety among holidaymakers, business people and frequent fliers. But Professor Gradwell said it is . extremely rare, other than in those who have late-stage cancer or . another medical condition that predisposes them to blood clots. The evidence that compression stockings will help prevent DVT in healthy people is inconclusive. Passengers should, however, stay hydrated and exercise their legs. He said: ‘No matter how small your seat, you can always flex your seat, raise and lower your feet and exercise your calves. ‘Flying is safe. Millions of people do it every year, without any issues at all.’","Professor David Gradwell says travellers should relax rather than working .

"By . Bianca London . It's the classic scenario in a high school reunion movie - a character lies about their life to appear more impressive to old friends. But it seems that stretching of the truth is not confined to fiction. We are so desperate to impress that one in five of us lie to old friends - about things such as jobs and cars - in a bid to appear more successful, a study has revealed. The research found 21 per cent of Brits admit fibbing when they get together with friends from school or university. One in five of us lie about what job we are doing or what car we have in order to sounds more successful to old school friends . Men are most desperate to appear successful, with 55 per cent who tell tall tales exaggerating how much they earn. The research, to mark the first National Reunion Week on September 10, found 8 per cent of the men also pretend to drive a much flasher car. Meanwhile, of the women who stretch the truth, 45 per cent claim to have a far more glamorous job than the one they actually do. Many (12 per cent) also lie to make it seem that they live in a much nicer area. Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos . said: 'We live in a time when everyone is desperate for everyone else to . see them in the best possible light. Men are most desperate to appear successful, with 55 per cent who tell tall tales exaggerating how much they earn . 'People’s use of Facebook shows we are increasingly aware of how we can use certain information to manipulate what others think of us. 'And people don’t necessarily see why they should stick to the truth. 'So we tell people the postcode we have - or would like to have - or the car we have - or wish we had - to impress others. 'School reunions or gatherings of old college friends can be full of boastful untruths. 'All of those old feelings about whether you’re cool and ""do I fit in?"" seem to resurface. High achievers? 42 per cent of us admit we would be loathe to go to a reunion, like American Pie crew (pictured), as we fear people showing off about what they've done with their lives . 'Childhood insecurities rear their heads again when all these people get together and people increasingly resort to lies to impress each other.' At such gatherings, boasting about the stamps in their passport is also a favourite, with 26 per cent of the braggards claiming to be much better travelled than in reality. One in six Brits - 17 per cent - confess they would lie about their relationship status, perhaps in the hope of hooking up with an old flame. And one in 17 men (6 per cent) admit they have been to a school reunion just to boast about their achievements. Perhaps tellingly, 42 per cent of us admit we would be loathe to go to a reunion as we fear it would be full of people showing off about what they’d achieved.","21 per cent of Brits lie when they meet up with old school friends .

"By . Hugo Gye . A generous taxi driver has become an overnight celebrity in China after he found a huge bundle of cash in the back of his cab - and promptly returned it to its rightful owner. Zhao Lei discovered 170,000 yuan (£16,200) in a paper bag on the back seat of his taxi after taking a young couple to a car dealership in Harbin, in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang. Instead of keeping the huge haul - likely to be at least three times his annual salary - he handed it in to the company which he works for. Generous: Taxi driver Zhao Lei, left, hands a stack of money back to the passenger who lost it, right . Lucrative: The total value of the cash was 170,000 yuan, the equivalent of £16,200 . The firm contacted the passengers, who said they had been carrying so much cash in order to pay for a new car, and returned the money. The delighted couple tried to offer Mr Zhao 10,000 yuan as a reward for his honesty, but he refused to accept the cash. 'It's what I have to do,' the driver said after news of his exploits came to light. 'Anyone who lost such a big amount of money will go crazy. I won't take advantage of that.' Pleased: The rightful owner of the money pictured after it was returned to him . Couple: The man and his girlfriend were planning to use the cash to buy a new car . GDP per person in China is around £4,500, meaning that the bounty discovered by Mr Zhao represents an enormous reward for the average Chinese person. Taxi drivers earn less than 5,000 yuan a month for working punishing 14-hour shifts, six days a week. The story of Mr Zhao's selflessness is likely to be held up as an example of community spirit by the Chinese media, in contrast to a wave of stories demonstrating the increasing individualism of the country's society. In 2011, a little girl who was run over by two cars was seen on camera bleeding to death while nearly 20 passers-by simply ignored her plight. President Xi Jinping has introduced the concept of the 'Chinese Dream' in a bid to ensure that citizens retain their sense of social solidarity as the country grows wealthier and more westernised.","Zhao Lei found 170,000 yuan in his cab after taking young couple to car shop .

"By . Julian Robinson . Americans are ditching dollar bills and paying with plastic more than ever before, according to a survey which found that nearly one in 10 no longer carry around paper money. The study also revealed that 78 per cent of Americans carried less than $50 in paper money and nearly half carry $20 or less every day. A report drawn up by Bankrate.com found that nine per cent of the country have stopped carrying around cash altogether. One in ten Americans has given up carrying cash around on a daily basis according to a survey . The website’s chief financial analyst, Greg McBride said: ‘If we move to a truly cashless society, it won't be much of an adjustment for most Americans. ‘The vast majority of Americans carry $50 or less on a daily basis, which seems to indicate that it's more out of necessity than a desire to pay with cash.’ CNBC reports that the survey, carried out by Princeton Survey Research, also found  gender played a part in who was carrying around more cash. Around 70 per cent of men carried less than $50 compared to 86 per cent for women. Is America moving closer towards a cashless society? Just seven per cent of Americans chose to take $100 in cash with them on a daily basis . The figures add to suggestions that some nations are moving towards becoming cashless societies. Just weeks ago it was revealed how consumers had increased their borrowing in March by the largest amount in more than a year, using their credit cards and taking out more auto and student loans. Consumer borrowing increased $17.5 billion in March, up from a gain of $13 billion in February, the Federal Reserve reported. It was the biggest monthly increase since a $19.3 billion advance in February 2013.The category that includes auto and student loans rose $16.4 billion while the category that covers credit card borrowing increased $1.1 billion. The overall increase in consumer debt pushed total borrowing to a record $3.14 trillion.","Survey finds nine per cent of Americans have stopped carrying cash .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Gamers across the country are gearing up for the launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles and new research has found many are willing to miss out on real-world events to play their favourite games. Almost half of male gamers admitted they have turned down sex to continue playing, while a fifth of female gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos. More disgustingly, one in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room with gamers in Birmingham among the worst offenders. New research claims gamers are willing to miss out on real-world events to play their favourite games. Almost half of male gamers admitted to turning down sex, while a fifth of females said they'd missed hen dos. One in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room . Sony's PlayStation 4 goes on sale in the UK on 29 November and was praised for being cheaper than Microsoft's Xbox One console that launches Friday. The PS4 goes on sale for £349 in the UK and $399 in the U.S, while the Xbox One costs £429 and $499. However, Sony is selling its console at a loss according to figures from analytics firm IHS. The Colorado-based company found that the bill of materials (BOM) for the PS4 equates to $372, plus manufacturing costs taking it up $381. This is $18 less than the retail price. Birmingham gamers also spend the most money on gaming a year at £253 per person ahead of Liverpool on £228 and Manchester on £223. The research was commissioned by Domino’s Pizza to celebrate the launch of Microsoft’s Xbox One on Friday and Sony’s PlayStation 4 the week after. According to the study, although men were willing to give up a night of passion, or even going to the toilet, they were less likely than women to skip spending time with their friends. Women even said they’d missed funerals in order to play their games, yet almost 85 per cent of men said they would never miss a stag do, wedding or important event. The research also found gamers across the country spend . over £200 a year on 'gaming nights'. This money is spent on new games . and consoles as well as snacks such as pizza, crisps and beer. UK gamers said pizza was their . favourite takeaway food to eat while they play (55 per cent), followed . by Chinese (27 per cent) and Indian (15 per cent).

Call of Duty and FIFA fans showed a preference for Pepperoni, while Grand Theft Auto players hanker after a Hawaiian as their topping of choice. And while some UK gamers admitted that video games were the ‘third person’ in their relationships, others said they have found romance in the world of online gaming.

"By . Mark Prigg . Just 74 percent of respondents knew that the Earth revolved around the Sun, a shocking new study into the scientific knowledge of American has found. The survey included more than 2,200 people in the United States and was conducted by the National Science Foundation. Ten questions about physical and biological science were on the quiz, and the average score - 6.5 correct - was barely a passing grade. ust 74 percent of respondents knew that the Earth revolved around the Sun, a shocking new study into the scientific knowledge of American has found. Fewer than half (48 percent) knew that human beings evolved from earlier species of animals. The result of the survey, which is conducted every two years, will be included in a National Science Foundation report to President Barack Obama and US lawmakers. One in three respondents said science should get more funding from the government. Nearly 90 percent said the benefits of science outweigh any dangers, and about the same number expressed interest in learning about medical discoveries. The National Science Foundation said nearly half of all Americans said astrology is either 'very scientific' or 'sort of scientific'. It said young people in particular were more likely than ever to consider the pseudoscience at least 'sort of' scientific. 'Fewer Americans rejected astrology in 2012 than in recent years,' the 2014 Science and Engineering Indicators study report said. Is your future in there somewhere? Skepticism of astrology hit an all-time high in 2004, when 66 percent of Americans said astrology was total nonsense. But each year, fewer and fewer respondents have dismissed the connections between star alignment and personality as fiction, the NSF said. 'In 2012, slightly more than half of Americans said that astrology was 'not at all scientific,' whereas nearly two thirds gave this response in 2010. 'The comparable percentage has not been this low since 1983.' Skepticism of astrology hit an all-time high in 2004, when 66 percent of Americans said astrology was total nonsense. But each year, fewer and fewer respondents have dismissed the connections between star alignment and personality as fiction, the NSF said. It claims the question was 'focused on the public’s capacity to distinguish science from pseudoscience.' Young people are also especially inclined to offer astrology scientific legitimacy, with a majority of Americans ages 18 to 24 considering the practice at least 'sort of' scientific, and the 25-34 age group is not far behind them. According to a new survey by the National Science Foundation, nearly half of all Americans say astrology, the study of celestial bodies' purported influence on human behavior and worldly events, is either ""very scientific"" or ""sort of scientific."" John Besley of Michigan State University, the lead author of the report's chapter on public attitudes toward science, told Mother Jones he thinks we need to wait 'to see if it's a real change' before speculating about what the data really means, but said the data 'popped out to me when I saw it.' The results come just days after the recent debate between Bill Nye 'The Science Guy' and young-Earth creationist Ken Ham, but reveals perhaps views of what constitute a 'real' science are not as good as researchers had hoped. By contrast, 92 percent of the Chinese public think horoscopes are untrue. First Lady Nancy Reagan famously employed the services of an astrologer after the assassination attempt on her husband. When asked in 1989 whether she thought astrology could be credited for her husband's success at avoiding any further danger, she said: 'I don't really believe it was, but I don't really believe it wasn't.'","Half of all Americans also said astrology is either 'very scientific' or 'sort of scientific.'

Michelle, 34, who is a FETAC-qualified personal trainer with . qualifications in pre and post pregnancy exercise, has released a three-part exercise plan tailored to the three trimesters of pregnancy. Describing itself as 'the only exercise DVD to feature a celebrity qualified to instruct rather than to merely stand looking thin beside a professional instructor', Michelle's offering features three programmes tailored to each of the three stages of pregnancy. Slimming down: Michelle Heaton, 34, has shifted the pounds since giving birth to her second child in February and now she's releasing a DVD to help women do the same . Speaking to MailOnline about the £12.99 DVD, which launches tomorrow, she said: 'I know how hard it is to try and stay active during pregnancy so I wanted to share what I learnt and what helped me with others. 'After . my first baby Faith was born, I realised that if I stayed active . throughout pregnancy, to try and regain my figure afterwards would be . less of a challenge. So that's what I set out to do when I got pregnant . with AJ. 'I went looking for a pregnancy exercise DVD but I . couldn't find one that took into account the massive changes our bodies . undergo as the pregnancy develops. A trimester 3 lady should not be . doing a trimester 1 workout! So I thought right, I'll do it myself. 'Everyone . told me the DVD market is saturated or non-existent, but I've trained . and qualified as a fitness instructor, I've paid my dues and I've got a . system that works for me. So if one hundred or one thousand women want . to borrow from it, I'll be delighted.' The healthy way: Michelle is a FETAC-qualified personal trainer with qualifications in pre and post pregnancy exercise and gently exercised throughout her pregnancy . The new DVD follows Michelle's journey as she aims to maintain a vibrant, fun and rewarding workout plan. While she hasn't yet shared the kind of exercise she will be revealing, Michelle says that she combines her take on active pregnancy with first-hand experience as a mother, offering support, guidance and advice to women wishing to remain fit and healthy throughout their developing pregnancy and beyond. Michelle refuses to speak about how much weight she has lost and instead wishes to focus on the 'wellbeing' aspect of her DVD and weightloss journey. As well as her exercise regime, the . Liberty X star opted for the Soulmatefood Post Natal Plan - a four-week . diet that promotes healthy eating by providing new mother’s with the . correct balance of nutrients in specially prepared meals delivered to . their door.

Users . can choose from three menu options - Weightloss, Low Carb and Balance - . with dishes ranging from Cajun chicken, steamed sea bass, breakfast . sundae and haddock frittata. Referring . to the diet in an interview with OK! magazine, she said: ‘They work with . what I like and what my end goal is and I get a delivery twice a week. ‘It’s a godsend at the moment because I can’t stand and cook family meals. It’s not a fad diet, it’s sport nutrition.’ Michelle, who found fame as a member of pop band Liberty X, says that 2008 heralded a fresh start for her when she met future husband, Irish fitness trainer Hugh Hanley. With Hugh's inspiration and guidance Michelle found a new passion for health and fitness, revolutionised her lifestyle and shed three stone in weight. How she got there: Michelle combines her take on active pregnancy with first hand experience as a mother and teaches others how to do the same in the DVD . Building on her interest and participation in fitness and health, 2010 saw Michelle become a FETAC-qualified personal trainer, and run both the New York and London Marathons. When pregnant in 2011, Michelle further qualified as a Pre and Post Natal fitness instructor, with Michelle and Hugh's first child Faith being born in January 2012. In July 2012, Michelle discovered she has the BRCA2 gene mutation, giving her an 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy as a preventative measure in November, 2012, with her story being documented for Lorraine (ITV1) and a weekly diary for Closer magazine, during Breast Cancer Awareness month.

"By . Associated Press . Caught: Orville 'Moe' Fleming has been captured after more than two weeks on the run . A former California fire battalion chief who eluded authorities for more than two weeks has been arrested in the stabbing death of his girlfriend. Orville 'Moe' Fleming had been on the run since the body of his fiancée, 26-year-old Sarah June Douglas, was found May 1 inside the south Sacramento home they had shared for the past two years. Authorities say Fleming, 55, had considerable outdoor skills and was familiar with California's mountains because of his career as a wildland firefighter. On top of that, he had places to hide out as he was believed to have had keys to state fire facilities throughout the state. He was fired from his job as a battalion chief and instructor with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection after failing to show up at work for a week after the slaying. 'We are pleased that this search is over and the Sheriff's Office has apprehended Mr. Fleming,' said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 'We will continue to support the sheriff and the district attorney in any way we can as the judicial process continues.' Investigators previously said Fleming moved in with Douglas after meeting her as an escort who advertised on the Internet. Fleming filed for divorce from his wife in Fresno County Superior Court in October, according to online records, but the case has not been finalized. Victim: Sarah June Douglas was found stabbed and strangled in the home she shared with Fleming, who she met on an escort site . Fleming's estranged wife, Meagan Fleming, had sought a protective order against Douglas last fall, alleging his new girlfriend was harassing her and her adult children in an attempt to get money from Orville Fleming. The request was denied a day later without being considered, when a judge said Meagan Fleming had not properly filled out the required form. There was no answer at the telephone number listed for Meagan Fleming's home on Friday, and she did not immediately respond to an email. Orville Fleming vanished after he abandoned his official California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pickup in a Sacramento suburb before sheriff's investigators learned of Douglas' death. Investigators received hundreds of tips, including unsubstantiated sightings as distant as Oregon and Los Angeles. Search: Police have started a state-wide manhunt for Fleming, who is believed to be armed and dangerous . Help: Fleming allegedly reached out to an escort service shortly after the murder of his girlfriend . Veteran: The lone suspect is a 24-year veteran firefighter that has risen to the rank of battalion chief . Earlier reports alleged that Fleming may have used other escorts from the same company that he used to originally hire Douglas when they first met. Police believe that Fleming, who had been dating Douglas for two years, had continued to use the escort website after her death. It is though that he picked up someone he had met on the site just moments after Miss Douglas was stabbed, before fleeing. 'We have information . that [Fleming] has most likely reached out to someone in the community . of [Redbook],' Sergeant Lisa Bowman told CBS. Attacked: Sarah Douglas had confided in her sister that she planned to end her relationship with Fleming just hours before she was killed . 'If he can commit such a heinous and violent murder in the way that he did, we're concerned for the public.' Douglas had confided in her mom and sister that her relationship with Fleming was troubled on the night she was murdered. The former escort called her sister, . Stephanie, just after midnight on May 1 to say: 'That [SOB] left the gas . on. I think he's trying to kill my birds.' She . was then heard saying: 'Whoa, you scared me' before a man the sister . later identified as Fleming was heard arguing with her. Stephanie Douglas said she then heard her sister scream, before the line went dead.","Orville 'Moe' Fleming has been captured after fleeing his Sacramento home where his fiancee was found strangled and stabbed to death .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Associated Press . Command Sgt. Maj. Martin R. Barreras died on Tuesday in a San Antonio military hospital from wounds sustained during his most recent deployment in Afghanistan . The soldier from Tucson has died from wounds suffered during . an attack in Afghanistan, the Department of Defense announced Thursday. Command Sgt. Maj. Martin R Barreras died on Tuesday in . San Antonio Military Medical Center, officials said. He had suffered . wounds earlier this month when his unit was attacked by enemy forces with small arms fire in Herat Province, . Afghanistan, the Department of Defense said. The 49-year-old was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 5th . Infantry, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division in Fort Bliss, . Texas. He became the top enlisted soldier for the battalion in March 2013. Soldiers from the battalion were deployed to Afghanistan in December. The 1st Armored Division, also known as 'Old Ironsides,' dates . back to before World War II. Barreras was part of the U.S. Special Operations Forces who rescued POW Jessica Lynch in April 1, 2003. Private First Class Lynch was seriously injured and captured when her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces. Her subsequent rescue thrust her into the media spotlight and was the first successful rescue of an American prisoner of war since Vietnam and the first ever of a woman. His vast number of awards include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with V device, Bronze Star with three oak leaf clusters and the Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster. His colleague, Lt. Col. Edward Brady told The Army Times: 'Command Sgt. Maj. Barreras was my friend and battle buddy. 'I’ve spent more time with him than my wife since I’ve taken command. I believe that I was the luckiest battalion commander in the Army to have him as my command sergeant major.' He added: 'While every soldier in this formation is extremely saddened by his loss, his Bobcats are doing exactly what he would expect of us: continuing on with the mission and taking the fight to the enemy. This man would do absolutely anything and everything to ensure his soldiers came home safely.' In a statement, Representative Ron Barber, (D-Tucson), called Barreras a brave member of the United States Army.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Accused: Alex Hope is accused of posing as a City trader and using his investors' money to buy popstar Rihanna Cristal Champagne . A catering manager accused of posing as a City whizzkid used his investors money to buy singer Rihanna Cristal champagne as part of his £65,000 bar tab at a Mayfair nightclub, a court heard. Alex Hope, 25, allegedly used the cash . to treat the Umbrella singer to a three-litre bottle of bubbly, . worth £4,500, after securing a table next to the star when she performed at the venue. Southwark Crown Court heard that Hope used punters’ funds as his . ‘personal piggy bank’ and blew £125,000 on a single Nebuchadnezzar . 15-litre bottle of champagne during another night out. He then allegedly frittered away almost . £1m in casinos and racked up bar bills of £500,000 at exclusive . nightclubs in London and Dubai after reinventing himself as a Forex . trader. The ‘City high flier’ was in reality a former catering manager at Wembley Stadium and used to flip burgers for a living. Jurors heard that after blowing money on his lavish nightlife Hope would repay investors in his fraudulent Forex scheme with cash from new punters. He allegedly got through £2million in the 13 months before his arrest in early 2012 when City of London police raided his flat in east London’s Docklands. Jurors were told that Hope demanded a table next to Rihanna after she performed at Aura, a members only nightclub in London’s Mayfair that charges a minimum table spend of £800. He then treated the 26-year-old singer to a Jeroboam bottle of Cristal following her set at the exclusive venue on February 26, 2012. Nightclub owner Alberto Barberini told the jury: ‘It was a Sunday night which was quite a popular night, not many clubs like ours open on a Sunday. ‘We had a famous singer in the club at the time, it was Rihanna, she was performing but we hadn’t advertised it, it was a late notice thing. ‘I sent out a tweet about it. Then on the night Alex Hope arrived and said he wanted a table next to her, if possible. Star: The court heard that Hope demanded a table next to Rihanna after the singer performed at Aura, a members only nightclub in London's Mayfair that charges a minimum table spend of £800 . ‘I said at that time there wasn’t one but the table next to Rihanna was people that we knew so we just asked them to join another table - so we made it happen. ‘We knew Alex was a good customer and he would enjoy that so we got him a close table to her’. Mr Barberini added Hope then bought Rihanna the bottle of Cristal as part of a £65,113 bar tab. The court heard that he waived Hope’s £550 membership fee on the advice of event concierge Mo Samba, who regularly introduced celebs and footballers to his nightclub. ‘The first time I met Alex he came to the club and he had two or three friends with him, he asked if a table was available’, Mr Barberini said. ‘We didn’t have a table at that time, I told him the minimum spend was £800, he told me it wasn’t a problem. ‘While that conversation was ongoing I got a call from Mo Samba, he said “somebody’s coming to the club, we’ve sent him over, he’s a good customer, do what you can for him”’. ‘I heard he was in the finance business, a young hotshot doing very well for himself. Venue:urors were told Hope once splurged £25,000 on a single Methuselah six-litre size bottle of Ace of Spades at Aura (pictured) and paid a third of his £41,330 bar bill by cash . ‘I took him and Mo Samba out for dinner as a thank you and later got Alex into a nightclub in Dubai’. Tom Baker, prosecuting, told jurors that Hope first partied at Aura on November 9, 2011, the night he won £4,000 on the tables at Palm Beach casino. He added Hope then lost £10,000 at the same Mayfair casino the very next night. Jurors were told Hope once splurged £25,000 on a single Methuselah six-litre size bottle of Ace of Spades at Aura and paid a third of his £41,330 bar bill by cash. However, Deborah Morris, defending, said Hope would not drink the luxury alcohol he had bought for friends but would instead sip cranberry juice, his favourite drink. She added that Hope would often party at Aura with ‘fit, athletic black guys’ such as former Arsenal footballer Jo Kuffour, who currently plays for League Two side Wycombe Wanderers. Hope is charged alongside Raj Von Badlo, 56, for his involvement in the unauthorised investment scheme. He is alleged to have withdrawn £95,000 in criminal proceeds and acted as the ‘promoter’ for the fraud. Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denies one charge of fraud. He has admitted violating City rules by carrying on a regulated activity when not authorised. Von Badlo, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, denies concealing £95,000 in criminal property, carrying on a regulated activity when not authorised and two counts of making misleading statements. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Alex Hope, 25, 'bought the Umbrella singer a three-litre bottle worth £4,500'

"By . Snejana Farberov . Donnie Sharp, 5, had many items on his to-do-list, among them riding a horse, sleeping outdoors and above all, becoming a New Orleans firefighter just like his grandpa. On Monday, the terminally ill boy exhausted from radiation treatment was carried into a firehouse in the Algiers section of the Big Easy to be named an honorary firefighter. No one knew it was to be his final wish. The toddler passed away Wednesday after losing a two-year battle with neuroblastoma - a rare malignant nerve tissue cancer. Fearless: Donnie Sharp, 5, passed away at Children's Hospital in New Orleans Wednesday following a two-year battle with Stage 4 nerve cancer . Donnie's mother, Laura Sharp, told the station WWLTV as soon as her son drew his last breath, relief was visible on his face as he passed away at Children's Hospital. The mother of six tearfully recalled that shortly before her son's death, Donnie confided in her that he saw angels in the hospital lobby. ‘He just looked back and forth like he was looking at somebody and he said, “I see 'em. I see 'em,""’ Mrs Sharp said. Two days earlier, New Orleans firefighters stood at attention as Donnie, his head shaven and oxygen tubes sticking out of his nose, was sworn in as their newest colleague. ‘On behalf of the city of New Orleans and the proud men and women of the New Orleans Fire Department, I promote you to the rank of firefighter,’ Chief Tim McConnell told Donnie. Becoming a firefighter was high on the boy’s 'Donnie's Do List.' Donnie's Do List: The 5-year-old had a list of things he wanted to do before his passing, which included riding a horse and a fire truck, roasting marshmallows and sleeping outdoors . RIP: Donnie, pictured here in a hospital room, succumbed to his disease after confiding in his mother that he had seen angels . 'He's always told us that when he grows up, he will be a fireman just like his Pop Pop,' Laura Sharp said, referring to her father, John Manning, a veteran of the NOFD. On Monday, the plan was for Donnie to go for a ride on a ladder truck with his new friends, but he was tired from his treatment and in pain, so the firefighters promised him to take him for a spin later on, the news station reported. So young: At age three, Donnie was diagnosed with terminal nerve cancer, which continued spreading despite chemo and radiation treatments, a bone marrow transplant and immonotherapy . At age three, Donnie, the youngest of six children, was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma. Over the course of two years, he had gone through chemotherapy, radiation treatment, surgery, a bone marrow transplant and immunotherapy, but the cancer spread. Last week, the family were told that there was nothing left to do for little Donne except make him comfortable in hospice care. The boy's father, Derek Sharp, recalled one of his last conversations with the wise-beyond-his-years toddler, who shared with him a few words of wisdom: ‘All I want you to do, Daddy, is love Mommy. And I want Mommy to love you and you will be happy,' The Sharp family's friends from church had started an online fundraiser on GoFundMe.com when Donnie was still alive to collect money towards his wish list, which included roasting marshmallows; going down a water slide; eating at a Chuck E. Cheese  restaurant and traveling to Illinois to meet with extended family. The 5-year-old will never get to do any of these things now, but his mother says there is a silver lining to the tragedy. ‘He will never have cancer again. He is cancer free. Cured,’ said Laura. The online fundraiser remains active to help the Sharps with Donnie’s medical bills and final expenses. So far, people have donated more than $11,000.","Doneven Sharp was diagnosed at age 3 with terminal neuroblastoma and had spent two years undergoing treatments and bone marrow transplant .

"By . Lydia Warren . A couple has been arrested after their six-week-old daughter was found unresponsive in their home with apparent signs of long-term neglect, police have said. Kadence Cannon was covered in dirt and fecal matter with untreated diaper rash and lice when she was found not breathing in Enid, Oklahoma on Wednesday, the police captain told KTOK. When police interviewed her parents, 45-year-old Mark Cannon and 26-year-old Jennifer Cannon, they told police they had been up all night drinking on Tuesday and got into an argument.

Emotional: Autumn Nelson said she burst into tears when she saw her son Ian, pictured with her husband Anthony, being picked up by his kindergarten teacher in surveillance footage . Innocence: Ian described the moment that his teacher grabbed him 'hard' as his mother became emotional . Instead of firing the teacher, who has been with the school district for 14 years, school officials placed her on unpaid leave for 10 days. It will come to an end as the school begins its summer vacation. It is still not clear why she was angry at the boy, who was coming out of the bathroom. Williams is seen on surveillance footage appearing to confront Ian. As the little boy walks out of the bathroom, Williams allegedly grabs him and lifts Ian in front of a wall. The teacher then appears to grab him by the throat, tilting his head back and forcing him off his feet. Shocking: Surveillance footage at Riverdale . School in Ohio show's six-year-old Ian Nelson's head being tipped back . as his kindergarten teacher, Barb Williams, appears to lift him off the ground .

In another shot, Williams appears to have grabbed the boy's shirt and used that to lift the terrified boy off the ground. 'She did this to me - hard,' Ian told the Today show as he grabbed his shirt. Action: Kindergarten teacher Barb Williams has been suspended without pay for ten days . His parents told the Toledo News that they were stunned by . 'We thought it was just a little incident that happened.That's what the school made it sound like. All of a sudden, we get this video today and this is just outrageous,' Anthony Nelson said. The incident came to light when a member of staff at Riverdale Schools in Hancock County reported Williams. Seeing . the way their child, who was left bruised, had been treated has been upsetting for the Nelsons, . who were given a copy of the footage by the school on May 7. She and her husband were shocked by the school's reaction however, and are demanding that Williams be fired. The unpaid suspension will end just as the school breaks up for the summer vacation. 'If I were to do that to her, I . would go to jail,' Mr Nelson told Toledo News Now. 'I don't think she should be teaching . anymore... There's no one that . should ever put their hands on a child.' Not only will Williams be back at the school after the summer vacation, she will also be teaching Ian's class. His parents requested that their little boy - or the teacher - be moved, but the school has refused. 'He's . scared of her, even going to the school next year, even the year after . he'll still have to see her if she's present in the building.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . When the Avengers Assemble call was sent out by the daughter of a cancer patient who has just weeks to live, the Hollywood stars of the hit movie were quick to respond. Sophie Caldecott has been harnessing the power of social media to help fulfill the dying wish of her father and superhero fan Stratford, who is in the final weeks of terminal prostate cancer. The 60-year-old, who has collected comics since he was a little boy, now has back up from Thor, Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk, thanks to a successful Twitter campaign. Super heroes: Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr, who play Thor and Iron Man, lend their support to cancer patient Stratford Caldecott . Fan: Cancer patient Stratford Caldecott, pictured with wife, Leonie, has collected comic books since he was a boy .

Super woman: Sophie got the Avengers cast to tweet selfies to her father, Stratford Caldecott . She got the idea for the #CapForStrat campaign after her father joked that he was clinging on to see the latest Marvel film, which isn't due to be released on DVD until August. He had been too ill to watch it at a movie theater. At first Ms Caldecott, who lives in Oxford, England, with her American husband Greg, and their baby, had just planned to ask Marvel to send the family an advance copy. With that mission accomplished, she decided to take matters one step further, and started tweeting the celebrity cast to see if they would take selfies and send them to her dad. 'As Agent Coulson would say, it’s time to call for backup. Let’s give him the send off he deserves,' she tweeted, according to SCPR. True to their super-hero alter egos, the cast of the film have responded to her request, with Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, and Ming-Na Wen, who plays Melinda May in Agents of Shield, rallying the troops. 'It’s been a bit like a massive flash mob where a whole bunch of strangers hug each other,' Ms Caldecott, who writes the Something For A Rainy Day blog, said. The 26-year-old has managed to get selfies of nearly the entire cast, with only one major character - Black Widow Scarlett Johansson left to track down.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 15-year-old girl who was unmasked as a 34-year-old suspected con artist this week not only managed to deceive her guardian and Texas school officials, but also her 23-year-old boyfriend, it was revealed Friday. Charity Johnson was arrested in Longview Monday - seven months after she enrolled in a local high school as a sophomore after pretending to be an orphan. The bizarre tale of deception has left many people in the small East Texas community in a state of disbelief, including Rickie Williams, who has been dating Johnson since last summer. Scroll down for video . Jarring contrast: Charity Johnson, 34, seen on . the left while pretending to be 15-year-old high school sophomore . Charity Stevens and right in a booking photo after her arrest . ‘My best friend showed me and I was shocked,' the 23-year-old movie theater attendant told KLTV. Williams said Johnson, who has been using the last name Stevens, told him she was 18 years old. Johnson also managed to pull the wool over the eyes of Roshunda Floyd, who met the 34-year-old at work. Floyd, who works at Walmart in Longview, recalled that one night Johnson approached her asking for help choosing an outfit for a family reunion. The Walmart employee asked Johnson how old she was, and the 34-year-old allegedly replied that she was 'just a sophomore in high school,.' '""Really?” I said, “You seem to be a little older than that.” She didn't say anything,’ Floyd recalled the exchange. Another person who bought into Johnson's sad tale of abuse and loss was Osarieme Obaseki, 40, who runs the Dallas-based What About Us non-profit organization helping women and girls. Tricked: Rickie Williams, 23 (left), has been dating Johnson (right) since last summer . Age of consent: Williams said Johnson had told him she was 18 years old . Obaseki told ABC News that Johnson first contacted her last month claiming to be a 14-year-old girl in need of help. The two formed a bond and continued exchanging phone calls, with Johnson calling the woman only six years her senior 'Mom.'  She was living with her guardian, Tamica Lincoln, in Longview at the time, but made no mention of that to Obaseki. Their relationship culminated on Mother's Day when Johnson took a train to Dallas to visit Obaseki, even bringing her a homemade holiday card. But over the course of Johnson’s visit, Obaseki's sister became suspicious, pointing out to her that the high school sophomore had the body of a grown woman. Sensing that something did not add up, Obaseki called Lincoln – a phone call that set in motion a chain of events which eventually led to Johnson being exposed as a fraud. ‘It’s just been a lot of lies and cover-up,’ Obaseki said. ‘Nobody I spoke to has said it’s ever been a financial situation. She had money! It’s not that, at all.’ Truth comes out: On Mother's Day, Johnson (left) was photographed with Osarieme Obaseki, 40, the head of a Dallas-based group helping girls, who became suspicious when her sister pointed out that the high school sophomore has the body of a grown woman . Charity Johnson, was arrested Monday night- more than six months after she enrolled in New Life Christian School in Longview pretending to be a 15-year-old orphan. According to school officials, Ms Johnson came to New Life last October accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth-grader. During the enrollment process, Johnson gave the name Charity Stevens and indicated that she was 15 years old. Tamica Lincoln, 30, who took on the role of Johnson's guardian last March, told the station KLTV the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father, who has since died along with her mother. Scam: Johnson enrolled in New Life Christian School in Longview, Texas, last October, claiming she was a home-school student without any prior transcripts . The two women met while working together at a McDonald's located inside the local Walmart, and Johnson confided in Lincoln that she had no place to stay after losing her parents. Lincoln brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home 'as a child,' bought her clothes and did her hair. She even attended parent-teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore’s impressive academic performance. 'She acted like a kid. She did her homework. She got good report cards,' the 30-year-old Longview resident told ABC News. Johnson’s web of lies began unraveling when Lincoln got a call from Obaseki, the head of the Dallas-based charity. Playing the victim: Johnson was taken in by a Good Samaritan after allegedly lying to her that she had been abused as a child and that her parents have died . Growing doubts: Tamica Lincoln (left), Johnson's guardian, and her mentor, Ray Ward (right), became suspicious about her identity and went to police . Ugly truth: Her work file indicted that Johnson was born in 1979 and that her last name was not Stevens . Ms Obaseki told Lincoln that she ran a background check on 'Charity Stevens,' which provided more questions than answers.

The staffer pulled up the . high schooler's file, which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and . her real name Charity Johnson. On Tuesday, Lincoln and the phony orphan’s mentor, Ray Ward, alerted . police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school. ‘Teachers were crying and students were crying, and her best friend just couldn't believe it,’ Lincoln said. School officials said Johnson came in last October as a home-schooled student without any prior transcripts. Officers who responded to Lincoln’s Longview home Monday night asked Johnson to identify herself, and in response she gave them the name Charity Stevens – the same moniker used on her school application. Sticking to her ruse: Hours before her arrest Monday night, Johnson posted this photo of her posing with a horse stature under the Instagram user name Charite Love . Sob story: Ms Johnson told Lincoln, her co-worker at a McDonald's who is four years her senior, that she had lost both her parents and had no place to live . Online persona: On Facebook and Twitter, Johnson called herself 'Charite' and shared photos of herself looking like a teenager . The woman has been charged with failure to identify/giving false, fictitious information. She remains in the Gregg County Jail on $500 bond. Looking at Johnson’s fake Facebook,Twitter and Instagram account created under the nickname Charite, it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes. In the photos posted online, Johnson looks like a shy, fresh-faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure. However, in her booking photo, Johnson dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years, with a lined, puffy face and a tangle of hair.","Charity Johnson, 34, charged with giving police false information by pretending to be 15-year-old Charity Stevens .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A substitute teacher and an EMT have been arrested after being caught selling drugs. Lisa Testa and Joseph Meyer were arrested on Thursday after they were caught selling heroin and other narcotics. Brooklyn police reportedly caught the two as a result of an undercover sting operation, The New York Daily News reports. Caught: Lisa Testa (left) and her friend Joseph Meyer (right) have been arrested and charged with selling illegal drugs after being caught in an undercover operation . Testa, 33, came under suspicion when police received an anonymous letter saying that she was selling crack cocaine and other drugs. A sting operation was launched from there and police bought prescription medication and heroin on multiple occasions. Police were never able to purchase crack cocaine. The investigation was focused on Testa but it extended to Meyer, 25, when police started trying to track down her supplier and they found that they were selling the same drugs. Testa and Meyer are said to be friends though it has not yet been revealed how they specifically worked together. Tip off: Police reportedly received an anonymous letter saying Testa, 33, was selling crack cocaine and they launched a sting operation where officers were able to buy drugs from her multiple times . Dishonoring the badge: The investigation did not start out involving Meyer, 25, but when they started looking for Testa's supplier they realized her friend Meyer was selling the same drugs . They were both charged with the criminal sale of a controlled substance and other unspecified drug-related charges. Meyer had been working as an emergency medical technician under the purview of the fire department for the past two years but was suspended for 30 days without pay upon his arrest. Testa was not a regular substitute teacher for New York City public schools and only taught for two days back in 2008 but at the time of her arrest she was still listed as a possible substitute in the department's database. The Daily News reports that her name was only placed on the 'do not call list' once she was arrested. Testa's mother, Grace Testa, spoke to the paper and said that her daughter has a history of drug abuse. Dangerous: Police were able to buy prescription pills and heroin from both but not crack cocaine which was the subject of the original tip-off letter . 'I’ve been begging her to go to rehab for a long time,' Mrs Testa told The Daily News. 'It’s not her personality to sell drugs. Maybe to take it, but not to sell it. 'She’s a good girl, that’s all I can tell you.... She never gave me problems. She stays home, she stays with her family. She doesn’t even go out to clubs or anything.' Mrs Testa said that her daughter was not in a relationship with Meyer, calling him 'just a friend', but she did not seem to be surprised that he was involved. 'He has a drug problem, too. They’re trying to stop it,' Mrs Testa said.","Brooklyn police received an anonymous letter tipping them off that Lisa Testa was selling crack cocaine .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Accused killer: Thomas Holland is accused of giving his young son a fatal cocktail of cocaine, codeine and acetaminophen . A Maryland father has been charged with giving his toddler son a fatal dose of cocaine earlier this year. Thomas Holland, 38, of Palmer Park, was arrested Thursday after toxicology results from the mysterious January death of his three-year-old son showed the boy to be high on a cocktail of drugs at the time. Investigators found toxic levels of cocaine, codeine and acetaminophen in his body, the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office announced. Police said they were first made aware of the father and son January 26 after Holland drove the unresponsive boy to a local hospital. Holland arrived that morning with the boy claiming he needed help. He was pronounced dead shortly after. It took until testing showed drugs in the child’s system for the Office of the Medical Examiner to rule the death a homicide, police said. Testing also showed that the dosage levels were far too high to have been ingested accidentally, cops said. Deputies were granted an arrest warrant Thursday for the accused killer and took him into custody without incident. The U.S. Air Force computer systems analyst, who worked at the Pentagon as recently as 2011, was charged with first-degree child abuse and manslaughter. He is being held in the county jail.","The child died in January after being brought unresponsive to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Two of the three Florida men arrested for dressing as ninjas while pillaging a multimillion-dollar waterfront home are career criminals, and one claims to have been a member of the Gambino crime family. Frank Bower, 54, Johnathan Contreras, 38, and Andres Perez, 45, are the main suspects in a daring home invasion last month caught on homeowner Bill Kitchen's surveillance video, but Bower's involvement is the one raising the most eyebrows. The ordained minister who now runs a Florida drug and inmate rehabilitation center and claims he found God after a life of crime that he boasted made him millions at the top of the Florida mafia food chain now sits in an Orange County Jail cell. Scroll down for video . A life of crime: Frank Bower is the subject of a 2011 book claiming he was a personal bodyguard to former Gambino crime family boss John Gotti before he turned his life around to become 'a servant of God' The trio was brought into custody Monday night while trying to break into another luxury home while wearing all black clothing, police sources told First Coast News. Investigators told WBBH that they darted onto the property after using wire cutters to break through a chain link fence ringing the property and were quickly busted. They also had a stolen gun, pepper spray, duct tape and zip ties on them when hauled in after 'criminal intelligence information, [led] the Orange County Sheriff's Felony Unit... to conduct surveillance.' Bower and Contreras surrendered without incident, but Perez barricaded himself behind a shrub and was eventually taken in with the support of a K9 unit, the station reported. He was treated for his injuries at a local hospital while deputies raided a nearby hotel room. They found cash, clothing and cellphones, sources said. Contreras has a robust criminal history with multiple drug convictions including trafficking in cocaine, records showed, but Bower's sordid past was the subject of the 2011 book 'The Incredible Journey of a Mafia Soldier.' His rap sheet includes multiple assault and drug convictions and jail sentences, but the book telling his life story is far more colorful. Bower boasts in the tome that he was 'Teflon Don' John Gotti's former bodyguard, and that his 'search for the true meaning of life' led him to be 'a faithful servant of God.' Accomplices: Andres Perez (left) and Johnathan Contreras (right) were apprehended along with Bower . The supposed one-time protector of America's most infamous mobster is shown in court records to have served multiple jail sentences for drug offenses, and said in a 2004 interview he also served time for killing a police officer, before finding God and opening a rehab center in rural Texas. 'Why does God call a guy like me to do something like this? I'm dealing with inmates that are getting out of prison,' he told KLTV a decade ago, adding that he suffered many tragedies as a boy including the kidnapping of two of his sisters and the drowning death of another. 'That's when the flip began. I was 14. That's when I kinda almost knew, I wanted to hurt people,' he continued. And he did, for many years, until he told the station he had enough. 'I think just one day it just hit me, I didn't want my kids to become what I'd become.' He bragged in the book about being a body guard that somehow found his way to running all Gambino operations in Florida, and that he made millions in illicit profits - but that he turned his back on that quick money to live an honest life. Now divorced and back living in Florida, it appears the allure of the quick score was too strong to overcome. He and his two accomplices are believed to have been involved in a string of similar robberies in the Orlando area. Brazen: Kitchen stands tied up in one of the home's rooms while a robber wears one of Espinel's hats and looks right at the security camera . A photo from the surveillance footage of their well publicized robbery last month shows Kitchen tied up in what appears to be a home office while one of the crooks wears one of Espinel’s hats. ‘Our home security shows me (hands bound behind me) in the office, pointing out the valuables. Camilo is sitting, also bound, with his head in a pillow case,’ Kitchen wrote Facebook. ‘One of the three robbers (in black Ninja suits) found Camilo's hat, and is wearing it. In the second pic, the robber sees the video camera.’ A MailOnline attempt to obtain a list of stolen items and the weapons used from Windermere Police was not successful. Held up: Bill Kitchen (left) and Camilo Espinel (right) were tied up but not harmed during the robbery . ‘We were asked to produce all money, jewelry and valuables,’ he wrote in the post. ‘For an hour they ransacked the house.’ The trio then made off in one a car owned by one of the bound men, Kitchen added. ‘It's very scary. I'm hoping that it was an isolated incident like they're saying it was and that it wasn't random and that we have nothing to worry about,’ neighbour DeeDee Lee told WKMG. Police also have not said what make or model car was taken, but did note it was found nearby. ‘Although this is frightening to . happen in our community, I believe this to be an isolated incident, said . police chief David Ogden. Those initial assumptions have since been proven false, but authorities may have finally put an end to the crime spree. Kitchen's home is worth just under $4.6million, according to Zillow. It was once owned by N'SYNC bandmember Joey Fatone, and was even featured in an episode of 'MTV Cribs' before Kitchen bought it.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Four people are dead and four more are injured after a van believed to be part of a human smuggling ring rolled over Friday on a Utah highway. Multiple people were ejected from the 1999 Toyota Sienna in the 4.30 a.m. accident about 35 miles from the Colorado border, police said. A woman who survived the smash up is believed to have fled the scene. The vehicle ‘lost control, rolled multiple times down the middle of the interstate, ejecting multiple occupants,’ Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Todd Royce told the Deseret News. Smashed: Four people died and four more were injured after this van rolled over on a Utah highway . The four dead were men, as were the four injured. They were transported by ambulance to a hospital just over the state line. The accident victims are all Hispanic, which has led authorities to consider the possibility human trafficking may be involved. ‘We're looking at this as possibly being a human smuggling case,’ Royce told the paper. It is not known what caused the maroon van to roll, he added, declining to say which state its license plates are from. Lethal: Multiple people were ejected from the van as it rolled down the center of the highway . Taken away: Investigators roll one of the dead from the scene on a stretcher . Also not known is the condition or whereabouts of the female passenger. ‘One concern is the medical well-being of that person,’ said Royce. ‘If they walked away and haven't been checked out by medical, that's a concern of ours.’ Investigators consider the missing witness a ‘vital piece to this puzzle,’ he insisted. The Utah Highway Patrol has been joined in the investigation by the state Bureau of Investigations, Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Dredging up the past: Dan Patrick is in the lead for the Republican Lt Governor's race but is now dealing with the revelation that he was treated for depression in the 1980s . A state senator in Texas whose medical history was released amid a dirty campaign for lieutenant governor has admitted that he was checked into a psychiatric hospital for treatment. State senator Dan Patrick's team has released a statement saying that he was treated for mild depression and diagnosed with a chemical imbalance in the early 1980s. The confirmation comes as Patrick's campaign accuses their opponent, David Dewhurst, of leaking records of a deposition where Patrick admits to his stay in the psychiatric hospital. In the deposition, Patrick claimed that he was not at Spring Shadows Glen Psychiatric Hospital for psychiatric or emotional problems but 'for rest'. He was later admitted to Memorial City Hospital in Houston and was treated for 'rest, fatigue, exhaustion,' according to local station WFAA. Patrick also confirmed that he took an antidepressant called Imipramine for a few years in the 1980s to treat the chemical imbalance. The deposition dates back to 1989, but does not give specific dates of when Patrick's treatment occurred. His testimony was part of a 1987 slander lawsuit Patrick filed against the Houston Post newspaper, which no longer exists. 'This has not been a secret; for years on his radio station, he has regularly talked about depression and discussed the importance of early treatment when dealing with depression,' campaign spokesman Allen Blakemore said in the statement released to The Houston Chronicle. Playing dirty: Incumbent Lt Governor David Dewhurst reportedly did not release the information but he doesn't pretend not to benefit from the questions about his opponent's mental health . 'He has done this to help others and remove any social stigma for those who seek or are considering seeking treatment. He has conducted several interviews with Texas journalists on the subject. None felt inclined to write the story.' Patrick, a former radio host, and Dewhurst are both vying for the Republican nomination for the state's second-in-command. Dewhurst is the incumbent but Patrick beat him in the party primary in early March, finishing ahead by more than 10 points. For his part, Dewhurst did little to tamper the speculation that he was somehow involved in the release of the deposition- or at least that he benefitted from the information being public. Big race: Texan voters will decide which of the four candidates (including Dewhurst at left and Patrick at right) will be the Republican Lt Gov nominee (all four candidates seen at a May 7 debate) 'My heart goes out to Dan and his family for what they've endured while coping with his condition,' he said in a statement through a spokesman on Thursday. The Houston Chronicle reports that Jerry Patterson, the departing commissioner of Texas' General Land Office, was the one to release the information to the San Antonio Express-News. The run-off vote will be held on May 27.","State Senator Dan Patrick is in the lead for the Republican nomination for Lt Governor of Texas .

"By . Associated Press . The mother of Jerome Murdough, pictured while serving in the Marine Corps, is suing the city after his death at Rikers Island, New York on February 15 . The mother of a mentally ill, homeless veteran who was found dead in a 100-degree New York City jail cell that overheated due to an equipment malfunction in February plans to file a $25 million wrongful death lawsuit against the city. Alma Murdough's attorney, Derek Sells, said he will also ask the city to preserve all communications and 911 recordings regarding former Marine Jerome Murdough's death on Rikers Island. Sells scheduled a news conference for Friday afternoon. He filed a notice of claim, the first procedural step necessary for a civil suit against the city, with the comptroller's office on April 30 on behalf of the inmate's 75-year-old mother. In it, he writes that the 56-year-old . Murdough's death was caused by carelessness and negligence by Department . of Correction employees. Prosecutors in the Bronx are investigating the death. 'This . case involves a tragic incident and we will review the lawsuit and . respond accordingly,' said Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law . department. Corrections officials have declined to comment, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. It . was first reported in March on suspicions about Murdough's cause of . death. One official who spoke at the time on the condition of anonymity . described him as having 'basically baked to death'. Citing a preliminary DOC investigation, court documents filed last month in a separate federal court case show that Murdough's internal body temperature, taken nearly four hours after he was discovered unresponsive in his cell in the early hours of February 15, was 103 degrees. Alma Murdough and her daughter Cheryl Warner hold a photo of Murdough's son, at her home in Queens, New York.  Jerome Murdough, a mentally ill, homeless former Marine arrested for sleeping in the roof landing of a New York City public housing project during one of the coldest recorded winters in city history, died last month in a Rikers Island jail cell that multiple city officials say was at least 100 degrees when his body was discovered . It said the cell was 101 degrees. Murdough was slumped at the edge of the foot of his bed with 'a pool of vomit and blood on the floor,' the documents said. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office says the exact cause and manner of Murdough's death have not yet been determined, pending further studies. But the court documents show the medical examiner investigator assigned to Murdough's case preliminarily found he likely died of hyperthermia. Murdough was on psychotropic medication at the time of his death, which experts say can make people sensitive to heat. DOC officials have said he was left unattended for hours. Murdough was arrested February 7 on a misdemeanor trespassing charge for sleeping in an enclosed stairwell on the roof of a Harlem public housing building, during one of New York's coldest winters on record. He was sent to Rikers Island after being unable to make $2,500 bail, according to court records. A letter kept by Mrs Murdough shows her son's promotion in the U.S. Marines from 1975. He died, homeless and battling a mental illness in a New York prison earlier this year .","Marine veteran Jerome Murdough, 56, died in prison in February .

Road to recovery: Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, said on a phone call with temporary The Last Word host Ari Melber that he has been doing physical therapy after breaking a hip in a car crash last month . After a month away in a hospital following a car accident, MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell called into his show The Last Word Wednesday to reveal that he suffered a broken hip. O'Donnell and his brother, Michael, were traveling aboard last month they got into an accident while riding in a taxi April 15. After flying home to the U.S., Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, has been getting treatment in New York and Michael has been hospitalized in their native Boston. The veteran TV presenter's colleague Alex took over 'The Last Word' on Tuesdays and Ari Melber has been filing in Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Wednesday this week, Melber got a surprise on the air when his injured co-worker called into the show to offer viewers an update on his condition. The 3-minute exchange with Melber was punctuated with quips and sarcastic jabs, proving that while O'Donnell may have fractured his hip, his sense of humor remained intact. ‘One thing I want everybody to know is . that Carl Rove's rumor that I’ve had brain damage… that is completely . untrue, so make sure that goes away,’ O’Donnell told Melber, poking fun . at the Republican strategist over his recent comments about Hillary . Clinton’s health. Scroll down for video . Ready for his return:  O'Donnell has been . hosting 'The Last Word' on MSNBC since 2010 (pictured), and he is expected to resume his duties next month . After a few seconds of friendly banter, O'Donnell promised to provide additional information on his eminent comeback next week after he meets with his surgeon. The 62-year-old political analyst shed light on his physical state, saying that the taxi collision left him with a fractured hip and injuries to his legs that required surgery for the first time in his life. After trading a few friendly jabs with Melber, whom O’Donnell jokingly called out for being more concerned with his vacation time than with his colleague's health, The Last Word host revealed that he is expected to be back on air in June. ‘That would be great because then I could make vacation plans,’ Melber quipped. ‘Of course, this of course is really all about you. Never mind that I was the one who was in the car crash,’ O’Donnell retorted in jest. O’Donnell added that now that he is feeling more energetic, he will continue calling into the show and may even join Skype so that his viewers could see him on screen. Funnyman: Ari Melber joked that if O'Donnell returns to MSNBC in June, he would be able to make vacation plans . Get well gifts: O'Donnell shared a photo of these flowers (left) sent to the hospital by the team from Morning Joe, and he joked that Bill O'Reilly's book Killing Jesus (right) is just what he needs to fall asleep . ‘And remember: I have access to the control room, so any time, when you least expect it - like right now - I could end up being your next guest,’ O’Donnell warned. O’Donnell finished the chat by asking viewers to stay with MSNBC ‘for more of The Last Word with the hardest working man in cable news, Ari Melber.’ ‘This is so great to get back in the saddle this way,’ O’Donnell gushed about doing the tease. While the host has been away from the small screen for the past month, he has remained active on Twitter, answering viewers’ questions about his recovery and commenting on the news of the day. In response to a fan's query on Twitter Thursday, Mr O'Donnell said that his brother is recovering on schedule, and that he was discharged from the hospital the day before. On May 5, he tweeted that he was learning how to walk with crutches after spending weeks getting around in a wheelchair and then with the help of a walker. Keeping tabs: O'Donnell jokingly warned Melber that since he still has access to the control room, he could end up as his next guest when he least expects it . O’Donnell followed up three days later with a message thanking his 'heroic' nurses and a 'brilliant' physical therapist. O’Donnell also revealed to his 241,000 followers that he is now sporting a full beard since he has not shaved since the accident. Lawrence O'Donnell has hosted the 10pm news analysis show since 2010. He is married and has a daughter. It is unclear where the O'Donnells were when the accident took place, and the left-leaning host did not leave any clues about his trip on his Twitter feed.","O'Donnell, 62, was traveling abroad with his brother last month when they were injured in a taxi accident .

"By . Associated Press . Authorities have charged a college soccer coach with suffocating and strangling a 12-year-old northern New York boy nearly three years ago. Police say 39-year-old Oral 'Nick' Hillary, the men's soccer coach at Clarkson University, was arrested Thursday at his home in the village of Potsdam. He is charged with second-degree murder in the slaying of Garrett Phillips. The suspect pleaded not guilty and is in county jail without bail. Charged: Oral 'Nick' Hillary has been charged with the murder of Garrett Phillips, 12. Hillary had been involved in a relationship with the boys' mother and was initially questioned by police but never charged . Behind bars: Clarkson University men's soccer coach Oral 'Nick' Hillary has been arrested in connection with the death of 12-year-old Garrett Phillips . The boy was found unconscious inside his home after neighbors heard screams and cries for help on October 24, 2011. Hillary is accused of suffocating and strangling the boy at his home. He was pronounced dead that evening at a hospital. Officials say he had been strangled and suffocated with a pillow. Hillary is being held without bail in the county jail. A message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.

Officials at Clarkson University, a Division III school in Potsdam, say Hillary is on administrative leave. 'I am 100 percent innocent. That's all I have to say,' said Hillary as he was brought in to the Potsdam Police Department. District Attorney Mary Rain said Hillary was given the opportunity to turn himself in to Potsdam police, but didn't do so. 'The evidence in the case is significant,' she said. She said Garrett Phillips’ mother, Tandy Cyrus, and several family members were present at the arraignment. Rain said the Potsdam police 'did a great job in pressing the case forward.' At least two dozen people testified . before the grand jury, including Phillips' mother, Tandy Cyrus, and the . teenage daughter of Hillary. Hillary, who had been involved in a . relationship with Cyrus, was initially questioned by police as a person . of interest in the boy's death but never charged. The arrest . comes after four days of closed-door testimony before a grand jury that . began Monday. In a texted statement, Rain called it 'an emotional week'. He has sued the village of Potsdam and the police department for defamation, claiming leaks during the investigation negatively affected his reputation.","Clarkson University men's soccer coach Oral 'Nick' Hillary has been arrested in connection with the death of 12-year-old Garrett Phillips .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Lisa Ling has shared a pictured of her daughter while she updated her former co-hosts on The View about her life. The reporter chose an intimate snap of her now-1-year-old daughter Jett lying in between she and her husband Paul Song. During the reunion episode of The View this morning, Ling credited Barbara Walters for reminding her to take care of her professional life and not just focus on her career. Coming together for Barbara: Lisa Ling joined her former View co-hosts in a celebration for Walter's penultimate show . Family snap: Ling said that her daughter Jett, now 1, is her husband's doppelganger . 'Your best advice that you ever gave me was don’t neglect your personal life because I'm someone who is a bit of an over-achiever and working all the time,' Ling said to Walters during the legendary journalist's penultimate episode. ‘My daughter Jett has just changed our lives in such a profound way. And she is my husband's doppelganger, she looks just like him- they have the same hair when they wake up in the morning.’ Ling was 26-years-old when she chosen from an estimated 12,000 young women who applied to be the new View co-host in 1999 after Debbie Matenopoulos left the show. Showing the maternal role that she took towards her younger colleague, Walters said: 'I thought you'd never get married!' Concern: Ling said that the most important piece of advice that Walters gave her was to never neglect her personal life . Mentor: Walters was flanked by the 10 other women she brought on to her show over the past 17 years . 'I wanted you to get married. I didn't want you to neglect your personal life,' the 84-year-old said on Thursday. Ling married Paul Song, an oncologist, in May 2007, five years after leaving the morning show. While she was pregnant with Jett, she opened up to Anderson Cooper telling how she was nervous throughout the pregnancy because she had suffered a miscarriage two years earlier. She said: 'I was trying to keep [my pregnancy] quiet for a long time, but I'm starting to get to the point where it looks like I have this really big beer belly. Embracing motherhood: Ling, seen with her baby last June was she was only 2-months-old, said that Jett has 'profoundly' changed her life . Happy family: Ling married Paul Song, an oncologist, in 2007 (pictured in December with Jett) 'I figured I'd better share it publicly.' 'I just felt like such an incredible failure and I felt so alone when it happened,' she told Cooper of the miscarriage. 'I wasn't ready to tell any of my friends about it. I jumped online, I started pouring through blogs... Once I did start talking to friends, I realised that it's so pervasive. Almost every one of my friends has had one at one time or another but nobody talks about it.' Her decision to go public with her pregnancy on Cooper's show only came out of necessity, as she said that she was 'starting to get to the point where it looks like I have this really big beer belly.' Aside from starting a family, Ling has continued to dedicate time to her career since leaving The view, opting to focus on international reporting with a series of documentary reporting projects. Ling, now 40, has her own documentary series called 'Our America with Lisa Ling' on Oprah Winfrey's network. The all-female cast was reunited in a way they'd never been before with every co-host from the show's 17 seasons joined together at an extra large table .","Lisa Ling gave birth to her baby girl in March 2013 .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Martin Ziegler, Press Association . Former top women's football chief David Dein sent one of the e-mails which led to a sexism scandal engulfing Premier League boss Richard Scudamore, it has been claimed. Mr Dein, a former President of Arsenal Ladies FC who has spoken out firmly for women's rights, is accused by the Daily Mirror of sending a joke about 'skinny big-t***** broads' to Mr Scudamore. Premier League chief executive Mr Scudamore has apologised and is facing calls to quit after he forwarded the sexist email and several others to a lawyer friend. Claims: A newspaper report accused David Dein, pictured, of sending a sexist e-mail to Richard Scudamore . The scandal erupted this week after a former temporary PA to Mr Scudamore leaked several e-mails to the Sunday Mirror. Sports Minister Helen Grant branded the content of the e-mails 'completely unacceptable' while her Labour counterpart, Clive Efford, voiced fears the Premier League could take action against the woman who leaked the e-mails. 'There . is a role for whistleblowers in public life and what has been published . shows she was right to make these emails public, as this is a matter of . public concern,' he said. 'If the league take legal action against her that would be outrageous.' FA chairman Greg Dyke and league sponsor Barclays have voiced concerns while DLA Piper, the firm which employs Mr Scudamore's lawyer friend, has launched an investigation. Hot water: Premier League Chairman Richard Scudamore has been in trouble for some inappropriate emails . MailOnline has contacted Mr Dein asking him to respond to the Daily Mirror's claims. The 70-year-old, who lives in north London, has not yet responded publicly. A former vice-chairman of both Arsenal FC and the FA, Mr Dein helped create the Premier League in 1992 and opened the first ladies' youth academy to be funded by a men's Premier League club in 2000. At the time, he said: 'It is not a publicity . stunt. Ladies football is a serious sport within its own right. 'There . were 90,000 at the World Cup final and there will be more and more on . TV.' Since then, Mr Dein has repeatedly spoken out against sexism in football. He was the President of Arsenal Ladies FC and at one point, he said: 'It's hypocrisy for football to call itself a family game and then keep women out of the boardroom.' Disapproving: FA chairman Greg Dyke has said that Scudamore's emails are totally inappropriate . In a statement earlier this week, Mr Scudamore said the messages were 'private emails exchanged between colleagues and friends . of many years' that should not have been accessed by the temporary . employee. He accepted they were inappropriate and added: 'It was an . error of judgment that I will not make again'. Anger: Sports Minister Helen Grant condemned the content of the e-mails as unacceptable . An email from Scudamore sent to club chiefs just before the Sunday Mirror's publication became public this week. In it he states the story has 'been obviously timed for our last day for it to cause maximum embarrassment to me and therefore the Premier League. 'The newspaper is asserting that some of the content is sexist and inappropriate. You will be the judge.' That prompted football equality campaigner Edward Lord, who chairs the London FA Inclusion Advisory Group, to question Scudamore's position yesterday. He wrote on his blog: 'This seeming refusal to accept that the content of his emails were in fact sexist and inappropriate to my mind completely undermines his public apology, and leads to only one conclusion: that it was insincere and therefore unsustainable in the court of public opinion. 'If it is that Richard Scudamore didn't believe that what he had written was wrong less than a week ago, I think that it is highly unlikely that he has come to that conclusion in any reality since. On that basis it appears to me that his position is now looking untenable. 'If Scudamore doesn't accept the heinous nature of his sexist remarks and the impact they have had, not only on women in the game, but on the perception they create of football's commitment to equality and inclusion in general, then regrettably I must reach the conclusion that he may be in the wrong job.'","Daily Mirror claims Mr Dein sent e-mail about 'skinny big-t***** broads'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Security company G4S has been putting up asylum seekers in four-star hotel rooms because of a shortage of beds in specialist hostels. Migrants stayed in the £100-a-night four star Holiday Inn in Barnsley, Yorks, for over a month. Far from the prison-like conditions detention centres are famed for, the plush rooms come complete with satellite TV, free broadband and 24 hour room service and guests can use the onsite Bannatyne health club. Security company G4S booked more than 400 rooms at the four-star Holiday Inn, Barnsley, for migrants to stay in after accommodation ran out at specialist hostels . More than 400 rooms were booked by G4S at the Holiday Inn and nearby Ramada Encore between mid-March and late April. The company is well-known for its failure to provide enough security staff at the London 2012 Olympics and holds the lucrative government contract to accommodate asylum seekers until their applications are decided on. And on top of providing half-board, four-star accommodation they failed to tell the police and council of the change as is specified in their contract. Although the exact cost of the accommodation has not been disclosed, bed, breakfast and an evening meal at the Holiday Inn can be more than £100-a-night. Asylum seekers in Barnsley would normally stay at Angel Lodge in Wakefield which has 250 beds. A G4S spokesman said: 'We were short of accommodation in the region and they ended up in there. I'm not sure why this hotel was chosen in particular. Although the exact cost of the accommodation has not been disclosed, bed, breakfast and an evening meal at the Holiday Inn can be more than £100-a-night . 'We're not obliged to tell the Police or the Council we just do it as a courtesy and I don't know if we did in this case. 'It was far fewer than 400 rooms and they were only there for a few days. I don't know exactly how many or exactly how long though. 'Any extra expense was born by us though, not the tax payer.' The Home Office said they were aware G4S had used a hotel in Barnsley for temporary accommodation for 'a short period of time' but this had now ended. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it and providing safe and secure accommodation while applications are considered. 'We continue to consult with our providers and local authorities to monitor existing agreements and ensure that performance levels are sustained, and community cohesion issues assessed.'","G4S booked more than 400 rooms at a two hotels for migrants .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Tragic: Chantelle Wood, 22, took her own life in August last year . A nurse who was raped by a family friend when she was younger killed herself after suffering harrowing flashbacks of the ordeal, an inquest has heard. Chantelle Wood, 22, stabbed herself after re-discovering a magazine article from 2009 in which she told of the abuse she suffered when she was a teenager. The mother of one, from Exeter in Devon, died in hospital six days later from brain injuries and a heart attack brought on as a result of the stab wounds. Her mother Caroline Wills told the coroner that her daughter suddenly became ‘ill and stressed’ in the months leading up to her death in August last year. She said: ‘She started talking to me about flashbacks, when she was raped four times by a family friend. ‘She started talking to me about what happened to her. She was very distressed and could not concentrate on her work properly. ‘She was beautiful and bubbly and had a three-year-old son. She had a very good job as an auxiliary nurse at the hospital. She had lots of friends and loved her job so much.’ Mrs Wills said her daughter did not take up counselling after she was raped, when she was aged between 12 and 14, because she was strong and ‘put it behind her’. However, she started suffering flashbacks to the abuse after finding an old magazine, which she had told her story to, while re-decorating her bedroom last year. Her family said it was the trigger for her rapid decline with her mother, describing her daughter as ‘very distressed’ in the days leading up to her death. She said: ‘She was a normal bubbly girl bringing up her son and had not spoken for a long time about what had happened to her.' Mrs Wills said she was shocked when her daughter came downstairs and told her she wanted to kill herself. ‘I was so shocked. She had never said anything like that before,’ she said. ‘She had had a lot of flashbacks.' Mrs Wills immediately took her to see the family's GP, Dr Alice Godwin, who prescribed anti-depressants and contacted the mental health crisis team. Dr Godwin told the inquest, held in Exeter, Devon, today, that she was happy with the crisis team’s response saying Miss Wood had no previous history of suicidal thoughts or behaviour and was unlikely to harm herself because of her young son Charlie. Mental health practitioner Chris Porteus said Miss Wood wasn't seen face-to-face by one of the team and said that decision was ‘taken on clinical grounds' and 'not because it was easier’. Assistant coroner Andrew Cox recorded an open conclusion at County Hall in Exeter, Devon, saying there was not enough evidence to record a suicide verdict . He said the crisis team had limited resources and said the decision to see her within 24 hours was sufficient ‘at that point in time’. He said: ‘She denied suicidal thoughts. I was aware of the child sex abuse. I did everything I could to help her. She had never self-harmed or attempted suicide in her life. ‘It is unlikely she intended to kill herself.’ He said it was the first time in his 42 years’ experience he had appeared before a coroner’s court. Two of Miss Wood’s sisters told the coroner she was also troubled by other issues, including concerns about her rapist being released and child care issues with her ex-partner. Whitney Lewis said her sister had recently received a letter telling her that the person convicted of raping her was going to be ‘out on parole sometime soon’. She said: ‘She was upset about it. She was worried about him coming after her.’ 'This is an absolutely tragic case, deeply sad' - Assistant coroner Andrew Cox . Detective Sergeant Adrian Hawkins said the letter from the Probation Service to Miss Wood had led her to believe the rapist was to be released in 2005 - when in fact it was 2015 before he could seek parole. He said: ‘The way it was worded sounded like he was going to be released from jail.’ In fact it was telling her he was being moved to another jail, he said. Miss Wood’s other sister, Danielle, said the victim was feeling down in the days leading up to her death citing child care issues and concerns about the way she looked. Assistant coroner Andrew Cox recorded an open conclusion saying there was not enough evidence to record a suicide verdict. He said: ‘This is an absolutely tragic case, deeply sad. A young woman, with a child, with her life in front of her who has died in this fashion.’ He said Miss Wood suffered from a number of issues including relationship problems with her ex-partner over child care arrangements, low self-esteem about the way she looked, and concerns about the release of her convicted rapist. He said she had a ‘loving family and no one had expected her to take the action she did’. He also told the inquest her GP acted appropriately and said the crisis team reacted within 24 hours before adding that ‘in an ideal world she would have been seen face-to-face’.","Chantelle Wood, 22, stabbed herself after suffering flashbacks, inquest told .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Suspended: Roger Bainton allegedly botched up 26 per cent of his experimental face surgery operations . A surgeon suspended over 88 alleged botched operations has blamed his failure on patients smoking, drinking and taking drugs. Roger Bainton was struck off the dental register and suspended by the General Medical Council over a death in Scotland in 1999. But he relocated to Stoke-on-Trent where he continued practising - and a shocking 26 per cent of his patients suffered surgical complications. In an extraordinary attempt to defend his errors, the disgraced surgeon claimed the victims' lifestyle was to blame. He also said patients in The Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent, have a 'weaker genetic make up', leading to further surgery mix-ups, a Royal College of Surgeons report reveals. The document states Mr Bainton - who rebuilds the faces of assault or . accident victims - used an unproven and experimental bone substitute . without personally telling 33 of his 123 patients. He started implanting the material into the eye sockets of the patients . at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2007. The technique had only previously been used on non-facial bones. But it was stopped in 2012 after colleagues blew the whistle and reported their concerns. Finally, in February 2013, Mr Bainton was suspended and the RCS was called to carry out an internal review. It said Mr . Bainton blamed his 26 per cent failure rate on 'a high incidence of drinkers, smokers and drug . addicts' in North Staffordshire. The report authors added: 'He tended to rationalise . poor patient outcomes and repeated procedures as being the result of the . patient's own lifestyle. Mr Bainton was suspended from University Hospital of North Staffordshire in February 2013 . 'There is now a legacy of patients who have had . unproven surgical techniques applied to their care without adequate . consent and who will likely require long-term follow-ups.' Karen Reynolds, of Freeth Cartwright . LLP, who is representing 30 of Mr Bainton's patients, said: 'The RCS . report indicates significant failings, not only in Mr Bainton's . practice, but within the maxillofacial department and the hospital trust . itself.' The report also reveals: . Hospital leaders and the oral and maxillofacial department where Mr Bainton worked were condemned in the report. It found 'no strong clinical leadership' which allowed the surgeons to run services without question and left them operating independently. Today, hospital officials reiterated their apologies to patients who may have been harmed during or following facial surgery. They accepted the RCS findings that Mr Bainton had carried out 'unproven' techniques or had used surgical procedures unnecessarily . Thirty-three of the 88 patients were recalled after being treated with the experimental bone substitute by Mr Bainton. A further 36 patients had jaw surgery when non-surgical measures would normally be adopted. The final 19 patients could have had eye socket surgery needlessly. Medical Director Robert Courteney-Harris said: 'We drew up a comprehensive action plan in response to each of the RCS's recommendations and completed the key actions some 12 months ago. 'Other, longer term actions, such as the appointment of a new oral and maxillofacial consultant with an interest in trauma, were finalised earlier this year. The appointee took up his post in March. 'We have been committed from the outset to being open and transparent with our patients, regulatory bodies and commissioners. 'Our first and last priority is to ensure our patients are able to have full confidence in the quality of care and treatment they receive from us and that any departure from these high standards is thoroughly investigated and acted upon.' Mr Bainton was unavailable for comment.","Roger Bainton carried out experimental face surgery on assault victims .

His left arm is covered with a series of offensive images - including a German eagle, used by Hitler during the Second World War, and two German planes diving towards a Jewish Star of David, coloured in yellow — the same colour as the badge Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is under increasing scrutiny over extremist candidates within his party . The shock image comes as the party's leader Nigel Farage was challenged over another candidate's suggestion for gay men to be shot to force other homosexuals to 'decide' to be straight. John Sullivan wrote on Facebook in February: 'I rather wonder if we shot one 'poofter' (GBLT whatevers [sic]), whether the next 99 would decide on balance, that they weren't after-all? We might then conclude that it's not a matter of genetics, but rather more a matter of education.' Mr Farage said he had never heard of Mr Sullivan and said he would face a 'disciplinary charge'. The Ukip leader also claimed his party was given a rougher ride in the media than the other parties. But he was not challenged over the Nazi shame pictures which emerged on the website Political Scrapbook earlier today. Mr O'Doherty, the candidate at the centre of the row, is standing for Ukip in Hastings where the party boasts one councillor. The picture - for a limited edition art book, The Dualism Volume 2 - was allegedly taken when he worked as a part-time character model. MailOnine attempted to contact Mr O'Doherty at his email address, which includes the phrase 'stukeboy', but he did not reply to our emails. The plane on the top of his arm is similar to a Stuka dive bomber, used by the Nazis in their invasions of France, Poland and Russia. Nigel Farage faces a barrage of hostile questions on LBC earlier today. The Ukip leader was accused of being a divisive politician playing on people's antagonism towards foreigners . A telephone number for the Ukip candidate is not publicly listed, but a party source told MailOnline they were 'working on the assumption' that the man in the picture was Mr O'Doherty. But they would only release a statement claiming that they were not a racist party and would be investigating the allegations. A former Ukip supporter, described as a 'rising star' by Nigel Farage, quit the party this week - claiming it was pandering to racists . A Ukip spokesman said: 'Ukip is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values. 'Where evidence is produced to indicate a breach it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the National Executive Committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure.' Mr O’Doherty has previously sparked controversy by writing on Facebook that ‘there is no such thing as a benign Muslim’. He posted the remarks in relation to a story he shared about a Birmingham school at the centre of allegations of a takeover plot by Islamic hardliners. Mr O'Doherty is standing as a Ukip candidate in the Central St Leonards ward in the Hastings Borough Council elections on May 22. The post, dated April 21, said: 'There is no such thing as a benign Muslim, only a latent adherent of Koranic dogma.' He also defended a Ukip candidate who said comedian Lenny Henry should ‘emigrate to a black country’. Mr O’Doherty wrote on the Daily Telegraph’s Facebook site: 'Lenny Henry is the one who raised the issue of racism by his proposition. 'The repudiation may not be pretty, but does it not have validity? He wants to set quotas which will do more harm than good. He is an opportunist grandstander.'","Picture emerges of Hastings candidate Kevin O'Doherty in shock pose .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Red-faced police scored an own goal when they evacuated hundreds of fans from a football stadium - after officers accidentally left a fake bomb in an executive box. Around 30,000 fans were getting ready to celebrate Wolverhampton Wanderers' League One title at Molineux on the last day of the season when the drama unfolded. Terrified supporters discovered the suspicious package in an executive box and raised the alarm, resulting in several hundred fans being evacuated from one stand. Samuel Ricketts scores Wolves' first goal against Carlisle United at Molineux, after the police had mistakenly evacuated one stand before the match . Concerned staff even considered calling off the game – just minutes before kick-off on Saturday, May 3. But it was revealed soon afterwards that the bomb was an imitation explosive device left behind by careless police after a training exercise. An investigation has now been launched by West Midlands Police into how the fake bomb could have been left inside the stadium after it received an official complaint. Despite the police erroneously evacuating one stand at Molineux before the match, Wolves won the match 3-0 and the League One title and celebrate in style . Wolves Chief Executive Jez Moxey said that he had expressed his concern to the force ‘in the strongest possible manner’ after the game - effectively a promotion party for the fans - was almost scrapped. He added: ‘Understandably, this incident caused significant distress to the individual supporters concerned and we have, of course, been in close dialogue with the specific box holder. ‘However, although only a small number of our fans were affected, it could easily have resulted in a wide scale evacuation of the stadium which, under the circumstances, would have had more serious implications. ‘We have been in contact with West Midlands Police and explained our concerns in the strongest possible manner.’ Mr Moxey said he was satisfied that police had acted quickly and responsibly by issuing a full apology and launching an investigation, and reassured supporters Molineux was a safe venue to visit. With league rules stating that all final day games must kick off at the same time any delay for the match with relegation threatened Carlisle United would have had serious repercussions. Goals from Sam Ricketts, Michael Jacobs and Nouha Dicko won the game 3-0 for Wolves, who lifted the League One trophy after the match. Fans expressed their disgust at being ordered to leave the ground before kick-off with some admitting they missed out on joining in their team's celebrations. A stand at Molineux, the home of Wolverhampton Wanderers, was evacuated before the final match of the season when spectators found a fake bomb in an executive box . Season-ticket holder David Billinghurst, 45, from Wolverhampton, said: ‘It was a farce. I've been to every home game this season and was really looking forward to seeing them lift the trophy but I was ordered out the ground. ‘Officers suddenly started telling fans to leave the stadium as a precaution and I obeyed. I left the ground and only realised it was a mistake when I got home. ‘I'm gutted I missed out on watching the team on their most memorable day of the season. I'm the laughing stock with my mates now because I just went home.’ Chief Inspector Ian Marsh, the Silver Commander in charge of policing for the match, said: ‘An imitation explosive device was found in an executive box at Molineux Stadium on Saturday against Carlisle United. It had been placed there during a training exercise. ‘Whilst the device posed no danger to anyone we appreciate it may have caused concern for the supporters who found it and we apologise for any distress it caused. ‘We've received a complaint and will respond to this in due course. ‘The matter has been referred to West Midlands Police Professional Standards Department who will look into the incident and advise on any learning that may arise.’","30,000 arrived to see Wolves celebrate League One title at Molineux .

An insider claims HMP Haverigg, Cumbria, was landed with an £80,000 bill for the bungle, although the Ministry of Justice refuse to confirm the figure. The missing keys turned up after locks at the 644-inmate jail were replaced. The Ministry of Justice has confirmed several locks at HMP Haverigg were changed after prison keys went missing at the jail on May 6.

The MoJ said all inmates were in their cells at the time the keys were lost and stressed the “human error” had not put posed any risk of escape from the jail or threat to the public. A spokesman remained tight-lipped over the number of locks the keys were able to open but confirmed they were for internal doors only. He said the keys were lost due to “human error” and said no inmates were involved in the incident. A prison insider claimed changing locks at the jail could cost as much as £80,000 - but the MoJ said they did not recognise the figure (library image) A prison insider claimed changing locks at the jail following the incident could cost as much as £80,000, however, the MoJ said they did not recognise the figure and added it is 'too early' to put costs on replacing the specialist locks. The jail’s 644 inmates are deemed low risk by Ministry of Justice guidelines, placing them as category C and D - the lowest on the scale. Now, the prison has launched an investigation to find out how the keys went missing and has confirmed “a number” of locks at the jail are set to be replaced as a precautionary measure. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'As a security precaution a number of locks at HMP Haverigg are being changed following the loss of some keys. This was an isolated incident and there was never any risk to the public. Incidents like this are extremely rare. 'We always investigate them thoroughly and update our security measures accordingly.' The spokesman confirmed the keys have since been recovered and said no members of staff have been disciplined as a result of the incident. A report into standards at the prison is due to be released by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons this month and a HMIP spokeswoman previously said it could be as early as next week.","HMP Haverigg, Cumbria, changed its locks after staff lost keys .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Nicola Hicks, 42, was told she wasn't allowed to buy more than three packs of steak from her local Morrisons supermarket in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire . A mother who wanted to buy four packets of steak for a family dinner was told she was only allowed buy three by a supermarket cashier. Nicola Hicks, 42, of Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, was astonished when the woman on the checkout at her local Morrisons in Hoddesdon held back one of the packets and called over her supervisor. The supervisor agreed that four packets was too many, and only allowed Mrs Hicks to buy three packets. When Mrs Hicks' mother-in-law, who was with her, tried to buy one pack separately, she was refused. Mrs Hicks, a mother of three, said that at first, she didn't understand why the cashier would only scan three of the two-packs of steak. She said: 'The lady on the till scanned three and then said she had to call the supervisor.  I had no idea why, and asked if there was a problem. 'She said ""I can't let you buy this last packet"", and when she called her supervisor over, she agreed. 'I said ""Why on earth not - it's not alcohol, it's not medicine, it's only steak"", but they just refused, saying there wouldn't be enough left for anyone else. 'I just couldn't believe what was happening - there was plenty left behind on the shelves, and no signs saying that it was on special offer so you could only buy a few. 'Everyone in the queue behind me was absolutely gobsmacked.' Mrs Hicks, who works in pharmaceuticals sales, argued her case with supermarket staff for quarter of an hour before realising she was not going to win. As she left, another customer offered to buy the steak for her surreptitiously. Mrs Hicks said: 'That was the only way I could buy enough meat to feed my family - giving another customer some money and getting them to buy the steak for me. 'I found it disgusting that it's a local store and I couldn't buy enough meat for a family Sunday dinner.'She wanted to buy four packs of two steaks to feed herself, her husband, her three children and her parents on Sunday night. Steak: The mother of three said she felt 'humiliated' by her encounter with two members of staff at Morrisons . A Morrisons spokesman blamed the problem on computer error, but Mrs Hicks says no-one has contacted her . A spokesman for Morrisons said the meat had been on special offer the day before, which meant sales were limited. They said: 'We are very sorry that Mrs Hicks was unable to purchase the steak she wanted. 'There had been a system fault on our part that meant that the products couldn’t be processed through the till. 'We are very keen to work with her to make sure that she is still happy to shop with us in the future.' But Mrs Hicks said: 'I was humiliated when I was in the right.  I wasn't trying to buy alcohol or pills, just steak. 'They say it was computer error but if that were the case, they would have allowed my mother-in-law to buy the steak.  And to make matters worse, I still haven't heard a thing from Morrisons.'","Nicola Hicks, 42, wanted to buy four two-packs of meat for a family dinner .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Benefits cheats will be forced to repay taxpayers’ money more quickly after it emerged five fraudsters claimed almost £750,000. Ministers named and shamed those responsible for stealing the largest amounts from the public purse with a vow that benefit fraud will not be tolerated. Among those jailed in the last year are a mother who claimed her children were disabled when they were appearing in West End shows and auditioning for Britain’s Got Talent and a man who said he was too sick to get a job caught working as a builder and riding elephants in India. Amanda Webber was jailed for four years after receiving £363,250 in benefits, claiming her children had dozens of physical and mental problems including poor co-ordination, lack of spatial awareness, difficulties walking, unclear speech and a fear of crowds . ‪Tougher rules are being introduced in an attempt to further claimants from committing benefit fraud and ensure stolen money is returned on top of any fine or custodial sentence handed out by the courts. It means that if a fraudster is still living on benefits, up to 40 per cent of their cash can be taken to repay what they stole. Up to 40 per cent of wages can also be deducted straight from a claimant’s pay packet. Bailiffs will also be used to confiscate expensive gadgets, jewellery and possessions from convicted benefit cheats. Illegal immigrant Bola Taiwo Olayeni, 49, living in London, used a stolen identity to claim £119,000 . The Department for Work and Pensions released details of what it said were the five biggest fraud cases where the claimant has been jailed in the last year. Amanda Jane Webber, 43, of Isaacs Lane, Hayward’s Heath, was jailed for four years on 23 May 2013 at Lewes Crown Court. She received £363,250 in benefits in total, claiming her children had dozens of physical and mental problems including poor co-ordination, lack of spatial awareness, difficulties walking, unclear speech and a fear of crowds. In reality, they were high achievers who attended private school and had performed in West End shows such as Oliver!, Billy Elliot and Les Miserables. Four of the supposedly disabled children had joined two siblings to audition for the television show Britain’s Got Talent under the name the Von Webbers. Illegal immigrant Bola Taiwo Olayeni, 49, living in London, was sentenced on 14 January this year to four years imprisonment, two to be served on license. She pleaded guilty to fraudulently claiming a total of nearly £119,000 by stealing the identity of a UK citizen. She used the new ID to fraudulently claim Income Support and Housing and Council Tax Benefits. Stephen Worton, 55, from Hill Street, . Liverpool, claimed £88,800 in Disability Living Allowance for people too . sick to work, but he was found working as a builder and roofing . contractor. Pictures also emerged of him on expensive holidays, including riding an elephant in Goa. ‪ . Mother-of-seven Cleo Embley was overpaid £94,063 in various benefits while Stephen Worton, claimed £88,800 in Disability Living Allowance for people to sick too work, but he was found working as a builder and roofing contractor . Cleo Embley, 37, from Bridge St, Rishton, was branded Britain's most brazen benefits cheat after it emerged she had claimed the cash by pretending to be single when she was actually living with her partner and father of her children. She claimed £94,000 in Income Support and Housing and Council Tax Benefits, but after being caught was handed a 22-week prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court. Welfare minister Lord Freud said the government was determined to claw back more money from fraudsters . Victoria Tracey, 33, from Hathaway Road, Liverpool, got a nine-month prison sentence on 17 January this year for lying about living with her partner, who was also her landlord. Amazingly she initially denied that her was the father of her children, until investigators pointed out he had tattoos of their names on his arm. Tracey pleaded guilty to falsely claiming £80,500 while going on two expensive cruises and admitting that her Housing Benefit went towards her partner’s mortgage. ‪ . ‪Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said: ‘Benefit fraud is deplorable and these five examples show that we won’t tolerate it. ‘Our fraud teams investigate suspected cheats and we have toughened the rules to ensure that convicted fraudsters don’t just face criminal prosecution, but that we make sure stolen money is paid back in larger amounts so we recover it more quickly.’ Figures this week showed Jobseeker’s Allowance and Income Support fraud and error overpayments have fallen to lowest recorded levels. New figures show fraud and error in the benefits system stands at £3.3billion, down £130million, or 2 per cent of the total welfare bill.","New rules mean 40% of benefits or wages can be used to take back cash .

"By . James Chapman . Demands: It was alleged that David Laws demanded Cornish minority status in return for another policy . The decision to recognise the Cornish as a minority group was the result of ‘petty’ horse-trading over policies between the coalition parties, senior Tories claimed last night. Amid deepening tensions, it was claimed the Liberal Democrat minister David Laws - one of Nick Clegg’s closest allies – demanded the move in return for signing off another policy. The Lib Dems are said to have refused to agree to reforms of town hall pensions, which could save taxpayers up to £600million a year, unless the Cornwall announcement was made. Cornish people were granted the same rights and protections as other ‘national minorities’ in the surprise move last month. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander unveiled the plan on a visit to Bodmin. It appeared to be part of an effort by the to shore up faltering support in the South West, traditionally one of the party’s strongholds. The claim that it was part of yet more ‘horse-trading’ will add to growing concern among senior Tories that government is being reduced to ‘transactional’ deal-making with their coalition colleagues. Last night a Cabinet source identified Mr Laws as a significant problem for relations between the two parties. Conservative ministers did not disagree with the proposal for Cornwall, but thought it bizarre that Mr Laws apparently sought to link it to a major austerity measure. ‘You can do a deal with Danny [Alexander]. He will do what he says he’s going to do. But I have never come across a more tricky politician than David Laws,’ said the Cabinet source. ‘You wouldn’t believe the horse-trading that we have to do and how silly some of the gimmicks that they want are.’ Tory Cabinet ministers are rallying to the support of Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has been embroiled in increasingly bitter public disputes with the Lib Dems in recent weeks. Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed Mr Clegg twice suggested police should be brought in to investigate damaging leaks about his plans to extend free school meals, which he blamed on Dominic Cummings – a former senior aide to Mr Gove. Deal: The Cornish are now a minority under an EU convention, and the Cornish language receives state funding . Ministers insist problems are not limited to Mr Gove’s department, but are increasingly happening elsewhere. One example, the source said, was the Communities and Local Government Department’s bid to make vital savings in the management of town hall pensions. Ministers agreed to bring in a bank or actuarial firm to cut huge administration costs, which vary greatly across almost 90 local government retirement schemes. But the Lib Dems insisted on the Cornish announcement in exchange for agreeing to the reforms, the source claimed. The Cornish have been afforded the status of a national minority, made under a European convention. Only 557 people claim Cornish is their main language, but teaching of the dialect is receiving government funding. It emerged yesterday Mr Clegg has asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, to issue a formal warning to Mr Cummings about his duty of confidentiality. Mr Cummings said he was prepared to repeat his allegations against the Deputy Prime Minister ‘under oath’. He accused Mr Clegg of lying about funding of free school meals for pupils aged five, six and seven. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It’s in the nature of coalitions that negotiations happen and David Laws has the role of leading those talks for us every week.’","Surprise announcement was a 'petty' trade-off, claim senior Tories .

"By . James Chapman . The long-delayed official report into the Iraq war must be published by the end of the year, David Cameron insisted last night. In a dramatic intervention that appears to set him at odds with his most senior civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Prime Minister said the public wanted ‘answers’ on the 2003 conflict and ‘shouldn’t have to wait too much longer’. Whitehall sources said Mr Cameron wanted  an agreement reached quickly between the Cabinet Office and the Iraq inquiry team that would see ‘as much as can sensibly be included’ of the most sensitive documents in the final report. A debate over publishing private talks between Mr Bush and Mr Blair is holding up the report . The Prime Minister is said to have been furious at suggestions that the findings – already held up for several years – might not now be published until after next year’s general election. Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry held its last public hearings in 2011, but publication of its conclusions has been held back by wrangling over  private communications between Tony Blair and George Bush. Sir Jeremy is said to have backed concerns from intelligence services and diplomats that publishing the documents might jeopardise the ‘special relationship’ between the UK and the US. Labour strategists are said to be concerned at the prospect of the spectre of Iraq being raised in the months before the election, since the  conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters into the arms of the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010. Cameron said the public wanted answers on the 2003 conflict and 'shouldn't have to wait much longer' Mr Cameron yesterday told Sky News the report should be made public by the end of 2014. He added: ‘It’s frustrating but it is not in my gift; this is an independent inquiry. ‘I want to see it published soon, my understanding is that they will be able to publish before the end of the year and I very much hope they can deliver on that timetable. ‘The public wants to see the answers of the inquiry and I think we shouldn’t have to wait too much longer.’","PM said he wanted answers on the 2003 conflict by the end of 2014 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A disabled pensioner who lost more than £700,000 in a telesales scam has won most of his money back. David Parker, 77, was ‘cajoled, bullied and, on occasions lied to’ in order to get him to part with his retirement savings as part of a 'land banking' scheme. Cold-callers convinced him to invest huge amounts of money buying up land in the scheme, in the hope it would be later be sold to developers at a huge premium. Ruling: David Parker, 77, was given more than £600,000 compensation at the High Court, part of the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured . But the land - small plots in Buckinghamshire, King's Lynn in Norfolk and Slough in Berkshire - had 'zero' chance of being given planning permission, and turned out to be practically worthless. Mr Parker, who is hard of hearing, suffers from cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, spent a total of £705,895 on the scheme, including £100,000 in 'facilitation fees' between June 2009 and February 2011, a High Court judge said. And even though the company running the scheme - part of umbrella group The Property Partnership - liquidated with debts of more than £5million, Mr Parker was still granted compensation from a solicitor whom the court ruled was in on the scheme. Saying that the solicitor - who had earned hefty fees from legal work for The Property Partnership (TPP) - was 'party to a common design' in the scheme, the judge ordered him to pay Mr Parker damages of £606,000. The solicitor, who has not been named for legal reasons, had been disciplined twice by the Law Society before for mishandling clients' funds and was fined a total of £25,000, the court heard. Worthless investment: In land banking scams, investors are sold small plots of land with the implication that they will rocket in value and be used for investment - but in reality the land often has no chance of being given planning permission. Pictured is protected green belt land in Suffolk . The judge said there was no evidence that the solicitor, who carried out conveyancing work for TPP, had told any lies himself or had any knowledge that telesales staff were ‘peddling’ misleading information to Mr Parker. Even though he was not acting for Mr Parker personally, nor did he owe him a legal duty of care, the judge pointed out that he was earning money from the scheme, and could easily have pointed out that there was 'zero' chance of the investment coming good. The judge said: “But there is no evidence that he did any of these things. Why is that? 'It seems to me that there can really only be one answer: like TPP, he was eager to ensure the success of each scheme because he would be likely to benefit substantially from such success. 'It was certainly not in his financial interests that anything should be done which might have the effect of dissuading purchasers from investing in the schemes, quite the reverse'. Rejecting claims that Mr Parker had himself been negligent in investing in the scheme, the judge said TPP had ‘expressly discouraged’ him from obtaining independent legal advice - saying that it offered a ‘free legal service’. The solicitor was ordered to pay Mr Parker back the money he had lost, less the £99,895 facilitation fees for which he could not be held responsible.","David Parker, 77, was conned into investing life savings in 'land banking'

"By . Harriet Arkell . Louise Pollard, 28, from Plymouth, admitted defrauding childless couples by telling them she was pregnant and then saying she had miscarried . A surrogate mother pretended she was pregnant and then faked having miscarriages to take thousands of pounds from couples desperate to be parents. Louise Pollard, 28, of Plymouth, took money from two couples in exchange for promising to help them have a baby.  But after telling them she was pregnant, and taking their money in exchange for her services, she then claimed she had miscarried. She was caught after one of the couples grew suspicious and went to police, and earlier this month, the serial surrogate pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to three charges of fraud against two couples. Pollard, a former PA who four years ago said she was carrying Osama Bin Laden's grandchildren before suffering a miscarriage, will be sentenced for defrauding couples Keith and Josephine Barnett and Winston and Debra Kaba next week. Today, one of her victims, who paid Pollard more than £10,000 to carry their baby, said they had had a 'horrendous' experience as their hopes for a baby of their own were dashed. And Pollard's own brother, Shaun McLoughlin, criticised her, telling the Sun's Alex West: 'The parents pinned all their hopes on her. 'They had to go through the agony of believing they were going to have a child and then that the baby had died.' He told The Sun: 'Who would do that to another human being?' Mr McLoughlin, a married double-glazing salesman from Bristol, said his sister found the couples online, before offering to help them. He said they would pay her to travel to their homes where she would impregnate herself with the husband's sperm.  It is illegal to pay a surrogate more than reasonable expenses in Britain. Mr McLoughlin said that his sister had tried to drag him into her fraudulent activities, once asking him to fake a doctor's note for her, and also asking for a urine sample from his pregnant wife, Kat, saying she needed it for a drugs test.  He said his wife refused to give the sample. Mother of two Pollard, who is now on remand, will be sentenced next Friday at Bristol Crown Court. Pollard, pictured with another baby she gave up, will be sentenced at Bristol Crown Court next Friday . She was caught after one of the couples, who paid her more than £10,000 to carry their child, became suspicious about what Pollard said was a doctor's note saying she had suffered a miscarriage. Her brother said he warned her that she would get into trouble when he realised what she was doing.  Pollard has worked as a PA and a pole dancer before getting into surrogacy, which she once described as her 'calling'. Her admission of how she tricked the couples casts new light on her dealings with Osama Bin Laden's son, Omar. In 2010, Pollard told how she had been implanted with embryos from Omar and his then 54-year-old British wife, Zaina (formerly known as Jane Felix-Browne). Pollard said she was carrying twins for Zaina Bin Laden, pictured with her, left, and her then husband, Osama Bin Laden's son, Omar, but lost them after she was reportedly attacked while walking in a street in Syria . She posed with Mrs Bin Laden and a positive pregnancy test and defended herself against criticism that she was having a terrorist's grandchildren, saying: 'Just because they have the surname they do, doesn't mean they have done anything wrong.' But ten weeks into the pregnancy Pollard, who said she was carrying twins for the couple, said she had lost the babies after she was attacked in the street while she was in Syria with Mrs Bin Laden. This morning Dean Lomas, the son of Mrs Bin Laden, who has reverted back to her original name, said she was not well enough and would not comment. Bristol Crown Court said Pollard was on remand awaiting pre-sentence review. Surrogacy advice: Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, right, with partner Tony, left, and their twins Aspen and Saffron when they were babies . Surrogacy expert Barrie Drewitt-Barlow told MailOnline that cases like Pollard's are increasingly common. Mr Drewitt-Barlow, head of social work at the British Surrogacy Centre, said: 'We hear about cases like this all the time and it is so sad. 'Often the people who turn to surrogacy do so for a very good reason: perhaps they have had cancer, or they have lost a child, and they have often been through so much already.  So to have to deal with this as well is heart-breaking.' Mr Drewitt-Barlow, who with his partner, Tony, was the first same sex couple in Britain to use a surrogate mother and be named on the birth certificate as parents, added: 'I heard of one woman who was pregnant with her own child but had four or five childless couples on the go at the same time and told them all it was their baby. 'Other people start talking about their wish for a baby in the pub, and before they know it are in a stranger's house inseminating themselves with a syringe two weeks later. 'I've also heard of people in Nigeria offering to be surrogates in exchange for cash.' He said: 'Surrogacy in the UK isn't illegal but it is illegal to pay someone more than reasonable expenses, which is set at about £15,000. 'People going into surrogacy need to make sure they are doing it with someone who had had the proper checks, and the only place in the UK that carries out these checks, including screening for HIV, is the British Surrogacy Centre.'","Louise Pollard, 28, of Plymouth, took thousands of pounds to carry babies .

Two-year-old Romeo Chudasama has been reunited with his mother Rekha, right, after being found wandering the streets of London by passer-by Louise Tarrant after he walked out of his nursery . Romeo’s mother Rekha, a 39-year-old bus driver, told the Evening Standard she has not taken her son back since. 'I . know accidents happen,' she said. 'If my son had hurt himself while at nursery, I . would have dealt with it. He is a very active child and very outgoing, . and he loves jumping around. 'But I can’t forgive them for letting a child go for a walk in the road.' She told ITV's London Tonight programme that her son now attends a different nursery. She said: 'You leave your child in the care of a nursery, you would expect your child to be kept safe at all times, at any given moment. 'I just imagined the worst.' Romeo was found by passing motorist Louise Tarrant, who picked him up and knocked on doors of houses along the street before returning him to the nursery 50 metres away. Ms Tarrant said the nursery didn't seem that concerned when she returned the youngster to them. She told ITV: 'He was running in the middle of the road with no shoes on. I was completely shocked. 'I picked him up and he didn’t talk or anything. I was knocking on the doors asking: “does anyone recognise this little boy?” 'There didn’t seem much concern [from the nursery].' Romeo, pictured, was found wandering the streets with no shoes on by passing motorist Louise Tarrant, who picked him up and knocked on doors of houses along the street before returning him to the nursery . The incident on Thursday last week came to light after Romeo's mother wrote about it on the East Dulwich Forum website. 'This . is not the first time!' she claimed on the forum. 'Ofsted and Southwark . Council are involved in this too. The police were also informed. 'My son was found in the road and by a . member of the public. It seems the nursery were unaware he was missing . until he was returned.' Speaking at the nursery today, a woman who described herself as the manager but would not give her name told MailOnline: 'There were things in the reports that weren't true but we don't want to comment further. 'Our statement is that the nursery's priority is the safety of the children in our care. 'The minute the incident occurred we took initial steps to notify the regulatory body and secure the main entrance of the building. 'We're going to undertake a full review with Ofsted.' The nursery's last Ofsted report in 2012 described it as 'well-established' with 22 children on the roll, all sharing access to an outdoor play area. The report rated it as good, adding: 'Good systems are in place to help safeguard children and promote their welfare. Some parents have vowed to boycott the Oak Tree Nursery in East Dulwich, pictured, after staff apparently failed to notice the youngster had gone missing . 'Staff have attended safeguarding training and have appropriate policies in place. 'This ensures they are able to take prompt action if they have any concerns regarding children's welfare.' But other parents on the East Dulwich Forum complained about standards at the nursery in recent months. One wrote: 'I was very happy with it until he went back in the New Year. The second Monday after New Year I dropped him off and found the door to be wide open and none of the staff near it. 'I went in and the nursery was very chaotic. When I picked him up after lunch the door was wide open again with no staff to be seen.' Another parent added: 'I removed my child before Easter as I wasn't happy about things - seemed too chaotic and badly run.' Southwark Council described the incident as 'very worrying' and said it had supported the family in finding an alternative nursery. A council spokesperson said: 'Ofsted is responsible for regulating and inspecting private nurseries. 'However, this incident is clearly very worrying for local parents and we are working with the nursery to help them improve their safety policies and procedures. 'The council has also been supporting the family concerned to find alternative childcare provision for their son.' The incident comes after a three-year-old boy escaped from Juneberries Day Nursery in Romford, Essex, earlier this month. He wandered onto a busy dual carriageway and was only rescued when a woman motorist and her daughter spotted him. The Romford nursery was temporarily closed as Ofsted, Havering Council and the police launched a joint inquiry.","Romeo Chudasama was found in the middle of the road in East Dulwich .

"By . Steph Cockroft . It seems fans of the cult film Zulu were not the only ones fascinated by the renowned Battle of Rorke's Drift. Queen Victoria, who was on the throne when the battle took place, was so enthralled by the celebrated battle that she ordered Lieutenant John Chard, the commanding officer, to give her a written report of what happened. But, just like in the battle itself, Lieutenant Chard went above and beyond his call of duty - and decided to draw the queen five sketches showing a blow-by-blow account of how the battle unfolded. Lieutenant John Chard - who later became a major - drew sketches to show Queen Victoria a step-by-step account of the Defence of Rorke's Drift, which took place in January 1879 . Lieutenant John Chard, who was awarded a Victoria Cross after the Anglo-Zulu War, for his part in defending Rorke's Drift . Lieutenant Chard - who later became a major - also drew one landscape sketch, complete with a key, to give Queen Victoria the full picture of what happened when Zulu Warriors surrounded a British compound. Now, those sketches have put been on display for the first time, as part of the Treasures From . the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle. In the . drawings, the lieutenant tells Victoria that the sketches are drawn . 'chiefly from memory and therefore might not be quite correct'. But he said it would give a 'fairly accurate impression' of the relative positions. In the sketches, Chard uses red dots to show where the British soldiers moved and black dots to represent the Zulus. He even includes gardens and bushes in the diagram, while showing in detail how the hospital - which, along with a supply depot, formed part of Rorke's Drift - was destroyed by fire. He uses the caption: 'Darkness - completely surrounded.' The battle, which became the subject of the movie Zulu in 1964, saw 150 soldiers fight off up to 4,000 Zulu Warriors. The film, which is still celebrated more . 50 years after it was made, saw Stanley Baker play Lieutenant John . Chard, while Michael Caine played his right-hand man, Lieutenant Goville Bromhead. The success of the hand-to-hand combat came just hours after the Zulus achieved a resounding victory over the British troops during their first engagement at Isandlwana. But this time, when some of the Zulu forces assaulted the British field station at Rorke's Drift, British soldiers repelled the attack, despite being heavily outnumbered. The Zulus eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded. Rorke's Drift was the base for B Company, 2nd Battallion, 24th Regiment of Foot. Lieutenant John Chard, played in the 1964 Zulu film by Stanley Baker, pictured above, brought the battle to life through his drawings . The sketches from the battle, which was later document through the Zulu film, pictured above, are now on display for the first time at Windsor Castle . Lieutenant Chard, the commander of No 5 Field Company, Royal Engineers, found himself in charge of the men and, together with Lieutenant Bromhead, led the men into battle. He was later awarded the Victoria Cross, praised for saving the lives of all but 17 of his men. He was one of an incredible 11 men given the award. The Anglo-Zulu war began in the late 1870s, when the Zulu kingdom presented an obstacle to British imperial ambitions in southern Africa. Acting largely on his own initiative, the British High Commissioner presented the Zulu king Cetshwayo with an ultimatum with which he could not comply, subsequently sending a force to invade Zululand. The exhibition, which includes dozens of other historic letters and pictures, opens today.","Lieutenant John Chard drew sketches to document Battle of Rorke's Drift .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Four robbers who posed as builders in high-visibility jackets to carry out a series of 'blood chilling' raids at convenience stores have been jailed. The gang tied up and beat staff in seven different shops before making off with £84,000 of cash, cigarettes and scratch cards. Armed with axes and metal bars, the raiders barged into shops in the early hours of the morning, bound employees using cable ties and dumped them in a back room - before filling their bags. Attack: The balaclava-clad gang broke into seven stores with axes and bars, tied up staff, and filled their bags . One member of staff suffered a heart attack during the ambush. Today, Graham Aulton, 33, Stewart Ferguson, 35, Alan Britton, 40 and Craig Osmund-Smith, 41, were sentenced to a total of 31 years and 10 months in jail. The gang planned and executed the string of raids last Autumn, Stafford Crown Court heard. Shocking CCTV pictures show the raiders wearing black masks or tights over their heads and hi-visibility jackets as they launched their raids in the early hours of the morning. During the first attack in Codsall, . Staffordshire, on September 9, the gang threatened to 'cut up' staff . members with an axe unless they handed over money and cigarettes, the . court heard. Judge Michael Fowler said: 'It takes little imagination to think of the kind of fear there must have been' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'It is a significant factor of the robberies that the robbers where masked wearing dark clothing, balaclavas and gloves. 'Masks were often made with the legs of a pair of tights knotted and eye holes cut out. A scary prospect. 'On occasion weapons were taken and threats made that would have been blood chilling. There was intimidation by urgency. 'There was total disregard for the feelings and well-being of those who were in the stores when the robberies took place demonstrated graphically by CCTV. 'It takes little imagination to think of the kind of shock and fear there must have been when someone opens a back door of premises expecting to take in the papers and milk but to find it pushed open and confronted by masked dark clothed robbers.' The second raid, at a Tesco in Wolverhampton, saw staff handcuffed to a metal rail in the store while they raided the shelves. A raid in Shrewsbury on October 16 saw a staff member kicked in the face while during the next in Ashmore Park, Wolverhampton, the thugs made off with a store manager’s BMW. They also targeted stores in Womborne, and Penkridge, both Staffordshire, and Gornal, West Midlands. After making sure the staff were out of the way the criminals bundled their loot into brightly-coloured builders bags. The bags were used on each occasion and the offenders covered their faces using black balaclavas or ladies stockings which were cut and knotted. Police arrested Osmund-Smith, Aulton, and Ferguson on November 5 last year as the trio arrived at the Sainsbury’s Local in Wordsley, West Mids.., in the stolen BMW. Aulton was in the driver’s seat tried to speed off but crashed into an unmarked police car. Craig Osmund-Smith (left) was jailed for six years and nine months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery. Stewart Ferguson (right) denied the same charge but was unanimously found guilty by a jury . Graham Aulton (left) was jailed for eight years and nine months after admitting conspiracy to commit robbery. Alan Britton (right) was sentenced to seven years and seven months after admitting the same charge . Mobile phone records showed the group exchanged text messages just before and after the robberies. Aulton, from Wednesfield, West . Midlands, was jailed for eight years and nine months after admitting . conspiracy to commit robbery. Britton, from Wolverhampton, was sentenced to seven years and seven months after admitting the same charge. Osmund-Smith from Dudley, West . Midlands, was also jailed for six years and nine months after he pleaded . guilty to the same charge. Ferguson, from Bilston, West Midlands, . denied the charge but was unanimously found guilty by a jury of . conspiracy to commit robbery and was jailed for eight years and nine . months. Speaking after the sentence, Detective Superintendent Paul Clews, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'These victims are hard-working shop workers going about their daily business and it is they and the wider community who suffer when organised criminals believe they will be immune from prosecution.'","Gang of four ambushed 7 stores with axes and metal bars and tied up staff .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . They say everyone has a double. And this man certainly believes so after spotting his doppelganger in an old Victorian photograph. Steve Cross, 64, saw his own face staring back at him in the faded black-and-white image, which was taken more than 60 years before he was born. And he is so convinced it is his historic twin that he has even had t-shirts printed with the photo on. Historic twins? Ex-firefighter Steve Cross (left) has spotted his doppelganger (right) in a Victorian photograph . The grandfather-of-four, from Bean, near Dartford, Kent, said: 'They say everyone has a doppelgänger and I've found mine. 'I've showed it to a few people and they all said: ""That's definitely you"", and my grandchildren said it was me dressed up.' Mr Cross, a former firefighter who now works in security at Gatwick Airport, was sent the photo of two men at a Victorian funeral by a friend who had spotted the doppelganger. He immediately noticed the man on the . left-hand-side of the image had a similar head shape, eyes, nose and . even facial hair as him.

"By . Sean Poulter . New robotic super-tills are set to replace the nation’s supermarket check-out workers. The days of someone sitting at a check-out, switching and flipping items to make sure the barcode can be scanned before sorting out the payment are clearly numbered. Tesco yesterday unveiled a bank of the super-tills at its new Extra store in Lincoln in a major policy shift that is already being adopted by some of its rivals. Tesco yesterday unveiled a bank of the super-tills at its new Extra store in Lincoln in a major policy shift . The theory is that scanners built in to the supersize check-outs automatically scan every item put on the conveyor belt, regardless of which way up it is, so removing the human element. A normal worker takes up to three seconds to scan a single item, however the rise of the machines means the new hi-tech version can do the same job three times faster – one per second. At the same time, customers will pack their items and pay automatically with a card, so allowing the entire process to be managed without the need for a shop worker. Most supermarkets have already installed self-scan tills for those picking up a few items for their evening meal on the basis of a claim that it is quicker and more convenient for customers. However, the millions who have struggled with scanners and wrestled with ‘unidentified items in the bagging area’ will confirm the process does not always run smoothly. Scanners in the supersize check-outs scan every item on the conveyor belt, regardless of which way up it is . It has been tipped as 'revolutionary', cutting the time it takes to scan an item from three seconds to one . Each of the robotic super-tills can send products on a conveyor belt to one of three packing areas, which enables up to three sets of customers to be using it at any one time. Four of the state-of-the-art machines have been installed at Tesco’s 80,000 sq ft Lincoln Extra store, which accounts for nearly a third of all those available to customers. Shopper, helped by Tesco employee, empties trolley on to the conveyor belt. Items pass through an arch which scans them from all sides – 360 degrees – to identify barcode. Once through scanner, items are carried by the belt to a circular platform. Cone in the middle of platform spins the items into the first of 3 packing areas. Once all the shopping is through, second customer can then load items on the belt. A . wall rises around the first shoppers items, which means the second . customer’s shopping is diverted into a separate packing area. The same pattern is repeated with a third shopper. Each of the three packing areas has its own payment point, where customers can pay with cash or card. There is also a dispenser for bags, which customers can take freely to pack shopping. Tesco said it had already received a . positive customer feedback from a trial of one of the checkouts in . Fareham in Hampshire, but the new Lincoln store is taking the technology . to a new level. The . super-till has been developed by NCR Retail and is similar to ones that . have been developed for Asda and put on trial at a store in York and . operate at speeds of up to 100 items per minute. Tesco . said the new technology will take the stress out of getting through its . tills, because people will not feel under pressure to pack and pay. A spokesman said: ‘Customers can feel pressurised when they have customers behind them at the checkouts. This is about making it a more relaxed experience.’ The firm stressed the check-out workers are not being made redundant, but rather they are being switched to other roles in the stores, such as helping people to negotiate the aisles or running taste tests and demonstrations. NCR Retail’s Ronen Levkovich told The Grocer magazine: ‘Supermarkets such as Tesco must differentiate themselves to attract and retain shoppers. 'As consumers increasingly expect a better experience, incorporating innovative software and hardware becomes increasingly important.’ The changes at the Lincoln store are part of a major revamp of Tesco outlets to try and turn them into surrogate high streets with a range of stores and services beyond the normal groceries. Many will have family restaurants under the Giraffe brand, together with Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Euphorium bakeries. A number will also have community areas which can be used for exercise classes or mother and toddler groups. Tesco insists check-out workers will not be made redundant but assume different roles within the stores . The Lincoln store includes a new drive-through centre for people to collect items they have bought on the Tesco website. There is also a Connected Technology department offering a dedicated area for tablets, smartphones and the latest games consoles. It is the first store to include a kitchen in a community room that Tesco will use to provide cooking lessons for children in conjunction with the Children’s Food Trust.","Tesco has launched the technology at Lincoln branch, rivals to follow .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Watch out Corona, Coors and Cobra - Britain is fast developing a taste for Polish lager thanks to the influx of workers from Eastern Europe, new industry figures reveal. The extra strong Tyskie brand is now so popular in the UK it has made the top ten ‘World Beers’ table alongside better known brands like Heineken and Kronenbourg. The list records the best selling foreign beers and lagers sold in shops, supermarkets and off licences across the UK, outside the mass market brewers like Carling and Stella. The Tyskie brand of lager is now so popular in the UK it has made the top ten 'World Beers table alongside better known brands like Heineken and Kronenbourg . But while the other brands have built up a strong following in Britain over decades, Tyskie is a relative newcomer thanks to the wave of Polish immigrants in recent years. In Poland it accounts for one in five of all beer sales and at 5.6 per cent is stronger than most other lagers sold over here which are often too weak for Eastern European tastes. Now it is owned by multinational brewing giant SAB Miller which also has Peroni, Grolsch and several other foreign beers. Miller Brands sales director Tim Clay said: 'Retailers should aim to have a selection of world beers available alongside their mainstream and everyday premium lager to encourage consumers to trade up.' Kronenbourg is the most popular world beer, followed by Beck's and San Miguel . Sales of so-called World Beers are soaring in the UK at a time when many mainstream brands are flat or showing small increases, according to trade journal Off Licence News (OLN). 1.Kronenbourg 1664 (France)2.Beck’s (Germany)3.San Miguel (Spain)4.Peroni (Italy)5.Corona (Mexico)6.Heineken (Netherlands)7.Coors light (USA)8.Cobra (India)9.Holsten Pils (Germany)10.Tyskie (Poland)*Off trade sales only, ‘World Beer’ is defined by the industry as a foreign speciality beer rather than a mainstream brand, brewed overseas or in UK under licence to its own recipe. Last year lager sales overall saw just a three per cent in value to £3 billion and 1.9 per cent in volume. However world beers saw increases of 18.6 per cent in volume and 21.3 per cent in value to around £400 million, and it is continuing to increase, said analysts IRI for the study. The economic downturn saw more people buying alcohol from shops to drink at home which led them to try brands they would not normally find prominent in pubs. Martin Green of OLN said: 'This means they are more experimental when making food at home. 'Just as sogger kebabs and TV dinners don’t seem to cut it any more, neither do cans of standard lager. 'Shoppers are increasingly prepared to fork out on premium drinks which are still far cheaper than on-trade (pubs and bars) offerings.' He added: 'I was surprised to see Tyskie performing so well. It must be due to the massive influx of Polish people but my non-Polish friends also like Tyskie and Zywiec so I think it’s catching on. 'It’s stronger than normal lager which I think resonates with some people.'","Tyskie so popular in Britain it has made top ten 'World Beers' list .
