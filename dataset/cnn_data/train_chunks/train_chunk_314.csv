"(CNN) -- He already holds the honor of being the only person to complete 20 Iron Man triathlons in a single year, but now Belgian athlete Stefaan Engels has claimed another world record by running 365 marathons in as many days. Engels completed his year-long mission at the Carretera de les Aigues race in Barcelona on Saturday. The ""Marathon Man"" has covered a distance of 9,569 miles (15,401 kilometers) since setting off from his home town of Ghent on February 5, 2010, participating in races in Spain, Portugal, Canada, Mexico, Britain and United States, as well as several in his native country. The 49-year-old has smashed the previous record of the most marathons run in one year, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records was held by 65-year-old Akinori Kusuda -- who ran 52 consecutive races in 2009. But in a statement on his official website, the former graphic designer played down his amazing feat. ""I don't regard my marathon year as torture. It is more like a regular job. I am running just as Joe Average goes to work on Monday morning, whether or not he feels like it,"" he said. ""I don't always feel like running, but when I am done, I take a shower, have some physiotherapy for an hour, and that wraps up my day."" Engels suffered from asthma as a child and was told he would never be able to do exercise. It was then that he decided he would start running the grueling 26.2-mile (42.195 kilometers) discipline. He said he hopes to inspire others to take up exercise and has encouraged people to run marathons with him in the past.","Belgian runner sets new world record by running a marathon a day for the last year .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian war has never been a simple fight between good rebels and evil government forces, and the United Nations has said so several times in the past. But this week, U.N. investigators released a particularly detailed and horrific report that slams both sides, accusing rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad of murder, rape, torture and forced disappearances. Government forces and the rebels have violated international humanitarian law in the two-year war, said Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria. ""The war displays all the signs of a destructive stalemate,"" he told the U.N. Security Council this week. ""If the national, regional and international actors fail to find a solution to the conflict and stop the agony of millions of civilians,"" Pinheiro warned, ""the alternative will be the political, economic and social destruction of Syria and its society, with devastating implications for the region and the world."" The lengthy report is based on information from 443 interviews that U.N. investigators conducted inside Syria. One of the more disturbing passages details rebels and government forces recruiting boys as young as 12. Children under 18 are seized at checkpoints, and government-affiliated militia use sectarian affiliation, kinship systems and cash to cajole children into their ranks, the paper notes. The government has used children as informants, but both they and rebels punish children who act as informants by killing them, the report says. An uncorroborated video, investigators say, seems to show a child associated with an anti-government group beheading a prisoner. The report says rebels frequently use schools as barracks or offices, children have taken up arms to fight and rebels have used them as lookouts. In other violations, both groups have also targeted typically off-limits groups like medical workers and indiscriminately shelled each other, killing innocents caught in the crossfire. Two million Syrians have been internally displaced, and more than 4 million need humanitarian aid, the investigators found. The United Nations has repeatedly called for more serious and sustained international attention to Syria and a diplomatic end to the fighting. But the war has affected the body itself. Last week, rebels detained 21 U.N. peacekeepers, claiming they came into an area where they didn't belong and saying they suspected the peacekeepers were secretly trying to help government forces. The captives were released a few days ago. Rebels on Tuesday said the report was an exaggeration. Louay Almokdad, a spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army, said he was shocked by the report. ""We are quite stunned that the U.N. would issue such a report and try to blame both sides for violations when it is clear who is committing atrocities in the country and who is killing our innocent civilians,"" Almokdad said. The Syrian government, meanwhile, has consistently blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for killing civilians. While the regime has often referred to opposition fighters as ""terrorists,"" some radical militants -- such as members of the Nusra Front -- have also joined the fight against the government. Last year, the United States blacklisted the Nusra Front as a foreign terror organization. The move baffles Syrian rebels, an analyst said. Many Syrians see the group as heroes of the revolution because of its professionalism and its willingness to fight and take causalities, said Jeffrey White, a defense analyst at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The organization is active in eight provinces, he said. More than 70,000 Syrians -- mostly civilians -- have been killed since peaceful anti-government protests led to a fierce government crackdown, an armed uprising and a civil war with no end in sight. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged patience. ""You have to have some patience in this process even as you approach it with care, and I think that's exactly what we are doing,"" he told reporters in Washington. ""We want to stop the killing. And they want to stop the killing. The world wants to stop the killing,"" he said.","NEW: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urges patience: ""We want to stop the killing""

"(CNN) -- At least 24 people were killed early Sunday when militants raided a Sunni town in northern Yemen, medics and witnesses said. The Houthi Shia militants raided a Sunni town in Sa'ada in the predawn hours, medics said. At least 61 Sunnis are also injured when their homes were shelled with grenades, the medics said. They medics did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Witnesses said the injured did not get medical attention because the town was under siege. The Houthi attacks were concentrated on a Sunni religious center, according to witnesses. All mediation efforts to end the conflict have failed. Houthis, a pro-Shia movement in Yemen, has expanded during the 10-month struggle to oust the president. Opposition officials have expressed concern over its growth. ""We cannot indulge in any political agreement with an armed movement. How can we involve them into politics when they don't believe in it,"" said Ali Mamari, an opposition member in Yemen. Mamari said Yemenis will not accept movements that spread with force and kill people. ""There is no difference between Houthis and al Qaeda, both are armed and use force to spread their beliefs,"" he said. Houthis rejected the power transfer signing that took place in Riyadh earlier this week and said it would not recognize it. ""The movement has more than 100,000 fighters ready to obey commands from their spiritual leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi,"" said Ahmed Bahri, an expert in Houthi affairs. ""This movement is well organized and only has one head,"" Bahri said. ""They now control majority areas in the provinces in Sa'ada and Jawf, and have powerful presence in Amran, Mareb, Sana'a and Hajjah,"" added Bahri. Sectarian violence is at peak in northern Yemen where Houthis control is spread across five provinces. Saudi Arabia fought the Houthis in 2009 but failed to end their expansion. The attacks come a day after Yemen's vice president called for presidential elections to be held in February, state media reported. President Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down after months of protests against his 33-year rule. He became the fourth leader to leave office as a result of the Arab Spring unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. Saleh returned to Yemen on Saturday night, days after he signed an agreement in Saudi Arabia yielding his powers, according to the Yemen official news agency .","Dozens killed when militants raid a Sunni town .

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- About 10 days ago, Lusa Khanneh took ill, but not with Ebola. Her son, Saymon Kamara, says his mother was having violent convulsions. Those aren't a typical symptom of Ebola; they're a complication of high blood pressure, which Kanneh had suffered from for years. Kamara drove his mother to Redemption Hospital, near their home in the West Point slums of Monrovia. Doctors had given her treatment there before, and he hoped to get it again. But Redemption, like so many hospitals in Liberia, is closed or partially closed out of fear that Ebola patients will infect health care workers. It's a fear based in reality: In Liberia, more than 170 health care workers have contracted the disease and 83 have died of it. Next, Kamara drove to ELWA Hospital, but learned it only takes Ebola patients. Then he drove his mother to JFK Hospital, but it was overwhelmed and accepting only pregnant women, children and Ebola patients. Cooper Hospital was his last chance. Kamara and his mother waited outside. By now she was convulsing every 15 minutes, ""as if someone had put a spell on her,"" he says. Her breathing was rapid and shallow. A doctor came out -- a tall man, Kamara remembers. He pointed to a small blood stain on his mother's shirt. He wanted to know what it was from. Kamara explained that during one of her seizures his mother had bit her tongue and bled a little. But he could tell the doctor was worried she had Ebola, because bleeding is one of the symptoms. He turned Kanneh away. Lusa Khanneh had run out of options. The only place her son could take her was home. Four days later, on September 19, she died. Saymon Kamara is angry. ""If the hospitals were open, she wouldn't have died,"" he says. ""This wasn't her time to go."" No contact: Life inside the Ebola outbreak . There's no question that countless Liberians are dying because of Ebola even when they don't have it. There are few functioning hospitals or doctors' offices. Health care services, weak before Ebola, barely exist; vaccination rates, for example, have plummeted. ""The primary care system here is basically shattered,"" says Sarah Crowe, a spokeswoman for UNICEF who is working in Liberia. ""It's an outrage that children are dying of diseases, like measles, that are preventable and treatable."" Even after death, Ebola -- a disease her son says she never had -- haunted Kanneh. Her family heard on the radio that no one should touch a cadaver, no matter what the cause of death. Call in, the announcer on the radio said, and a team from Dead Body Management will come for the body. It's simply impractical to test every cadaver for Ebola and sort out who died of what before burial. It would dangerously delay the burial to do so, and would take up too many resources. So the Kanneh family did as they were instructed. On Saturday, the day after her death, a team of five men in white suits, covered head to toe, sprayed Lusa Khanneh's body with chlorine and buried her. Kanneh didn't receive the burial she would have wanted as a devout Muslim. Her family didn't wash her body. They didn't carry her to the mosque and pray over her. They didn't bury her themselves. ""These guys who buried her -- I don't know these guys,"" Kamara says, referring to the men in the white suits with the chlorine spray. ""I expected my family to bury her, but now strangers have buried her."" But he says he understands. ""I have to accept this because this is the kind of country I live in and the kind of country my mother died in,"" he says. ""I have to accept it with a heavy heart."" CNN's John Bonifield, Orlando Ruiz, and Orlind Cooper contributed to this story.","Liberians with other ailments trapped by Ebola crisis .

"Boca Raton, Florida (CNN) -- At 13 years old, Nickolaus Dent is his mother's primary caregiver. He's responsible for the grocery shopping and cooking. He cleans the house. He does all the laundry. His mother, Janine Helms, has been battling HIV for as long as Nickolaus can recall, and her health has deteriorated in the last couple of years. Nickolaus makes sure she takes her medication. He often helps her get dressed, and at times, he has helped her bathe. Nickolaus' father died two years ago. Since then, ensuring Helms' well-being has been a full-time job for Nickolaus, leaving him with little energy to socialize or study. ""It does make it hard to pay attention in class,"" he said. ""Helping her out is a bigger priority than going to school and getting (an) education, because I feel if I don't have her, I don't want to go to school. Whatever happens to her happens to me."" Nickolaus is just one of the estimated 10,000 youth caregivers living in Palm Beach County, Florida, according to the American Association of Caregiving Youth. The nonprofit, founded by county resident Connie Siskowski, was instrumental in bringing this previously unrecognized population to light in 2002, and it has since provided support to more than 500 area youths who are caring for an ill, disabled or aging family member. ""No child in the United States should have to drop out of school because of caregiving,"" said Siskowski, 65. ""These children suffer silently behind closed doors. ... They don't have the help and the support and the recognition that they need."" According to a 2006 study conducted by Civic Enterprises for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 22% of high school dropouts in the United States leave school to care for a family member (PDF). It's these children who Siskowski had in mind when her group started the Caregiving Youth Project at Boca Raton Middle School. The project, the first of its kind in the nation, aims to intervene early on in the academic lives of youth caregivers. Special classes, led by a mental-health professional or social worker, cover topics such as coping with stress and anger, managing finances and setting goals. Periodic field trips and overnight camps offer recreational, social and educational activities. There are home-care demonstrations and workshops. The program also makes teachers and school administrators more aware of the children's extenuating circumstances and how they can lead to truancy, absenteeism and dips in academic performance. The hope is to reduce the negative effects -- anxiety, depression and feelings of isolation -- that caregiving responsibilities can have on a child's mental, physical and emotional health. ""We can't change the health condition of the person (receiving care),"" Siskowski said. ""But what we can do is provide the skills and the resources and the value to the children so that they can have a little more balance in their life. And also so that they know that they're not alone."" Since 2006, the program has been introduced into eight area middle schools and followed hundreds of students into 17 area high schools. ""We stay with them to graduation, and it's amazing,"" Siskowski said. ""We've watched these kids grow up before our eyes. It's nothing that happens overnight, but it's very gratifying. It's like, 'OK, there's one more kid that's going to make it.' "" Nickolaus joined the program last year. The group provided him with a computer, a bed, clothing and tutoring. Now, he has raised his grades and aims to make the honor roll. He was also able to attend the group's overnight camp while a nurse's aide stayed with his mom. ""I found out there are more people that do the things I do, and some do more,"" he said. ""Now I'm getting As and Bs, and I feel more confident in school."" Children in the program are also offered a home study by a medically licensed staff member or contractor who assesses what skills and resources are most needed to support a child. Working with dozens of community partners, Siskowski's group helps families with unique needs. ""We've provided clean-water systems and enlisted the support of community members to build wheelchair ramps or relocate a family from a moldy environment,"" said Siskowski, whose group relies solely on donations and grants. ""We've provided in-home tutoring, light cleaning, translation and transportation support, counseling, access to medical care, financial assistance and food resources. ""We've donated computers and printers. And slow cookers, as we've had several fires in homes where children are cooking for their families."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Siskowski knows the toll that caring for a loved one can take. As an 11-year-old, she cared for her grandfather until his death two years later. She remembers waking up at 2 a.m. to give him his medication and finding that he had died. ""I don't think I realized he was going to die. No one prepared me for that,"" she said. ""It was very traumatic. But way back then, nobody really appreciated the trauma or the impact of losing someone."" Siskowski became a registered nurse in 1967 and has worked in Florida's health-care community for decades. Over the years, she has witnessed how technological advances have affected aging baby boomers and their families. ""People are living longer,"" she said. ""We have much more technology and electronics that are available. ... More and more people who maybe yesterday would've been in a nursing home are being cared for at home. And so that puts a burden on a family. ""The hospital is in a unique situation. ... Technically, they're supposed to be able to give instruction to a caregiver. But sometimes that caregiver is a child."" The tasks can be sophisticated, too, from monitoring respiratory devices to cleaning catheters and preparing syringes. And not all of the children are caring for just one parent like Nickolaus. Others have to care for multiple family members, including siblings. A report released in 2005 (PDF) by the National Alliance for Caregiving and the United Hospital Fund said there were at least 1.3 million caregiving youths, ages 8 to 18, nationwide. It's a population that has been virtually hidden for several reasons, including the reluctance of many sick parents to go public with their infirmity. ""Parents are embarrassed to tell school members, or the principal, that they have medical problems. ... Their pride goes out the window, and most feel more vulnerable,"" Helms said. Children also fear trouble for themselves and for their families. While they might know that too many truancies and absences could land them in court, they're often more fearful that a parent could be deemed incapacitated and the family split up. ""Children are afraid to reach out because they don't want to be taken away from the parent,"" Helms said. ""It's scary. And people don't want to be near you when you have an illness. It's just as hard on the disabled parent as it is the child, to open up. That's why it's kept like under the table."" Siskowski and her group are determined to create other options and provide other solutions. She says the first step is acknowledging youth caregivers and telling them they are not alone. ""We have definitely turned around lives and kept kids in school because they feel valued,"" she said. ""They never knew anyone noticed or cared. ""It can turn their frustration and anger and flip it around to feel valued and supported in the role they are having for the family as well as society. If they weren't doing some of the things they are doing, who would be?"" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Richard Kiel, the actor best known for playing the James Bond villain ""Jaws,"" died Wednesday at a Fresno, California hospital, St. Agnes Medical Center spokeswoman Kelley Sanchez said. The cause of death for the 74-year-old actor has not been released. The 7-foot-2-inch Kiel, who was born in Detroit in 1939, won over audiences worldwide in the 1970s as the steel-toothed character Jaws in the Roger Moore Bond classics ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker."" ""I am totally distraught to learn of my dear friend Richard Kiel's passing. We were on a radio programme together just a week ago. Distraught,"" Moore tweeted early Thursday. Kiel appeared in a handful of B-movies and of TV shows -- including four episodes of ""The Wild Wild West"" in 1965 -- in supporting, henchman roles that took advantage of his intimidating height. He first appeared as a metal-mouthed bad guy in ""Silver Streak,"" the 1976 Gene Wilder-Richard Pryor train caper, but it was the Bond movies that made him most familiar to moviegoers. Kiel first encountered Moore's James Bond in 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" where his silent hitman Jaws repeatedly menaced Bond with his sharp metal teeth. Although repeatedly thwarted by the British spy, Jaws proved resilient and even sort of likable: Near the movie's end he survived a brush with a killer shark by biting the creature. Jaws was such a popular character that the producers of the Bond series brought him back two years later for ""Moonraker,"" which was set partly in space. He and Bond battled each other in a opening skydiving sequence and in a memorable scene atop an aerial tram in Rio de Janeiro. Later, Jaws switched allegiances to Bond upon learning that his employer, the villain Drax, planned to exterminate him. Opinion: Why Jaws was best 'Bond' villain ever . In later years, Kiel turned his hand to writing and producing as well as acting, including in the 1991 movie ""The Giant of Thunder Mountain,"" according to the IMDB. He also had a small role in ""Happy Gilmore,"" the 1996 Adam Sandler golf comedy. ""Richard Kiel was one of the nicest, funniest guys I've ever met. I'll never forget hanging out with him & how good he was to everyone,"" Sandler tweeted Thursday. Kiel's family posted this message on Facebook: . ""It is with very heavy hearts that we announce that Richard has passed away, just three days shy of his 75th birthday. Richard had an amazing joy for life and managed to live every single day to the fullest.

""His family was the most important thing in his life and we are happy that his last days were spent surrounded by family and close friends.

"London (CNN) -- What do you do if a potentially valuable Banksy graffiti work appears on one of your buildings? If you're the local council in the English seaside resort of Clacton-on-Sea, the answer is: remove it fast. The image, painted in Banksy's distinctive style on a nondescript seafront building, showed a group of pigeons holding signs saying ""Migrants not welcome,"" ""Go back to Africa"" and ""Keep off our worms"" directed at a more exotically plumed bird. To most observers, it would appear to be a sharp piece of social commentary highlighting anti-immigration rhetoric, but it sparked a complaint Tuesday to the local council that it was itself offensive and racist. The Tendring District Council's graffiti team moved in, and as of Wednesday morning, the Banksy was no more, the council's communications manager, Nigel Brown, told CNN. Where can you find a Banksy? The officers did not realize the mural they were removing was by the famously anonymous graffiti artist Banksy, he said. But at the same time, if they considered that the image could be seen by some people as offensive or racist, they had a responsibility to remove it, he said. ""It's damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" Brown said. ""But there is a 'whoops it's a Banksy' moment."" From graffiti to galleries . Banksy's social comment comes at a sensitive time in local politics. A special election is taking place on October 9, triggered by the defection of the Essex district's member of Parliament from the Conservative Party to UKIP. Immigration is a key issue for the two parties, with UKIP committed to limiting the number of migrants entering Britain. Is Bambi the female Banksy? 'Appropriate' Banksy work . It was only after the council was contacted by the media over a photo of the work on Banksy's website that the council realized what it had -- briefly -- had, Brown said. All that remains is a discolored smudge on the wall. ""We would obviously welcome an appropriate Banksy original on any of our seafronts and would be delighted if he returned in the future,"" he said. An ""appropriate"" work would have to be something that would fit into a ""family seaside resort,"" he said. The world of African street art . The words on the mural could have caused distress, Brown added, if the reader did not understand the irony. ""It's not the sort of thing we would want to be on one of our own buildings in Clacton,"" he said. Other Banksy artworks have become tourist attractions in their own right or have been snapped up by collectors willing to spend big bucks. A work spray-painted on a door at a youth center in the English city of Bristol, showing a couple embracing while checking their cell phones, was sold at auction in August for 403,000 pounds (more than $650,000), according to UK media reports, with the proceeds going to the youth club.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A newly published edition of an authoritative Chinese dictionary has come under fire for leaving out the homosexual definition of a word commonly used to refer to gay men and lesbians. The word ""tongzhi"" traditionally means ""comrade"" and has been widely used by the Communist Party. But in recent decades the word has evolved to refer to homosexuals. The committee charged with revising and updating the dictionary said they chose to leave out the definition because they didn't want to encourage its use, the director of the committee Jiang Langsheng told Chengdu Business Daily. Coming out of the closet in China . The dictionary, which had its sixth edition published July 15, is one of the most renowned sources of information in China. According to CNTV this latest edition contains 69,000 entries -- an increase of 4,000 from the fifth edition published in 2005. ""It's unacceptable that the 'gay' meaning of 'tongzhi' was excluded from the dictionary, a reference book written for all, simply because of the compilers' own preferences and values,"" Nan Feng, a gay rights activist told the state-run news agency Xinhua. ""Tongzhi"" serves as a substitute for ""tongxinglian,"" which is the formal Chinese term for homosexuality. The 2005 edition of the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary defines ""tongxinglian"" both as same-sex love and as a psychosexual disorder, according to Xinhua. Homosexuality's classification as a mental disorder was removed in China in 2001, despite the dictionary's definition. Video: Mom in China advocates for gay son .

"(CNN) -- Now it's about family. A new heartbreaker television ad from the Democratic candidate looking to wrest Mitch McConnell from his perch atop the Republican Party in the Senate makes Medicare a gut issue. The ad describes the struggle of Alison Lundergan Grimes' grandmother after her husband's stroke. ""My husband was a strong person, but the stroke just took everything away,"" says Grimes' grandmother, Elise Case, in the ad. ""I remember that day, when my mom called. The world stopped,"" said Grimes. Grimes' new ad costs six figures, is 60 seconds long and airs statewide in Kentucky Thursday, days after a six-figure ad broadcast by McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader. That ad pinged Grimes for supporting Obamacare. ""Grimes twice supported Obama's platform for Obamacare,"" says the narrator in McConnell's latest, which is a response to Grimes' earlier skeet-shooting attack. Grimes has in the past criticized McConnell's votes to defund the Affordable Care Act. Focusing on Medicare pulls at different heartstrings, however, and can cause a limited group of voters to abandon normal political alliances, a tactic especially helpful in the tight race between Grimes and McConnell. ""My grandfather was a proud man,"" says Grimes in her latest ad, entitled, ""A Proud Man,"" which is interspersed with old photographs of her grandfather and grandmother. He ""didn't want to ask for help, but they needed it,"" she says. For 10 years the Case family struggled to afford medicine when Grimes' grandfather was left unable to work or speak after the stroke. ""We scrimped and saved, because suddenly our finances were going for medical bills,"" said Case. Grimes has attacked McConnell on Medicare before, bashing a McConnell vote on Medicare that she said cost a coal miner a $6,000 increase in medical bills. And she has featured her family in at least one political ad while running for secretary of state in 2011. That ad, which featured both of Grimes' grandmothers, was widely credited for her 61% victory in that race. Grimes' father, Jerry Lundergan, is a political bigwig in Kentucky; a former Kentucky Democratic Party chairman with close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton. In her current political ad with family, Grimes said, ""Sen. McConnell has voted over and over again to raise seniors Medicare costs. I'll never do that,"" then she hugged her grandmother and approved the message.

"(CNN) -- One hundred thirty new cases of Ebola were identified during a three-day lockdown in Sierra Leone, Stephen Gaojia, the country's head of emergency operations, said Monday. Officials are awaiting tests on another 39 potential cases, he said. During the lockdown from Friday through Sunday, no one was allowed to leave home. More than 75% of the targeted 1.5 million households were contacted, according to the Health Ministry. The latest report from the World Health Organization, released Monday, says at least 2,803 people have died during the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In these three countries -- the hardest hit by the epidemic -- there have been at least 5,843 confirmed, probable or suspected cases. The death toll includes victims in all three categories. The first Ebola case was documented in December. The WHO is also tracking the virus in Senegal and Nigeria, where a much smaller number of cases have been confirmed. Only one case was confirmed in Senegal, and no deaths have been reported. In addition, the WHO reported, all of those believed to have been in contact with the infected person have completed follow-up evaluations with no further Ebola cases confirmed. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976.","130 new cases were identified during a 3-day lockdown in Sierra Leone .

According to the New York Daily News, the former ""Mean Girls"" star turned in a ""shaky"" performance, and ""fumbled for words a few times."" The New York paper adds that Lohan ""seemed to rely on a book she clutched as a prop that had some lines from the script scribbled in it."" The Daily Beast wasn't any gentler, noting that halfway through the show, ""the audience was openly laughing at Lohan's struggle to grasp Mamet's sharp, trademark dialogue."" Before the production opened, Lohan told TimeOut London that she hoped her work on ""Speed-the-Plow"" will help restore her image. ""I think it shows that I can be accountable, and I think it helps with the perception that I'm just a psycho that goes out and stuff,"" the actress said. ""I've done things, but people grow up and they change. I'm willing to work hard to gain back the respect that I once had and have lost."" As for the future, Lohan added that she does have a five-year plan: ""I would like to be married and have children, and hopefully be at the Oscars,"" the 28-year-old said, ""but that's as far as it goes for now."" The production of ""Speed-the-Plow"" runs at the Playhouse Theater in London until November 29.","Lindsay Lohan made her West End debut on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has opened the door to Noah's ark by considering an end to the ban on owning ferrets, which dates to 1959. New York City's ferret owners -- a shadowy underground that smuggles and coddles the beasts in defiance of the law -- say that their pets, which are legal to own everywhere in America except Hawaii and California, should not be banned from the city. If only things were that simple. Having voluntarily chosen to live locked up in brick and steel towers, the 8 million homo sapiens who dwell in New York tend to get antsy about the idea of sharing our fancy concrete cage with other animals. Our wariness is codified in law, leaving no room for confusion: Section 161.01 of the New York City Health Code describes and classifies the species that cannot be kept as pets, with mind-numbing taxonomic precision. Barring professional exceptions like running a licensed zoo, circus or laboratory, says the code, it is illegal to own a polar, grizzly, or brown bear. New Yorkers cannot own bats, beavers, wolves, lemurs, hedgehogs, porcupines, elephants or dolphins. You might consider these prohibitions to be common sense. Who needs a law? You'd be wrong. In 2003, a New Yorker named Antoine Yates was discovered to be living in a Harlem public housing project with an alligator and a 400-pound Bengal tiger. The situation came to light after Yates showed up at the emergency room with a suspiciously large bite wound. So the code is a guide to help people avoid getting hurt. It prohibits hooved animals, ""including, but not limited to, deer, antelope, sheep, giraffe and hippopotamus."" Sounds good to me. It's hard enough to find parking on my block. Who needs to worry about hippopotamuses taking up spaces? New Yorkers cannot legally own members of the Procyonidae family, including ""kinkajou, cacomistle, cat-bear, panda and coatimundi."" Again, no problem. To tell the truth, I never heard of any of those creatures except the panda -- although a cat-bear reminds me of a popular science fiction series I read as a kid, featuring 500-pound feline aliens that nearly wipe out the human race. Marsupials are prohibited in New York: No Tasmanian devils, no kangaroos, and none of those other odd-sounding Down Under critters like dasyure, bandicoot, cuscus and numbat. You also cannot own any ""nonhuman"" primate. And no ferrets. But unlike most of the beasts on the forbidden list, the wily ferrets have developed a political constituency. ""They have an odd half-monkey, half-dog kind of intelligence that bonds them to their people and makes them always very interesting and often very funny"" is how one owner described her pet to the City Council at a hearing in 1999. When pressed on the subject of ferret attacks on humans, one council member noted that New York probably has more spouse bites than ferret bites. Rudy Giuliani, the mayor at the time, was having none of it. He famously berated a ferret advocate on a radio program, telling him, ""There is something really, really, very sad about you,"" and ""This excessive concern with little weasels is a sickness."" Giuliani's rant remains posted online to this day, as does an official statement denouncing the creatures. Fast-forward to 2014, and a new mayor already embroiled in a high-profile battle over whether to ban horse-drawn carriages from the city. The Department of Health announced it has received a petition from the pro-ferret forces, and will duly consider lifting the ban. A word of advice to de Blasio: Tread carefully. If the ferrets get traction, it's hard to say where the revolution will end. People may want to have zorilles, wolverines or stoats. Advocates for binturongs, fossa, linsangs and suricates -- whatever those are -- may follow the ferret freedom fighters. And the scene down at City Hall, where one protest or another already takes place on any given day, could start to get truly wild.","Errol Louis: New York City is considering an end to a 55-year-old ban on owning ferrets .

"(CNN) -- My friend Susan had a solution to her days spent stressed out as the head of marketing for a global tech company: Shoes. She knew no problem could truly be solved by buying a new pair. But, she told herself, she could afford it, and shoes made her happier -- especially when she was thinking about what she was going to purchase in place of the drama going on at work. For Susan, whose name I've changed (along with all others cited), even the act of going online to browse the new arrivals at her favorite online shops was thrilling. Clicking through heels and wedges and flats, planning and plotting her purchases, was as stimulating as the coffee she sipped. When her box of shoes arrived in the mail, it was like Christmas morning. But when the box was opened, the shoes tried on, admired and put away, Susan was left to wonder: Now what? ""I rarely regretted a purchase, but having a new pair did not make me want more pairs any less,"" she told me. ""They may have filled a need, but they didn't make me any happier, not like imagining myself in them had seemed to do."" Retail therapy has long been a tool for the stressed-out, brokenhearted or just plain bored; some figures, including a 2012 survey by online retailer eBates put the number of Americans who go shopping to feel better at more than half. In many ways, retail therapy works: A great dress or a sharp, well-fitting suit can soothe the soul, provide a confidence boost that helps you land a job, or inspire creativity in a way that's more than just imagined. According to a 2011 study published in the Journal of Psychology and Marketing, retail therapy can positively affect your mood. The study noted that 28% of shoppers had purchased something to celebrate an occasion or personal victory and 62% to cheer themselves up. Indeed, studies show, money can buy happiness. A December 2012 study published in the journal Emotion found well-being rises with income at all levels of income -- and that richer families, and countries, are happier than poorer ones. But retail therapy might not work quite in the way consumers assume it works. That's because the happiness that buying something provides is derived not from acquiring the item, or from the item itself, but from the targeting it, wanting it and anticipating its arrival into your life. That is, the electric jolt shopping can provide is a result of the act of desiring, more than the act of fulfilling. Meaning: You're better off if you don't buy the outfit, or gadget, or piece of art, but simply long for it. The evidence: In June, the Journal of Consumer Research published a study finding that when it comes to shopping, wanting things makes people happier than actually having them, even among those, such as Susan, who do not experience buyer's remorse. Researchers analyzed the emotional state of consumers before and after making a significant purchase. Most, especially those who self-identified as materialists, anticipated future purchases with strong, positive emotions: They felt joy, excitement, optimism and peacefulness when they thought of their future purchase, which they also believed would improve their relationships, boost their self-esteem, enable them to experience more pleasure and be more efficient. (Super shoes, indeed.) But after the purchase was made, and the anticipation faded into reality, what followed was what the researchers called ""hedonic decline."" Happy feelings dissipated. Consumers were left wanting more. That doesn't mean all purchases end in remorse or longing. The Consumer Research study argues that buying is less satisfying than wanting, but not that buying makes people sad. Though the happiness that results from acquiring an item may be short-lived, the happiness that comes from thinking about and planning for a purchase can be sustained. Below are a few tips for prolonging retail therapy afterglow: . Opt for experiences over stuff. Plenty of studies show that buying experiences is more satisfying that buying things. The answer, though, isn't to quit your retail therapy cold turkey, but to weave in experiences -- trips, sporting games, theater -- that might provide some added meaning. Play hard to get. Resist the impulse to see something in a magazine, or at a friend's house, and go straight away to buy it. Instead, let yourself think about the item for as long as you can. (One key to the success of social media site Pinterest, where users can post photos to create a public sort of ""wish list"" of ideas, goals, and, yes, goods.) Limit flash sales. Or limit even buying anything simply because it's discounted. Flash sales foster quick and easy purchasing, but as such limit the beneficial impact of desire. There's no chance to feel the rush of wanting and to envision how an item might make your life better before it's put into the cart, paid for and at your door. Shop in person. Recall, and participate in, the joy of buying things from a brick-and-mortar store, which prolongs the joy of shopping from an impulse buy in the half hour before you rush off to work to an afternoon spent with a friend or even just yourself. Online shopping is a relatively mindless activity that, while relaxing, offers little in the way of engagement with others. Shopping in the presence of people, though, fosters a sense of connection to others, which can increase levels of happiness and satisfaction derived from the experience. Spend within your means. Perhaps the most crucial conclusion made in the study of hedonic decline is that more really isn't better, and that wanting a new car is as effectual, moodwise, as having the new car. Why not, then, hang onto the old one for a little longer? The next time you're about to press ""Complete My Order"" or perform the in-person equivalent, remember that it's not about what's acquired, but about what's yet a possibility; that it's the hope of what's to come that provides the biggest thrill of all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Retail therapy is a pick-me-up for the stressed, brokenhearted or bored .

"(CNN) -- A new regional branch of al Qaeda infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack a vessel earlier this month to launch rocket attacks on American ships in the Indian Ocean, a site that monitors terror groups said. It was the first major offensive by the newly formed al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. The SITE Institute's monitoring service said the group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, on Twitter compared the Pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to Nadal Hasan, the U.S. Army psychiatrist convicted of killing 13 people at Fort Hood. Hasan was sentenced to death by a military court for the November 5, 2009, rampage, which authorities said the American-born Muslim carried out because he did not want to deploy to Afghanistan to fight other Muslims. Mahmoud's tweet on Wednesday said the group sought to avenge the ""bloodshed of Muslims"" from Afghanistan to Syria as well as what it called U.S. control and superiority over ""ours straits, our channels and our waters."" The September 6 hijacking attempt of the Pakastani navy vessel PNS Zulfiqar in Karachi ended after a fire fight in which three attackers were killed and seven others arrested, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told parliament on September 10. A naval officer was killed. ""We cannot rule out inside help in this attack because, without it, the miscreants could not breach security,"" Asif said. A Pakistani navy source said the investigation is still under way and the attack could be linked to any network. According to SITE, al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent claimed credit for the attack and even posted a picture and schematic of the Pakistani naval ship on Twitter. ""These mujahideen had taken control of the Pakistani ship, and they were advancing towards the American fleet when the Pakistani army stopped them,"" said the tweet quoted by SITE. ""As a result, the mujahideen, the lions of Allah and benefactors of the Ummah, sacrificed their lives for Allah, and the Pakistani soldiers spoiled their hereafter by giving up their lives in defense of the enemies of the Ummah the Americans,"" the group said on Twitter. After the attack, three naval officials were arrested during a raid on the outskirts of the city of Quetta near the Afghan border. The officials said the suspects were trying to escape to Afghanistan. Earlier this month, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, in an effort to reclaim relevancy, announced the creation of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, led by Asim Umar, which will include at least one faction of the Pakistan Taliban. According to a translation by the SITE Institute, Mahmoud said the group's basic goals included jihad against America, supporting the Taliban and establishing a caliphate (implicitly rejecting the Caliphate claimed by ISIS leader Bakr al-Baghdadi). The announcement steps up the philosophical battle between al Qaeda and ISIS about how the dream of the caliphate, to which Muslims the world over would owe allegiance, is achieved. Mahmoud spoke of ""a caliphate where the emirs are proud in their closeness to the honest scholars... a caliphate in whose shadow even the disbelieving people of dhimma (non-Muslim citizens of an Islamic state) have a life of safety and security."" The last condition was clearly aimed at ISIS and its merciless campaign against non-Muslims and non-Sunni Muslims in both Iraq and Syria. Not to be outdone, ISIS' propaganda machine recently posted photographs showing residents of the Iraqi city of Nineveh enjoying ""prosperity... under the shade of the caliphate."" Al-Zawahiri may be counting on the withdrawal of most U.S. combat forces from Afghanistan as his best chance of reviving al Qaeda's fortunes. Agent Storm: Inside al Qaeda for the CIA .

"(CNN) -- Nerves for Adam Scott as the defending champion at the Masters? Not so. In fact, the Australian said it had the opposite effect. Scott, bidding to become just the second man in more than two decades to defend his title at Augusta, shot a 3-under-par 69 in Thursday's opening round to leave him joint second alongside 2012 champion Bubba Watson and the man he beat that year, South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen. They trail surprise leader Bill Haas of the U.S. by one shot. ""I think winning very much calms you down here,"" Scott told Sky Sports. ""It's the calmest start I ever had here and it was a pleasure to be out there today. ""It was a fantastic response from the patrons coming to every tee. I loved every minute."" Scott hit five birdies, his lone blemish coming at the 12th with a double bogey. But Rory McIlroy, who entered the tournament as joint favorite with Scott according to some British bookmakers, suspected the 12th would pose problems for quite a few of those in the field. ""I played really well today from tee to green,"" said Scott, the highest ranked golfer at the Masters with Tiger Woods injured. ""I just hit one poor shot on 12. ""I'm very pleased with my start and it's something to build on for sure."" Scott's success a year ago at Augusta marked his first major to end years of disappointment, and although McIlroy owns two major titles, when it comes to the Masters the Northern Irishman is most associated with his agonizing collapse in 2011. He led by four shots entering the final round but then came unstuck. On Thursday he proclaimed himself pleased with his round of 71, to leave him one shot under par. ""I feel good,"" McIlroy, 24, told Sky. ""I feel like I'm better prepared than I ever have been and I think I'll feel like that every year I come back because experience counts for so much on this golf course. ""The golf course set up today was very difficult for a Thursday. Some of the pin placements were pins you'd expect to see on the weekends so to shoot under par today I felt was a good effort."" Early leader . Haas, who has never finished in the top 10 at a major, bogeyed his first hole and the 17th but in between struck five birdies. He birdied the last hole, too. ""I was leading last week after the first round and finished 37th, so I know there's tons of golf left,"" Haas, the son of a U.S. Ryder Cup player, told reporters, referring to the Houston Open. The last Masters rookie to win the title was Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 but three were in contention Thursday: Americans Kevin Stadler and Jimmy Walker, and Swede Jonas Blixt. They all finished at 2-under. Stadler and dad Craig -- the 1982 winner -- became the first father-son combo to compete at the same Masters. Kevin Stadler easily bettered his 60-year-old dad, who shot a 10-over 82 and said it was likely his farewell Masters. ""I played like a moron,"" Craig Stadler told reporters. Meanwhile, three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson was among the big names to struggle at Augusta, after carding a 76. England's Luke Donald finished the day with a disastrous 78, while compatriot, and defending U.S. Open champion, Justin Rose limped home only two shots better off.","Defending Masters champion Adam Scott shoots a 3-under-par 69 in the first round .

"(CNN) -- ""A service allowing travelers who like to get their thrills between the sheets to get them beneath the waves at the same time."" The description provided by luxury travel company Oliver's Travels of its latest offering couldn't be more frank. The new service, called the Mile Low Club, targets couples who seek physical excitement underwater in a private submarine nicknamed Lovers Deep (in case the rest of the clues aren't obvious enough). The innovative holiday destination -- the submarine in question is moored in the Caribbean -- was launched by the British travel company to mark its 10th anniversary. ""We started in business 10 years ago focusing on French chateaus initially, but launched Oliver's Travels in November, the focus being on more quirky and unique properties,"" says Oliver's Travels co-founder Oliver Bell. ""In order to get life to the new brand, we needed to get some exceptional property ideas. ""We had a meeting where we asked, 'where's the coolest place to stay?' We started with the moon and obviously realized that wouldn't be possible so a submarine was the next realistic target, and we found a submarine company with the capability to make it bespoke."" Ocean deep. Pockets, too . The only catch is you'll need pockets as deep as the ocean -- the special voyage costs an eye-watering £175,000 ($292,000) a night. The venture was launched, appropriately, for Valentine's Day, but to date no one has paid up the six-figure sum for a night's stay. Bell is confident the first booking is on the cards. ""We've obviously had some joke inquiries but I'd say we have about five realistic inquiries so I expect one to be booked in very soon,"" he says. ""Obviously if that happens, it'll be high fives all around the office."" So what exactly do you get for your £175,000 a night? Exactly what you want. As part of the service, you choose how to deck out the submarine -- which is currently hired by a variety of different businesses for quirky brand launches -- exactly as you like from bedroom to bathroom, and bar to ballroom. You have to pay for your own flights, but a speedboat will be on hand to take you to and from your submarine. An artist's impression has been done to mock up how the romantic hideaway might look and how you can get under the waves as well as under the covers. The company emphasizes that the crew (captain, chef and butler) will considerately occupy separate, soundproof living rooms at the other end of the vessel. Barry White included . While the sub is currently in the Caribbean, it can be moored wherever you desire. The chef can also offer his in-house aphrodisiac menu including everything from oysters to a fondant of chocolate with an essence of pomegranate. Not enough to get you in the mood? On its website, the company promises the smooth tones of Barry White singing ""You're the first, the last, the everything"" over the sound system. ""Well, the Barry White thing's a bit of a joke really,"" says Bell. ""It's all great fun putting this together but we're also deadly serious about this. ""We know it's not in our usual customer's price bracket, this is very, very high end, but we think that people with that sort of money will have very specific tastes. ""It'll take 12 weeks to kit it out and customers can have exactly what they want."" Bell's one warning is that however wealthy you might be, it's probably not one for the claustrophobes out there. From the artist's impression, there's an element of a Bond villain lair to the submarine, akin to the Atlantis home of the character Karl Stromberg, the villain in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" ""To me, it looks really, really cool but you can have it to whatever taste you like,"" Bell says. Bell has yet to visit the submarine in question but, because of the increasing interest, he's planning a trip to the Caribbean to find out what's in store and how his customers can find love on the ocean floor.","Travel company offers a submarine for couples to the bottom of the ocean .

"(CNN)  -- Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle says in a campaign ad that Democratic incumbent Harry Reid is the ""best friend an illegal alien ever had."" According to her, he tolerates illegal people ""sneaking"" across the border and receiving ""illegal Social Security benefits."" One Democratic commercial isn't much better. Rep. Walt Minnick of Idaho has a spot accusing his opponent, Raul Labrador, of helping illegal immigrants stay in the United States and running a website offering advice on how to seek amnesty. Not to be outdone, Delaware GOP candidate Christine O'Donnell calls for ""closing the border."" She argues we need to stop illegal border crossings before any other legislative action is taken on immigration. Explainer: Illegal immigration 101 . These and other appeals heard on the campaign trail this year are inflammatory and move the immigration issue in the wrong direction. They are based on erroneous assumptions and misguided arguments. These claims play to popular fears and emotions rather than reasoned debate over the controversy. Similar to the views of many Americans, candidates are exaggerating the cost of immigration and underestimating its benefits. Critics assume we can solve the illegal immigration problem through strict law enforcement and putting more money into border protection. Spending on customs and border security rose from $7.4 billion in 2002 to $17 billion so far in 2010, according to the Department of Homeland Security, yet we still have more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Part of the misunderstanding is that 40 percent of those folks are here not through illegal border crossings but from overstaying visas. They came to America through lawful means, but didn't leave when their visas ran out. Half arrived before 2000, according to research by the Pew Hispanic Center, so tougher border enforcement will not eliminate undocumented visitors. Click for more commentary on timely topics . In terms of the drain on government resources, skeptics fail to understand that many illegal immigrants actually pay taxes. They incur sales taxes on purchases, property taxes when they rent or buy homes, income taxes when they are employed, and Social Security payments for jobs. A study by the Social Security Administration, for example, found that undocumented immigrants have contributed an estimated $120 billion to $240 billion to the Social Security trust fund, even though they are ineligible to receive Social Security benefits. Research by the George W. Bush Council for Economic Advisors estimated that immigrants contributed $37 billion annually to the country's overall economic activity. American cities with the biggest increases in numbers of immigrant workers also have the fastest growing economies. Rather than a drag on economic growth and job creation, as is commonly thought, immigrants help spur economic growth through employment, tax payments and consumer purchases. Immigrants are vital to American innovation and entrepreneurship. They perform jobs in agriculture, hotels, restaurants and constructions that many Americans don't want. At the high-skilled end, they set up businesses and create high-paying jobs. One quarter of the technology and engineering businesses launched in America between 1995 and 2005 had an immigrant founder. In Silicon Valley, that number was 52.4 percent. These are not isolated stories. Google, Yahoo, eBay, and Intel are among the companies with immigrant founders or co-founders. Where would the U.S. economy be if Google were based in Russia, Yahoo in Taiwan, eBay in France, and Intel in Hungary? There would be far fewer jobs and much less technology innovation in the United States. To be sure, these ventures have come through the efforts of legal, and not illegal, immigrants. But, some of the crackdowns on undocumented workers, such as the Arizona law, create a chilled climate for those here illegally, possibly persuading other immigrants to take their energy and innovation to other countries. It is time for candidates and political leaders to tell the real story about immigration. Even though illegal immigrants enrage many Americans, it would be prohibitively expensive to deport 11 million people. As a vivid illustration of this point, the Center for American Progress found that mass deportations would cost $285 billion over five years, or an average of $900 for every American. If people actually are worried about government cost, they should support the creation of a pathway to citizenship based on paying back taxes, learning English and collection of a serious fine for illegal entry. Experts say that a full path to legalization would add $1.5 trillion to the American economy over the next decade. It would be cheaper to legalize illegal immigrants than keep them underground and outside the mainstream economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Darrell M. West.","Darrell West: Campaign ads appeal to fears on immigration and spread bad information .

"(CNN) -- The terror group ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) which has shortened its name to ""Islamic State"" or ""IS"", led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, its self-proclaimed caliph, has hit a new low. Having spread across huge swathes of Iraq and Syria, leaving absolute devastation in its wake, its latest offensive has brought it to Sinjar, a city in the north western region of Nineveh in Iraq and home to at least 200,000 of the world's 700,000 members of the Yazidi faith . ISIS has always worn its love for sectarianism on its sleeve, and its vicious hatred for Yazidis has been no mystery. Repeatedly, disturbing videos have been circulated on social media depicting Yazidis held in tiny cells being cruelly taunted by ISIS prison guards. On top of this, ""IS"" propagandists have continuously warned of their intention to execute or enslave the adherents of this ancient Zoroastrian-linked religion, whom they view as ""devil worshippers"" on account of their revering a fallen angel. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that, when it seemed that ISIS were about to sweep into Sinjar last week, thousands upon thousands of Yazidis fled from their homes. Tragically, alongside the local Yazidis that fled were others who had taken refuge in Sinjar the month before, when ISIS captured Tal Afar, a neighboring city. Everyone's fears proved to be rightly placed, with ISIS fiercely battling and soon routing the Kurdish Peshmerga, leaving them in control of Sinjar and many of its surroundings. While most fled to refugee camps in semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, some 30,000 families ended up on Mount Sinjar, where they are now stranded, surrounded by jihadists. They are forced to sleep in caves, faced with temperatures of over 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and have no food or water, let alone arms to defend themselves with. Initially, they could contact the outside world using mobile phones. Now, though, most of these have run out of battery and there is no telling how critical the situation has become. What is for certain is that their prospects for escape are minimal. This is yet another instance of the appalling brutality of ""IS"", a group that has consistently abused the most basic human rights of the people it has forced itself upon. Over the last two months, it has committed countless mass summary executions of Shiite soldiers and tortured and shot hundreds of Sunni tribespeople who resisted its rule before taking to social media to boast about their actions. Likewise, it recently gave the entire Christian population of Mosul a choice -- either they leave their homes and livelihoods, or they pay a tax to IS on the basis of their religion. Those who refused to do either faced death. The list of human rights offenses goes on. These jihadists are making a mockery of international law. It is becoming increasingly clear that they will not stop committing these criminal acts unless they are forced to stop. Unfortunately, the prospects for this are becoming more remote by the day, as ISIS fighters continue from strength to strength, capturing most of north-west Syria's largest military facilities and repelling all counter attacks by the Iraqi Armed Forces (IAF). We, the international community, must not turn a blind eye to what's happening in on Mount Sinjar like we did in the wake of the expulsion of Mosuli Christians or the mass executions of Shiite soldiers. What's transpiring now is a new Kosovo, an ethno-religious cleansing on a huge scale. That it is taking place at the hands of a jihadist group too extreme for al Qaeda, a group that has repeatedly shown that it has internationalist ambitions, is all the more worrying. It is ludicrous that no one has acted against it already when it is clear that neither the IAF nor the Peshmerga is capable of shutting it down alone. ISIS has acted with impunity in the region for far too long. It has been allowed to take control of an area larger than the United Kingdom, commandeer hundreds of thousands of dollars of U.S.-made weaponry and subjugate nearly 6 million people. The international community needs to step up to this most troubling challenge. It must provide substantial and coordinated humanitarian assistance to all refugees and internally displaced people -- of any faith or ethnicity -- in the region. Furthermore, diplomatic pressure must be exerted on Turkey, the only military power in the region that stands a chance of crushing this false caliphate. Ankara must be ready to bury its differences with the Kurds and extend all the assistance it can to them on a human rights basis, even if this means military support. Lastly, it is imperative that states across the world reaffirm their absolute commitment to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which establishes the right to free thought, conscience and belief. If we do not stand by our principles, who will? It is not enough to just condemn something with rhetoric; the world must react robustly and directly to these reprehensible developments. The views expressed in this commentary are solely Maajid Nawaz's.","ISIS has taken control of Sinjar in Iraq, home to members of the Yazidi religious minority .

"(CNN)  -- The Netherlands plans to ban foreigners from the country's famed pot shops, a decision Amsterdam's tourism industry hopes goes up in smoke. The Dutch Cabinet late last month said the measure was needed to ""reduce nuisance and drugs tourism,"" arguing that ""substance use of minors has to be countered more strongly and that coffee shops have grown into large points of sale of cannabis that are hard to manage."" Known as the ""Weed Pass,"" the measure will turn coffee shops into private clubs for Dutch citizens over the age of 18. The memberships will last for a minimum of a year, and each shop will have a capped number of members. ""Persons who do not hold Dutch citizenship will not have access to the coffee shops,"" the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice said in a statement. ""The Cabinet expects that closure of coffee shops to foreign drugs tourists will ensure that they no longer travel to the Netherlands to purchase and consume cannabis. After all, many of them can use the illegal markets available in their immediate surroundings,"" it says. The government said the measure also is needed to crack down on drug trafficking near the borders with Germany and Belgium. ""The number of criminal organizations that will be dealt with will be doubled from 20 to 40%,"" the Ministry of Security and Justice said in its statement. But even in announcing the tougher stand, the government said Dutch drug use has ""remained more or less stable in the past decade."" Under the current plan, the measure will go into effect this year in the southern part of the country, and then for the rest of the country in 2012. The city of Amsterdam, including its mayor, has vowed to fight the measure. ""The Dutch government has decided upon this for the whole of the Netherlands. Amsterdam doesn't want it,"" said Machteld Ligtvoet, a spokeswoman for the Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board. Ligtvoet added, ""Coffee shops are not actively promoted by our organization and are not used in order to attract tourists. However, the mere idea that one can buy and use soft drugs here is an attractive aspect of Amsterdam and its famous spirit of freedom."" The Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board says the new measure should be dismissed because it discriminates against foreigners. The board also says it fears ""soft drugs will be sold on the street again, leading to more crime and dangerous situations."" The Netherlands is renowned for its coffee shops where anyone over the age of 18 can freely walk in and peruse a menu of marijuana and hashish delicacies. Customers can purchase up to 5g of cannabis, and it can be smoked in regular joint fashion, as well as by bong and pipes. Alcohol is strictly prohibited in the shops. Twenty-three percent of Amsterdam tourists say they visit coffee shops during their stays, according to the Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board. ""These tourists are an important (though not most important) economic factor of Amsterdam."" HIGH TIMES magazine has sponsored the Cannabis Cup for the past 24 years in Amsterdam, bringing together thousands of marijuana and hashish enthusiasts in the city known as the ""Mecca of Pot."" This year's Cannabis Cup is slated for November 20-24 and is not affected by the new measure. But the ban could affect next year's event. ""As a result, HIGH TIMES is encouraging all who've always wanted to attend the Cannabis Cup and visit Amsterdam to do so this year,"" the magazine says on its website.","Dutch plan to ban foreigners from coffee shops where marijuana is sold .

"New York (CNN) -- Passengers on a delayed flight at New York's LaGuardia Airport were understandably a bit crabby for a while Thursday evening -- and it wasn't because of the weather or a maintenance issue. U.S. Airways Flight 890, set to depart at 7 p.m., was delayed a half hour after ""a good number"" of little crabs were ""running amok in the cargo hold,"" said Josh Freed, spokesman for American Airlines Group, the parent company of U.S. Airways . Maintenance crews corralled the crustaceans -- which had escaped from their cages on the aircraft as they were in transit earlier -- before the flight was able to depart New York for its destination in Charlotte, North Carolina, Freed said. It's not clear exactly why the crabs were being shipped but it's not unusual for airlines to transport different types of cargo, including live animals, Freed said. US Airways officials announced to passengers at the airport that the flight was delayed because of crabs, according to Anna Scarcella, who was on the flight. She tweeted: ""Ladies and gentlemen your flight is delayed b/c a box of live crabs spilled out in the cargo bin during flight"" @USAirways how is this real"" ""I think everyone appreciates knowing the cause for their delays and I don't know how anyone wouldn't find this funny,"" Scarcella told CNN. James Gillespie was flying to North Carolina for a wedding. He said he was concerned about arriving too late to make the drive. After learning the delay was minimal, he said he found the entire ordeal ""amusing."" ""Because the delay wasn't that long, I hadn't seen much anger,"" Gillespie said of other passengers. ""They (passengers) just couldn't believe the reason."" The situation was such, though, that even hard-shelled airline industry veterans could see the humor. Scarcella said, ""I fly a lot so I expect inconvenience but I appreciated the humor here. I don't think I was alone in that."" CNN's Laura Ly and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","Crabs roamed after escaping their cages in the cargo of a plane at New York's LaGuardia airport .

"New York (CNN) -- A stretch of New York City was renamed Saturday to honor a U.S. soldier who killed himself in Afghanistan allegedly after weeks of abuse. Pvt. Danny Chen was 19 when his body was found in a guard tower in Afghanistan in October 2011. He died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The new street, ""Private Danny Chen Way,"" is located in Manhattan's Chinatown, the neighborhood where the GI grew up. ""This was a vote for tolerance, acceptance, and above all, respect,"" New York Council member Margaret Chin said last year when the council voted to rename a portion of Elizabeth Street in lower Manhattan. ""Private Danny Chen Way will be an enduring testament to the life of this remarkable young man, and serve as a powerful reminder that bullying and racism have no place in our society."" Allegations of racially charged hazing, physical abuse and bullying by fellow soldiers are believed to have contributed to Chen's death, according to a council statement. The Chen family told The New York Times in October 2011 that officials said that he had suffered physical abuse and ethnic slurs by superiors, including an incident in which he was dragged from his bed and across a floor for failing to turn off a water heater after showering. In December 2011, eight U.S. soldiers were charged in connection with Chen's death. When it announced the charges, the Army did not specify what acts were alleged to have been committed by the soldiers, but family members said Chen had complained in letters of harassment by fellow soldiers before his death. At the time, an Army official said the soldiers were charged with hazing and abusing Chen in the weeks and days before he killed himself. Army Sgt. Adam Holcomb, who was charged with maltreatment and assault, was demoted and sentenced to 30 days in prison in July 2012, though he was cleared on the more serious charge of negligent homicide.","A section New York's Chinatown is renamed ""Private Danny Chen Way""

"(CNN) -- Formula One championship leader Nico Rosberg claimed pole position for Sunday's British Grand Prix after a rain-affected qualifying session that saw his Mercedes teammate and title rival Lewis Hamilton slip back to sixth position, having at one stage looked set for top spot. World champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull claimed second position on the grid at Silverstone on Saturday, while McLaren's Jenson Button boosted hopes of a home winner by qualifying third. Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen of McLaren picked up positions four and five respectively. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 29 points overall, had looked set to claim pole but pulled out of his final lap believing the damp conditions meant he could not better his Q3 time. But as the skies cleared and track dried, Rosberg, Vettel, Button, Hulkenberg and Magnussen all passed the Briton. Rosberg, with whom he has had a tetchy relationship at times this season, later spoke of his relief at Hamilton's decision. ""Wow, what a qualifying. It was so tricky out there this afternoon with the rain and the conditions changing so quickly,"" the German said. ""My last flying lap was difficult because we were very tight for time and I was stuck right up behind Lewis. ""Luckily he didn't finish his lap but I remembered that we were losing three or four seconds in the last corners when it was very wet, so there was an opportunity to make a real improvement and that I should keep going."" ""It's a great opportunity to start the race from pole and I'll give it everything to take the win tomorrow."" Latest results and standings . Hamilton, seeking his first home victory since his championship-winning year of 2008, was left to rue his bad judgment. ""I made a mistake today and pulled out of the lap when I should have kept going. It was a tough qualifying with the changing conditions and we got through most of it really well, until the most important part,"" the Englishman said. ""It was my decision, a bad call, and that decided my qualifying. ""I need to have a start like I had in Austria two weeks ago and then do my best to get back to the front; you never know what might happen."" Hamilton can at least comfort himself at getting as far as the final qualifying session. There were shock exits in Q1, as Williams' Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas were eliminated along with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. It was a big setback for Massa and Bottas, who were on the front row in Austria just two weeks ago. Elsewhere, Force India's Sergio Perez claimed seventh position just behind Hamilton and in front of Red Bull's eighth-placed Daniel Ricciardo.","Nico Rosberg claims pole at British Grand Prix on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Afghan insurgents who staged a daring, well-planned raid on Camp Bastion, the military base where Britain's Prince Harry is deployed, were wearing U.S. Army uniforms, NATO said a day after the attack. It's extremely rare for Afghan insurgents to use U.S. uniforms in their attacks. The last time CNN can identify was more than two years ago, when NATO repelled attacks on two bases in Khost province in August 2010. No coalition troops were killed in that attack, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said at the time. At least two U.S. Marines were killed in the brazen strike late on Friday, and six jets were destroyed, ISAF said as it released more details about the raid. Well-trained, well-rehearsed fighters carried out the sustained assault in Helmand province, ISAF said. About 15 insurgents organized into three teams penetrated the base's perimeter fence and did considerable damage, destroying six refueling stations and damaging six aircraft hangars. The attackers toted automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. They destroyed six AV-8B Harrier jets and damaged two others before the attack ended, the coalition said. Fourteen of the fighters were killed and one was wounded and captured, ISAF said. Eight coalition military personnel and one civilian contractor were also wounded. It is too soon to say whether the attackers had ""inside knowledge,"" ISAF spokesman James Graybeal said. ISAF would not say how the attackers got the uniforms, but CNN staff who have spent time in Afghanistan say they are for sale in markets there. There has been at least one other case of Afghan insurgents wearing U.S. uniforms, in May 2010. And in Iraq five years ago, there was a dramatic and successful raid using the tactic. Attackers wearing what appeared to be American uniforms were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of five U.S. soldiers in Karbala, Iraq, in 2007. Prince Harry is an Apache helicopter pilot based at Camp Bastion, but the British Ministry of Defence categorically rejected reports in Sunday's British press that he was just a few hundred yards away from the gun battle. Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne, ""was in no way in any danger"" during the latest attack, ISAF spokesman Maj. Martin Crighton said earlier. On Saturday, ISAF said the camp is secure and the strike would not ""impact"" air and ground operations. Camp Leatherneck, the U.S. side of the base, was not affected by the attack, Maj. Adam N. Wojack, an ISAF spokesman, told CNN. The joint base is located in a remote desert region of Helmand, the southern province in the Taliban heartland. The Taliban said it carried out the strike, calling it a response to the anti-Islam film stoking anger among Muslims. Yet Crighton said there had no organized demonstrations outside its gates before the assault. Afghanistan has seen only relatively small and peaceful demonstrations against the film during a week in which there were protests across predominantly Muslim-countries and other locations. Separately, four American troops were killed by Afghan police on Sunday, an administration official said after NATO's International Security Assistance Force reported the attack. The latest attack on coalition troops by their supposed Afghan allies brings the number of people killed in so-called ""green on blue"" incidents to more than 50 this year. The killing of the four Americans on Sunday is the latest in a series of incidents in which members of Afghan security forces have been suspected of turning their weapons on coalition or Afghan soldiers, known as green-on-blue attacks. White House says Karzai, Obama committed to preventing Afghan riots . Sunday's killings came only a day after the British Ministry of Defence announced that two troops had been killed in Helmand province's Nahr-e Saraj district. In that attack, a man wearing an Afghan police uniform fatally shot two members of the 3rd Battalion at a checkpoint, according to Maj. Laurence Roche, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said in a statement released by the ministry. The killing occurred the same day that another British soldier died in in a separate incident in Nahr-e Saraj, according to the ministry. He was killed when his vehicle struck a bomb. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Adam S. Levine, Kevin Flower, Jessica King and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: It appears to be the first time Afghan insurgents have worn U.S. uniforms in years .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Laura Siegfried sat aboard Delta Flight 656 to Bermuda on the morning of August 28 thinking about where she had been and where she was going. A month before, she was exactly where she and her family had expected she would be: working at a marketing firm in northwest Arkansas after graduating from the University of Arkansas in December. But she hated it. The 24-year-old felt underpaid, unappreciated and unmotivated. She knew she needed to make a change. After a month of planning, she accepted as job as an au pair for a family with two children in Hamilton, Bermuda. What's in an airport name? Sitting in her seat waiting to take off, Siegfried said she was ""absolutely flipping out excited but I was so nervous. I thought my knees would give out. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was about to move in with a family I had never met on a 12-month agreement. It was pretty intimidating."" You can learn a lot about people by looking at what they post on social media when they're at the airport. That day in late August, CNN sent a team of more than three dozen journalists to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to document an entire day at the world's busiest airport by volume of passengers and the number of takeoffs and landings. (The stories CNN discovered both behind the scenes and among travelers will be published on November 20.) At the same time, thousands of people passing through the Atlanta airport were telling their own tales via social media. Siegfried's close family and a few friends knew about the move, but nobody else did. So to officially announce her big move to the world, she took a photo of her boarding pass and passport and posted it to Instagram with the following quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: ""I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move."" Now, two and a half months later, she has no doubts. Though she misses her family and friends, she feels a great sense of personal achievement and growth for making the move. 10 airport restaurants that taste like home . ""Relocating is never an easy thing to do -- especially by yourself -- but I am too curious about the world not to,"" Siegfried said. ""I love it here, I am able to impact the lives of kids and set a good example for them. ... Sometimes the happiest decisions may not always look like the most impressive ones on a resume, but I'm OK with that -- for the time being."" First step toward a lifelong dream . Later that day, 17-year-old Nicholas Erebia sat in the terminal waiting for a flight to Columbus, Ohio, that would bring him closer to achieving a lifelong dream. Since he was 5 years old, the high school senior from Acworth, Georgia, has wanted to attend The Ohio State University. The dream dates back to when he was living in Akron, Ohio, and watched his aunt graduate from Ohio State. As he got older he rooted for the school's sports teams and told everyone that when he was old enough, he would enroll at the Big Ten school. So as he waited for Delta flight 1030 to board, he was anxious and nervous, but also excited about the three-day campus trip he was about to take. That's when he posted a photo of his boarding pass on Instagram with the caption: ""My first official college visit, and it's at @theohiostateuniversity!! So ready!! #GoBuckeyes."" During the 90-minute flight, Erebia shared a row with his father and twin brother, who both fell asleep. But he was wide awake, staring out the plane's window, thinking about his future. ""I realized, 'Wow, I'm going to visit the college of my dreams,'"" Erebia said. The visit only strengthened his resolve. If he is accepted, Erebia plans to study aviation and business so that he can be a pilot for the Navy and then a commercial airline pilot. Erebia said he needs to score higher on the SAT if he wants to fulfill his dream. ""But with hard work and the passion I have for the university, I know I can get in."" 'I was so happy' Denise Pennamon was so excited about her trip to the airport that she couldn't sleep the night before. But she wasn't flying anywhere. Instead, the arrivals lobby at the Atlanta airport would serve as the site of her first meeting with her granddaughter, 2-month-old Suri. The Monticello, Georgia, woman's son and daughter-in-law live on an Air Force base in Idaho, so she had only seen pictures of her first granddaughter. Pennamon stood with a group of relatives in the arrivals lobby waiting for the infant to emerge with her parents. ""I cried. I was so happy,"" Pennamon, 47, said. ""It was so special to get to see them. I thought I wouldn't see them until Christmastime. Everybody was trying to be the first one to hold the baby."" While Pennamon was with a large family contingent at the airport, she wanted to share the joy of meeting Suri with a wider group. So at 9:05 p.m. she posted a picture to Instagram of herself holding the baby in her arms and looking into her eyes. ""Meeting my grand daughter for the first time,"" the caption said.

"(CNN) -- A Red Crescent official and a priest were among the two dozen reported killed Wednesday in Syria, where a pro-government militia stormed neighborhoods in a city already notorious for an earlier revolt. The Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross called for Syria to investigate the killing of Abd-al-Razzaq Jbeiro, the Red Crescent secretary-general for Syria and the head of its operations in Idlib province. The international Red Crescent said Hisham was driving in a vehicle ""clearly marked"" with its emblem when he was killed. ""Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers administer life-saving first aid to the injured,"" the Syrian organization's president, Dr. AbdulRahman al-Attar, said in a written statement. ""Like all medical personnel, they must be allowed to carry out their work in safety."" Jbeiro was on his way back to Idlib from a meeting in Damascus when he died, the Red Crescent said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said he was shot in the head by a ""terrorist group."" In the flashpoint city of Hama, security forces and pro-government militias assaulted neighborhoods overnight, an opposition activist group reported Wednesday. Among the dead was a priest who was killed while trying to give first aid to a wounded man, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an umbrella group. The LCC identified the priest as Basilious Nassar of the nearby town of Kafr Buhum. He died as militia members pushed into various neighborhoods in Hama, a bastion of Syria's anti-regime sentiment, according to the LCC. The forces bombed the Bab Qebli area ""from all directions"" and destroyed several buildings, the group said. Several deaths and injuries were reported, according to the group, and the constant shelling made it impossible to rescue the wounded in the western city. Soldiers also launched mortar shells in several neighborhoods, including those of al-Hamidiya, al-Faraya, Jarjameh and Alalillat. Explosions and gunfire rang across the city, and soldiers fired rocket-propelled grenades and nail bombs at houses, the LCC said. Samer Al Husain, an activist with the Revolutionary Council of Hama, told CNN from Damascus that al-Faraya was surrounded by ""hundreds of thugs and military forces"" late Wednesday. All streets in and out were closed, and Syrian troops were cutting off telecommunication lines, he said. ""This is what the regime usually does when it intends to start a crackdown,"" he said. Hama is the site of a notorious 1982 clampdown by the government of Hafez al-Assad, the father of President Bashar al-Assad, and ""tens of thousands"" of people died at the time, the group said. Another 953 Syrians have been killed in Hama since the current unrest started in March, ""including 21 women, 53 little boys, 16 little girls, and 33 that were martyred under torture,"" the LCC said. Hundreds were killed there in August when Syrian forces moved in with tanks and armored vehicles ""to obliterate the city ... during the first days of Ramadan,"" the group said. The LCC said 24 people were killed nationwide on Wednesday, including six from the Free Syrian Army, a group of defectors from the country's armed forces who have taken up arms against the al-Assad regime. At least four died in Hama, another four in Homs and five in the Damascus suburbs, the group said. The Syrian government blames the violence on terrorist groups and says security forces are only trying to protect civilians. CNN cannot independently confirm events because the Syrian government restricts access of international media to the country. The uprising against the regime and the resulting government crackdown have engulfed the country for more than 10 months. The United Nations last month estimated that more than 5,000 people have died since March. Opposition groups are estimating a higher death toll. The LCC said Tuesday more than 6,600 deaths have been documented since the unrest began. Avaaz, a global political activist group, said the death toll has exceeded 7,000. On Wednesday, Syria's government agreed to a month's extension of the Arab League monitors' mission there. The 22-member Arab League has called on the al-Assad regime to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders -- including the international news media -- to travel freely in Syria. The league is working on a proposal for al-Assad to transfer power to his vice president following the formation of a national unity government. The group's plan calls for the government to start talks with the opposition within two weeks and for the formation of a new government within two months. A new constitutional council would follow, as would a plan for parliamentary and presidential elections. A draft U.N. resolution on Syria obtained by CNN calls on ""all states"" to take steps similar to those the Arab League undertook in November when it imposed sanctions on Syrian authorities. Russia, a Syrian ally, has been seen as an obstacle in developing a tough U.N. resolution toward the al-Assad regime because it has veto power as a permanent council member. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, whose country has been sharply critical of the Syrian regime. The Russian news agency Interfax reported that Lavrov said ""Russia and Turkey are urging all the sides in Syria to stop violence, and consider any outside military intervention to be unacceptable."" Lavrov said it seemed to him that ""our fundamental approaches coincide. We are certainly calling for an end to violence in Syria, wherever it is coming from,"" Interfax reported. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Arwa Damon, Raja Razek, Yousuf Basil and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Red Crescent, Red Cross want inquiry into humanitarian official's death .

"(CNN) -- Love that chocolate Haagen-Dazs ice-cream? But what about the way its makers treat their farmers? How about KitKat and the way its production impacts the environment? In a campaign to push big companies towards more ethical sourcing, international development group Oxfam is asking people to think about food producers' attitudes towards issues such as climate change and workers' rights the next time they dig into their favorite treat. Oxfam's ""Behind the Brands"" scorecard compares the way the 10 largest global food and drink companies do business. The report, first compiled last year, looks at transparency, women's rights, farmers' rights and land, water and climate sustainability. It relies on a ""naming and shaming"" strategy which asks people to share their concerns about the industry on social networks. According to Oxfam, users asked companies to change their practices nearly 400,000 times since the campaign was first launched last February -- making their requests by sharing information on social media or printing out an information poster. A year after its launch, the campaign is now looking at how these companies have improved their business practices. Of the 10 biggest food and drink companies, nine made improvements to their policies in the last 12 months and improved their scores, Oxfam says. General Mills, the seller of Haagen-Dazs and Yoplait, was the only one to see their score drop. Oxfam's assessment is not favorable. ""General Mills doesn't recognize key issues like the right to earn a living wage,"" the report said about the company that sells Betty Crocker, Cheerios, Haagen-Dazs or Old El Paso. General Mills, like other low-performing companies, blames Oxfam's methodology for its poor scores. ""We do feel our efforts merit a stronger score,"" the company's spokesperson said. ""General Mills is strongly focused on sustainability,"" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement to CNN. ""We regularly report our progress in our annual Global Responsibility Report. Our report tends not to mirror the Oxfam scorecard, and because the scorecard is based only on publicly available information, that may be a key factor in their ranking,"" the statement said. Associated British Food, the brand behind Jordans cereals and global tea business Twinings, improved its score slightly compared to last year when it finished last -- but in this year's report, Oxfam still highlights its lack of ethical sourcing policies. ""In reality, the group's policies are much, much more effective than Oxfam gives it credit for,"" a spokesperson for ABF, which finished second to last, told CNN. ""At ABF, we believe we have policies and practices in place to deliver a genuinely effective corporate responsibility strategy,"" ABF said in a statement. At the other end of the spectrum are the companies Oxfam praises for their drive to change their sourcing attitudes. ""Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola have joined a race to the top on policies that help address issues like hunger, poverty, women's rights, land grabs and climate change in their supply chains,"" the report said. Nestle scored the highest marks on the issues of climate change and water usage, while Coca-Cola came top of the table at supporting women's rights. Unilever, the owner of Ben & Jerry's and Lipton got thumbs up from Oxfam for their support of small-scale farmers. But Oxfam says even the top-ranking companies still have a long way to go. ""It will take time for them to reverse a 100-year history of relying on cheap land and labor to make mass products at huge profits but at high social and environmental costs. The race to the top is under way and there are clear leaders and laggards,"" Byanyima added. Read more: Unwrapping the chocolate industry .

"(CNN) -- Blake Fielder-Civil is trying to kick his Amy Winehouse habit now that he's seen photos of the singer cavorting with another man in the Caribbean while he sits in a British jail. Blake Fielder-Civil and Amy Winehouse in happier times. The pair married in 2007. Celebrity lawyer Henri Brandman confirmed to CNN that Fielder-Civil has asked him ""to commence divorce proceedings on the grounds of Amy's adultery."" Winehouse was quoted by a London tabloid last week saying she was ""off the drugs for good"" and has a new man in her life, 21-year-old actor Josh Bowman. ""I've finally escaped from hell,"" Winehouse told the News of the World. ""I'm in love again, and I don't need drugs. Look at me; I'm glowing!"" The tabloid also published pictures of Winehouse and Bowman in playful poses on a beach on the island of St. Lucia. Grammy-award-winning singer Winehouse, 25, married Fielder-Civil, 26, in May 2007. Since then, both have been arrested on drug charges together and separately. ""I don't know what's going on with us now, and for the time being I've just forgotten I'm even married,"" Winehouse told the tabloid. ""I'm just here on my own, happy and having a good time with Josh,"" she said. ""I'll deal with Blake when I get back. But our whole marriage was based on doing drugs."" Fielder-Civil is currently jailed in England after a failed drug test in December. Winehouse, 25, is well-known for her song ""Rehab,"" which describes the singer's reluctance to enter a clinic. She won five Grammy awards last year -- three for ""Rehab"" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. Winehouse has battled drug addiction and spent about two weeks in a rehabilitation clinic last January. Police started investigating her last year after obtaining a leaked home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she was heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium.

"(CNN) -- The man who has gone over the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups with a fine tooth comb wants FIFA to make his report public. Michael Garcia's stance puts him at odds with soccer's world governing body which has insisted the 250-page report should be kept private. The American lawyer gave the report to FIFA's ethics chief Hans-Joachim Eckert earlier this month. ""Given the limited role Mr Hans-Joachim Eckert envisions for the Adjudicatory Chamber, I believe it is now necessary for the FIFA Executive Committee to authorize the appropriate publication of the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process,"" Garcia said in a statement. ""Publication would be consistent with statements made by a number of Executive Committee members, with the view recently expressed by Independent Governance Committee Chair Mark Pieth, and with the goals of the reform process."" Garcia's statement was released ahead of a two-day FIFA executive committee meeting in Zurich, which begins Thursday. FIFA was not immediately available for comment when asked for a response to Garcia's desire for the report to be made public. The 2018 World Cup was awarded to Russia while the 2022 tournament will be staged in Qatar. Last week FIFA president Sepp Blatter tweeted: ""Everyone in the global football community has a responsibility to act ethically. Football fans rightly demand this. FIFA has taken the lead."" However, one of the criticisms leveled at FIFA is that the organization is not transparent enough and ""reform"" will not take place without greater transparency. Some FIFA officials, notably vice-presidents Jim Boyce of Northern Ireland and Jeffrey Webb of the Cayman Islands, as well as executive committee members Moya Dodd of Australia and Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, have all demanded Garcia's report to be made public. For the last four years Qatar's successful bid has been dogged by controversy. Issues relating to the feasibility of playing in scorching summer temperatures, the conditions of migrant workers building World Cup infrastructure and allegations of bribery and corruption have all been raised. British newspaper The Sunday Times has published a number of stories into the bidding process for the two World Cups and in one story claimed a Qatari official paid more than $5 million to secure support for his country's bid. Qatar has said it provided full cooperation to Garcia and has also said that it won the bid fairly. The debate has also raised questions about whether Qatar could lose the 2022 tournament and, if it did hold the event, at which time of the year it should be played. Some like UEFA boss, Michel Platini, believe a re-vote is necessary if corruption accusations are proven.","Michael Garcia wants FIFA to make the findings of report into 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process public .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Thai authorities have raided two premises and seized nine babies -- allegedly fathered by one Japanese man -- as part of the country's crackdown on suspected illegal surrogacy. One of the raids was on an IVF clinic involved in the birth of Gammy, a seven-month-old boy with Down syndrome left in Thailand by his Australian parents. The case has made international headlines amid accusations from his surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, that Gammy's parents weren't interested in taking their son, who also has a serious heart condition. The parents have denied that they wanted to leave him, according to a statement from a friend to the Bunbury Mail, who said they were told their gravely ill baby was going to die. Japanese man wanted 'a big family' Along with the raid on the clinic, authorities searched a condominium in the Lad Phrao area of Bangkok after receiving a tip-off about the presence of several women and babies. Police found nine babies, ranging in age from newborns to one year old, who were being cared for by seven Thai ""nannies,"" said Paveena Hongsakul, chairwoman and founder of the Paveena Foundation. All of the children appeared to have been well taken care of and had been moved to a government-run orphanage, she said. Police Colonel Panthana Nujchanart said a Thai lawyer acting for a Japanese man claimed the babies belonged to his client. He wanted to build ""a big family,"" the lawyer said. ""It is very unusual for a father to have nine babies at the same time,"" said Boonruang Triruangworarat, head of Thailand's Department of Health Service Support, adding that police were continuing to question the nannies. Code of conduct 'breached' The raids came amid an international furor over the fate of baby Gammy, who was born via surrogate with his twin sister in December. Their parents took the female twin back to their home in Bunbury, Western Australia, leaving their son with the surrogate mother who was concerned how she'd pay for his care. At a press conference in Bangkok on Thursday, Boonruang said it was ""very clear"" that the clinic involved in Gammy's birth had broken the law governing the establishment of medical facilities. He said the clinic had failed to ensure its doctors followed the Medical Council's Code of Conduct. The code states that surrogacy is allowed only when the surrogate is a blood relative of the parents and doesn't receive any payment. ""It's clear for this case that (Pattaramon) is not a relative and also she has received money to carry the baby,"" Boonruang Triruangworarat said. Authorities have previously said they would not pursue legal action against Gammy's mother, a 21-year-old food stall worker who is caring for the baby alongside her own two children, aged six and three. However, if charged and convicted, the clinic operator faces one year in prison and a fine of 20,000 baht (US$619). The doctor who performed the procedure could also be struck off. The Medical Council is currently reviewing the doctor's medical license, Boonruang said. Around 20 doctors work at the clinic, which has performed about 100 surrogacies so far, authorities said. It's one of 45 clinics and hospitals that are authorized to perform IVF across the country.

"(CNN) -- There is a new level of intensity in the courting of the Hispanic vote, and it culminated last week in two Univision Candidate Forums, one with Gov. Mitt Romney and one with President Barack Obama. But before I get to that, there's the issue of the secretly recorded videotape of Romney's remarks at a fundraiser earlier this year, where he was caught on camera saying it would have been helpful if he were Latino. This election cycle, we have seen political operatives perfect the art of feigned outrage. After the video was released, Democrats pounced on the remark, calling it offensive and insulting. The question regarding Romney possibly having Mexican heritage has come up before. Romney's father was born in a colony of American Mormons in Mexico and soon after, the family moved back to the United States. In Romney's last interview with Univision, in January, the network's co-anchor, Jorge Ramos -- who is fiercely proud of his Mexican descent -- told Romney that under the Mexican Constitution, he could claim Mexican citizenship. Ramos asked Romney why he wasn't embracing his Mexican roots when he could be the first Latino president. Romney answered then with a similar answer to the one on the video. He gave a brief description of the circumstances of his father's birth, but then explained that neither he nor his dad was Mexican or had any claim to Hispanic heritage. He finished by quipping, ""I don't think people would think I was being honest with them if I said I was Mexican-American. But I would appreciate it if you'd get that word out."" I saw nothing wrong with Romney's answer. Neither did Ramos. Romney is not funny. When he tries to be, it often comes across as awkward. But his remark was not offensive. What would be insulting is if he used his father's Mexican birth to try to pass himself off as what he is not, solely for political purposes. Romney is not Latino. And he is right: Being Latino would probably help him improve his Latino support, which is around 26%, according to the most recent Gallup poll. It might give him a better understanding of our culture and idiosyncrasies. It would help to be able to say some words in Spanish when campaigning in swing states like Florida, New Mexico and Nevada. Even then, Romney would not win the Latino vote, but it could at least marginally improve his numbers. Now, back to the Univision Forums: The Presidential Debate Commission did not choose minority moderators. So Univision organized its own forums with both candidates. They weren't debates, but pointed and relevant questions were asked. I was at both forums. At the forum with Romney, a rowdy and wildly supportive crowd clapped, whooped and hollered at practically every word he said. When the moderators asked questions the audience members didn't like, they booed. Romney got a lot of help from this audience. It gave him energy and unconditional support and reinforcement. The next day, the Obama crowd was starkly different. It was solemn and eerily quiet. That turned the conversation somber at times. Obama supporters accuse the Romney campaign of packing the room with supporters. That's what campaigns are supposed to do. Both were given the same number of tickets. The Romney campaign out-organized and outsmarted Camp Obama. Obama gave Univision an hour; Romney gave it only 35 minutes. This was an unfortunate decision. For most of the interview, Romney surpassed expectations and made a good showing. He got a real grilling over his immigration positions. This would have happened no matter how short the interview. Romney said things during the primary that have come back to haunt him. His tone has now changed. He's gone from talking about self-deportation to saying there will be no massive rounding up and deportations of undocumented people. Now, instead of promising to veto the Dream Act, he invokes Sen. Marco Rubio's plan. He is still not giving much detail on the thornier immigration questions. He talks about fixing legal immigration but doesn't say how he is going to address the 11 million undocumented people already here. It's a mystery to me what he plans to do with the young undocumented students currently covered by the Obama administration's deferred action directive, which halts their deportation. His campaign tells me his answer could not be any clearer. I have a law degree and still cannot decipher his words. Apparently, neither can the experienced journalists who keep asking him the same question over and over again hoping for a real answer. In a Telemundo interview, he was asked four separate times if he planned to revoke or keep the Obama directive, which will last for an initial period of two years. During the Univision Forum, co-anchor Maria Elena Salinas tried unsuccessfully three times to get him to give a ""yes"" or ""no"" to the same question. Nada. All we got was an unpresidential display of a candidate dancing, prancing and pirouetting around an issue. It was the low moment in an otherwise successful interview for Romney. Next it was Obama's turn to get grilled about immigration. He was held accountable for promises he made four years ago. Perhaps the most poignant moment came when Obama was asked what he considered his biggest failure. With sad resignation, Obama said it was not having passed immigration reform. Salinas ended the point by telling Obama, ""So I think the answer is, yes, with many excuses, but you actually broke your promise."" Ouch! This was a rare moment of humility. In a way, it felt cathartic that after years of making excuses, he finally took responsibility and admitted he failed. It revealed Obama's vulnerability on the issue. I would not be surprised to see that exchange turned into a 30-second Spanish ad by the Romney campaign. Here is what mattered most: Both candidates recognized the Hispanic vote is crucial and deserves attention. It is to the advantage of Hispanics not to be taken for granted by one party and ignored by the other. Hispanics will realize their political power only if courted and engaged by both sides. This week we were. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ana Navarro.","Ana Navarro: There is a new level of intensity in candidates' courting of Latino vote .

"(CNN) -- Calling him ""arrogant and defiant,"" a Wayne County Circuit Judge on Tuesday sentenced former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to four months in jail with no early release under the terms of a plea deal. Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick listens as he is sentenced Tuesday in Wayne County, Michigan. Kilpatrick pleaded guilty last month to two felony obstruction of justice charges stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case. In imposing the sentence, Judge David Groner harshly criticized Kilpatrick for his conduct, particularly for a televised speech that aired hours after he entered his pleas. ""That night, the community expected to hear a message of humility, remorse and apology,"" Groner said. ""Instead, we heard an arrogant and defiant man who accused the governor, among others, for his downfall.""  Watch the judge issue the sentence » . While a presentencing report submitted to the court said Kilpatrick accepts responsibility for his actions, Groner said he questioned the former mayor's sincerity. ""Many defendants have stood before this court. However, this case is different, and you are not the typical defendant,"" the judge said. ""... You were expected to lead from the front and set an example."" Kilpatrick was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up an affair with his then-chief of staff, Christine Beatty. When that deputy, Gary Brown, filed a whistle-blower suit last summer, Kilpatrick and Beatty denied under oath that an affair had taken place. Groner noted that after a jury found in Brown's favor, Kilpatrick publicly vowed to appeal, only to do a ""180-degree"" turn after he found out the plaintiffs were in possession of text messages that gave evidence of the affair. Brown then urged the City Council to approve settlements, which cost the city $8.4 million -- closer to $9 million after legal costs. In January, the Detroit Free Press revealed the text messages that contradicted Kilpatrick's and Beatty's testimony. After the text messages were made public, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy charged Kilpatrick and Beatty with multiple counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and misconduct in office. The most serious charges would have carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison upon conviction. Beatty resigned her post after the text messages were made public, but the case against her remains pending, Worthy said. The Free Press reported Beatty has rejected several plea deal offers, the last of which would have required her to serve 150 days in jail. Worthy told reporters after Kilpatrick's hearing that she was satisfied with the result, but could not comment extensively on Kilpatrick's case. ""We have another defendant to try,"" she said. ""I don't want to step over that line."" Kilpatrick must also pay the city of Detroit $1 million in restitution, Groner ordered, and forfeit any future pension. He initially refused to resign, and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm had called a hearing on whether she should remove him from office at the request of the Detroit City Council. Granholm adjourned those hearings after Kilpatrick pleaded guilty and agreed to resign. In the speech after he pleaded guilty September 4, Kilpatrick told reporters Granholm and city officials should work for the people of Detroit as hard as they did to get him out of office. He told the crowd his marriage is better than ever, and kissed his wife to resounding applause when he concluded his remarks. He said he decided to step down so the city could move forward. Groner also ordered Kilpatrick to sign an order of revocation regarding his law license. Because of a pending complaint against Kilpatrick, he could not surrender the license, but instead had to agree to revocation -- something his defense attorneys argued vehemently against. Groner told them the issue could be raised on appeal if necessary. The judge did, however, deny prosecutors' request that Kilpatrick repay $22,000 in costs unique to prosecuting his case -- including the purchase of new door locks for their offices. He also refused a prosecution request to order that Kilpatrick attend anger management counseling based on the July 24 incident involving the police officers, saying it was ""an isolated incident"" and he knows of no other evidence that Kilpatrick is violent or requires counseling. Worthy said she was disappointed with that decision, but acknowledged, ""It is unusual to ask for prosecutors' costs. ... A lot of judges aren't familiar with that."" On the law license, she said, ""Frankly, I'm surprised we were even having that discussion,"" adding that defense attorneys, prosecutors and ""everybody was clear that the license should be given up. He should not practice law."" Groner imposed the sentence at the end of a lengthy hearing featuring remarks from a phalanx of prosecutors and defense attorneys. The judge grew impatient with members of Kilpatrick's defense team, most of whom made extended remarks. The hearing itself began more than a half hour late, as attorneys met to discuss terms of Kilpatrick's plea bargain, according to the Detroit News. And the imposition of the sentence was punctuated by two court recesses as attorneys wrangled over conditions. During the hearing, Kilpatrick's defense attorneys pleaded with Groner to keep in mind the benefits he had brought to the city as mayor. But prosecutors read statements from both police officers involved in the incident, saying they had suffered lasting effects from it.","Judge sentences former Detroit Mayor Kilpatrick to 120 days in jail, no early release .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Most people know international recording artist Will.i.am (born William James Adams Jr.) as the producer and front man for The Black Eyed Peas, the Grammy-winning group that has performed at the Super Bowl and sold more than 18 million albums worldwide. But Will.i.am is also a huge gamer and techie. When it comes to technology, he's much more than just a gear head. He actually visits NASA for rocket launches and works with nonprofits such as FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) to encourage kids to build robots. He also serves as Intel's director of creative innovation. At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, Will.i.am announced that he's doing a global tour with Intel to promote its new Ultrabooks. Fans will be able to follow his journey as he visits 12 countries in 12 months recording music and filming his adventures. He helped design the new willpower360 app, which allows viewers to experience the Ultrabook Project from any angle. And -- and! -- not only did Will.i.am help create one of the top-selling music games this holiday season, Ubisoft's The Black Eyed Peas Experience, he actually helped Microsoft design the Kinect for Xbox 360 technology that powers the dance game. The man behind the games chatted with CNN about his love of video games and tech at CES in Vegas. The following is an edited transcript of that conversation: . CNN: What's a favorite memory of playing video games when you were young? Will.i.am: We were poor. We couldn't afford video games. So I would go to my friend Calvin and Douglas' house to play his Nintendo or Markey's house to play the Atari 2600, Intellivision or Colecovision. We'd always go to Markey's porch, and he used to have them there. We had to pay 15 cents to play one of his games, whether it was Pong or Combat. You remember Combat and having those graphics? Just think about that. Wow! CNN: What did you think of the music in those old-school games? Will.i.am: I remember playing Donkey Kong and Pac-Man and thinking, ""Wow, who designed the audio for that?"" Some guy was like, ""Oh, shucks. When Pac-Man eats the ghost should it be booo-oomp!"" I wonder what they were thinking when they made the audio. CNN: Did game music influence you at all? Will.i.am: I remember when Super Nintendo came and then the graphics changed and that was a big leap because you saw Mario from different angles. That was cool. I did a beat. I have a track where I sampled that game. I have my hip-hop Mario underground music. That's when he goes underground (in the game). CNN: Did you play games as they got better over the years? Will.i.am: Yeah. I remember Joust and then Q*BertC, right with the graphics started getting better and then there was Pole Position and Mike Tyson Punch-Out. That's when Nintendo started coming in. I loved Duck Hunt. Do you remember Gyromite? What was that all about? And then Zelda came out. That's when I was like it's all about video games. Zelda. Did you save the princess yet? Did you get the fairy? Where's the fairies at? Wow, that was like the dopest. And there was that little pond that you had to go to get some more lives and stuff. I loved that. I mean, that's my childhood from just video games. CNN: What are you playing these days? Will.i.am: My favorite game is Madden. That's it. I'm a Madden addict. I go at it. I design my own teams. People online always go, ""I'm not playing you, you're a freaking cheater."" And I'm like, ""What are you talking about? You can design your own team too. We can just play with our own teams anyways."" CNN: Who's on your Madden team when you design them? Will.i.am: Oh, I make names up like Little Whoop A** or Little Speedy. I make a little short guy that runs really fast; change his attributes and whatnot. I like big dudes, like 6-foot-2 quarterbacks. That's what I like doing. So that's why I play Madden. CNN: Do you play any other games? Will.i.am: I freaking love Grand Theft Auto. Don't have me play that because I don't even do the missions. I just like to see what I can do to make the cops come chase me and see if I can run from them. But Madden's my favorite. CNN: What was it like working on The Black Eyed Experience game? Will.i.am: Two years ago, I would go up to Seattle and consulted on Natal. That's what it was called before they coined it Kinect. Project Natal. So I'd go up to Seattle and put in all the work, when I finally saw the video game, I'm like, ""Wow, that's what I was consulting on?"" And my group got the benefit off of all that flying back and forth. I'd work with (Ubisoft) and say, ""Oh, no, the dancing shouldn't be like this. We should make it so once I sit down the avatar shouldn't turn into a noodle. You got to fix it to like."" And they'd work on that. And I'm like, ""OK, cool. Also, it should have some type of gesture where the beat slows down and then the choreographer dance guy instructor tells you what you're doing wrong. You should have it do that. It should be real."" And they'd work on that. CNN: What impact have you seen your game have on fans? Will.i.am: What I've noticed with BEP Experience was it was the Christmas thing to do, it was the New Year's thing to do when families got together. I read Tweets like, ""Oh my gosh, I haven't had that much fun with my daughter in years. I haven't had that much fun with my wife in years. I haven't had that much fun with my brother for years."" When families come together and they're doing this Black Eyed Peas experience with songs that they all know, it's great. It's a great extension of the Peas. And it goes back to all the work I did going back up to Seattle working on Code Natal, which is now Kinect. It's been a great journey and I'm proud of the result. CNN: What's your favorite piece of technology that you can't live without? Will.i.am: Really I want to say my phone. I like my phone because that's the thing, but really it's my laptop. I can Tweet with my phone and I have all my addresses in it, but now it's backed up to my computer. So if I lose my phone, I lose it. It has a code (password) on it. Nobody's going to get into it. I just get a new phone and download. It's really my laptop that I can't live without. CNN: How do you use your laptop creatively today? Will.i.am: I've been making music on desktops and laptops for a long time now, so to use this Ultrabook, which is lighter and offers better performance is great. I love DJing with it. I love creating with it. If you imagine what it was like when Michael Jackson was making music, we used to make music in studios and the music played on the radio. Now you're making music on a computer and you listen to it on the computer. So just the idea of that is amazing.","Will.i.am visits NASA for rocket launches and works with nonprofits such as FIRST .

"Washington (CNN) -- Watching President Obama react to what he called his ""shellacking"" in the midterm elections had me remembering then-President Bill Clinton back on November 9, 1994 -- the day after he and his fellow Democrats lost control of the House and the Senate. I was then CNN's Senior White House correspondent and I vividly remember attending Clinton's news conference. Like Obama this week, he was humble in defeat. None of us knew what to expect from Clinton on that day 16 years ago, but he came out and was direct -- he said that he took responsibility for the political disaster. On Wednesday, Obama was clearly somber and sad. But like Clinton in 1994 he answered questions for nearly an hour. What a difference it was for both presidents from their election days. Clinton was in Little Rock in November 1992 when he was elected: Obama was in Chicago on November 4, 2008, when he was elected -- exactly two years ago today. How quickly their political fortunes changed. A fundamental lesson in American politics is that things can -- and often do -- change rather dramatically and very quickly. And that means that things can dramatically change over the next two years as well. So the issue for Obama is what he does next. Does he follow Clinton's playbook and move toward the center -- what was called ""triangulation""? Will Obama separate himself from the liberal base of the Democratic Party -- as Clinton did? As much as Obama doesn't want to do that, he's a politician, and politicians have a very powerful instinct for their own political survival, especially when they face re-election in two years. Just ask Clinton. He pushed for welfare reform and a balanced budget -- to the deep concern of his liberal base. But he beat Bob Dole and was re-elected.","Wolf Blitzer attended Clinton's 1994 news conference after Democrats lost Congress .

"Oakland, California (CNN) -- If college athletes were to start being paid, many schools would leave Division I sports, NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday. And the universities that stayed in Division I sports would have to start cutting other, less popular sports to be able to afford the salaries. There would be less competition and no more national championship games — at least not in their current form, Emmert said. Emmert testified at the landmark federal trial for former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He and other athletes are suing for the opportunity for future athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses when they play sports on television. Emmert said he believes the customs that most college sports fans hold most dear -- the camaraderie of game day, the tailgating, the atmosphere of a stadium packed with nearly 100,000 fans and the pride of cheering for a university team -- are at stake. ""Traditions and keeping them are very important to universities,"" Emmert said. ""These individuals are not professionals. They are representing their universities as part of a university community. ""People come to watch ... because it's college sports, with college athletes,"" he said. Those beloved traditions go hand in hand with the model of amateurism, and if amateurism goes away, so will the games as we know them now, he said. Many schools lose money on Division I athletics but keep them for the ""social cohesion"" and the boost to their profiles, Emmert said. Emmert said officials at several member schools have told him that if athletes were to start getting paid beyond the cost of attendance, institutions would ditch Division I sports and opt for Division II or III, in which coach's salaries, stadiums, hype and scholarships are much smaller. ""Do the members want the sports to remain amateur?"" an NCAA lawyer asked. ""Yes,"" Emmert replied. ""If the rules were changed to permit student athletes to be paid for (names, images and likenesses), would that change what college sports is all about? ""Yes, it would."" Never before has the NCAA membership — leaders at about 1,100 colleges and universities — proposed changing the rules to allow college athletes to be paid. However, they are currently considering giving athletes a bit more ""miscellaneous"" money to cover the full cost of attending college. Emmert, a much-anticipated witness at the three-week trial, testified for five hours Thursday and is expected to continue on Friday. On the stand, Emmert embodied the NCAA's no-budge, no-compromise take on the issue of pay-for-play, citing the organization's century-old history. In the five years since the O'Bannon suit was first filed, there have been several controversies and many attempts to reform the NCAA. Emmert acknowledged that public opinion of the organization is low and that part of his directive when he took this job was to fix that. While he made no concessions to the argument of hypocrisy in college sports — the idea that everyone else involved makes money, except the athletes — Emmert did concede that the commercialization of college sports is overwhelming the amateurism. He said the use of athletes' names, images and likenesses is ""one of the most debated topics in NCAA history."" One of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson, displayed picture after picture of athletes with corporate logos and asked, ""Putting athletes in front of logos, that's all fine under NCAA rules?"" ""It's not something I'm personally comfortable with,"" Emmert responded. ""... It's certainly not where I would prefer the rules be drawn."" Responding to questions from U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken about commercial exploitation, Emmert said the schools have chosen to define it to mean that college athletes should not be acting as ""pitchmen"" for products. A recent poll conducted by the Saint Leo University Polling Institute showed that 66% of Americans don't think athletes should be paid beyond scholarship money. But complicating the issue are recent academic scandals and consistent court testimony from athletes from several different schools that they were athletes first, not students. Emmert responded by saying that it's hard to get motivated athletes to focus more on schoolwork, but he insisted that they are motivated to play college sports because of the education they receive. But when he was asked about that education, he first mentioned the life experience that athletes earn on the field, then discussed what they learn in class. O'Bannon's lawyers questioned Emmert at length about an e-mail sent to him at the start of his presidency by a senior member of the organization, Wallace Renfro. It said ""the notion that athletes are students is the great hypocrisy of intercollegiate athletics"" and said the public believes the athletes are exploited in the name of money for higher-caliber coaches and bigger stadiums. Last week, O'Bannon's lawyers said that even if Wilken were to rule in their favor, the conferences and colleges could still decide on their own not to share any of the television revenues with athletes. As long as the NCAA doesn't have a rule against it, it would still be OK for colleges to choose not to pay. Rules, Emmert testified, are necessary. ""It's essential there be a body that provides rule-making,"" he said. ""One of the most fundamental principles of fair competition is that everyone is playing by the same rules. Everyone understands they are governing and conducting the game the same way from one side of the country to another. You couldn't do it nationally without those rules.""

"(CNN) -- In 2010 the African Union launched a decade-long initiative to promote women's empowerment and put female rights at the heart of development in the billion-strong continent. Dubbed African Women's Decade (AWD 2010-2020), the ambitious scheme aims to create the conditions for the active participation of women in the socio-economic development of the continent. Now, more than two years after the Nairobi launch, African Voices caught up with three diaspora-based, prominent African activists to discuss the current state of women's rights in the continent. CNN spoke to Rainatou Sow, Marie-Claire Faray and CNN Hero Betty Makoni -- an edited version of the interviews follows. Rainatou Sow . Rainatou Sow is the founder and executive director of ""Make Every Woman Count,"" an organization that monitors female rights in every African country. The Guinean activist was named ""Inspirational Woman of 2012"" by the UK group ""Women 4 Africa."" CNN: ""Make Every Woman Count"" publishes an annual report detailing the treatment of women in each country to remind people that African women are watching. Rainatou Sow: Yes, that's the message. Basically, when they launched African Women's Decade it was in Nairobi -- you had people from all over coming, delegates, African governments, it was a big feast. But then after a few months you hardly heard about it -- because of the credit crunch basically we didn't hear about financing going into women's projects there and it was really calm. So we thought what can we do? Are we going to sit down and let this decade pass away, or are we going to do something, mainly us as the younger generation. I see this as an opportunity to really push the agenda of women's rights in Africa because most of the time African voices are lost in the field. So every year we do the overview annual report where we do all the 54 countries. We evaluate all of them, regarding what they have been doing this year on women's rights, in education, reproductive health. See also: U.N. director: 'Women will change world' CNN: Why do you think African voices aren't being heard? RS: I think that's really missing. Whatever we do, we should make sure that we invite those women to come to tell their own stories because that is how you could best help her. Not you talking for her. By using the power of social media, of the internet, really reaching women around Africa and in the diaspora here and that is what we are really trying to do -- to really give African women the voices they deserve that we haven't seen so far. CNN: Do you think it's hard to get donors to move beyond the mindset of the emergency aid to more sustainable approaches? RS: Yes, that is what we are trying to do. A lot of women are really raising their voices about that because there is no sustainability and that's the big problem. After so many years of aid we haven't seen an impact on the ground. So for me it is about time to maybe sit back and look at what we have done wrong and how we can improve things to try and ask the local communities and then go ask people, ""so what have you already done here?"" Marie-Claire Faray . Marie-Claire Faray is an activist from the Democratic Republic of Congo who campaigns to end violence against women, especially in her home country. As a member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, she is advocating for change and pushing for action during the AWD 2010-2010. CNN: What are you hoping to achieve with the AWD? Marie-Claire Faray: We really hope to bring a lot of women on board to first of all commit to changing at the individual level, local level, national level and international level. We hope to bring women from all backgrounds -- not only the lawyers, the politicians, but also the grassroots women, particularly them, to come and hold their government to account. CNN: Because in many African countries the legal framework is there, what's been missing is the accountability. MCF: Definitely, not only the accountability but the action plan to set changes. This decade is actually just a time frame for us to evaluate every year during this decade what achievement has been done and what challenges lie ahead of us. But ultimately, in 2020, we want to look back and say ""we have at least achieved this in this country"" -- for example ""in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have achieved more women in parliament, the end of violence against women, the end of sexual violence."" We want to look at places like Mali, where there is conflict right now, and see what women have achieved to end this conflict. CNN: Does it feel like no one is listening to African women as to what their priorities are? That people are coming from the outside and deciding for them? MCF: Of course, because not only people are deciding for us, but people are talking for us. This is what the Congolese women are saying, ""end the war and sexual violence in the Congo."" We feel that some of the agenda that African women such as Congolese women want to put forward to end the war is not being listened to because there is another agenda so that the illegal trade of natural resources will continue in the Congo. CNN: Many women's groups in the Congo feel not enough is being done. So it is not about getting the voices heard, it's about what happens next. MCF: Yes, I think Gandhi said it, ""if you want to see change, you start it within yourself."" If we want to see change in the Congo, we have to work for that. So it's about ourselves, about working with African women all together to make that change. Betty Makoni . Betty Makoni is a Zimbabwean activist fighting to rescue girls from sexual abuse. She was raped at the age of six and lost her mother at the age of nine. After surviving these traumas, she vowed to devote her life to protecting young women and girls from abuse. Through her program ""Girl Child Network"" she says she is protecting more then 300,000 girls in her home country. Among the many honors she has received, Makoni was named a CNN Hero in 2009. CNN: You have experienced some of the worst deprivations, yet you are standing, saying ""listen to me, it can be done, we can move beyond all of this, we can start over with a new generation."" Betty Makoni: Definitely, I'm coming to confirm that. People are looking at big organizations like the United Nations, SADIC or EU. They don't come to your house when you are being raped, they don't come to your community when you are being stopped from going to school. Action begins with an individual girl like myself who was adopted into a good girls school and I said: ""I've got the brains but no money, allow me in."" It was my voice, so it is that voice of an African girl we are trying to say ""let it come out."" So, I think let's enable; the girls in Africa, the women have been disabled, they've received handouts, they've been given fish to eat instead of the fishing rod. But we are coming to change that, to say that there is potential we can unleash. See more: Tribute to Betty Makoni . CNN: It's easy to say that African women's voices need to be heard but often there is a huge price to be paid when African women speak out. Yourself, in the end, you had to leave Zimbabwe and come to the UK. BM: I left Zimbabwe because I dealt with sensitive issues like high-profile rape cases involving children, like rape is a weapon of war. Those are not matters that governments take so easily, but I'm saying wherever you can be positioned it's very strategic for you to continue contributing. I know my life in Zimbabwe was not going to be safe, that I can confirm, but I travel globally now, there are many countries in Africa that have accommodated me. Africa does not only consist of a small country, Zimbabwe, it also consists of the whole continent joined together. So as African women let's not give up -- even if there is a backlash we can strategically use technology to keep speaking out like I'm doing; we can set up offices elsewhere; we can mobilize other people elsewhere to support us. So there is still hope even when you are uprooted like in my case. CNN: If there was a message that you would like the international and donor community to hear about what women in Africa need, what would it be? BM: The best thing would be, let's go build all these offices on the ground, in villages, rural areas, in high-density suburbs, family areas and then let's open the doors. Once we open the doors the ideas will come in. Because a solution is not far from the person who is affected by a problem -- normally persons with challenges, they have got solutions of their own.","Rainatou Sow, Marie-Claire Faray and Betty Makoni are advocates for equal rights .

"(CNN) -- The thing about presidential elections, be it in Ukraine or anywhere else for that matter, is that it makes sense to ignore everything that was said during the election campaign and, especially, in the immediate aftermath. Election promises are made to be broken or ignored altogether -- remember ""Yes We Can?"" And in the first few days, or even weeks, after results are announced lots of things are said that mean pretty much nothing. To say that the presidential election campaign in Ukraine produced a lot of statements and pledges that made little or no sense would be an understatement. If you summarise them all, then Ukraine should be in fine shape to join the G7 group of industrialised nations, replacing Russia, in about five years' time. The election winner, confectionary billionaire Petro Poroshenko, and his nearest rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko - the two have received 57 and 12 per cent of the votes respectively - have promised to unite Ukraine, suppress the rebellion in the east, return Crimea grabbed by Russia, revive the country and put it smack at the heart of Europe while practically no-one even bothered to contradict them. And even Darth Vader -- one of 17 candidates for the presidency, walking around in full Star Wars costume -- didn't really sound over the top compared to others. The whole point of the hastily-arranged election in Ukraine was to get a ""legitimate"" president, of sorts, to emerge in Kiev, even if he would be the best of the worst, as someone said, and attempt to introduce some sense of normality in Ukraine which has been rocked by violence and upheaval since November last year after the then President Viktor Yanukovich walked away from a free association deal with the European Union, and was later ousted as a result. All the talk of a possible second round if no-one won more than 50 per cent of the vote was obviously intended to put a bit of ""competitiveness"" into elections that were predetermined from the moment one of the favourites, former heavyweight boxer Vitaly Klitchko, stood down from the race, throwing his impressive weight behind Poroshenko. Not to mention the approval of his candidacy by Washington (President Barack Obama's cover was blown when he congratulated the winner before the votes had been counted -- he really needs some coaching in the art of diplomacy.) Announcing his victory late on Sunday, Poroshenko said all the things that he had been saying during his election campaign: That under his presidency Ukraine would be united, that the economy would grow, that the country was going to join Europe, that he was prepared to deal with Russia but would never accept the annexation of Crimea and the two referendums on independence that had been conducted in Donetsk and Lugansk regions in the east on May 11. Opinion: Will Ukraine's new president tame country's elite? In fact, the ""Candy Man"" as he was dubbed during the election campaign, said that the anti-terrorist operation in the east against the anti-Kiev rebels would be intensified, although hinted that it won't be running for months but would be wound up relatively quickly. If that wasn't a hint to Moscow that the soon to be crowned new leader was open to suggestion, then I don't what is. The big challenge that Poroshenko, a clever political operator who has managed to steer through troubled waters under four presidents, is facing comes from the mere fact of his victory. As of now, the buck stops with him and he will be held responsible for anything that happens in the country. That was why the cunning Tymoshenko, when she accepted defeat in the election, pointed out that her former opponent was now in charge and would be taking on the weight of responsibility. (Tymoshenko still fares her chances of becoming president quite highly and, as I was informed, plans to highlight all the problems that Poroshenko would no doubt start encountering with gusto.) Seasoned Ukraine watchers, who have slept through the current revolution in Kiev and failed to predict the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich in February, have now got a new spring in their step, pointing out that a lot would depend on how the Kremlin will play its cards and whether it would be serious in dealing with Poroshenko. Although Moscow has already signalled, on all levels, that it is prepared to give the new Ukrainian leader a chance, and a possible visit to Russia in June has already been mentioned. But, ironically, the biggest challenge facing Poroshenko in the next several months comes not from Russia or the so-called separatists in the east but from Ukraine's very own oligarchs, who now see the newly-elected president as a potential threat to their business empires. It was one thing when Poroshenko was just a candidate, but once that inauguration comes, he will have the power to not only to put financial pressure on the oligarchs but also to order their arrest and put them in prison for the many sins they have committed. And the example of Tymoshenko ending up in the slammer in the times of President Yanukovich must be still fresh in their minds. Make no mistake, the oligarchs with their vast wealth, their personal armies and their people in the government machine, the police and the intelligence services will not stay idle. The horse trading and the scratching of backs was going on ever since Poroshenko emerged as the favorite for the presidency. But that doesn't mean he can't be pragmatic and go back on his promises. And it sure doesn't mean that the rest will keep their word as well. Especially as some of the oligarchs actually prefer a situation of instability and uncertainty, as they thrive under such conditions and find it easier to jostle for power. So what can happen in the next year or so? Well, the parliamentary elections will obviously take place this year in Ukraine, with Poroshenko promising to ""see them through."" The talks with Russia will commence very soon, if only to resolve the gas supply issue, but won't bring any dramatic results on most other subjects in the foreseeable future, with the prospect of Crimea coming back to the Ukrainian fold looking as likely as Joe Biden winning the next presidential election in the U.S. So the only realistic way out could be agreeing some sort of compensation, paid out by Russia to Ukraine, say something like $500 billion over a period of 10 years or more, in return for Kiev accepting the loss of the peninsula and the world recognising it as part of Russia. The resolution of the problem with the separatist Donetsk and Lugansk regions promises to be a thorny issue, but if Poroshenko and President Putin were able to negotiate a ceasefire in the next few weeks or so, this would be seen as a great achievement. And although Poroshenko is telling everyone that the idea of federalism and giving Donetsk and Lugansk greater autonomy is totally unacceptable to him, things, as has been pointed out above, do tend to change a lot after elections, so he might change his mind on this one as well. Finally, a lot will depend on whether the U.S. and the EU would actually allow Poroshenko some serious room for manoeuvre to deal with President Putin. If he is boxed in by the demands of his Western patrons to keep the pressure on Moscow high, then his chances of achieving anything will be quite slim and the other oligarchs might just be tempted to bring him down. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexander Nekrassov.","Election promises are made to be broken or ignored altogether, writes Alexander Nekrassov .

"(CNN) -- Nearly all underage immigrants waiting for visas to stay in the United States will have to start the process all over again when they turn 21, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday. The 5-4 vote created an unusual bloc of justices with at least five different interpretations of the federal law at issue. The case deals with whether those seeking permanent status under a family preference provision, but then ""age out"" because of the often lengthy visa approval process, have a right to appeal the agency's order reassigning them to the adults-only category. The majority agreed with the Obama administration, concluding the Board of Immigration Appeals made a ""reasonable"" interpretation of what the court called ""ambiguous language"" in the immigration application rules. In the face of such ambiguity, courts typically defer to the agency's interpretation, as the justices did in this instance. The Supreme Court appeal came from a Salvadoran immigrant, Rosalina Cuellar de Osorio, who applied for visas on behalf of her and her 13-year-old son. The lengthy process stretched past the young man's 21st birthday, at which time he lost his ""automatic conversion and priority date retention."" That meant he went to the back of the line to begin the application process anew to become a lawful permanent resident, which caused him to wait years longer for the visa. The appeal is not related to the recent spike of unaccompanied immigrant children coming over the U.S. border from Mexico. Federal officials last week had begun transporting about 1,000 such youngsters from Texas to Arizona, as part of a resettlement process for the minors to their native countries. Most are from Central America. Referring to an aged-out applicant, Justice Elena Kagan said, ""In the unavoidably zeroÂ¬-sum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the board could decide that he belongs behind any alien who has had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate."" ""Were we to overturn the board in that circumstance, we would assume as our own the responsible and expert agency's role,"" Kagan added. ""We decline that path."" Under the court's ruling, only a small group of young visa applicants would be eligible under the Child Status Protection Act. That allows them to keep their priority underage status -- ""Peter Pan-like"" as Kagan put it -- throughout the immigration process, even after they turn into adults. But under complex immigration rules, which Kagan again said parts of which were ""through and through perplexing,"" the government says several thousand other visa applicants age out of the process each year. Some immigration groups had argued that could extend the wait in some cases by nearly a decade. The federal Immigration and Nationality Act allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent resident aliens to petition for certain family members to obtain visas to immigrate to the country or to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident alien. As Kagan observed, ""All of this takes time - and often a lot of it ... and as the years tick by, young people grow up, and thereby endanger their immigration status."" Chief Justice John Roberts agreed the board's conclusions were reasonable, but he and Justice Antonin Scalia had a different idea of what made the law ""ambiguous"" in the first place. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was among three other colleagues who disagreed with the majority. ""Because the court and the BIA ignore obvious ways in which [federal law] can operate as a coherent whole and instead construe the statute as a self-contradiction that was broken from the moment Congress wrote it, I respectfully dissent,"" she said. Justices Samuel Alito, Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas also separately dissented. Several current and former members of Congress had also opposed the administration's interpretation of the rules. Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, along with Republican colleagues John McCain and Orrin Hatch, were among 26 lawmakers who said the 2002 law they promoted would preserve family ties and not unfairly punish children who patiently waited for a visa. Current efforts at broader immigration reform have stalled in Congress. The case is Scialabba v. De Osorio (12-930).","Supreme Court ruling will impact nearly all underage immigrants waiting for visas to stay in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- There are no easy answers when journalists have to decide how to cover a terrorist group's video. The issue resurfaced Tuesday when a member of the Islamic extremist group ISIS was shown on camera beheading American journalist Steven Sotloff. No major news organization showed the gruesome conclusion of the ISIS video, but many did show screen grabs and short video clips of Sotloff and the executioner, as well as another hostage that ISIS is threatening to kill. The video is newsworthy -- even if it also plays into the propagandistic hands of the people who produced it. But a vocal flock of viewers and readers -- and some fellow journalists -- have deplored the decisions to show snippets of the video, reprising arguments that were made in August when news organizations showed screen grabs of James Foley, another American journalist who was beheaded by ISIS. ""Can't believe this bears repeating, but one should not empower ISIS by publishing their PR materials,"" freelance journalist Jeb Boone wrote on Twitter after the Sotloff video emerged. One major international broadcaster, Al Jazeera, said it had decided not to show any images of Sotloff from the video -- a more conservative position than other television networks. ""We suggest all media do the same,"" Al Jazeera's public relations account said via Twitter, using the hashtag #ISISmediaBlackout. Not showing the video at all, however, risks sanitizing the grim reality of the world. So most media outlets tried to strike a balance. ISIS ""would like us to show you the most graphic images on that video, as part of their campaign of terror. We will not,"" CBS News anchor Charlie Rose said as he introduced a segment about Sotloff's death. Instead, CBS showed only video clips from it. Media figures also tried to demonstrate some self-awareness when dealing with the issue. ""No way to avoid leading the show with ISIS butchery and yet, maddeningly, that also seems like what ISIS wants,"" Chris Hayes wrote on Twitter before his 8 p.m. MSNBC program. Newscasts tended to show more photos of Sotloff in the field, reporting on stories throughout the Middle East, than of him as a hostage. But screen grabs from the video were still widespread, including on CNN's homepage and television networks. The Foley video surfaced on the social media website Diaspora, as reported by INSITE, a blog on terrorism and extremism run by the SITE Intelligence group. It was later put on YouTube and promoted via Twitter. The Sotloff video was discovered on an unidentified file-sharing website by the SITE Intelligence Group, which researches terrorist threats. Perhaps that's why social media reactions to the Sotloff video were more muted -- or perhaps, terribly, it's because the shock value was diminished the second time around.","No major news organization showed the conclusion of the ISIS Steven Sotloff video .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday brushed off widespread criticism that the December 4 parliamentary elections in Russia were falsified. He said their results ""reflect the actual line-up of forces in the country, as well as the fact that the ruling force -- the United Russia party -- has lost certain positions."" In his traditional year-end question-and-answer program, televised live by state media, he said there is nothing new in the fact that the opposition is not happy with the election outcome. ""That happens every time and will be happening in the future. The opposition always struggles and takes every opportunity to sideline the authorities, to blame them and to highlight their mistakes. It is a totally normal thing."" Speaking of large-scale protests that took place last Saturday in Moscow and many other cities across the country, Putin said he is glad that many young and active people were participating in them. ""If this is the result of 'Putin's regime' that people now have a chance to express their point of view, it is normal,"" he said, ""as long as all those actions are within the law."" He said there were established procedures in place for resolving disputes, including through the courts. ""We should proceed from the assumption that our courts will act fast and be objective,"" he said. Putin suggested the opposition's criticism of the vote has a far-reaching goal -- that of aiming to undermine confidence in the upcoming presidential election in which he is running. ""It is obvious to me that the attacks on the latest election are secondary; their primary goal is the next election, the Russian presidential election,"" Putin said. ""It is necessary to minimize the possibility of claims that this or future elections may be unfair in order to cut the ground under the feet of those wishing to de-legitimatize the national authorities."" The Russian opposition is not alone in voicing concern over the conduct of the election, however. The Organization for Security and Cooperation said in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" Its election-observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also said the United States had ""serious concerns"" about the election and called for a ""full investigation"" of apparent irregularities. Looking ahead, Putin said the opposition must have the opportunity to control everything that is going on at polling stations, and he proposed that live web cameras be installed at all voting stations across the country in the presidential elections next March. ""I am proposing to the Central Electoral Commission to install live web cameras at every polling station across the country -- at more than 90,000 of them -- and let those cameras work round-the-clock, day and night, to take in on to the Internet so that the entire country could see what is going on at every polling box -- to completely remove all concerns about falsifications,"" the prime minister said. Tens of thousands turned out Saturday to protest against election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power but with a smaller majority. Police estimated crowds in Moscow at 25,000, while organizers said the total was 40,000, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Either figure would make the protests the largest in the Russian capital in 20 years. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted ""Putin out."" They also braved freezing temperatures in other Russian cities to demonstrate against what they said was vote fraud. Another protest is scheduled for December 24 -- three days after the new parliament is due to hold its first session, under a decree signed Tuesday. Putin said that such public protests and discontent should not undermine Russia's political system. ""We have qualitatively new tasks for the medium-term and longer, strategic prospect. We will need to re-configure society, strengthen the political system and broaden the foundation of democratic institutions. Naturally, we need to modernize every sphere of life,"" he said. Putin promised that if he is elected president, he will work and maintain contact with all political forces in the country, including the opposition, ""although it's often useless or impossible.""","Vladimir Putin says critics are trying to undermine upcoming presidential elections .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In the suburbs of Afghanistan's capital on the third floor of a modest apartment building live newlyweds Mushtaq and Haleema Changezi. They tied the knot in a traditional ceremony just four months ago, yet their families are wondering why they haven't started a family. ""This is supposed to be a new chapter in our lives -- we should be excited,"" explained 27-year-old Haleema. ""But there is no future for us here in Afghanistan, so how can we possibly start a family?"" Haleema has a double masters degree in economics and accounting. She has applied for dozens of jobs in Kabul but can't get one interview. Her 30-year-old husband works for a production house in multimedia design -- his salary is just enough to support them. They are both Hazaras -- Persian-speaking ethnic Afghans who over the years have been persecuted and discriminated against. Escaping dangers of home . The couple feels this is still the case and the reason why so many Hazaras have left their homeland for foreign shores. ""In our country there are NATO forces, the aid of foreign countries and yet we don't feel we have a life or a future. What's going to happen when the foreign forces leave in 2014? There is no future for us in Afghanistan,"" she said. This is a familiar story, not just among the Hazara community but also across the Afghan community in general -- many are fearful of what will happen to their country once coalition forces leave in two years time. Australian vote keeps question mark over asylum seekers . Despite assurances from ISAF -- the International Security Assistance Force -- that includes U.S. and NATO forces, there has been an increase in violence across the country. Analysts say the Taliban are no longer based only in their Helmand province heartland in the country's south and along the eastern border with Pakistan. They are now spread out across all 34 provinces using suicide attacks and IEDs -- Improvised Explosive Devices -- to target coalition and Afghan forces, as well as innocent Afghan civilians. Which countries take in most refugees? This resurgence has frightened many Afghanis, including Haji Ali Mohammad. He decided to send his two sons and nephew to Australia to escape the war-ravaged nation. ""They were going to Australia for work, to make a better life, a good and peaceful life, away from the Taliban. Our life is dangerous here -- we don't feel secure,"" he said. His sons, 19-year-old Akbar and 22-year-old Javid, joined their cousin, 20-year-old Hashim, on their 11,000-kilometer journey. Organized by people smugglers they flew to Dubai and then to Thailand where they picked up visas. From there, they caught a plane to Malaysia where the trio traveled by boat to Indonesia. The three eventually boarded a leaky wooden fishing vessel bound for Australia's Christmas Island. ""The last time I spoke to them, they said we're leaving tonight. The next time we call you we'll be in our new home -- Australia,"" said Mohammad. A few days later, he received a call. On the phone was another passenger from the fishing vessel. He said within a few hours of leaving shore the boat began to sink. Of the 18 men on board, only 10 survived. Among the dead were Mohammad's sons and nephew. ""The people who survived, held onto broken pieces of ship until the rescue boats arrived. My boys knew how to swim but not in that much water for hours on end,"" Mohammad said. The father of 11 children then broke down in tears. ""A bright day turned into a dark night. The anniversary of their deaths is approaching. I miss them constantly."" Thousands of Afghan asylum seekers attempt the long and treacherous journey to Australia every year. Frustrated with waiting for political asylum though the official channels, they pay smugglers up to US$20,000 per person -- and there's no guarantee, just the promise of a brighter future. For Mushtaq and Haleema Changazi they are trying the legal route and for good reason. Haleema's 28-year-old brother, Ishaq, set off earlier this year because he didn't want to wait any longer.

"(CNN) -- Same time, same date, same length. No, you haven't stepped into a time machine -- President Barack Obama's address to the nation on his strategy for dealing with the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, delivered on September 10, 2014, had some striking similarities to his address on airstrikes against Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria delivered exactly a year earlier. The bottom line was different. On September 10, 2013, Obama announced the United States would not be launching airstrikes in Syria; on Wednesday, he announced the U.S. military would. Here's what changed and what didn't over the past year: . WHAT'S CHANGED? No set timeline . In his 2013 address, Obama was very clear that any military action in Syria would have been limited in its scope. ""This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities,"" he said. Strong reaction to Obama statement: 'ISIL is not Islamic' In his speech on Wednesday, the President told Americans that this campaign to take out ISIS would take time and left unanswered the question of how long the fight against the terrorist group might last. ""Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL,"" he said. ""This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years."" 9/11 . Although it took place on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Obama's speech last year didn't include any mention of 9/11. His speech on Wednesday did, though it was just one line: ""Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked."" A recent CNN poll showed that 53% of Americans are concerned with acts of terrorism in the United States around the 9/11 anniversary, an increase from 39% in 2011. A frightening, far-reaching new world of terror threats since 9/11 . The popularity factor . Obama acknowledged in 2013 that military intervention in Syria was not going to be embraced by the American public. ""Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular."" CNN polling taken in September 2013 showed that was true: Only 29% of Americans thought it was in the national interest of the United States to get involved in Syria. This time, the politics are a bit easier. Americans overwhelming support additional airstrikes against ISIS -- 76% according to CNN polls. WHAT HASN'T CHANGED? This is not going to be a repeat of the Iraq war and there won't be ""boots on the ground."" This continues to be a key point for the President, who never supported the war in Iraq. He stressed it in 2013, saying: ""I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan."" He stressed it again on Wednesday. ""As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission -- we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq."" Obama doesn't need the approval of Congress, but he'd like it. For a president that frequently blames Congress for not getting things done, Obama has demonstrated an enthusiasm for including them when it comes to the question of military action in Syria. ""Even though I possess the authority to order military strikes, I believed it was right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress,"" Obama said in 2013. ""I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress. And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together."" Transcript: President Obama's speech on combating ISIS and terrorism . He made a strikingly similar remark on Wednesday. ""I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL. But I believe we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger."" One key difference though between then and now is the actual likelihood of congressional approval for military action. In 2013, it was clear by the time Obama gave his East Room address that an authorization vote was going to fail in Congress. On the fight against ISIS, it appears likely that the President will get support from Congress on at least some elements. Ted Cruz: How U.S. can stop ISIS . America can't fight every evil . Early in his remarks on Wednesday, Obama noted ""we cannot erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm."" It was something he pointed out last year. ""America is not the world's policemen,"" he said at the end of his 2013 remarks. ""Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong.""","President Barack Obama's made a speech on Syria exactly a year ago .

"(EW.com) -- Thanks to his role as a throne-swiveling talent scout on NBC's hit singing competition The Voice, Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine is now a stand-alone star — one who seems awfully pleased to see his every move, from the silly beefs with fellow Voice coach Christina Aguilera to the flings with Victoria's Secret models, get street-fliered across the media landscape. Which makes it all too tempting to put him to his own show's test. What if we could listen to a new Maroon 5 album with our backs turned to the band? If we didn't know about Levine's trysts, his Voice image, and the band's yo-yoing chart history (including 2010's disappointing Hands All Over and last summer's smash ''Moves Like Jagger'')? Would we still hear star potential in these boys from Brentwood? In the case of ""Overexposed,"" Maroon 5's fourth album in 10 years, the answer is mostly no. But not for lack of effort on their part: Inspired, perhaps, by the crossover appeal of ''Jagger,'' the group has drafted pop kingpins Max Martin, Benny Blanco, and Ryan Tedder — who regularly deal dope beats to Britney, Katy, Usher, et al. — to thoroughly Top 40-ify their game. So it's hardly surprising that on much of the album, which never quite finds a balance between rock grit and dance-pop glitz, Maroon 5 barely sound like a band at all. Tracks like ''Love Somebody'' and the Coldplay-ish ''Daylight'' have choruses so thickly produced that the only physical instrument you can reliably pick out is Levine's larynx. Not that he comes off as particularly organic either, since his voice is usually processed into a kind of high, disaffected whine — like a male Rihanna or an android castrato — that's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook. His lyrics don't help the songs make up much ground. ""Overexposed""'s self-aware title is just about the strongest wordcraft on the album; its verses alternate between horndog rhapsodies (''I light you up when I get inside,'' Levine sings on ''Doin' Dirt'') and bratty put-downs of some Everygirl who always disappoints, whether she's ''drown[''ing''] me in questions'' (''Fortune Teller''), ''feeling so hollow'' (''Love Somebody''), or just being ''such a f---ing snob'' (''Tickets''). The exception is first single ''Payphone,'' an alchemy of elemental pop-rock building blocks that conjures virile longing in the same corny-graceful way as past M5 hits like ''She Will Be Loved.'' Levine's voice soars, the piano and guitar hit notes of bitter nostalgia, and for once the words' hurt feels real. And whether by Pro-Tooled magic or old-fashioned sweat, the song also sounds remarkably like it was recorded in a studio by musicians who actually came together to play as a band — even if one of them was only dropping by on his way to the soundstage.

"(CNN) -- It depends on mind-bending physics and ultra-cold temperatures but quantum computing could bring about a new era in processing power that promises to revolutionize everything from artificial intelligence to high finance. The field of quantum computing is still in its infancy but it was given a sizable boost when Google announced in September that it is partnering with experts from the University of California Santa Barbara to develop quantum computing technology as part of its Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab team. The project also sees Google pairing up with NASA and the Universities Space Research Association to create technology that could become the world's fastest supercomputer. How it works . In a traditional computer, circuits are either on or off, and use binary code of ones and zeros for solving problems. A quantum computer uses quantum bits -- called qubits -- and has circuits which exist in all possible states at the same time -- a one, a zero and everything in between. This ability to exist in various states greatly increases the processing power of quantum machines. While the science behind quantum computing seems very technical, broken down in the simplest terms it amounts to a computer which could operate at breakneck speed in comparison to a traditional computer that uses a binary system, and would be especially useful for solving what are known as ""optimization problems"" -- finding the best solution among huge numbers of possible options. Currently, the world's fastest computer belongs to China, the Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which can carry out about 34 quadrillion calculations per second. Experts say a quantum computer would ultimately far surpass this speed. Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence team has been working with scientists from Canadian company D-Wave Systems, which owns what has been called the first commercially viable quantum computer. Some experts have cast doubt on whether D-Wave's computers are any faster than regular machines, but while D-Wave's CEO Vern Brownell concedes that it's early days for this technology, he sees a bright future. ""We're at that stage of the very first days of microprocessors, when Paul Allen and Bill Gates built the first software for those,"" said Brownell. A mature technology could have huge benefits in a variety of fields. The increased computing power could one day help run complex simulations, such as modeling climate change and helping to develop new drugs. ""It's not going to replace classical computing, but certain problem types fit quantum computing very well,"" said Brownell. Financial revolution? Financial services will be the first industry to feel the benefits, said Brownell. For example, there's currently a huge workload on Wall Street trying to optimize portfolios and dealing with risk management. ""Ultimately, quantum computing will do that better,"" said Brownell, who served as chief technology officer for Goldman Sachs from 1989-2000. Other areas of finance which could benefit include structured asset-backed security pricing, mapping market correlations, capital project budgeting, and developing trading strategies, said D-Wave. D-Wave said it is also interested in expanding the cloud capabilities of quantum computing. Potential customers could include anyone with a complicated optimization problem to solve -- from sectors ranging from transportation and logistics to financial services and healthcare. Another broad area for quantum computing is machine learning. Using artificial intelligence to train algorithms, trying to mine big data, and also helping with fraud detection all fall under the quantum computer's domain. Currently, Lockheed Martin uses D-Wave's machine to help verify flight control systems. Another partner of D-Wave is a company called 1QBit, which is building financial algorithms with quantum computing and ""making good progress,"" said Brownell. Obstacles in the way . One of the biggest challenges so far for the mighty quantum machine has been environmental interference. The machine can only operate at an incredibly low temperature -- just above absolute zero, or -273.15 degrees. ""This chip has to have exactly the right temperature, it has to be shielded,"" said Brownell. ""So a big part of it is building that rarefied environment. A huge amount of research and billions of dollars are being poured into building it."" Maintaining the perfect environment is just one of the problems facing quantum computing. ""We're really just beginning to understand how we might make a full-scale quantum machine,"" cautions Dr Peter J Bentley, of the department of computer science at University College London. ""There is a vast number of challenges remaining."" Bentley believes it could be many years before we see quantum computing come into its own. ""Compared to the speed we moved from valves to transistors to integrated silicon chips, progress on quantum computers has been very slow,"" wrote Bentley, in an email. ""It's a much harder problem using mind-bending physics that we don't fully understand. So it may take a few billions of dollars from Google and a few decades before we really see quantum computers."" But Google's confidence in creating super-fast quantum computing is palpable. Brownell sees the challenge as a positive for not just Google, but for all of us. ""It (quantum computing) will be another tool to help solve very challenging, very hard problems,"" he said.","Google has assembled a team of experts trying to craft a quantum computer .
Financial services, machine learning and other industries could benefit .

"(CNN) -- Philadelphia prosecutors have dropped their pursuit of the death penalty for Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of shooting a police officer three decades ago. He will instead serve a life sentence in prison, prosecutors said Wednesday. ""The decision to end this fight was not an easy one to make,"" said District Attorney Seth Williams. ""There has never been a doubt in my mind that Mumia Abu-Jamal shot and killed Officer Faulkner, and I believe the appropriate sentence was handed down in 1982."" Abu-Jamal was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of Daniel Faulkner. Witnesses testified that Abu-Jamal shot Faulkner in the back and head after the officer pulled over Abu-Jamal's brother in a late-night traffic stop. Once known as Wesley Cook, Abu-Jamal was wounded in the encounter and later confessed to the killing. He's been on death row at a state prison in southwest Pennsylvania, where he's remained an outspoken activist from behind bars -- claiming there were procedural errors during his capital sentencing, and that too few blacks were on the jury. The case has attracted international attention, amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct. Abu-Jamal, a onetime radio reporter and cabdriver, has been a divisive figure, with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial. Others counter that Abu-Jamal is using his race to try to escape responsibility for his actions. They say he has provoked community unrest for years with his writings and advocacy. In April, Abu-Jamal was granted a new sentencing hearing by a federal appeals court, sparking a threat by the prosecutor to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. In its 32-page decision, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals accepted defense arguments that the jury instructions at Abu-Jamal's 1982 murder trial were unclear. The court's decision did not grant Abu-Jamal a new trial; his conviction on the murder charge stands. A 2008 appeals court ruling also had nullified Abu-Jamal's death sentence and granted him a new sentencing hearing. But the Supreme Court tossed out that ruling and ordered the appeals court to revisit the issue. The high court last year denied Abu-Jamal's separate petition for a new trial.","Mumia Abu-Jamal will serve a life sentence in prison .

"Washington (CNN) -- The perceptions Americans have of how a college degree will affect their average paycheck over a lifetime appear to be close to correct. A recent study called ""Is College Worth It?"" by the Pew Research Center found that those who have a college degree believed that they make about $20,000 more per year than those who didn't attain a college degree. And vice versa, those who didn't get a college degree felt that they earned about $20,000 less per year than those who did. Census data from 2010 shows that the median gap in earnings between those with only a high school diploma and those who have a college degree is $19,550. ""We find that for the typical person there's about a $550,000 advantage to going to college in lifetime earnings,"" said Paul Taylor, one of the study's authors. The study points out that the student's field of study, among other factors, can also influence income. For example, a college graduate can choose a career that doesn't come with a high salary and some people with just a high school diploma can earn a lot of money. President Barack Obama clearly believes that a college degree is worth it for most Americans. He has set a goal of having the largest number of college graduates in the United States as compared to other countries by the year 2020. The survey found that a majority of college presidents don't think it likely that we will make that goal. Just under a third of the college presidents thought it ""somewhat likely"" that the United States will meet the goal and only 3% thought it was ""very likely."" ""People are clearly struggling with the high costs of college,"" Taylor said. Three-quarters of those surveyed said college is no longer affordable for most Americans, according to the study. Yet, for those who are college graduates, 86% said college was a good investment for them personally. Maria's big dream? Stanford University . Although the study found that most adults believe a college education is needed to succeed in the world, they listed a good work ethic and knowing how to get along with people as more important to success. ""You have a public that understands that college is important,"" Taylor said. ""But at the end of the day, if you push them and ask is it college or character, people place more importance on character than a college diploma."" As compared to those who only graduated high school, college graduates did tend to be more satisfied with their work life and they found their work to be more interesting. For those who did not receive a college degree, 30% said they had wanted to apply for a job, but had not because the job required a college degree. Thirteen percent had been turned down for a job because they did not have a college degree.","President Obama wants U.S. to have most college grads in world by 2020 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Close to 20 inches of snow piled up at the nation's capital as a blizzard pounded mid-Atlantic states Saturday, cutting power to hundreds of thousands in the region in what the president referred to as ""Snowmaggedon."" Snow was falling from southern Indiana eastward to New York City, Washington, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the New Jersey coast. President Obama kept to his busy Washington schedule amid the swirling flakes, and ditched ""the Beast"" -- his souped-up Cadillac limousine -- for an armored, four-wheel drive Chevy Suburban capable of trudging through the several inches of snow. Despite plowing and shoveling, the continuous snow made for a slippery White House driveway. Before the 15-vehicle presidential motorcade pulled out of the driveway headed to the Capital Hilton for Obama's speech to democrats, one of the emergency vehicles lost traction and slid into an SUV. No one was in the car at the time. Flights canceled, highway crews mobilized . About 19.5 inches of snow fell at American University in Washington over two days, and was on track to possibly break a record. The capital received 28 inches of snow in the ""Knickerbocker Storm"" of January 27-28, 1922. The blizzard has left hundreds of thousands of customers from Virginia to Pennsylvania without power, utility companies said. As of 12 p.m., Dominion Virginia Power had restored electricity to 101,000 of 207,000 customers who were without power Saturday morning, the company said. In Maryland and Washington, more than 104,000 Pepco customers were in the dark, the utility company said. The majority, or 81,324, live in Montgomery County, Maryland, and 9,587 live in Washington, according to Pepco. In Philadelphia, a reported 26.7 inches had fallen at the airport by 1 p.m., the National Weather Service said. ""We are getting absolutely clobbered this morning with snow,"" said Steven Steingard, a lawyer who lives in suburban Philadelphia. ""We have about a foot already and they say it will continue for 10 to 12 hours more."" The storm also may produce a record snowfall for Baltimore, which has 21 inches of snow so far, according to the National Weather Service. Virginia snowman is taller than a house . In College Park, Maryland, snow-laden power lines drooped onto branches, causing power failures. One city resident, Ben Hampton, told CNN he could could hear electrical transformers popping. Annapolis, Maryland, had 18 inches of snow by Saturday. State officials at the briefing said 2,400 pieces of equipment were trying to clear highways. The state also was relying on 300 National Guard members to help with ongoing weather trouble. Check on traffic and road conditions . More than 750 personnel are clearing roads in Washington, Mayor Adrian Fenty said. But the heavy, wet snow has even trapped some plows, Washington Department of Transportation director Gabe Klein said. Flights were canceled at Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at Philadelphia International Airport. Amtrak has canceled many trains in and out of Washington, and Greyhound has been halted until 1 p.m. Sunday, Klein said. Check on flight delays . On Friday, a weather-related accident in Virginia's Wythe County left two dead, state police said. A father and son stopped on a shoulder to help injured occupants of a disabled vehicle. Minutes later, a tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck their van while trying to avoid hitting the disabled car. The father and son died at the scene, state police said. Virginia state police said the accident was one of many crashes and disabled cars reported. Winter storm warnings were in effect from southern Indiana eastward to New York City and south to North Carolina, with blizzard warnings for Washington, Delaware and the New Jersey coast. Are you snowed in? Share photos and videos . Delaware Gov. Jack Markell declared a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10 p.m. ET. Forecasters were predicting that the mountains of West Virginia and Maryland, west of the nation's capital, would receive the most snow -- possibly 3 feet.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- An American aid worker died from a gunshot wound suffered in the southern African nation of Lesotho, the Peace Corps said in a statement. Peace Corps volunteer Thomas Maresco, 24, died in the country's capital, Maseru, on Friday. ""The deceased was attending a farewell function at the Maseru Sun Cabanas Hotel ... he and a female friend decided to return to the center on foot even though their vehicles were waiting outside the Hotel,"" Inspector Lekhotla Mojete, of the Lesotho police, told CNN in a phone interview from Maseru. ""The area the hotel is in is very safe -- with not much crime, but we think they were observed leaving the hotel on foot and when they were returning, (an) assailant was waiting outside the Hotel,"" Mojete said. ""The stranger started making demands of them, which they didn't fully understand and (the assailant) then shot the deceased."" He said the woman accompanying Maresco rushed back into the hotel to get help, but police were unable to find the gunman when the arrived on scene. ""We believe this was a robbery,"" Mojete said. A description of the attacker was provided to law enforcement officials by the woman. No arrests have been made yet and an autopsy was scheduled. ""Tom was an exceptional volunteer, leader, teacher and coach -- he was an integral part of his host community where he shared his passion for teaching, music and sports,"" said Aaron S. Williams, the Peace Corps' global director. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic event, and I ask that you keep Tom's family, and our volunteers and staff in Lesotho in your thoughts and prayers."" The statement said that Maresco is from Port St. Lucie, Florida. He taught secondary education in the highlands district of Thaba-Tseka since November 2009. Maresco was scheduled to serve until January 2012. Maresco's work also involved HIV awareness in the communities he served, according to the Peace Corps. Peace Corps has 91 volunteers in Lesotho. More than 2,100 Americans have served as Peace Corps volunteers in the nation since 1967.

"(CNN) -- At least 130 people have died and dozens are missing after heavy rains triggered flooding and mudslides that buried communities Sunday and left a swath of destruction in El Salvador, officials said Monday. The death toll was ""preliminary,"" said Raul Murillo, subdirector of the Department of Civil Protection in San Salvador. Another 13,680 people were staying in emergency shelters, he said. Laura Mata, communications manager for World Vision in El Salvador, said 40 percent of the dead were children. About 60 people were still missing Monday afternoon, said Carlos Alvarado, communications director for the government's rescue efforts. The most affected departments are San Salvador, La Paz, Cuscatlan, Usulatan and San Vicente. He described the latter as the most heavily affected. The government's Web site said there were 108 landslides, 209 destroyed buildings and another 1,835 damaged ones. In all, 18 bridges were affected, it said. Private, government and U.N. donations have all been promised, but the needs exceeded supplies, with high demand for food, construction materials, plastic sheeting, medications and -- with a cold front expected to sweep into the area Tuesday -- clothes, Alvarado said. Fumigation efforts were slated to begin Tuesday to reduce the chances of disease. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" he said. Guatemala, Spain and other countries were helping, Mata said. At the 139-bed Hospital Santa Gertrudis in San Vicente, 33 patients sought help overnight in the emergency room, mostly for trauma, broken bones and abrasions, said Dr. Ana Luisa Velazquez, the hospital director. Patients had to be removed from the pediatric unit and women's surgery unit, both of which were built on low-lying ground and were inundated, she said. Though the hospital had fresh water from its own well, fresh water was in scarce supply in San Vicente, she said. Mata visited the town Sunday. ""All three access roads were completely wiped off,"" she told CNN's Jonathan Mann. ""You could only get there by one lane. Everywhere -- mud, huge rocks."" Electricity was largely out, she said. In addition to losing their homes, many people have lost their crops, she said. President Mauricio Funes declared a national emergency and described the loss as incalculable. About 7,000 people lost homes in the disaster Sunday, officials said. Authorities said the death toll is expected to rise as rescuers scramble to reach regions where roads have been washed away. In some of the hardest-hit areas, such as the capital, San Salvador, roads are completely gone, Mata said. ""You would never imagine there were road systems there. ... Huge rocks, mud, water everywhere,"" she said. ""People have lost complete families."" Landslides on the side of a volcano swallowed up a village in Verapaz, Mata said. iReport: Neighborhood slammed with mud and debris . Residents in affected areas climbed over boulders as rescue crews waded through muddy water, some carrying young children. Homes, trees and electricity poles, and mountains of mud, covered streets. The heavy rains in the impoverished Central American nation were unrelated to Hurricane Ida, said Saul Ezgardo de la Reyes, a government meteorologist in the Center of Prognostics. ""The rains in Salvador are due to the low pressure system,"" he said, adding that it was dissipating Monday. ""We're waiting for the arrival of fresh air and higher pressure."" On Sunday, 355 millimeters (14 inches) of rain fell near the Saint Vincent Volcano, southeast of the capital, and 196 mm (7.7 inches) fell on the capital itself, he said. Sunday's inundations were unprecedented, he said. Hurricane Mitch dropped similar quantities in 1998, but those values were tallied in three or four days, he said. ""This was in practically four hours."" A low-pressure system out of the Pacific triggered the disaster, said Robbie Berg of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.","40 percent of dead are children, aid group spokeswoman says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has one of the oldest food cultures in the world and, like that acme of Western food culture French cuisine, the food needs to be fresh. At Sei Wui, a remote town in western Guangdong Province, a live goose will cost you little more than $US3 a bird. ""They're 18 kwai a piece,"" said one market trader, using the Chinese vernacular for the renminbi, China's currency, and pointing to her gaggle of geese honking furiously at one end of a bamboo pen. ""Buy it now and they'll cook it for you,"" she added, pointing down the road to a small stall doing a brisk business serving a lunchtime crowd of pavement diners. In southern China, it's said that people will eat everything with four legs except for the table. Whether it's a chicken, a goose or even a frog, if its heart is still just beating by the time you get it home, all the better. It may taste delicious; but the way the birds are handled, stored and slaughtered has the potential to make you very sick. It's no accident, then, that China's public health authorities are now proactively targeting small towns and villages, taking throat swabs from live food dealers and their customers in wet markets where the rough and ready food culture provides a perfect environment for viruses -- such as H7N9 bird flu -- to flourish. As with all things in China, the scale of the undertaking is witheringly massive. China's Ministry of Agriculture, says its medical dragnet has taken samples from poultry markets, farms and slaughterhouses across the country. So far, 84,444 samples have been taken, 47,801 have been tested and 39 samples confirmed as H7N9 positive. Of these, 38 positive samples came from live poultry markets in the Shanghai municipality and Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. One sample, worryingly, was found in a feral pigeon; an indication of the virus's ability to spread undetected in wild species. ""Basically, at the moment poultry seems to be the source of the virus so there's a risk if there's direct contact with the poultry or indirect contact with the fecal matter or other products. Of course, if the food is being cooked properly then the risk is limited,"" said Dr. Leo Poon Lit-man, associate professor, at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong. While the World Health Organisation has not established a direct link, medical investigators are concentrating their efforts on China's poultry farms and vendors. ""That is the reality,"" he said. ""That is what we learned from H5N1,"" he added, referring to the outbreak of the bird flu virus in Hong Kong in 1997 that killed six and left 18 seriously ill. Like most of China, Hong Kong back then liked its chickens fresh. Poultry in bamboo cages on street corners was a common sight and grandmothers could be regularly seen blowing on chickens' anuses -- a common local method of checking the bird's cloaca to gauge its age. All of these practices have ended in Hong Kong. After 1997, millions of poultry were slaughtered and hundreds of vendors put out of business. According to Poon, reducing the risk in any market place is not just a matter of improving hygiene, restricting transport and creating overnight ""rest days"" are all ways of bringing down the viral load in China's ubiquitous wet markets. ""Once a month we leave a day that allows the poultry to sleep and then on that day we have a very thorough cleaning procedure of the market,"" Poon said, adding that the almost 24/7 nature of many market places in China made it difficult for health authorities to break the cycle of the virus. ""Basically, we come up with a package -- we need more than one single measure to reduce the risk,"" he added. Virologists, meanwhile, are now looking at how viruses pass, not just from animals to humans, but from humans to animals and then back to humans again. According to Professor Gabriel Leung, head of the Department of Community Medicine at Hong Kong University, the spread of disease does not just work in one direction. He said that dangerous outbreaks of epidemics such as SARS and bird flu are a wake-up call, demonstrating that the fate of humans is inextricably linked with that of the animals we raise and eat. ""It reminds us that human health and veterinary health are one and the same thing and we need to be constantly vigilant,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Penn State fans and students knew the Freeh report was going to be harsh, but even so, it exceeded their expectations. Yet, for a significant number of them, their respect for the late Joe Paterno is unchanged. The lengthy report was released Thursday morning, castigating four former university officials -- President Graham Spanier, Vice President Gary Schultz, athletic director Tim Curley and Paterno -- for their roles in dealing with former coach Jerry Sandusky, who now sits in prison for abusing boys, some on the Penn State campus. ""I think JoePa's career here at Penn State has been unique because he was able to build an athletic program that helped improve academics, which is rare for a university,"" Dan Florencio, a Penn State graduate, told CNN's Jason Carroll. ""So it's hard for a lot of people who have been ingrained over those decades to hear his name not used in the best of light."" Read Freeh's prepared statement (PDF) Student John Zang was glad the truth had ""finally come out."" He said it was sobering to read how officials appeared to be more interested in preventing bad publicity. ""It really seems like everybody was just focused on something else, not the victims,"" he said. ""It's just sad because the kids, they were lost in all this. And I think it's really important that we move forward and make sure that this stuff does not happen again."" Penn State leaders disregarded victims, 'empowered' Sandusky, review finds . His sentiment was echoed by the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, a group that also has members who were molested at camps and in athletic programs. The group released a statement that said the report was a good step, but change was more important. ""Often, we assume that when a scandal is exposed, reform will result, but that's not necessarily true. Information sometimes leads to action, but sometimes not,"" the statement read. ""Penn State students, staff and alumni must continue to push hard for practical changes to the unhealthy, self-protective institutional culture at the school that endangers kids. At a glance: Key players in Penn State report . ""For starters, top school officials need to be prosecuted as vigorously as possible and punished as severely as possible. That is perhaps the best way to deter future cover-ups."" Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said: ""Today's release of the Freeh Report will not hinder the continuing work of our statewide investigating grand jury, nor will it impact ongoing criminal prosecutions."" According to a statement from her office, Louis Freeh has promised to turn over any material related to criminal conduct to her investigators. Former student John Tecce said he will maintain his deep pride in his university. Paterno defended Penn State in letter he wrote before his death . ""I received my diploma in May and it says 'The Pennsylvania State University' not 'Joe Paterno University,' "" he said. ""The university is not defined by one name or the actions of a few."" There are so many other things to be proud of, Tecce said: the $10.6 million the university raised to help fight pediatric cancer, the $500,000 it raised for the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. ""We can either put our heads down in shame and say, 'How are we ever going to recover from this?' or we can raise our heads and say, 'OK, how are we going to come out of this?' and start recovering,"" he said. Key passages from the report . ""It certainly hurts. You can't not be hurt by this, but at the same time I think what's important now is just moving forward,"" he said. There is a healing power in a community where there is a common goal, a common passion, he said, and he senses that among the Penn State community. Zang said there was an opportunity for students to ""really make up for what these administrators have done and have failed to do."" A few dozen students and fans wanted to watch news of the release of the report on Wednesday morning at a Penn State student center, but according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, just before a CNN anchor started talking about it, the channel changed to a public access show. A student worker at the help desk said a university employee was in charge of what channel was on. That person was in a meeting, the report said. On social media, supporters duked it out with critics and commentators weighed in on what they thought the future will or should hold for Penn State. While some called for Penn State dropping football, a reporter who covers the NBA's Miami Heat, said, ""Forget the ""Death Penalty"" for Penn State ... let them play and make millions ... and make them donate EVERY DAMN $ to stopping child abuse."" CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Support remains for late football coach Joe Paterno .

"(CNN) -- As a Miami-area homicide detective, Marshall Frank has met some really bad people. Now retired, the 30-year law enforcement veteran reveals trade secrets about how he ""made friends"" with criminals and coaxed them to confess. For example, take Paul Eugene Rowles -- a convicted murderer and sexual predator who died last year in a Florida prison. When he was with Metro-Dade Police in 1972, Frank arrested Rowles for the strangling death of Rowles' Miami neighbor, Linda Fida. Frank, who spoke with CNN by phone, described the handsome, 6-foot, blue-eyed Rowles as ""someone you trust right away, very pleasant to talk to, soft spoken, somebody you wouldn't think would be a dangerous killer. But these killers are the most dangerous of all."" For them, Frank said, killing is ""like an addiction, like heroin, and they've gotta have that murder fix."" So, how did Frank get Rowles to confess? ""I made friends with him,"" he said matter-of-factly. ""It took half an hour."" But he didn't do it alone. ""I had another cop in the room with me, and we knew each other's methods. The other detective just stayed quiet. He was there for support, but not to be a part of the interrogation."" Sitting close to Rowles with his knees almost touching him, Frank said he would lean toward him during the interrogation. ""I was really appearing to be interested in him,"" Frank said. Then they started talking about how Rowles' life, family, father and mother had all affected him and ""how that led to what he had just done."" And then Rowles began ""blathering the confession out,"" Frank said. ""He started crying."" Although Rowles was sentenced to life in prison, he was paroled in 1985. Nine years later Rowles was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor and sentenced to 19 years. In 2012, DNA testing linked Rowles to the 1992 murder of 21-year-old Elizabeth Foster. Before Rowles died last year, police tried to interview him, without success, to determine if he was behind the disappearance of 20-year-old Tiffany Sessions in 1989. After his death, investigators found a journal in Rowles' cell with a note that read ""2/9/89"" -- the date Sessions disappeared. ""No. 2"" was scrawled on both sides of the notation. Police believe it's an indication that Sessions was Rowles' second victim. Read more about Rowles . In 2003, Frank played a very different role in another Florida murder case. While researching a crime novel, Frank began corresponding with James Duckett, a former police officer who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1987 murder of an 11-year-old girl named Teresa McAbee. Duckett has been on death row for more than 25 years, as the appeals process plays out. Frank sat face-to-face with Duckett in a prison lunchroom, a conversation both men describe in CNN's documentary series, ""Death Row Stories,"" airing this Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. See more about Duckett and Frank . Successfully interrogating suspects one-on-one, Frank said, requires patience. ""You can't come across as though you're personally involved,"" he said. ""You can't come across like you're mad or angry or impatient or putting pressure on. Real jailhouse police questioning doesn't happen the way it's portrayed by Hollywood. According to Frank, the clichÃ©, the two-cops-on-one-suspect scenario with angry, screaming interrogators isn't part of the real world. We've broken down Frank's method into three ideas: . 1. ""The most important thing is gaining their confidence, respect and cooperation."" Frank repeated his theme: ""I just kinda made friends."" 2. ""At the beginning of the interrogation you don't even go into what you're there for. You wait five minutes. Wait 15 minutes, 30 minutes. There's no hurry. What you want to do is get the person talking and feeling good about talking to you."" 3. ""Eventually you just work your way into whatever the issue is. Next thing you know, someone's just blathering a confession. Believe me that's how it worked."" 'I just got a hunch' During all his years on the force, Frank claims he never arrested the wrong person in a case. But he came close. Frank told a story about a case where he questioned a man whose aunt accused him of raping her. ""During the interrogation he was adamant that he didn't do it,"" Frank recalled. ""Well of course a lot of guilty people are adamant that they didn't do it. But I just got a hunch â€” something about the guy. So I started thinking, 'Maybe we ought to check this out further before we actually book him.' We went back out on the streets, and we found the aunt again, and we polygraphed her. After polygraphing her, she admitted that she had told a lie."" Frank said it turned out the aunt had ""an ulterior motive about her wanting to have him arrested."" He then freed the suspect. The 'conveyor belt' After three decades as a law enforcement officer, Frank has some opinions about America's justice system. Public defender resources are overburdened, Frank said. Which sometimes contributes to less than fair circumstances. ""It's really an uneven system to have people who can afford a good attorney and other people who can only afford public defenders,"" Frank said. ""I asked a public defender once, 'How do you keep up with the caseload?' And he said, 'It's like Lucille Ball and the conveyor belt: You just can't keep up with it.'"" A lot of public defenders are talented and would like to do a better job, Frank said. ""But they're constrained by the enormous stresses and the pressures to keep up with their caseloads. The death penalty . CNN's ""Death Row Stories"" draws back the curtain on how murder cases are investigated and prosecuted. It connects the judicial dots between the crimes, the evidence, the trial and the death chamber. Frank joked about his days as a ""hotshot detective,"" when he used to favor the use of the death penalty in some cases. But in the years after his retirement in 1990, Frank has turned a 180 on the issue. Now 73, Frank has been writing crime novels, which require many hours of research. ""The death penalty is something I researched a lot about,"" he said. ""How many times do we find people who've had life sentences and 25 years later DNA proves them to be innocent? Those same people could easily have been executed by now. I'm sure that there have been people executed who are innocent."" That's just not acceptable, he said. ""I've realized that society can't sacrifice some innocent people once in a while just so it can get all the guilty ones."" Frank said society should consider alternative punishments for dangerous criminals. ""Because, basically, putting someone to death is murder,"" Frank said. ""It's intentional murder. Premeditated murder. Isn't it?"" Are overburdened defense attorneys breaking America's justice system? What do you think? Tell us in the comments below.

"(Oprah.com)  -- I have this friend, Sarah. Since meeting in our thirties, we've shared many of life's essentials: hairdressers, dog-walkers, phobias (airplanes and mice), health scares, worries over our kids, and insomnia caused by husbands who snore. But lately I'm aware that whenever Sarah calls I feel a tightness in my chest and, more often than not (thanks to caller ID), I don't pick up the phone. I feel guilty, but that's preferable to spending hours listening to Sarah complain. I've been meaning to tell her how I feel, but I haven't quite worked up the nerve. Most of the time I feel like a bad boyfriend. Then there's Natalie, whom I fell in love with when I was 9. We became inseparable and, at one point, I secretly tried to find out if it was possible to be adopted by your best friend's family if your own parents were still alive. It wasn't until college and postcollegiate life on opposite sides of the country that we drifted apart. But we never lost touch and, years later, when I moved with my husband to the city where Natalie lives, she seemed thrilled. She threw a dinner party in our honor and did everything possible to make us feel at home. Then, after about six months, Natalie suddenly stopped calling, and whenever I tried to make a date she claimed she was too busy and got off the phone, fast. To this day -- ten years later -- I have no idea why she gave me the boot. Now when our paths cross, we greet each other like distant acquaintances and I feel bruised all over again. Oprah.com: What to do when you feel left out . It is strange that friendships, which nourish and sustain us and often provide our deepest source of connection, lack the sort of standards that are routine in romantic relationships. If your significant other stops calling, makes impossible demands, or treats you like roadkill, you deal with it. It may not be easy -- you may put it off -- but eventually you'll find out where you stand. Not so with friends. ""You don't get together and say, 'I'm really mad at you, I'm not going to see you anymore,'"" says Ruthellen Josselson, PhD, a Baltimore psychotherapist and coauthor with Terri Apter, PhD, of ""Best Friends:The Pleasures and Perils of Girls' and Women's Friendships."" ""To the extent that we have a ritual, it's not calling, not getting together. But that makes it difficult to know when someone is distant because she doesn't want to be your friend or because something's going on in her life that's keeping her from being in touch."" Oprah.com: The friendship test . So how do you know you're being fired? And what do you do when you're at your wit's end -- as I am with Sarah -- and ready to issue a pink slip of your own? ""It's a complicated dance. We start learning the steps when we're quite young, and they don't change all that much,"" Josselson says. If nobody calls or makes a move, if you run into each other and say, ""Let's do lunch,"" but don't, if one person is suddenly booked until 2013, sooner or later the message gets through. Luckily, most friendships have a natural life cycle. Often we're drawn together by circumstance -- work, the single life, kids -- and as our situations change, we gradually drift apart. On a deeper level, our friendships mirror our internal life. ""As we gain a stronger sense of self, what used to matter no longer does, and we're bound to outgrow certain friendships,"" says Florence Falk, PhD, a New York City psychotherapist. ""Once you're aware of that, without being cruel or feeling guilt-ridden, you can begin to let go of relationships that no longer nourish your most authentic self."" Occasionally, though, a friend all but forces a clean break. My pal Nancy reports, ""I'd been close to Anne for years, but at a certain point I felt overwhelmed by her need for me. She acted as if I belonged to her and became resentful when I socialized with other people. I felt drained, suffocated. When I tried to talk to her about it I got nowhere, so I wrote her an e-mail explaining that I just couldn't be friends with her anymore."" Anne was predictably enraged and fired off a response accusing Nancy of being selfish and uncaring. But even though the exchange was painful, Nancy emerged feeling as if a great weight had been lifted. In my own life, I seem to have a knack for attracting needy friends. Even though I joke about my nonpaying ""caseload,"" I struggle to set limits. ""Women seem to be both hardwired and socialized to be nurturing,"" says Sandy Sheehy, author of ""Connecting: The Enduring Power of Female Friendship."" The upshot is that many of us get stuck in draining relationships. Sheehy tells the story of Martha, a graduate student, wife, and mother who felt sucked dry by an emotionally dependent friend. After unsuccessfully trying the usual stop-calling-and-drift method, Martha found a way to extricate herself while allowing the other woman to preserve her dignity. She said, ""I can't be the friend you want me to be."" Sheehy says, ""Martha took the burden of inadequacy on herself."" It's like a boyfriend telling you, ""I can't love you the way you deserve,"" instead of saying, ""I don't love you."" Oprah.com: The cure for a compulsive helper . Sheehy also recommends explicitly calling it quits if you have what she terms an enabling friendship. ""Maybe you started out as drinking pals or shared a shopping jones, but now you want to stop the behavior that brought you together,"" she says. ""It's more responsible to admit that you don't think you can maintain intimacy and not binge than to pretend you can't see her because you've suddenly taken up scuba diving."" Although the troublesome twins -- envy and jealousy -- are at the root of many breakups, they're more difficult to address gracefully. Ruth, a moderately successful painter, remained silent on the occasion of her friend Carolyn's first solo art show. When Carolyn asked her why, Ruth said she thought it best not to respond because she hated the work. ""It was obvious that she hated me for getting a one-woman show before she did, but she couldn't admit it,"" Carolyn says. The former bosom buddies haven't exchanged a word since. Sadly, many friendships end needlessly because we're afraid to acknowledge conflict. ""If you notice you're withdrawing from someone who really matters to you, you have to ask yourself why,"" Josselson says, adding that we anticipate tension in our relationships with men, but not with other women. But at some point, any meaningful friendship is bound to provoke difficult feelings. ""Once you accept that, you can talk about things as they come up and there's a good chance you'll become closer,"" she says. Oprah.com: Who's never going to let you down? Sometimes the conditions of a relationship change, especially one forged during a time of mutual crisis, but the unspoken contract on which the friendship is based stays the same -- which is what happened to my cousin Paula and her best friend, Elaine. The two women became joined at the hip when both were having marital problems. ""It was almost like another marriage,"" Paula says. ""We did everything together."" Eventually, Paula and her husband resolved their differences, while Elaine and her husband parted. ""I was terrified to tell Elaine that even though I still loved her, our friendship could no longer be as all-consuming,"" Paula says. ""But I knew that if I didn't say something, I'd withdraw completely."" Fortunately, Elaine was able to adjust her expectations and the pair found a new way of relating that was comfortable for both. Despite our best intentions, talking doesn't always repair the rift: Not everyone is able to listen without becoming defensive or blaming the other person. Feelings stirred up by a close friend often echo unresolved issues from childhood, like sibling rivalry or fear of abandonment, and unless those feelings are acknowledged, no amount of discussion can save the relationship. ""My friend Gail seemed to have me confused with her older sister, whose attention she'd always craved,"" says Joan. ""I spent years trying to convince her that I really cared, but eventually I threw up my hands. I told her I didn't have the time or energy to give her the constant reassurance she needed."" Gail felt hurt and rejected, and a 20-year bond was severed in a single phone call. Bottom line: There's no single template for friendship. Some people are in our lives because they carry a precious shard of our history, while others reflect our passions and priorities right now. Still others are in danger of becoming ex-friends because we're either too preoccupied to pick up the phone or too scared to speak our minds. As Virginia Woolf said, ""I have lost friends, some by death -- others through sheer inability to cross the street."" Which brings me back to Sarah: I'm not sure where this friendship is headed, but I realize I still care enough to cross the street and let her know why I've been so out of touch. As for Natalie, I hope that one day she'll do the same. Oprah.com: More than a shoulder to cry on: The surprising benefits of friendship .

"London (CNN) -- If only Mitt Romney could turn the Olympic torch on the newspaper headlines in London. He's the ""Party Pooper"" in the Daily Mail, ""Nowhere Man"" in the Times of London and ""Mitt the Twit"" in The Sun. This was not the storyline Romney and his team wanted when they journeyed overseas for a trip designed to burnish the GOP contender's foreign policy credentials. Romney has yet to publicly acknowledge the outrage he set off in London when he appeared to question the city's ""disconcerting"" problems in gearing up for the Olympic Games. In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday, Romney chuckled when he was asked about the criticism. Romney's Olympics false start . ""Well, I'm delighted to see the kind of support that has been around the torch for instance. I watched last night on BBC an entire program about the torch being run across Great Britain. And the kind of crowds. I guess millions of people that turned out to see the torch. That's what you hope to see,"" Romney told Morgan. Asked about the controversy on NBC's ""Today"" show, Romney again sidestepped the question but declared London prepared. ""After being here a couple of days it looks to me like London is ready,"" Romney said. The uproar in Britain reached its crescendo Thursday evening when London Mayor Boris Johnson whipped up a crowd of 60,000 revelers at a pre-Olympics celebration with a taunt for the Republican presidential candidate. Johnson is a Tory, theoretically putting him near Romney on the same conservative end of the political spectrum. ""There's this guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know if we are ready. Are we ready? Yes we are,"" Johnson shouted at what sounded like a political rally, for President Obama. Meanwhile on Twitter, the hashtag #RomneyShambles was trending on both sides of the Atlantic.

"(CNN) -- It's the world's last, great wilderness rich in natural resources, like oil and gas. But now the frozen seas of the Arctic are being opened up; its vast riches unlocked. The Yamal is one of Russia's biggest, most powerful icebreakers, and one of the few ships in the world capable of cutting through the thick Arctic pack ice. It does it for one reason: to clear a path for other vessels, so they can take advantage of the frozen Arctic. Escorted by icebreakers, cargo ships and oil tankers crossing the Arctic can shave thousands of miles off a journey between Asia and Europe, saving fuel, and vastly reduce their carbon emissions. Captain of the Yamal, Alexander Lembrik says the Arctic's untapped potential is the reason behind the dramatic increase in maritime traffic. ""We are now seeing the increase of transport flows again. There are more and more transport vessels, through routes for ships from Europe towards the Bering Strait in the North Pacific,"" Lembrik said. He is concerned that an increase in traffic in the region could have a damaging ecological effect on the Arctic. ""You can't deny that possibility but if you take all the precautions, this is avoidable,"" Lembrik said. With a water purification plant and waste disposal system, the crew of the Yamal say the ship's own ecological impact is minimal. It's also nuclear powered which means low carbon emissions, but, of course, it's a risky polluter if anything goes wrong -- just one of the many paradoxes of Arctic ecology. Take, for instance, the problem of global warming caused by greenhouse gases. It is believed to be melting the polar ice caps, making the Arctic waters even more accessible to shipping, slashing journey times. But it's also opening up the region to exploitation for its oil and gas reserves. And as the traffic in the Arctic increases, so too will the need for icebreakers like the Yamal. And not just for clearing routes -- navigating Arctic waters can be treacherous. An incident in January saw several fishing boats trapped in the ice. It was an icebreaker like the Yamal that broke them free. Adding more cargo ships and oil tankers to the mix, says captain Lembrik, is a big concern. ""As a rule, when the traffic along the Northern Sea Route is organized well, emergencies don't happen,"" Lembrik said. ""It's when there are errors in the organization that some ships could find themselves in difficult situations. With the increase in freight turnover there will be a larger number of ships that will need icebreaker assistance."" For their critics, Russia's fleet of icebreakers are hastening exploitation of the Arctic. But without capable vessels like the Yamal, these frozen waters may be even more exposed to risk.","Russian icebreaker, the Yamal helping oil and cargo vessels cut shipping times and emissions .

"(CNN) -- A tiny black spot approaches from the distance in the gray dawn sky, growing larger as it glides through the icy wind against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains. Drawn to the shrill blast of a whistle, the majestic bird of prey soars in for a perfect landing onto the arm of Mingzhe Zhao, the ""falcon king"" of Ying Tun. In China's Jilin province, the tiny rural community of Ying Tun -- known here as the ""Falcon Village"" -- the 55-year-old Zhao has, like many of his ancestors, dedicated his entire life to training the fierce feathered creatures. Jilin is one of China's most isolated provinces. Deep in the northeast, Jilin borders North Korea and Russia. It's the home of China's ethnic Manchu, who continue to practice ancient traditions in an effort to preserve their culture. This includes falcon training, which dates to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), an era when the Manchu ruled the entire country. Like hunting and horse racing, raising falcons -- once a form of leisure and entertainment for royals -- remains an admired practice in the region, considered a show of bravery and man's conquest over nature. It's practiced in some form or another by most of the men in Ying Tun, which has about 300 households. Chuanxin Jia, photographer and editor for Chinese magazine ""Jilin Pictorial,"" has visited the Falcon Village on multiple occasions, where he captured some of the images in the gallery above. ""Trained falcons can hunt 10 to 20 pheasants per day, which can be sold for up to RMB 150 ($24) each at the local market,"" says Jia. ""This money can be used as extra income by local village families."" Falconeering isn't just about making money. Ying Tun's falcon trainers -- locals call them ""Yingbashi"" (falcon masters) -- are emotionally attached to their birds. How to train a falcon . Falcons are known for being unruly, says Jia, which makes for an incredibly punishing training process. After capturing a wild falcon from a mountain forest, a master must spend several days in isolation taming it. ""It's a real battle of willpower,"" says Jia. ""But the relationship between a master and his falcon will be unbreakable when it's all over."" Surviving on minimal sleep, masters spend the bulk of their days staring into the falcons' eyes. Eventually, the bird will tire and grow docile. Next the bird will be taught to circle the skies, understand its new master's orders and bring back prey. Hunting season lasts primarily during winter months, when masters aren't busy tending to their farms. In the off-season, masters enjoy the company of their falcons, regarding them as regular pets. Once relatively isolated to outside visitors, Ying Tun has grown famous in recent years as more and more photographers and visitors come for the chance to see masters and birds in action. Held annually the first week of January, the area's Falcon Culture Festival is particularly popular. More than 80 masters perform; trained falcons demonstrate incredible hunting skills on open snowfields. Traditional Manchu music and dance performances take place during the opening ceremony. Visitors also eat local cuisine, chat with masters and get close to the falcons. As Ying Tun is a fairly small village, visitors are recommended to stay in the nearby city of Jilin, an hour away from Ying Tun by car.

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- For a man who used to hang a framed picture of Mohandas K. Gandhi in his Senate office, President Obama declared that checking out a museum honoring the Indian independence hero's legacy was ""pretty cool"" Saturday. Shortly after landing here for his first stop on a 10-day tour of Asia, the president and first lady Michelle Obama quickly headed over to this city's Gandhi Museum, a three-story home where Gandhi stayed when he was in Mumbai. It's now full of historic photos and posters as well as a library with about 50,000 Gandhi-related works. This was like manna from heaven for the president, who once declared that the one person living or dead that he'd love to have dinner with would be Gandhi. ""Now it would probably be a really small meal, because he didn't eat a lot,"" Obama joked then about Gandhi's fasting. On Saturday, Obama was particularly tickled about getting to sign a guest book at the museum and taking a peek at an older guest book that was signed by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who also saw Gandhi as an inspiration for the civil rights movement in America. ""Pretty cool -- 1959,"" the president said after seeing King's signature. The president spent several minutes in the library, which has Gandhi quotations on the walls, such as, ""Freedom is like a birth."" Obama seemed particularly moved by another quotation: ""To call women the weaker sex is a libel. It is man's injustice to women. ... If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future is with women."" ""Look at that,"" the president said. ""It's my favorite,"" responded his guide, Usha Thakkar, a trustee of the museum. When he signed the guest book, Obama left this inscription: ""I am filled with hope and inspiration as I have the privilege to visit this testament to Gandhi. He is a hero not just to India, but to the world."" Mrs. Obama wrote simply, ""This visit will be one that I will always remember ..."" The Obama tribute to Gandhi will continue Sunday, when the first couple lay a wreath at his grave site. And on their way out of the museum, the president said the couple would definitely be back someday, next time with their daughters.","Museum is a three-story home where Gandhi stayed when he was in Mumbai .

"Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- A few days into the new year, it's not too late to make some predictions. This year a few will still note the loss of Lehman Brothers, and many will continue to see the new U.S. president as an agent of major change. Swedes will mourn the death of SAAB and China will see the rise of the Geely-Volvo merger as a major change. But the really big changes in the world happen over decades and centuries, and so the 2010 world will be very similar to the pre-crisis world we had in 2007. The Israel-Palestinian conflict will roll on and the strife in Afghanistan and Pakistan will continue. Chinese economic growth will continue, as will the U.S. trade and budget deficits. There will still be no malaria vaccine, and the European Union will continue to move slowly, slowly toward political unity. But in contrast to business as usual, I predict one major change in 2010: This is the year when we will upgrade how we view the world. It became obvious during the financial crisis that we have moved from the G-7 to the G-20 world. Another way of putting it is that the world during the past few decades has changed from one of diverging to one of converging trends. This is a major change, because ever since the rise of the West started more than 200 years ago -- and until at least 1970 -- the world diverged into two groups. The West had 1 billion people with a life span of 70 years, two-child families, and an average annual income of $10,000 or more per person. The ""Rest,"" known as the developing world, consisted of 3 billion people who lived shorter lives, had three times as many children per woman, and tried to survive on a tenth of the income of people in the West. But as the last century came to a close, in a very subtle way the diverging trends slowed down and were gradually replaced by a converging trend. The switch from a diverging to a converging world could first be noted in health and demography. The change to a converging world started in the bedrooms of what were to become the emerging economies. In 1968, when Paul Ehrlich published ""The Population Bomb,"" countries like China, India, Egypt, Vietnam, Iran, Brazil and Mexico had six to seven children born per woman. Today women in all these countries give birth to three, two or even fewer children, on average. In pillow talks of hundreds of millions of newlywed couples, a consensus was reached to have fewer children, and commitments were made to work hard to provide a healthier and better life for them. And the young couples in the emerging economies were successful. The fertility decline was combined with a fall in child mortality. Most surprising is the speed of these major social changes. The United Nations Millennium Goal set the target for all countries to reduce child mortality by 4.3 percent per year in the period 1990 to 2015. How did young parents, governments and aid organizations jointly manage to improve this noble metric, to improve the chances of surviving childhood? Due to the wise funding by USAID of the Demographic and Health Surveys, we know the answer. Since 1990, Bangladesh, Egypt and Brazil have had an average annual rate of reduction in child mortality of 4.7 percent, 5.5 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. This obviously represents a switch to a converging world, as the average annual rate of reduction of child mortality in Sweden was only 3.6 percent over the last century. Bangladesh is catching up to Sweden. In health and demography, the major countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America are progressing faster than the West ever did. The resulting population composition and health status enable these countries to grow their economies faster than the West ever had. The sequence of social and economic change is different. In Western Europe and North America, industrialization, technology and the market economy were the driving forces; they were followed by social investments, health improvements, and eventually fertility decline. In the rising nations of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, the sequence of events is almost reversed. First came basic education, improved survival and small families, which helped lead to fast economic growth that spurred technology development. Through efforts like the Gapminder Foundation, which turns data into animated graphics, we can see and explain the big but gradual global changes that rarely make it into breaking news. And the biggest one of all is this -- a converging world where we can look into the future and see the eventual end of Anglo-European world dominance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hans Rosling.","For hundreds of years, the West was richer, healthier than the rest of the world .
Hans Rosling says that started to change about 1970 .
He says people in emerging countries started having fewer children .

"(CNN) -- In 1967, the Mamas & the Papas had a hit with a song that detailed, with bittersweet harmonies, the checkered history of the band. The song, written by the group's John Phillips and his wife, Michelle, was called ""Creeque Alley."" Michelle Phillips, Denny Doherty and John Phillips, here in 1998, were members of the Mamas & the Papas. If the song were to be updated today, it might have to be retitled ""Creep Alley."" With the claims by John's daughter, Mackenzie, that she had an incestuous relationship with her father, the story of Phillips and his group -- in music, models of California dreams and California dreamin' -- takes on a darker hue. The story was already tangled, a motley love- and drug-soaked tale of excess set to the group's distinctive four-part harmonies. Phillips left his first wife, Mackenzie's mother, Susan Adams, for 18-year-old Michelle, whom he'd met in a San Francisco club while touring in the early '60s, according to the band's biography on Allmusic.com. The band's lead male singer, Denny Doherty, later had an affair with Michelle; she was forced out of the group for a time. The fourth member, Cass Elliot, had an unrequited crush on Doherty, the biography noted. After the Mamas & the Papas' success with such singles as ""California Dreamin' "" and the No. 1 hit ""Monday, Monday,"" the Phillipses bought a Bel Air mansion from which they ruled over the Los Angeles music scene. In his 1986 memoir, ""Papa John,"" John Phillips, who died in 2001, remembered hosting parties for the Beatles when they visited town. John Phillips, the band's primary songwriter, was at least six years older than the others and did not shy from the task of addressing the group's pain and confusion in song. In such songs as ""Got a Feelin',"" ""I Saw Her Again Last Night"" and ""Trip, Stumble and Fall,"" he cast a cold eye on the band's romantic entanglements, even as his melancholy and sometimes cutting lyrics were often belied by those sunny harmonies and Lou Adler's slick production. ""One doesn't try to hold Cass and Denny and Michelle together,"" he said in a 1995 interview. ""It's a useless task to start with. You just sort of stay out of the way and let things roll as they can."" In 1968, the group split up. There was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album ""People Like Us,"" but the experience was ""horrible,"" John Phillips recalled in the liner notes to the group's anthology, ""The History of the Mamas and the Papas."" The group members had mixed success after the breakup. Elliot, who died of a heart attack in 1974 (and not by choking on a sandwich, as urban legend has it), pursued a solo career; she had a handful of hits. Doherty and John Phillips also tried their hands at solo careers; the latter's 1970 ""John, the Wolf King of L.A.,"" produced a minor hit and is now considered a classic but sold relatively poorly upon release. More common were the stories of trouble. Michelle and John Phillips divorced in 1970; late that year, Michelle was married to Dennis Hopper for eight days. John Phillips, who married Genevieve Waite in 1972, became increasingly immersed in drugs, says his Allmusic biography, to the point where he couldn't finish an album commissioned by the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. In 1981, he was convicted of drug trafficking. By that point, daughter Mackenzie says, she was also a full-blown drug addict. ""I grew up in a place where there were no rules ... which did not serve me well, and everybody, I think, knew that,"" she said on a reunion special for her '70s sitcom, ""One Day at a Time."" According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh's ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,"" Phillips missed the 1980-81 season while in rehab for addiction issues. In her new book, ""High on Arrival,"" she claims she had become sexually involved with her father in 1979, after he forced sex on her the night before she married a rock manager, Jeff Sessler. (Earlier that year, the house she shared with Sessler burned down, taking all her belongings with it.) According to Mackenzie Phillips, the affair with her father lasted 10 years. She told Chynna Phillips, her half-sister, about the affair in the late '90s, according to an interview with Chynna in Us magazine. ""Somebody could have dropped a piano on my head, and I probably wouldn't have felt it,"" Chynna Phillips told the magazine. ""But I knew it was true. I mean, who in their right mind would make such a claim if it wasn't true?"" She says the news sent her into ""a deep, deep sadness and depression for about 10 days. A part of me died when I found out."" John Phillips also underwent rehab but struggled for the rest of his life. He had a liver transplant in 1992 but was photographed drinking several months later. He toured with versions of the Mamas & the Papas, some including Mackenzie. He died in 2001 of heart failure. Chynna Phillips and Mackenzie's ""One Day at a Time"" co-star Valerie Bertinelli have since rallied around her. But others have not. ""I am stunned by Mackenzie's terrible allegations about her father,"" Waite, John Phillips' third wife, wrote in a statement released to ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" Mackenzie Phillips appeared on the show Wednesday. ""I would often complain about her overly familiar attitudes towards him, and he said it was just her way. John was a good man. ... He was incapable, no matter how drunk or drugged he was, to have sexual relations with his own child."" And Mackenzie's half-brother, Tamerlane, the follower of an Indian guru, is having none of it. ""My family is and always will be a decrepit bowl of dog urine compared to Nityananda of Ganeshpuri. That is how great Nityananda is,"" he told the New York Post's Page Six. ""Worship Nityananda, not the Phillips family.""","John Phillips' reputation taking hit with claims of incest by daughter Mackenzie .

"(CNN) -- Ali Hussein Kadhim was not supposed to live to tell his story or that of the hundreds of other Iraqi soldiers and Shiites who were massacred in June by ISIS militants in Tikrit. But on the execution line that day the bullet destined for him whizzed past his head and he fell forward feigning to be fatally wounded. Kadhim lived to tell his story to the New York Times, which produced a gripping video offering a rare survivor's retelling of one of countless massacres carried out by the brutal Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""It took 23 days from the day of the massacre until he was reunited with his family,"" Adam Ellick, a senior video journalist for the New York Times, told CNN Thursday. ""I think the best way I would describe it is a combination Schindler's List-style escape and an Underground Railroad of local Samaritans sort of putting humanity before everything else."" Brutality has become a propaganda tool for the militants. It has included processions of soldiers making their way across the desert in their underwear before facing a hail of bullets, the beheading of American journalists and even crucifixions. The militants often capture the killings on videos distributed throughout the world like bloody calling cards of their cruel campaign. Kadhim shares ISIS survival tale with New York Times . Kadhim, 23, is the rare witness. Pretending to be dead among a pile of bodies, Kadhim told the Times that he waited for hours until he was able to escape. ""It's one of those stories where every time you feel relaxed something else bad happens to Ali,"" Ellick said. ISIS claimed it killed 1,700 Shiite soldiers that day, making the killings the deadliest sectarian atrocity in Iraq's recent history, according to the Times. On the video, Kadhim points to a computer screen showing footage of him among the pile of bodies during the Tikrit massacre. ""This is me,"" he said. ""I'm 100% sure. Not only 100%. A million percent."" Kadhim was fourth in line for execution. The bullet buzzed past his head. His face already was splattered with the blood of others. He feigned death. ""I thought it was the end,"" he told the Times. ""There was nothing more to fear. But then I remembered my family. ... Who will care for them?"" That gave him a will to live.

"New York (CNN) -- Hall of Fame NFL linebacker Lawrence Taylor was sentenced to six years probation during a court hearing Tuesday after pleading guilty to sexual misconduct with an underage girl. Taylor, who pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges in the case in January, will also have to pay a $2,000 fine, Judge William Kelly said. Kelly will also determine which sex-offender level status Taylor is expected to receive -- which could range from low to high risk -- during a separate hearing set for April 12. Taylor was arrested last May on charges of ""improper sexual conduct involving an underage girl in a Rockland County hotel,"" the district attorney's office said. Prosecutors said Taylor paid the teen $300 after ""sexual acts."" The girl, who was 16 years old at the time of the incident, denied allegations that she was a prostitute. ""I'm very upset about what Mr. Taylor did to me,"" she said. ""I did not want to go to his hotel."" The teenager said she was glad Taylor had been prosecuted though disappointed that the former New York Giant won't receive jail time. ""He took something very special from me,"" she said. ""I'm not a prostitute. I'm a victim, and I'm hurting."" Taylor entered a guilty plea to one count of sexual misconduct and one count of patronizing a prostitute in the third degree, both misdemeanor charges, prosecutors said. He was arrested in a Ramapo, New York, Holiday Inn room on May 6, a few hours after the encounter took place, authorities said. Ramapo is about 30 miles northwest of New York City. Ramapo police applauded a plea agreement Taylor entered into with prosecutors at the time. ""This department believes that the resolution reached in this case is fair and appropriate,"" Ramapo Police Chief Peter Brower said at the time. ""Mr. Taylor wants to publicly apologize to his wife and family and fans,"" said his attorney Arthur Aidala. ""Mr. Taylor accepts responsibility for what he did and he did intend to patronize a prostitute. He did not intend to patronize an underage person."" Aidala added that Taylor was ""deceived."" In July, Taylor's wife vehemently denied that the famous linebacker had sex with the underage prostitute. ""He didn't rape anyone. He didn't have sex with anyone. He didn't call a pimp,"" Lynette Taylor said on ""Larry King Live."" Lynette Taylor told King that the girl snuck into her husband's hotel room because many people knew Taylor was in town for an autograph signing. Taylor gave her $300 because she was going through bad times, Lynette Taylor said. ""So I mean for him, $300, here -- here is $300. Will this help you out any? It was very much that,"" said Lynette Taylor. ""Yes, he should have told her to get the heck out of my room. But I cannot explain why men do what they do.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal judges struck down Texas lawmakers' plans for new congressional and state legislative districts Tuesday, finding the maps were designed to discriminate against minorities. The ruling by a three-judge panel is at least a temporary victory for the Obama administration, which had challenged the redistricting plan drawn up after the 2010 census. Those plans require Justice Department approval under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. ""The Department is pleased that the district court has denied Texas's request for pre-clearance, "" the agency said. The summary opinion of the three Washington judges declared the redrawn lines were intentionally designed to discriminate against racial and language minorities, noting that Texas officials ""did not adequately engage with the evidence"" presented. The Justice Department had challenged the redistricting plans for congressional districts and state House of Representatives seats. It did not challenge the state Senate district lines, but the court said that plan also showed intentional discrimination. The Republican-led Legislature and Texas Gov. Rick Perry had defended the plans. An official familiar with the case said Texas would promptly appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Republican-led Legislature and Texas Gov.

"(CNN) -- With enough practice any hack can create a CAD rendering of a blender or produce an iPhone mockup that'll earn hundreds of likes on Dribbble, but designing a device that convinces people to make a meal out of maggots? That requires a special level of skill. Designer Katharina Unger is on a mission to make eating insects irresistible. The recent graduate from the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and current Fulbright Scholar devoted her thesis project, called Farm 432: Insect Breeding, to developing an appliance that incubates insects for human consumption. The striking blue and white vessel is stocked with one gram of black soldier fly eggs, and over a period of 18 days, the eggs move through the device's chambers, gestating, reproducing, and ultimately producing 2.4 kilograms of nutritious, if slightly nauseating, fly larva. This frightful food processor was invented to satisfy the meat cravings of the nine billion people expected to be living on Earth in 2050. To support that population, protein production will have to double and farming, primarily livestock cultivation, already uses up half of the planet's arable land, making it difficult to expand. Read this: Can this solar-powered watercraft save lives? Many believe the solution will lie in entomophagy, also known as eating bugs, but getting Westerners to make insects a big part of their diet will require a marketing program the size of Mothra. Unger's device hides the dirty and disgusting aspects of the process while employing design language from mainstream consumer products to make the concept seem more familiar. The concept unsettles many stomachs, but according to Unger, we already consume 500 grams worth of insects in our food annually. There can be up to 60 insect fragments in a 100 gram chocolate bar, and insect-infested fruits that can't be sold as produce are turned into juice. Starbucks even used crushed beetles to color their strawberry Frappucinos for a time. People seem willing to deal with the taste and texture of edible insects as long as they're presented properly. Here are five design principles Unger employed to make her flies seem flavorful. Do your (repugnant) market research . There are approximately 1,400 edible species of insect, yet there isn't a single skeevy sommelier to educate the masses about proper pest pairings. Unger took the challenge on herself and began sampling grasshoppers, crickets, mealworms, and other vile vittles. ""I felt okay with all that, but grabbing/touching the animals was gross,"" she says. ""I knew the only way people would grow insects at home was without having to touch them."" This informed the design of the appliance and users never have to touch the insects until it's time to cook. Read this: The 'talking' streetlamps that save energy . Make the disgusting delightful . While most of her classmates were making models of cars or furniture, Unger was harvesting insects. Initially suspicious, her peers eventually came to appreciate the eco-friendly goal and even partook in a slightly terrifying taste test. Unger attributes this open-mindedness to the way her appliance produces the flies. ""We tend to associate insects with negative imagery: destroyed crops, plagues, manure,"" she says. Her design is clean, almost to the point of being clinical, and promotes a sense of trust. ""Once people see how the larvae can be grown, that they clean themselves before they are ready to eat, they become very curious and forget their prejudices."" Create a community to go with your contraption . The idea of eating bugs may seem bizarre now, but blogs devoted to entomophagy are popping up and award winning chefs have begun integrating creepy-crawlies into their cuisine. With the right products and promotion, Unger thinks the distasteful could eventually become delicacies. ""It is comparable with the backyard chicken movement or growing vegetables on your balcony,"" she says. ""There are almost 2,000 edible insect species. The variety of tastes and different dishes is endless. We miss out a lot by not considering this food source!"" Pollinate your idea . Unger didn't stop at growing the flies â€” she also developed recipes, including a stellar tomato and larva risotto, to help make the icky output more enticing. She's now working out how changing the diet of the larva would impact taste. ""I always speculated what happened if I gave them just one specific type of food,"" she says. ""Maybe you could make them taste like strawberries?"" Create buzz . Turning insects into a protein powder or peanut butter-like substance could help introduce edible insects to the mass market more smoothly, but Unger wanted her project to make a statement. ""I felt it would be inconsequential to suddenly hide the main product away,"" she says. ""In the end it is not only about producing food, but also about the adventure of growing live animals in your home!"" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

The House apologized last summer. The first family -- descendants of Africans, of enslaved Africans and of slave-holders -- visited a slave fort in Ghana. These were historic occasions, and they occasioned the kind of hue and cry that always accompany the subject of slavery and whether we still need to reckon with it. I believe we do need more reckoning, and a little more love and a little more logic would help that process. Logic first: There's this quasi-math problem in which things don't add up. Many African-Americans naturally feel as if there is unfinished business from the past, while many European-Americans (and others) don't think they should inherit burdens from a past not of their making. So there's this generational equation to be worked out, and it will take big hearts, eager hearts, to do so. The calculation is a bit easier for me at first glance. I'm the seventh-generation descendant of the worst slave traders in American history. I found out from my grandmother when she was 88 and I was 28, a few years before she died. Over three generations, from 1769 to 1820, the DeWolfs brought more Africans to the Americas than any other family. They conducted the trade from Rhode Island, the ""largest"" slave trading state, contrary to what most of us would expect. It's natural for me to feel a particular burden. I wasn't the perpetrator, I didn't inherit money from the slave trade, but I gained so much through the accident of birth: material comfort, education, access, a sense of entitlement. A look at the other branches of my family tree makes it more complicated. I have ancestors who were here during slavery but, as far as I know, didn't own slaves, and I'm also the descendant of Irish immigrants who came to work in factories in New Jersey in the late 1800s. What I've learned is that this ancestry is not exempt either: . • Slavery was not just a Southern but also a Northern institution. Northerners, including the ""middling"" classes, owned slaves for over two centuries; they dominated the slave trade (which included ship-building, producing trade goods, regular folks buying shares in slave ships, etc.); they fueled industrialization with slave-picked cotton. From workers to the wealthy, everyone was part of the slave-based economy, even if just as consumers. • Slavery benefited immigrant families, even after the Civil War. Millions of Europeans flocked to the ""land of opportunity"" for jobs in a booming economy built largely on unpaid labor. Immigrants struggled when they arrived but then found routes to prosperity closed to African-Americans for a century after slavery as a result of official and unofficial segregation. Within two to three generations, my Irish ancestors were solidly middle-class, not because they worked harder than African-Americans but because they were white. They worked hard, and the system worked for them: home loans, home values that rose in white neighborhoods and not in black ones, college loans, access to better-paid jobs ... it all added up. So I can't help but conclude that slavery was central to building this nation, paving the way for so many, at the expense of so many. It was a national institution, not a Southern fluke or a sin of the wealthy few. As white Americans today, we can be proud that we don't have the prejudices of our forefathers, but we've inherited various blind spots and head starts, and it takes more than a couple of generations post-civil rights and affirmative action to create the level playing field we extol. Understanding this history makes me more committed to being part of the solution. Now, the love song. We don't usually talk about civic love. Rousseau did. He thought it was an extension of the biblical call to love one's neighbor as oneself. It was his definition of patriotism: a love of self that extended to love of fellow citizen, all of which created a national glue of commitment to the public good. It seems to be in short supply when the debate turns to black/white issues. If love sounds extreme, then how about real empathy, or maybe even tenderness? My ancestors came to purchase human cargo at the same slave fort, Cape Coast Castle, that the Obama family visited last month in Ghana. When I was there, in those dungeons, empathy overcame me, and my personal feelings of defensiveness suddenly seemed so petty. It now feels really natural to want to express regret -- not an apology (that's for institutions; Congress was right to step forward) but deep regret and sadness about what happened, fellow citizen to fellow citizen. I try to imagine what it would be like if we went so far as to extend tenderness toward each other. We could actually all use more of it when we're talking about race, racism and anything to do with slavery. Instead, we are full of protestations, distrust, dismissiveness, resentments. For those of us who are white, what's the resistance really about? It may be, at core, that we don't want to feel guilty or blamed or responsible for the outrage of slavery. I didn't. But here's the funny thing: While we white Americans are busy establishing our innocence, it turns out that many black Americans are not personally angry at us for slavery. Many do want authentic acknowledgement of what happened, but not for the sake of guilt-tripping. I've witnessed a generosity of spirit that I have been humbled by. Meanwhile, many African-Americans are upset about the disparate outcomes that persist and want to see everyone step up to address them. There are so many lingering ""structural inequalities,"" as President Obama put it -- ones without clear racist villains but that are embedded, like the fact that schools are funded with property taxes, so poor black neighborhoods, the legacy of earlier eras of discrimination, are not able to fund the quality schools that we say all our children deserve. From the wealth gap to the health gap to the education gap, let's explore how the dots connect from the past to the present and commit to finding solutions that should be race-neutral at times and at other moments should be race-sensitive. I have this image of us all coming up shoulder to shoulder on the same team, as fellow citizens. Not facing off against each other but looking the same way, facing the shared challenge: the legacy of this painful history. The past is not of our making, but it has shaped us indelibly, and we have the power to make things right, together, today.

"Washington (CNN) -- Even as the war against ISIS expands, House Speaker John Boehner said he doesn't believe Congress should debate any new authorization for the military operation until next year. In an interview with the New York Times, Boehner said he didn't believe holding a vote in November during the so-called lame-duck session of Congress was appropriate because there is ""a whole group of members who are on their way out the door."" Boehner delivered that same message to House Republicans in closed-door meetings before the House wrapped up its brief fall session last week, according to a top Boehner aide. ""He believes that having such a consequential debate with members who are either retiring or lost is not the right way to go about it,"" Kevin Smith, Boehner's communications director, told CNN. The speaker has emphasized on multiple occasions that he doesn't believe lame-duck sessions are the right time to tackle major policy debates such as immigration or tax reform. Will U.S. strikes hurt ISIS' oil riches? But both Republicans and Democrats have argued that the legal justification that the Obama administration cites to launch action against ISIS -- a 2001 measure passed by Congress to fight al Qaeda and the 2002 Iraq war authorization -- doesn't cover the current military action against this terror group. Some members, including Republicans, want Boehner to call the House back into session before the mid-term election to vote on a new authorization. Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen told MSNBC Thursday that it's time for Congress to return to Washington and take up new legislation focused on the fight against ISIS. ""We are shirking our responsibility by not voting on this,"" she said. Pentagon spokesman on fighting ISIS: 'I think we are in this for a matter of years' But Boehner, who is on a campaign swing for GOP candidates in New England this week, made it clear he has no plans to do so. The House speaker did tell the Times -- as he said before Congress left for the final stretch before the November mid-term elections -- that he believes it's important for Congress to ""speak"" on the issue. But he insisted it's up to the White House to draft and send new language to Capitol Hill. ""I would suggest to you that early next year, assuming that we continue in this effort, there may be that discussion and there may be that request from the President,"" Boehner said. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who could become majority leader if Republicans win control of the Senate in November, didn't have a comment about Boehner's remarks. But his spokesman Don Stewart told CNN that McConnell ""has said multiple times that the President should present us with a plan and we can vote on that and if it's a good plan it will have bipartisan support."" CNN Senior Congressional Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this story.","Debate in Congress over war authorization likely wouldn't happen until next year .
That's according to House Speaker John Boehner .

"(CNN) -- Eleven years ago this week, the world faced the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, a new epidemic that infected some 8,000 people, took the lives of 775 individuals, and inflicted $30 billion in damage to regional economies. The emergence of SARS was a wake-up call for the World Health Organization and its members, including the United States. The world had to do more to prevent, detect and respond to new biological threats. This is not just a health challenge; it's a security challenge as well. Infectious diseases -- whether naturally occurring, deliberate or accidental -- have the potential to cause enormous damage in terms of lives lost, economic impact and ability to recover, just as with nuclear, chemical, or cybersecurity attacks. During the anthrax attacks of 2001, 22 people were infected and five people lost their lives here in in the United States. The cleanup cost was more than $1 billion. The global H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 killed 284,000 people worldwide in its first year alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the decade since the SARS outbreak, we have made notable progress. China, for instance, has shown leadership in its transparent approach to the ongoing and rapidly escalating H7N9 influenza outbreak. Under revised WHO regulations, many countries have increased capability and made event reporting more transparent. But 80% of the world's nations still are not prepared to deal with new pandemics, and more can and must be done across the health, agriculture and security sectors to elevate this issue and steer resources toward it. The United States has made addressing infectious disease threats a priority. On Thursday in Washington and Geneva, we are convening 26 countries to launch a Global Health Security Agenda that will accelerate progress on addressing a wide range of global health security threats. With our partners and allies, we'll be intensifying our efforts to meet the challenges of an increasingly globalized world, whether that means the emergence and spread of new microbes, the globalization of travel and food supply, the rise of drug-resistant pathogens, or the risk of an inadvertent or intentional release. At the same time, we'll continue to work to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring or using biological agents for harm. New diseases are inevitable, but in the 21st century we have the tools to greatly reduce the threat posed by global epidemics. We can put in place a safe, secure, globally linked, inter-operable system to prevent disease threats, detect outbreaks in real time, and share information and expertise to respond effectively. To achieve this goal, we must work more effectively across sectors and governments, harmonize our efforts, identify what works and measure our progress. We invite national leaders, international organizations and nongovernmental stakeholders from around the world to join us in this endeavor. Our security and the lives and livelihoods of our citizens depend on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kerry, Kathleen Sebelius and Lisa Monaco.","Infectious diseases are security challenges, say John Kerry and Kathleen Sebelius .

"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) -- Teaching Mandarin is a growing trend across schools in the United States, where the number of students enrolling in Chinese language and cultural programs has tripled in recent years. A school district outside Columbus, Ohio, is on track to receive more than $1 million in federal grant money for its Chinese arts and language program. But what's really caught people's attention is the $30,000 that the district is getting from the government of China. The Gahanna-Jefferson School District began teaching Mandarin Chinese four years ago and since then, the number of students in the program has increased from about 40 to 350. Administrators felt China should have a home in their suburban Ohio school system since the communist country has the world's second-largest economy and is becoming increasingly relevant. ""We owe it to our students so they can be a successful part of the world,"" said Hank Langhals, coordinator for pupil services. ""And China will be a major player there."" The district has been dubbed a Confucius Classroom, which in a nutshell means it has earned the support of the Chinese Ministry of Education. The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming. From New England to California and many places in between, dozens of public schools have similar relationships with the Chinese government. And the number continues to grow. Chinese student loving life at U.S. college . During his visit to the United States this week, Chinese President Hu Jintao plans to visit one such program at the Walter Payton College Prep school in Chicago. The nonprofit Asia Society works, in many instances, with the Chinese government to help secure new Confucius Classrooms and relationships. They work with more than 60 schools in the U.S. Mandy Aldis is a mother of three at Gahanna's schools. She and her family moved to the district specifically for the language program. ""We feel very lucky that we have this,"" Aldis said. ""I say it's just like math, English, art -- it's as important as anything else."" Aldis added that having guest teachers from China who are native speakers adds to the experience. Her son is a sophomore and has taken a serious interest in the language. ""I'd have potential to get a job doing translating or interpreting, maybe work for the State Department,"" said Andrew Aldis. Pop culture helps bridge U.S.-China gap . Judy Huang Lewis, who owns a business in Ohio that regularly does business with China, said the need for Chinese speakers is increasing, particuarly because of the small Asian population in the Midwest. ""It's really been challenging,"" she said. ""Schools that offer stuff like this I think are crucial going forward."" But the program doesn't sit that well with everyone, in part because of the Chinese government's role. Aldis said he hears about it ""all the time."" ""I actually have a few friends that are hateful towards the language and the culture, maybe because it's different,"" he said.  ""A lot of Americans don't really know much about Chinese culture so they see it as alien so it's bad. I think China has a beautiful culture."" Teacher Chiwei Lin has also heard some concerns raised about the program. ""Not really often because I think most Americans are really polite,"" Chiwei said.  ""They wouldn't just say something like that in front of your face, but there are people who are not willing to open up to other cultures."" Outside Los Angeles, the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District was set to receive similar funds from the Chinese government through the Confucius Classroom network. But backlash from community members who cited ""communist propaganda"" meant they ultimately had to turn it down. ""The objection ... was not to the teaching of a foreign language,"" said John Kramar, the district's former superintendent and a vocal opponent of the proposal. ""The problem here was the culture portion and the involvement with the Chinese government."" Kramar said he was concerned about impressionable elementary students learning about communism through material provided by the Chinese government. School officials at Ohio's Gahanna-Jefferson school district maintain that is not part of their curriculum. Asked whether they must follow certain guidelines in order to receive the funds, International Language Coordinator Rae Harriott-White said ""absolutely not."" She added that they wouldn't have accepted teachers from China if they came with their own curriculum. School administrator Hank Langhals stressed that a relationship, however small, between China and the United States will be mutually beneficial in the long run. ""We don't agree with everything, how the system works in China, but hopefully as it opens more and more, which it certainly has, they will become more democratic, they will become more open with less censorship, so you hope that's all there,"" Langhals said.  ""That doesn't mean, though, that if it's not there yet that our students don't learn about the culture and don't learn about the language."" Parent Mandy Aldis said she isn't bothered one bit by the program being funded by China's government. ""I'm not sure why [people have problems with it],"" Aldis said. ""It's wonderful that [China is] reaching out to us and we're reciprocating. I think the more you're exposed to another culture, the more you understand each other, you're just a more well-rounded person. And I think everybody could use that.""","China's government is sponsoring the Confucius Classroom program .

"(CNN) -- They are the famous voices. The actors whose names and faces you may not know -- but they're aiming to change that. Every July, at San Diego Comic-Con, voice actors enjoy major celebrity status along with A-list stars who do on-camera acting. It's a welcome change for the never-seen actors who may usually go unnoticed. Following CNN's 2012 interviews with several voice actors, John DiMaggio (best known as Bender on ""Futurama"" and Jake on ""Adventure Time"") had been finishing work on a documentary that sought to pay tribute to those unsung famous voices behind animated icons. ""I Know That Voice,"" is set to make a splash with a Comic-Con panel Thursday, and features interviews with multiple generations of voice-over artists including Tom Kenny (SpongeBob Squarepants) and 95-year-old June Foray (Rocky the Flying Squirrel). CNN recently spoke with DiMaggio, and the film's director Lawrence Shapiro, as well as veteran voice actress Tara Strong from the new animated series ""Teen Titans Go!"" Strong is also known for her work on ""Rugrats,"" ""Powerpuff Girls,"" and ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic."" (""Adventure Time,"" ""Powerpuff Girls"" and ""Teen Titans Go!"" all air on Cartoon Network which, like CNN, is a subsidiary of Time Warner). Comic Con 2013: What we can't wait to see . CNN: Where did the idea for this documentary originate? John DiMaggio: Larry [Shapiro] and I were in Amsterdam for a thing we've been doing for a long time called ""Jam in the 'Dam."" We'd just been talking about stuff we wanted to do and Larry said we should do something about voiceover. ""I Know That Voice"" came from that. Shapiro: You'd see people enjoy John on one level as an emcee, then he would bust out a voice like Bender and you'd see everyone's jaw drop. DiMaggio: I got a bunch of people I work with on a regular basis to come talk to us. I owe a lot of people a lot of favors now, so I'm screwed. I kind of wanted to make a valentine to the folks I work with, and give a little face-time to these folks who entertain so many people all of the time and don't really get credit. It is a close-knit group of people, and it's a group of actors that really look out for each other. It's a competitive industry and these people are the least competitive and some of the most talented. It's just a really good group of people and that's what we wanted to show in the film. Strong: We all know each other and we see each other wherever we go. It's usually the same 10 or 20 people on every show at a time. The nice thing about the voice acting community is there's this camaraderie, we know there's work for everyone. You don't get the same sort of cattiness that you'd get on camera. It's not about what you look like. I'm pretty amazed by voice actors every day. CNN: How often do you get recognized? DiMaggio: People are starting to recognize me at these conventions, but as soon as I walk away from the convention, people don't really know who I am, which is great because I love flying under the radar. Strong: Anytime around the conventions, we're suddenly superstars. DiMaggio: You get these more mainstream projects and suddenly you're walking down the street and someone says, ""Hey man you do that voice!"" That's a strange thing. I didn't get into this business to be famous; I got into this to work. CNN: Do you ever breathe a sigh of relief when you see on-camera celebrities getting mobbed? DiMaggio: Yeah, do I really want to have to invest in hand sanitizer? I'm good. CNN: How easily can you call upon all of your various characters? Strong: Once I create a character, they live up there in my head. Some people say, ""I want to get into voice acting because I have an interesting voice,"" but there's so much more to it than that, bringing characters to life through your acting abilities. I don't even know where they come from half the time, they're in there -- whenever it's time to play, they come out and they don't get mixed up. CNN: What do you think of the rise of ""name"" actors getting involved in animated features after the success of ""Aladdin,"" ""Shrek"" and ""Madagascar?"" DiMaggio: That's a difficult call, from a producer's standpoint you want to bring in names just to create a buzz. Sure, but in the long run, kids don't really care who's doing the voice as long as it's good. It's a constant dilemma that we in the trenches have to deal with all the time. They're starting to cast names a lot more in cartoons, because a lot of people are becoming hip to the job. ""Really, I don't have to go to the makeup trailer and wait 10 hours to shoot one scene?"" It's an interesting thing that names are coming out of the woodwork. But if you're a producer, if you want to make money, you gotta spend money, I suppose, in that vein. There's enough to go around I think. Strong: I've been doing it for over 25 years and others doing it even longer. Sometimes they'll give millions of dollars to an on-camera celebrity who isn't as convincing as one of the voiceover greats. It's nice to see (voiceover actors) get more recognition, that's for sure.

Onboard LCD TV's and Wi-Fi clash rather starkly (pleasingly, for technophobes) with the alluring beauty of historic architecture like the Taj Mahal beyond the train. Boarding: Delhi. Cost: Seven-night Classic India Tour from US$6,265 for Deluxe Cabin; US$17,500 for Presidential Suite.http://www.rirtl.com/ . Also on CNNGo: Maharajas' Express: Super luxury train voyage, celebrity included . 10. Pride of Africa . Africa . Spacious suites (rather than cabins) with their own stocked bar fridge define the accommodation aboard Rovos Rail's Pride of Africa service. Double beds and modern en suite bathrooms complete with hair dryers ensure grooming standards don't slip while slipping through some of Africa's wild landscapes. It's all rather glamorous in an understated manner for just 72 guests. Windows that open send rail buffs into delirium on the odd occasion when a steam locomotive takes the lead position. For the time-rich with deep pockets, the 14-day Dar Es Salaam to Cape Town service is the ultimate African adventure. Boarding: Cape Town (South Africa) or Dar Es Salaam (Tanzania).

"(CNN) -- Thousands of migrant children, including newborn babies, are being locked up in squalid and cramped detention facilities each year in Thailand, enduring serious physical and emotional harm, according to a new report. The 67-page report from Human Rights Watch (HRW) entitled ""Two Years with No Moon': Immigration Detention of Children in Thailand,"" describes how Thailand is unnecessarily violating children's rights and risking their welfare because of their immigration status or that of their parents. ""Migrant children detained in Thailand are suffering needlessly in filthy, overcrowded cells without adequate nutrition, education, or exercise space,"" said Alice Farmer, children's rights researcher at HRW and author of the report. ""Detention lockup is no place for migrant children. The sad thing is it's been known for years that these poor detention conditions fall far short of international standards but the Thai government has done little or nothing to address them."" Held indefinitely . The report, which was based on interviews with 41 children and 64 adults who were all detained or arrested by immigration officials, said those affected -- often from neighboring countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos -- can be held indefinitely with little or no legal support, in violation of international law. One migrant mentioned in the report described how he and his family were kept at a detention center in Bangkok for six months. ""My [five-year-old] nephew asked, 'How long will I stay?' He asked, 'Will I live the rest of my life here?' I didn't know what to say."" The rights group also said several children described being confined in cells so crowded they had to sleep sitting up. Others reported sleeping on tile or wooden floors, without mattresses or blankets, and surrounded by strange adults. ""The worst part was that you were trapped and stuck,"" Cindy Y., a migrant child held from the age of 9 to 12, told HRW. ""I would look outside and see people walking around the neighborhood, and I would hope that would be me."" According to Thai law, any migrant with an irregular immigration status, even a child, can be arrested and detained. Military crackdown . In recent months, tens of thousands of migrant workers, particularly from Cambodia, have fled Thailand amid rumors of a crackdown on undocumented workers by the country's new military rulers. Thailand has a very low unemployment rate of 0.9%, according to the National Statistical Official of Thailand. Many of the foreigners work low-paying jobs that Thais are unwilling to do, but they are often vulnerable to police harassment and exploitation, advocates say. But the Thai military has claimed it doesn't have a policy of arrest as has been widely reported, rather it says it has encouraged undocumented workers to ""seek employment through proper channels."" The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates there are 370,000 to 380,000 migrant children in Thailand, with the largest number coming from Myanmar where they have fled sectarian persecution against ethnic groups such as the Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine state. According to HRW, the problem of overcrowded detention facilities is worsening, as the country sees more refugees and asylum seekers coming from further afield, such as war-torn Syria, or Christians fleeing persecution in Pakistan. Meanwhile, an event being held to discuss the human rights situation in Thailand in the wake of this year's military coup has been canceled following pressure from the authorities. Police officers arrived at the Foreign Correspondent's Club of Thailand (FCCT) in Bangkok on Tuesday afternoon to deliver their order, according to Pawinee Chumsri of Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. She said police told her the event would violate an order from the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) banning political gatherings. ""We regard this action as a human rights violation to families and people who are entitled to receive justice,"" she said. The Thai authorities have yet to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch.","Human Rights Watch reports says Thailand is unnecessarily violating children's rights .

"(CNN) -- Militants in Iraq have taken hold of nuclear materials at university science facilities near the northern city of Mosul, the Iraqi government has said in a letter to the United Nations. But two U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday that the small amounts of uranium aren't enriched or weapons-grade, prompting only minimal concern. The letter from Iraq's U.N. ambassador about the uranium compounds asks for help ""to stave off the threat of their use by terrorists in Iraq or abroad"" as the country struggles with a deadly insurgency. In the letter, obtained Wednesday by CNN, Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said that ""terrorist groups have seized control"" of nearly 40 kilograms (90 pounds) of uranium compounds at science departments at the University of Mosul after the sites ""came out of control of the state."" The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group, has led Sunni insurgents who have taken over large areas of northern and western Iraq in an offensive that began last month. The terrorist group has also made major gains in Syria in its quest to establish an Islamic state spanning both countries. In his letter, dated Tuesday, Alhakim said the nuclear materials were used in ""very limited quantities"" for scientific study and research. But he warned that despite the small amounts, the materials could be used by terrorists in Iraq or smuggled out of the country. ""Such materials can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction,"" Alhakim wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Reuters. Iraq witnessed another violent day Wednesday as the country's security and political crises deepened. More than 50 unidentified bodies were found in the predominantly Shiite town of Alexandria on Wednesday, Iraqi security officials said. The bodies of two children were among the dozens found in different parts of the town. Details about the circumstances of the deaths were not immediately available, and officials did not say when the people may have been killed. Not far from Alexandria, at least five people were killed and 17 wounded by three car bombs that exploded in front of a courthouse in the town of Hilla, security and medical officials said. Hilla is about 92 kilometers (57 miles) south of Baghdad and is the first sizable town south of the capital. CNN's Richard Roth, Elise Labott, Hamdi Alkhshali and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Iraq: Terrorist groups have control of about 40 kilos of uranium compounds .

"(CNN) -- The sudden death of Academy Award-winning actor and comedian Robin Williams has sent shock waves throughout the world. The 63-year-old was not only known for bringing laughter to so many throughout his career but for bringing compassion to his philanthropic causes as well. Impact Your World remembers Williams' generosity by looking at some charities with which he worked. Robin Williams' legacy: A big heart for charity . The United Service Organization (USO) was a perfect fit for the comedian. The goal of the organization is to lift the spirits of American troops, and that's exactly what Williams did. During his USO tours, the ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" star traveled to war zones entertaining troops from Afghanistan to Kuwait. The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, which is dedicated to curing spinal cord injuries, tweeted: . The entertainer and Christopher Reeve were very close friends. They formed an inseparable bond as roommates while studying at New York's Julliard School. Williams was the first to bring a smile to his college buddy's face after Reeve's 1995 horseback riding accident left him paralyzed from the neck down. In Reeve's autobiography ""Still Me,"" he wrote how Williams made a surprise hospital visit impersonating a Russian proctologist and was going to perform an exam on him! The comedic actor was a friend to people of all ages. Just like his ""Patch Adams"" character, Williams brought smiles and laughter to sick children. He visited kids battling cancer one-on-one and signed autographs at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In 2006, the father of three was honored with the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Award at Celebrity Fight Night. The annual event raises money primarily for the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center in Phoenix. Reba McEntire has emceed the benefit dinner and auction for the past nine years and recalled her favorite memory of Williams. She added, ""I will miss Robin so much, as we all will. Thank God we have so many wonderful memories of him, his wit, talent, big heart and generosity."" The late actor was also involved with Comic Relief to raise money for those in need, especially America's homeless. He hosted a series of HBO TV specials with comedian friends Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg. Comic Relief founder Bob Zmuda remembered Williams' generosity on CNN's ""New Day"": ""Robin was the one from the get-go that was really insistent that we would raise funds for the homeless community. Robin was kind of born with a silver spoon in his mouth. ... I think he felt that he was given so much and that he needed to give back and he truly did."" Complete coverage of Robin Williams .

"(CNN) -- Faced with a choice between a cash incentive or signing up for a hard day's work, which would you pick? Shoe retailer Zappos.com is famous for bribing prospective employees to turn down a job offer, on the theory that we should only work in a place we love. This year, CEO Tony Hsieh is testing whether this kind of corporate culture can work beyond the warehouse of this one quirky online company. Hsieh is trying to spark a Delivering Happiness movement, named after his recent book, which expands on how, and why, companies who care about their bottom line should make employees feel like a family. Hsieh made a name for himself at Zappos by prioritizing customer service to an extreme, and his in-house employment policies have gotten at least as much attention. Zappos, which is now part of the Amazon.com family, has been climbing Fortune magazine's ""Best Companies to Work For"" list, thanks to a corporate culture where ""weird"" is meant as a compliment and the line between personal and professional is often blurred. He tells CNN why workplace happiness isn't just for shoe retailers or dewy-eyed optimists. An edited version of the e-mail interview follows. CNN: When you got to what many people consider the top of the game in the corporate world, your outlook appears to have taken on a whole new set of goals. What became priorities for you in your career? Tony Hsieh: After LinkExchange (Hsieh's first company) was sold, I could do whatever I wanted to from a financial point of view, which forced me to reflect and think about what I really wanted to get out of life. Part of the goal of the book is to nudge people to really think about what they're passionate about, what makes them happy. You don't have to sell a company in order to think about what you want out of life. Jenn (Lim, Hsieh's partner and CEO of the Delivering Happiness movement) was actually in the same position at that time but for a completely different reason: she had just been laid off. Through that process, she ended up pursuing things she was actually passionate about. 3 rules for the first-time boss . CNN: How does a little healthy cynicism fit into the Delivering Happiness equation? Can't a little bit of moaning and a critical attitude also have a place in the workplace? TH: There's a difference between constructive criticism and complaining and moaning without helping contribute to a solution. You can't force employees to be like a family -- they actually need to want to do it themselves. Our goal at Zappos is to inspire -- not motivate -- employees to treat each other like family. For example, most Zappos employees when they leave the office leave to hang out with other Zappos employees. That's behavior you can't force upon employees. They actually have to want to do it. CNN: You tweet and encourage employees to access social media on the job. The professional and the private are increasingly blurred. Will social media also serve a business purpose, particularly as it extends to individual employees? TH: For us, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, blogs, etc. are all ways we can connect with our customers and employees. We're not looking at them as marketing channels, more as connection channels, the same way we view the telephone as a great way to connect. At Zappos we are all about blurring lines. Our goal is to hire employees whose personal values match our 10 core values, so every employee is automatically living the brand, at home, in the office and in social media. Rather than focus on work-life separation, we focus on work-life integration. CNN: Prioritizing happy customers and happy employees seems like it should be a given, yet the Zappos model still sticks out as a bit of a lone phenomenon. Are most major companies not agile enough to play along with quirky ideas from a CEO? TH: I'm not sure ""happy customers"" and ""happy employees"" should be classified as quirky, but in any case, I think the reason why we aren't seeing more companies in corporate America focus on these things (yet) is because the payoff from a financial perspective is usually two to three years down the road. Many companies are focusing on the current quarter or current year at best. The good news is that information is moving faster and faster and companies are becoming more and more transparent whether they like it or not. As a result, the lag time between brand and culture is becoming less and less, so in the long run I think the ""good guys"" will win.","Tony Hsieh: Employees who really like their workplace are more likely to live for their jobs .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush reflected on his own struggle with alcohol in a White House meeting Thursday that touted gains in the war on drug abuse. President Bush speaks about his administration's efforts in fighting drug abuse at the White House on Thursday. CNN was the only media outlet invited to attend the entire meeting, which other reporters joined in the final minutes for remarks from the president. Several in the room, including Don Coyhis of Colorado Springs, Colorado, who runs a program targeting Native Americans battling substance abuse, were recovered addicts or alcoholics. Bush, who quit drinking at the age of 40, was impressed. ""Congratulations on 30 years of sobriety,"" the president told Coyhis. ""I'm eight years behind you."" The president told the group of 14 -- all leaders in drug prevention, treatment and interdiction programs across the country -- that a new study shows teen drug abuse has dropped 25 percent since he took office in 2001. ""No question there's still work to do in America, but we are making progress,"" Bush said. But the study by the University of Michigan cautioned that progress could be threatened by a drop in the percentage of young people who think marijuana is harmful. And it found that a high percentage of teens are abusing prescription drugs, with nearly 10 percent of high school seniors reporting using Vicodin over the past year and nearly 5 percent abusing OxyContin. Bush listened to participants' stories and shared some candid moments. Professional baseball player Josh Hamilton, who once suffered from a debilitating drug addiction, talked about seeking help from eight treatment centers. ""They didn't work for me,"" he said. It wasn't until his grandmother confronted him while he was high on drugs that something clicked. ""That moment cleared my mind, opened my heart, and that following night I committed my life to Christ,"" Hamilton said. The president praised the effectiveness of the programs represented, most private and faith-based. ""I'm a faith-based guy,"" Bush explained. ""Sometimes, to help change a person's behavior, you have to change their heart. Government's not really good at that."" Former New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. talked about why he was motivated to launch a student drug testing program that has now spread to 20 city high schools. Over his nearly 30-year-career, Connick said, ""I sent a lot of people to the penitentiary. But at one point I thought, this is not enough."" The father of singer Harry Connick Jr. maintained that the best way to reduce demand for drugs is to test high school students. Dr. Katie McQueen advocated more careful screening of patients for substance abuse by hospitals and doctors. ""Of the millions of people who need help, most don't get it because they don't think they need it,"" McQueen explained. When McQueen announced that her Houston program was based in ""the great state of Texas,"" Bush interrupted with a broad smile, ""I'll be home in about -- but who's counting -- 39 days."" Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, discussed research showing that 50 percent of a person's vulnerability to drug addiction is genetic. Bush asked whether the same was true of alcohol abuse. ""There's clearly a genetic component,"" Volkow responded. ""That's why prevention is so important."" Lt. Mike Boudreaux of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department described his battle to eradicate marijuana fields on California public lands. ""It's a daunting task,"" Boudreaux said of the efforts, which often involve confronting Mexican drug dealers intent on protecting their hidden fields. Boudreaux added that his mother often prays for the president. ""One of the most striking aspects of being president is the power of prayer in my life. I feel it,"" Bush said. ""Some days are happy. Some days are not so happy. But every day is joyous.""","President Bush discussed gains in the war on drug abuse .

"(CNN) -- Minimum wages are on top of the political agenda in many countries. U.S. President Barack Obama's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $10 per hour seems blocked by Congress, but individual states and cities are raising minimum wages within their jurisdictions -- Seattle's mayor, for example, proposes a new $15 minimum. Germany looks set to introduce a national minimum wage for the first time, after months of fierce debates. In the UK, politicians from all the main parties are falling over themselves to find some way to inject new vigor into the UK's national minimum wage. Even the free market redoubt of Hong Kong introduced a national minimum wage in 2011. But it's not all travel in one direction. Last weekend, 76% of voters were opposed to a proposal to raise the Swiss minimum wage to what would have been the world's highest, about $25 per hour. So, why this widespread enthusiasm for the minimum wage? There is both economics and politics at play. The main argument against the minimum wage is that it destroys jobs, harming those it sets out to help. But evidence suggests that this is often just a scare story. When the UK introduced its national minimum wage in 1999, critics predicted hundreds of thousands of job losses. The actual impact seemed to be zero. This experience and other studies have shifted the expert opinion on the minimum wage. Few dispute that there comes a point at which minimum wage is so high that it destroys jobs. But this does not happen at the current levels of minimum wages in many countries. The reason the minimum wage seems to have little effect on employment, is that total labor costs do not rise as much as one would expect as costs of turnover and absenteeism are reduced. Moreover, the incentive to work rises as wages rise for low-skill workers. Most workers earning are not in sectors where they would be facing international competition so prices rise a little bit. And many low-paid workers are in an vulnerable economic position and are paid less than the value of what they produce. So yes, the minimum wage does help low-paid workers -- it raises their earnings without harming their job prospects. It helps to reduce poverty. But it alone cannot solve the problem of poverty. Many people earning minimum wage, such as students, are not living in poor households. And many poor households do not contain minimum wage workers. Indeed, the poorest households are those with no-one in work. So why the push for higher mimum wage? Many people think there is something very wrong with an economic system in which someone who works hard is still unable to provide an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families. Such views have always been common, but are much more common after the crisis when living standards are threatened and the link between growth and people's welfare seems to have been severed. In some places, these political pressures seem likely to lead to minimum wages much higher than we have seen in recent experience, perhaps around 60% of median earnings. This is the point at which many economists get nervous that the negative effects on employment must surely kick in but we do not have many studies to know whether these concerns are valid. But it seems likely we may be about to find out. Opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Manning.","Minimum wages are at the top of the political agenda in many countries .

"(CNN) -- In the aftermath of the decision in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, there is one thing (and perhaps only one thing) that most everyone agrees upon: It is a game changer. The Background: A game changer . By Jonathan Turley . After decades of conflicting and increasingly convoluted decisions on the use of race as a criterion for university admissions, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the citizens of Michigan could constitutionally ban the use of race and other criteria in the selection of students. For some, the court affirmed the right to establish a colorblind selection process. For others, the court engaged in an act of willful blindness to the racial realities of society. The court has been struggling in this area for decades. In 1977, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the court allowed only a limited use of race for the purpose of achieving ""diversity"" in classes. The Medical School at the University of California at Davis set aside 16 of the 100 seats for minorities. The court ruled it unconstitutional but was deeply divided on why -- a harbinger for the line of cases that would follow Bakke. The court spent nearly the next 40 years spinning on the ice of affirmative action, unable to get traction or a clear direction. The court's split decision in 2003 is illustrative. It was presented with two cases involving the use of race as a criterion in the undergraduate and the law school admissions processes at University of Michigan. In one case, Gratz v. Bollinger, the court voted 6-3 that the university violated equal protection in the selection of students based on race and other criteria. It then ruled 5-4, in Grutter v. Bollinger, to uphold race criteria in the admissions process for Michigan Law School. However, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stressed that the court ""expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."" O'Connor's statement was ridiculed by many (including some on the court), but seemed to capture the fluidity of the court's position on the use of race. In 2013, the court again seemed to produce a nuanced and uncertain decision in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, where the court rejected a lower court decision upholding the use of race in admissions at the University of Texas. However, it did not prohibit the use of race but rather sent back the case for the imposition of a more demanding test of ""strict scrutiny."" These cases offered little hope that a ""bright line"" could be reached to bring resolution of the issue and meant that the court would continue to referee such matters. That line, however, may now have been reached in Schuette. Michigan voters responded to the divided results in the Grutter and Gratz cases to bring their own clarity to the area. They passed a constitutional amendment that required an entirely colorblind process for selection at state schools (as well as barring schools from giving an advantage to some students based on other immutable characteristics like gender). By a vote of 6-2, the court ruled this week that citizens could do precisely that. In so ruling, the court for the first time created an avenue that could end this longstanding controversy by vote of citizens. Seven states have already passed such rules, and this decision is likely to encourage others to follow. In my seminar on the Constitution and the Supreme Court, my students and I debate leading cases each term and voted both on the merits and on our prediction as to the outcome in that ""other"" court. So, in our recent vote, the GW Supreme Court voted overwhelmingly, 11-4, to reverse the Sixth Circuit and allow Michigan voters to make such a decision. The class also predicted the result in the case -- again by an 11-4 vote. Here are two of our ""GW justices"" who viewed the case in manifestly different ways: . AGAINST: Ruling reflects 'sad history' of racial hurdles . By Yvette Butler . The importance of the court's decision is amplified by our sad history of placing hurdles to bar minorities from meaningful participation in the political process. Race-conscious policies, by the court's own admission, are highly controversial and should be confronted in the political process through healthy debate. However, the debate means little if no real action can be taken to implement what was decided through that debate. The Michigan Constitution already contained a process for deciding university admissions policies. Michigan residents had ample voice through elections to choose members of a board that were an integral part of this process. If the board members were not advancing the will of the people, residents could have made their voices heard through elections. This switch from a highly accessible and accountable board to a state constitutional amendment is an impermissible restructuring of the political process which will only serve to cripple the effectiveness of public debate and severely disadvantage the minority. By adopting a change on a state constitutional level, the issue is further removed from the hands of the people. Even assuming that a healthy debate will take place, the decision places a significant hurdle in the way of any concrete action. This decision goes against clearly established Supreme Court precedent that it is unconstitutional to inhibit meaningful access to the political process for minorities. The Supreme Court plays a special role in our system. It must uphold constitutional rights, especially in the face of majority rule where that majority seeks to take a voice away from the minority. FOR: Court should not undo the will of the people . By Vincent C. Cirilli . The political process yields favorable and unfavorable results. As long as the government does not interfere with the right to participate in the process, and as long as the results of that process are constitutional, the courts cannot take power from voters and undo the will of the people. The Supreme Court made clear that Schuette was not about the constitutional validity of affirmative action programs. Instead, the case was about whether Michigan's constitutional amendment barring affirmative action interfered with the right to participate in the political process. The court correctly ruled that the process functioned properly. What did that process entail? Michigan's Proposal 2, a statewide referendum, was approved by 58% of Michigan voters. The amendment the voters passed does not restrict speech, deny voting rights, or impose majoritarian barriers designed to prevent the minority from achieving its goals. In other words, the amendment does not interfere with the political process. Voters are not silenced, the issues are not censored, and the debate surrounding affirmative action is not over. If the role of the court is to perfect democracy, then the court fulfilled its role in not overturning Michigan's amendment. A ruling to the contrary would undermine democracy by removing this debate from the public sphere and leaving its resolution in the hands of nine unelected judges. Some may disagree with Michigan's amendment. That is to be expected and encouraged. The political process is always ongoing and perhaps the issue will be revisited. In the meantime, the debate will continue, ideas will be shared, and the political process will march forward.

"(CNN) --  A state-run Chinese newspaper expressed relief Monday that senior Japanese officials had dismissed the country's air force chief after he denied Japan's aggression before and during World War II. General Toshio Tamogami . Gen. Toshio Tamogami lost his job as chief of staff for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force, the Ministry of Defense said, after saying in an essay that ""it is certainly a false accusation to say that our country was an aggressor nation."" Japanese troops invaded China in 1937 and were widely accused of gross human rights abuses, including raping tens of thousands of girls and women and killing several hundred thousand others in what has come to be called ""The Rape of Nanking."" Imperial Japan also invaded several other Asian nations, leading to the death and misery for an untold number. Two former Japanese prime ministers have apologized for Japanese aggression before and during World War II. Yet China has long accused of elements within Japan of trying to whitewash the Japanese atrocities committed before and during World War II. ""The denial of the aggression history by Toshio Tamogami comes in as an element of disharmony,"" the state-run China Daily said a commentary Monday. ""Yet, as long as the Japanese government has a right attitude to this question, the smooth development of ties between the two neighbors will not be derailed by such discordant notes."" Tamogami's essay, published late last week, also stirred controversy in South Korea. Japan controlled Korea from 1910 to 1945. Its military is accused of forcing roughly 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves -- they were known euphemistically as ""comfort women"" -- for soldiers in the Imperial Army. The South Korean foreign ministry criticized Tamogami's commentary in a statement published by Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. ""His claim is distorting history,"" the statement said. ""International friendly relations are based on repentance for past wrongdoings and learning a lesson from history,"" Tamogami's essay won first prize in a competition called the ""True Perspective of Modern and Contemporary History."" Several Japanese leaders have apologized in recent years for past Japanese aggression. In 2005, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apologized for his country's role in World War II on the 60th anniversary of the war's end. He vowed Japan would never again take ""the path to war."" Japan agreed to surrender on August 15, 1945, after U.S. planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The formal surrender was signed September 2. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama also expressed Tokyo's deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the damage and suffering it inflicted on its Asian neighbors.

"(CNN) -- At least 1.2 billion usernames and passwords hacked. Is this truly scary or corporate fearmongering? The New York Times published an article this week that has shocked the public. The article says that a Russian cybercrime group by the name of CyberVor has amassed this astoundingly large number of credentials from upwards of 420,000 distinct web sites. My immediate response was: Yeah, so? In the context of the story it would seem that countless passwords are now known to this criminal group, and we should be panicking and changing all of our passwords. But wait a minute. Hold Security, the company that found this hack, may have a commercial interest in this reaction. Hold Security offers to tell companies if their usernames and passwords were compromised for the princely sum of $120. Arguably, Hold Security stood to make more money out of this story than the Russian hackers themselves. Rather than go down the rabbit hole, let's focus on what this really means and how we should react. While 1.2 billion is a big number, it appears that many of these credentials could have been obtained from previous large-scale breaches such as Adobe, Sony, LinkedIn, RockYou.com and eBay. The totals from these sites alone adds up to close to half a billion. We can also assume that many of the 420,000 hacked websites were Mom and Pop blogs, forums and other places where people often consider using a ""throwaway"" password. The concept is that things like your email, social media and bank require secure, unique passwords. But all the other junk in our lives can just use a simple, less secure password. The criminals don't have the passwords in most cases. They have cryptographic representations of the passwords known as hashes. These hashes come in a lot of varieties with varying degrees of security associated with them. The purpose of a hash is to slow down an attacker from being able to acquire your password if a password database is stolen. This hashing is most effective if you follow good security practices, like not using dictionary words, and making sure to include numbers and symbols in your password. People in general are bad at choosing passwords. That means hashing is often only a speedbump for a determined attacker. But the hashes bring out the truth of the matter. The criminals don't necessarily even have your password. They have a hash that could result in them discovering your password, especially if it is poorly chosen like password123 or qwrtyasdfg. Many of these stolen hashes may have been obtained some time ago, which means they are less useful to the crooks now. Of course, we don't know the truth and can't analyze what is known because Hold Security is trying to figure out how to monetize the knowledge, leaving even the experts a bit in the dark about how serious a discovery this truly is. My advice? Keep calm and carry on. It is always a good practice to use strong passwords and different passwords on the different sites we use and change them if we have reason to believe they might be compromised. There are many tools available to assist with automating this task, making it only a minor inconvenience to keep track of your new stronger passwords. Many are available at no cost. And if we have learned anything during our first 20 years of web surfing, it's that we need a helping hand with our passwords. Hold Security's findings are interesting. If the research community gains access to the information we will all jump in with both feet to determine how it happened, what it means for Internet security going forward and possibly even who is behind the attacks. But for the rest of the world? It's business as usual. Think before you click, do your best to follow best practices with regard to your privacy and safety and enjoy your online experience. It's not as scary as it looks.","New York Times says 1.2 billion usernames and passwords were hacked by Russians .

"(CNN) -- A battle of former World No.1's in Tokyo saw Ana Ivanovic continue her 2014 renaissance with a fourth title of the year as she beat Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki in the final Sunday. It's been a fine year too for Wozniacki, capped by a runner-up spot to Serena Williams in the U.S.Open, but she proved second best to her Serbian opponent, who won 6-2 7-6 in the final of the WTA Pan Pacific Open. It stretched Ivanovic's career tally over Wozniacki to five wins against two, the victory wrapped up in 99 minutes. ""It was a really good battle out there -- there were some very tough moments, especially in the second set,"" Ivanovic told the official WTA website. ""But I just tried to take it one point at a time, and I'm really happy to make it through. It's just an amazing feeling to win this title."" Having taken the opener with three breaks of service, Ivanovic had trailed 3-1 early in the second, but fought back to level at 4-4. It eventually went to a tiebreak, won 7-2 by Ivanovic, who wrapped up the title and the near $200,000 first prize with a forehand down the line, . ""I tried to serve and return well. I tried to play the first couple of balls out wide so she has to run for it,"" was the verdict of the beaten Wozniacki. ""Ana was playing very aggressively."" While Ivanovic and Wozniacki have gone some way to booking their place in the end of season WTA Tour finals in Singapore, another former world number one, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, has called quits on her season. Azarenka, who started the year second-ranked behind Serena Williams, has been plagued by a foot injury and has decided to withdraw from the remainder of this year's tournaments to help her recovery. Azarenka has slipped to number 26 in the rankings after missing a string of tournaments, including the big money event in Wuhan, China which started Sunday. Seven-time grand slam champion Venus Williams was an early casualty at the tournament, going down in three sets to rising young French player Caroline Garcia. Garcia won a third set tiebreaker 8-6 after the initial two sets had been shared, her victory taking more than two-and-a-half hours, in a tie-break which finished 8/6. She will now face Polish fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska in the second round. Williams, 34, has also shown improved form this season and arrived in China after losing in the Quebec City final to Croatia's Mirjana Lucic-Baroni last Sunday.","Ana Ivanovic beats Caroline Wozniacki in Tokyo final .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Most Americans know of the Zapruder film of the JFK assassination -- the one and only visual recording of the killing of an American president. Less known is another controversial recording -- this one an audio tape -- of the other Kennedy assassination, that of the president's younger brother. It is the one and only sound tape of the RFK murder in 1968. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was fatally shot in a Los Angeles hotel while making his own bid for the White House five years after President John F. Kennedy's murder. That long-forgotten sound recording -- uncovered by a CNN International senior writer and highlighted on CNN BackStory in 2009 -- is now at the heart of an ongoing court effort by convicted RFK assassin Sirhan Sirhan to win a new trial or freedom. In their first in-depth court filing, prosecutors this month addressed the existence of the tape and a controversial analysis of it by an audio expert: the sounds of 13 shots can be counted on the tape, even though there were only eight bullets in Sirhan's sole gun, which he had no opportunity to reload. So, was there a second gunman involved in RFK's assassination? Just as the Zapruder film raised questions in some theorists' minds about whether a second gunman was involved in JFK's death, the audio tape is being used as evidence in Sirhan's new legal effort to assert a second assassin was involved in RFK's murder. In documents filed this month in federal court, California Attorney General Kamala Harris acknowledged the existence of the recording of the RFK shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski, who was covering Kennedy's presidential campaign and was about 40 feet away from the hotel kitchen pantry shooting. Acoustic expert Philip Van Praag, featured in the CNN BackStory program, said his analysis of the tape concluded that at least 13 shots were fired. That meant a second gun had to be involved, according to his analysis. In her overall legal argument, Harris dismissed the second-gun assertion, citing ""debunking"" evidence. But California's top prosecutor was finally forced to engage the second-gun analysis, and that legal development marked a new chapter in one of America's great political tragedies -- RFK's death -- and the case of the man convicted of his assassination, according to Sirhan's attorneys. RFK assassin faces parole board . Prosecutors' engagement of the second-gun argument was stated clearly in court papers, when the California attorney general said about Sirhan's petition: ""Petitioner at most has shown that, according to Van Praag, two guns could be heard firing 13 shots in an audiotape of the shooting."" At another point, Harris stated: ""The mere possibility that more than one firearm was discharged during the assassination does not dismantle the prosecution's case."" Convicted RFK assassin denied parole . William F. Pepper, a New York attorney now representing Sirhan, said this month's court filing raised public ""recognition"" of a second gunman now being advanced by Sirhan and his attorneys. Mindful of a nation's pain surrounding the Kennedy assassinations, Pepper is careful to note he was a political supporter of RFK in the 1960s. He adds that in 1999, he represented Rev. Martin Luther King's family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning King's April 4, 1968, murder and successfully persuaded a Memphis, Tennessee, jury to find Lloyd Jowers responsible as an accomplice in the King assassination. Pepper believes Sirhan was hypno-programmed to be a diversion gunman for the real assassin in RFK's murder. ""What is of interest is that there now seems to be more recognition of the fact that there was a second shooter, well positioned to put three bullets into the Senator from close powder burn range behind him, whilst Sirhan was always some distance in front of him,"" Pepper said in an e-mail to CNN. Sirhan's insistence on the presence of a second gunman is highly controversial -- and it is questioned by some, such as legal expert Robert Shapiro, the defense attorney who gained prominence for successfully defending O.J. Simpson in the 1990s. Sirhan seeks prison release . In fact, when Shapiro was in his last year of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles in 1968, he was at the Ambassador Hotel where RFK was shot. Shapiro had just heard Kennedy's speech after winning the California primary for the Democratic presidential nomination, but Shapiro said he was in a room next to the pantry where Kennedy was fatally wounded and Shapiro only heard, not saw, the gunfire, he said. ""So let's say that there was a second gun. Does that relieve him of any responsibility?"" Shapiro said of Sirhan. ""Even if there is a second, third or fourth gun, it's irrelevant to his claim that he's not responsible."" Shapiro remembers the night of RFK's assassination as ""horrifying and one that you'll never forget."" ""That's like 44 years ago. Unbelievable. I remember it vividly,"" Shapiro said. ""I think about it now when I go by there and see a school being built there,"" on the site of the old Ambassador Hotel. ""It's interesting, but conspiracy theories will come out on every single case imaginable,"" he added. Shapiro isn't a party in the latest court action. In rebutting Sirhan's contentions, Harris criticizes the method of analysis used by the acoustic expert. ""As reflected in Van Praag's declaration, his conclusions depend on numerous assumptions he made in recreating the shooting, such as the location of Pruszynski's recorder, the make and model of the 'second' gun, the location of this second gun during the shooting, and the number of shots fired by petitioner before he was grabbed by others,"" Harris wrote in court papers. Prosecutors rebut jailed RFK assassin's claims in freedom quest . ""Moreover, Van Praag's tests necessarily involved his own personal interpretation of whether impulse sounds in the recording were actually gunshots. In turn, there is no dispute herein that Van Praag's interpretation or opinion about the number of shots and firearms is not universally accepted by acoustics experts and that the opinions of qualified experts are available to rebut or challenge Van Praag's controversial opinions,"" Harris said. Harris further stated that even if it could be proven ""that a second gunman successfully shot Senator Kennedy, (Sirhan) would still be guilty of the charged crimes"" under California law. Countering that, Sirhan's defense argues he was hypno-programmed to be the diversion, and that is based on a psychological examination by Daniel Brown, an associate clinical professor in psychology at Harvard Medical School who has interviewed Sirhan for 60 hours over three years, Pepper said. ""The inescapable conclusion was that Sirhan was subject to hypno-programming which involved the use of drugs and hypnosis,"" Pepper said in an e-mail. ""Consequently, he was not in control of his actions on that night and cannot be legally responsible for them. ""I mention, as well, that Dan Brown's conclusion was precisely the same as that of Dr. (Edward) Simson-Kallas, who extensively examined and worked with Sirhan when he was in prison right after the trial,"" Pepper said. Simson-Kallas was a prison psychologist, according to court papers. ""That these techniques were developed and used by the CIA over a 50-year period was also well documented, in our brief, by Professor Alan Scheflin, the leading expert on these practices,"" Pepper wrote to CNN. Scheflin, of the Santa Clara University School of Law, is an expert in the field of mind and behavior control. Because Sirhan was under the mind control of conspirators, he wasn't legally responsible for his actions, and he should be freed or given a new trial, his attorneys contend. The attorney general, however, said the psychological evaluation of Sirhan is undermined by a failure to provide ""any concrete evidence ... about when, where and how (Sirhan) was programmed, about the identity of the 'malevolent hypnotist,' or about how the hypnotist happened to find (Sirhan) as his or her ideal subject for mind control. ""Without any independent evidence that (Sirhan) was actually hypno-programmed against his will to write about his intention to kill Senator Kennedy, to plan the murder, and to shoot Senator Kennedy on June 5, 1968, Brown's opinions about the possibility of mind control are insufficient evidence of actual innocence,"" Harris wrote. Sirhan and his legal team have until February 22 to file in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles their response to the attorney general, Pepper said.

"(CNN) -- Johnny Pesky, beloved member of the Red Sox Hall of fame who spent 61 years with the renowned baseball club, died Monday at the age of 92, the Boston franchise said. Pesky's No. 6 is one of only eight uniform numbers retired by the club. Red Sox president and CEO Larry Lucchino described him as the ""grandfather of the Red Sox."" Pesky signed with the Red Sox in 1940. The shortstop played his first year in the major leagues in 1942 smashing 29 doubles and was second in the American League with a .331 batting average. The next year, Pesky left to go fight in World War II. He was away at war until 1946. He did not miss a beat, coming back in 1946 to hit 43 doubles and batting .335. Pesky was not much of a slugger only hitting 17 home runs in his entire career. But still, the right field foul pole at Boston's Fenway Park is referred to as the Pesky Pole because of his habit of crushing the ball down the line and hooking it around the foul pole. In 1952, Pesky was traded to the Detroit Tigers, but he quickly found his way back to his Red Sox. After ending his playing career two years later, Pesky went back and served as a coach, manager, announcer and ambassador during his 61 years with the Red Sox. He was inducted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame in its inaugural 1995 class. ""The national pastime has lost one of its greatest ambassadors today. Johnny Pesky, who led a great American life, was an embodiment of loyalty and goodwill for the Boston Red Sox and all of Major League Baseball,"" said Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. John Henry, Red Sox owner, expressed his sadness upon hearing the news: ""We have lost a dear and beloved friend.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two Israeli soldiers were convicted of ordering a 9-year-old boy to open bags they thought might be booby-trapped during Israel's incursion into Gaza nearly two years ago. The three-judge military panel said the soldiers knew that endangering civilians is strictly forbidden by military law, according to legal papers obtained by CNN. They have not been named or sentenced yet. Israeli military and criminal investigators have conducted dozens of probes into actions of Israeli troops during the incursion, known as Operation Cast Lead, which was intended to halt the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel. More than 1,400 Palestinians died in Israel's incursion, according to officials in Gaza. The Israeli military said 1,166 people were killed, 60 percent of whom were ""terror operatives."" A 575-page report approved by the U.N. Council for Human Rights in 2009 -- accused both Israel and Hamas of ""actions amounting to war crimes, possibly crimes against humanity"" during the three-week offensive that ended in January 2009. Earlier this year, the Israeli military disciplined two officers -- a brigadier general and a colonel -- for allowing artillery shells to be fired into a populated area of Gaza. There was at least one earlier criminal conviction, of a soldier found guilty of stealing a credit card. Another Israeli soldier faces a manslaughter charge in the death of a Palestinian waving a white flag during a three-week incursion, the Israeli military said in July. The manslaughter charge was filed after an investigation into the shooting, the Israel Defense Forces said in a news release. ""This decision is based on evidence that the soldier, who was serving as a designated marksman, deliberately targeted an individual walking with a group of people waving a white flag without being ordered or authorized to do so,"" the IDF said. In another incident, a battalion commander authorized sending a Palestinian man into a house sheltering terrorists next to his own house in order to persuade them to leave, the news release said. The commander was indicted ""because he deviated from authorized and appropriate IDF behavior"" and ignored rules on the use of civilians in military operations, it said. The IDF statement in July also said a criminal investigation has been ordered into an incident in which a residence holding about 100 members of a family was struck from the air. In a separate case, an investigation into an assertion that the Ibrahim Al-Makadma mosque had been attacked concluded that that did not happen, but that an aerial strike near the mosque had occurred. ""The aerial strike targeted a terror operative involved in the launching of rockets toward Israel who was standing outside of the mosque,"" the news release said. ""Injuries caused to civilians inside were unintentional and caused by shrapnel that penetrated the mosque."" But the investigation concluded that the officer who ordered the attack had ""failed to exercise appropriate judgment"" and, as a result, will not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command. Legal measures were deemed unnecessary, however. ""The military advocate general decided that the attack did not violate international laws of warfare because the attack did not target the mosque, rather it targeted a terror operative, and when the attack was authorized, no possibility of harming civilians was identified,"" it said. Israeli investigators looked into more than 150 reports and conducted nearly 50 probes of incidents during Operation Cast Lead. But Palestinians said Israel's actions were unsatisfactory. ""I think Israel should take all responsibility for all the war crimes that it is responsible for during its unjustified war in Gaza, and what they just announced is too little too late,"" Palestinian spokesman Ghassan Khatib told CNN in July. CNN's Shira Medding in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","The soldiers ordered a 9-year-old boy to open a bag which might have been booby-trapped .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The apparent suicide of former government researcher Bruce Ivins is the latest development in the mystery of the anthrax attacks of 2001. Letters laced with the bacteria brought the disease into the forefront, sparking fear across America. Anthrax infetions result from bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax comes from a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis, and infection can come in one of three forms: cutaneous (also called skin), inhalation (lung), and gastrointestinal(digestive). It emerged in World War I as a biological weapon, but has been blamed for plagues throughout history that killed both humans and livestock.  How does a person become infected? You can get anthrax by handling products from infected animals, breathing in anthrax spores, and by eating undercooked meat from infected animals.   There are few cases of infected animals in the United States. Anthrax is found more frequently in animals in developing nations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why was it so scary in 2001? In the fall of 2001, anonymous letters laced with anthrax were sent to news agencies in Florida and New York, as well as to a congressional office building in Washington. Two postal workers died of inhalation anthrax as a result. An elderly woman from rural Connecticut, a Manhattan hospital worker from the Bronx, and an employee at a Florida tabloid magazine also died of the disease, possibly through cross-contamination.   A total of 22 people fell ill because of these attacks. Seven survivors had confirmed cutaneous anthrax disease, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Bioterrorism experts say anthrax is difficult to use effectively as a weapon on a large scale, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.   Still, a person can contract the disease in other ways, and it is important to recognize its different forms. What does the disease do? • In cutaneous anthrax, the most common form, about 95 percent of infections happen with the bacterial spore enters a skin cut or abrasion, according to the CDC. At first an itchy bump appears that resembles an insect bite, which then develops into a painless ulcer with a black center. About 20 percent of untreated cases result in death, but the disease is seldom fatal if treated with antibiotics. • Inhalation anthrax at first resembles a cold or flu, causing a sore throat, mild fever, muscle aches, fatigue and mild chest discomfort, according to MayoClinic.com. While these first symptoms may appear to subside, a high fever, breathing problems, and shock can follow, MayoClinic.com said.   This disease goes after the lymph nodes inside the chest. It may kill lung tissue and spread to the blood or brain, causing meningitis. Even with appropriate treatment, inhalation anthrax is usually fatal in about 75 percent of cases, MayoClinic.com said. Five of the 11 people infected with inhalation anthrax in the U.S. in 2001 died of the disease, in spite of antibiotics and other therapy, the CDC said. • Intestinal anthrax, which can come from eating contaminated meat, causes inflammation of the intestinal tract, the CDC said. An infected person may notice nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and fever at first, then later abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe diarrhea, the CDC said.   Other symptoms may include lesions and soreness in the throat, difficulty swallowing, and swelling in the neck and regional lymph glands. This kind of anthrax is fatal in 25 percent to 60 percent of cases, the CDC said. Treatment . Antibiotics such as penicillin can treat anthrax, and a patient should receive treatment as soon as possible. The disease can be fatal if left untreated.  Treatment takes about 60 days, since that is how long it may take anthrax spores to grow, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. How can you protect yourself? Avoid contact with livestock and animal products in countries where anthrax is common and herds aren't commonly vaccinated, the CDC says. Also try not to eat meat that has not been properly slaughtered and cooked. There is also a vaccine, reported to be 93 percent effective in protecting against anthrax, according to the CDC. The CDC recommends that certain people get vaccinated against anthrax. This includes people who work directly with the organism in a laboratory or work with imported animal hides or furs in areas with low standards to protect against exposure to anthrax spores. People who handle potentially infected animal products in countries with a high incidence of the disease, and work, and military personnel in areas with high risk of exposure to the bacteria, should also be immunized, the CDC said. A study published in 2003 showed that soap and water can be effective at eliminating bacteria spores similar to anthrax.","Anthrax can spread through infected animals, spores, and undercooked meat .

"London, England (CNN) -- A young boy sits in his bedroom staring up at the poster of Bruce Lee hanging on the wall. Like most kids in Kafanchan, a small town in the heart of Nigeria, he is a big fan of the martial arts supremo, frequenting the local cinema which almost exclusively shows Hong Kong karate movies or Bollywood films. Other times the young boy immerses himself in a world of literature reading work from acclaimed writers like Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka and Charles Dickens. And while outwardly he may still appear to be a child, the die has been cast. ""I knew I wanted to be a writer from when I was six,"" Biyi Bandele tells CNN. ""My dad took me to the local library, I was five or six and I just fell in love with the books."" Some three decades later and Bandele has become a celebrated novelist and playwright who most recently moved behind the camera to try his hand at directing. A task he seems well suited for after receiving critical acclaim for his directorial feature film debut, ""Half of a Yellow Sun,"" based on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's much-loved novel of the same name and starring Hollywood stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandie Newton. ""What really particularly attracted me to 'Half of a Yellow Sun' was that ... there were these characters -- middle, upper-middle-class characters, educated characters, Nigerian characters -- who I suppose had been seen in quite a few novels set in Africa, written by Africans, but they had never been seen in any movie set in Africa,"" says Bandele. ""I felt it was a great opportunity to bring these people to the big screen,"" he adds. ""I was really fed up of going to the cinema and watching a movie about Africa and all you saw were them as victims without any say over their own destiny,"" explains Bandele. ""They just seemed to live this passive existence but that was redeemed only by gifts from NGOs. ""I felt like I could do a better job than [others] had and so I decided that I had to take the plunge and direct."" From writer to director . Talented and ambitious, Bandele left Nigeria at 22 after studying drama at Obafemi Awolowo University with two novels he'd written in his luggage. ""I actually came [to London] because I'd been invited to a theater festival ... within weeks, I had a publisher, not just in the UK but in Italy and in France and in Germany,"" he recalls. ""Then I got offered a job to be the literary editor of a weekly Nigerian newspaper in London so I had actually come with absolutely no intention of staying."" Shortly after his arrival to the UK, his work was published and he received his first commission from the Royal Court Theatre where he was catapulted into arts. Just three years later -- his career flourishing in playhouses up and down the country -- Bandele wrote a screenplay which was picked up by the BBC, who attached a young up and coming director to it. His name was Danny Boyle. ""Working with Danny was a game changer,"" recalls Bandele. ""I wasn't that interested at the time in actually directing anything but I watched Danny ... it was a joy working with him,"" he adds. ""I then started directing theater because I think, subconsciously, I was preparing to get into film ... I kept thinking I can do this, I can do this better."" Behind the camera . It was Bandele's empathy for storytelling -- a trait he has held all his life -- that spurred him to take ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" and begin a six-year production process from adaptation to the big screen. Upon completion of his debut film, Bandele was approached by MTV's Staying Alive Foundation to direct ""Shuga,"" a popular TV series aimed at educating viewers on HIV/AIDS. Set in Lagos, the eight-part series follows a group of young people trying to live normal lives as HIV/AIDS becomes more prevalent in their world. Bandele says this was a project he simply couldn't say no to. ""Nigeria has, depending on which authorities you listen to, between 3.4 million and 4.3 million people suffering from HIV/AIDS,"" says the director. ""But when you go to Nigeria and talk to anyone about this epidemic, people will tell you, 'We don't have a problem' -- there's a culture of complete denial and I felt it was important for us to do the series to get people talking,"" he adds. ""We also knew from the TV-watching habits of Nigerians, the likelihood was that this 15-year-old kid was watching it and so was their parent and probably their grandparents ... you'd have several generations actually having this conversation and that's exactly what happened."" For Bandele, this is what it all comes down to -- telling stories that matter whether it is on stage or screen. ""I like telling stories but if telling stories actually has a positive effect on how people live their lives, the better."" READ THIS: How Mariah Carey transformed this woman's life .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities captured four suspects who allegedly participated in the ambush and killing of 12 federal police officers last week in southwestern Mexico, the state-run news agency Notimex said. Police present suspected drug dealer Jose Alberto Lopez Barron to the media Wednesday in Mexico City. The arrests follow a deployment of federal police that nearly quadrupled the number of forces in the state of Michoacan, which has recently been a flashpoint in the government's battle against drug trafficking. Among those arrested was Jose Alberto Lopez Barron, who had a handgun that was traced to one of the slain officers, federal police said at a news conference, Notimex reported. The other three alleged drug cartel members -- Gamaliel Rodriguez Granados, Evaristo Armas Bello and Jaime Rafael Navarro -- were captured aboard a taxi in a town in Michoacan, Notimex said. All are believed to have taken direct orders from the boss of the La Familia Michoacana cartel, a group that has become exceedingly violent in recent months, Notimex said. The 12 slain off-duty police officers were found on the side of a remote highway July 14. The killings were among a series of reprisals by La Familia after the federal police captured one of their top leaders, authorities said.","Four arrested in deaths of 12 federal officers last week in southwestern Mexico .

"BARCELONA, Spain (CNN) -- We traveled by metro to the Barcelona suburb of Santa Coloma de Gramenet, where the phrase over my dead body takes on a new meaning; it's the first town in Spain that has placed solar panels in its municipal cemetery and has been attracting global attention and causing local discussion. Santa Coloma de Gramenet cemetery: Where many rest in peace, some see renewable energy. We could quickly see why the town officials said there was not enough land to put the solar panels on the ground. The town is densely packed with tall apartment buildings for its population of 124,000 people, many of whom commute to work in nearby central Barcelona. From Santa Coloma's city hall plaza, we took a taxi to the cemetery situated on the town outskirts, and the driver provided the first indication that not everyone approves of solar panels in a final resting place. ""In Spanish culture there's a lot of respect for the dead. I don't think people will like this idea,"" said taxi driver Juan Nogales, whose grandmother and uncle are buried in the cemetery. He said he didn't even know about the cemetery solar panels, even though town officials had told us earlier that there had been a broad public information campaign to inform residents and solicit their opinions before the solar panels were even installed. The cemetery provided further evidence of the land crunch in town. Few people are actually buried in the ground here. Instead, like in the apartment buildings, the deceased are stacked up in tall mausoleums, rising to five levels. Many Spanish towns have similar cemeteries . And where were the solar panels? It's true that the solar panels are not easily visible from the ground in many parts of the cemetery, but from up the hill and looking down the photovoltaic panels become readily apparent. Perched atop the mausoleums is a veritable sea of solar panels, connected by cables that channel the electricity into a small transformer station at the top of cemetery hill, which connects to tall electrical towers nearby. We stopped at the tomb of Teresa Grinon, who died in 1985 and rests in the top row of a mausoleum. There are four other tombs directly below her, but directly above her is a large solar panel. Esteve Serret's family firm is in the cemetery management business. It has the contract to manage the Santa Coloma cemetery -- among others in Spain -- and the idea for the solar panels came from the firm. Serret, a cheerful man who speaks Spanish, English and Catalan said the aim was to put the solar panels discreetly in the cemetery. ""We think it's important for the cemetery to generate this clean energy, but it's so important to respect the use, the normal use, of the cemetery,"" Serret said. The cemetery florist, Francisca Hans, whose father and grandfather are buried here, perhaps had a bit of graveyard humor as she told us, with a smile. ""Nothing's going to happen to the dead once they're here if there are solar panels up above."" We also talked to Natividad Jimenez, a housewife who has two brothers buried in the cemetery. She approves of the solar panels, and said that's partly because another brother installs solar panels in Valencia. Santa Coloma's environment councilor, Begona Bellette, told us about the city's other solar initiatives, on the roofs of schools -- one of which we visited -- and at the library. The town proudly says the United Nations has recognized it in the fight against global warming. But the cemetery has many advantages over the other locations in town for solar panels, Bellette said. ""You have a large surface, with no chance of shadows on it that would reduce the energy production,"" Bellette said. The cemetery currently provides enough electricity to power 60 homes, Serret said. There are more solar panels planned for the cemetery, and Serret said a dozen other cities in Spain and Mexico have expressed interest in following their lead and are considering installing solar panels in their own cemeteries. Where many rest in peace, some see a renewable opportunity.","Solar cemetery in town just outside Barcelona the first of its kind in Spain .

"(CNN) -- Just how bad is the civil unrest associated with the Occupy protests in some U.S. cities? This bad: There is an online petition calling on California Gov. Jerry Brown to send the National Guard to protect Occupy Oakland protesters from the city's police department. In recent weeks, hundreds of protesters in Oakland have clashed with police officers in riot gear. In one tragic incident, a 24-year-old Iraq war veteran named Scott Olsen was critically injured when he was hit in the head by a teargas canister at close range. Even compared to the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and other protests around the country, what's happening in Oakland shocks the senses. Judging from video and firsthand accounts, the police in that city have been especially brutal in dealing with the protesters. Just two decades ago, in the 1990s, the favored law-enforcement approach was community policing: the idea that police were most effective when they were intertwined with the community. This is a throwback to an earlier time, when a cop walked a beat, knew the neighborhoods and made sure doors were locked after dark. Now, in some cases, instead of the police serving the community, it's more like the police are at war with the community. How did we get here, in Oakland and elsewhere? And how do we go back? I have a friend who thinks he knows what went wrong. He's a cop who has been on the force more than 25 years, having worked himself into the upper management ranks of a midsized police department near San Diego. I'm comfortable in that world. My father is a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job. I grew up around cops. And now, some of my good friends are cops. I often say that while I cover politicians for a living, I'd rather spend the day with police. Yet my relationship with the institution of law enforcement is also complicated. My upbringing doesn't prevent me from -- in the course of doing my job -- criticizing police officers or law enforcement agencies when they turn into bullies, betray the public trust or deny a suspect due process. I'm also highly critical of the tendency of some police officers to dabble in areas of law enforcement they don't understand, such as federal immigration law. The siege in Oakland, where police have repeatedly clashed with protesters, reminds us that there's one other thing that police officers shouldn't do: impersonate soldiers. That's what concerns my friend, who agreed to talk with me on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitive nature of the subject. Like many law enforcement officers, he was in the military. But after he was discharged he began a career in civilian law enforcement. He knows the difference between the job that he used to have and the one he has now. But, he fears, that may not be true for a lot of cops on patrol these days. The way my friend sees it, our police forces have become militarized. ""The mission hasn't changed,"" he said, ""And that's to make people feel safe in their communities. It's how we go about doing it that has changed."" These are miniature armies, stocked with every weapon imaginable -- all at the officer's disposal. ""You make adjustments here and there,"" he said, ""The next thing you know, there are machine guns in the squad cars."" You heard right. Machine guns. And not in a weapons locker back at the station house. In many cities, the machine guns are in the police cars, next to the standard issue shotgun. On the officer's belt: a Taser, .40 caliber handgun with 16 bullets in the clip and one in the chamber, a baton and mace. And that's for one officer. Multiply it out, and you'll get an idea of how much firepower is circulating out on the street. There is more on the way. Leaf through a police magazine these days and you'll see ads for automatic weapons, military equipment and the like -- all being pitched at police officers. Midsized and larger police departments have long had SWAT teams. But now, even patrol officers have access to more firepower than they used to. The must-have item this holiday season: an armored assault vehicle. That's right. A tank, which will be back at the station house if you need it. ""There's a sense among new recruits that police work is about soldiering,"" my friend lamented. ""And we don't discourage it. In fact, we encourage it -- when (in reality) about 90% of what we do is community relations."" He's right. Law enforcement isn't about kicking down doors. It's about building and maintaining relationships. Police officers have the power to either make their job simpler or more difficult. If they treat people well and build relations, people will cooperate. They'll have leads, witnesses and informants. But if they see the people they're supposed to ""protect and serve"" the way an occupying army sees the native population, they're going to encounter resistance, suspicion, defiance and other things that make their job harder. That's a recipe for chaos. Meanwhile, these mini-armies are always on the lookout for the next battle. And, as events in Oakland and around the country suggest, they usually find it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Occupy Oakland protests showed cops in violent clash with citizens .
He says increasingly cops everywhere trading community policing for more weapons .
He says officers in some cities have machine guns in cars, see job as soldiering .
Navarrette: Policing not about kicking down doors, it's about building relationships."
"(CNN) -- Andy Murray became the first British man to win a Grand Slam final since Fred Perry in 1936 after defeating Novak Djokovic in the final of the U.S. Open. The Scot even surrendered a two-set lead during a five-set thriller that lasted almost five hours, before he regained his focus to win 7-6 (12-10) 7-5 2-6 3-6 6-2 in swirling winds at Flushing Meadows. It proved to be fifth time lucky for the Olympic champion, who -- like his coach Ivan Lendl -- had lost his previous four Grand Slam finals. Murray will now replace the injured Rafael Nadal as world No.3 in the official men's rankings. 'Shocked' Williams wins U.S. Open final thriller . ""They were incredibly tricky conditions. It was really tough because Novak is really strong and fights all the way,"" said Murray after the final. ""I have always had tough matches with him. I don't know how I managed to come through in the end."" With his support team in New York swelled by fellow celebrity Scots, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and actor Sean Connery, the 25 year old singled out Lendl, a three-time U.S. Open champion, for praise. ""He was one of the greatest,"" Murray said. ""He has helped me through the tough times as have all of my team. It's the best feeling for me, I've had an unbelievable summer."" Murray put the bitter disappointment of losing this year's Wimbledon final against Roger Federer behind him by taking the Gold medal at the London Olympics at the Swiss star's expense -- a result many believed could be a turning point in the Dunblane-born star's Grand Slam fortunes. But it was never going to be easy on Monday night. After narrowly losing the first two sets, Djokovic proved why he was the 2011 champion in New York, as he battled back to take the third and fourth sets with apparent ease as far as the scoreboard was concerned -- but in reality both players fought tooth and nail for every single point. Though the momentum appeared to be with Djokovic, Murray refused to give up and summoned his earlier verve and aggression to put his visibly tiring opponent on the back foot once again. Not even a late pause for treatment on the Serb's cramping leg could prevent Murray from closing in on the prize British tennis has coveted for 76 years, much to the delight of the crowd inside the cavernous Arthur Ashe Stadium. When the final shot of the match -- a rasping forehand from Djokovic -- went long, Murray was left visibly stunned by his achievement. But he had finally overcome lingering doubts about his mental fortitude when it mattered most. Despite his own disappointment, Djokovic was quick to pay pay tribute to his great friend and rival. ""It wasn't to be and I want to congratulate Andy on a first Grand Slam. He deserves it,"" said the Serbian. ""I tried my best and I gave it my all. It was another tremendous match and I am proud to have been part of it. It went to the last moment.""","Andy Murray becomes the first British man to win a Grand Slam in 76 years .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces arrested 10 people in the attempt to kill teen activist Malala Yousafzai, the army said Friday. An outspoken supporter of a girl's right to an education in Pakistan, Malala was despised by Taliban militants who opposed her assertive initiative because they didn't want girls to go to school. In October 2012, an Islamist militant shot Malala, then 15, in the head as she was traveling home on a school bus. She survived after emergency surgery in Pakistan and further treatment in Birmingham, England. The attack left two others injured. Her bravery and determination generated support for her ordeal and knowledge about the plight of girls across the world who can't get a formal education. Authorities in Pakistan said the people involved in the attack were linked to the Pakistan Taliban and were taking orders from its leader, Mullah Fazlullah. The suspects were arrested in Swat, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said. Malala, now 17, was born in the Swat city of Mingora. Speaking at a press conference in Rawalpindi, Bajwa said that after an initial arrest ""we were able to track down the entire gang,"" known as Shura. All of them are residents of Malakand, also a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . An activist for years . Malala's activism began in the Swat region in 2009. Despite Taliban threats and pronouncements, she kept going to school and speaking out for education, and she wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC about her harrowing experiences. The Taliban came by on house raids, and she had to hide her books. She received national and international honors for her efforts. But, according to the Malala Fund website, ""her increased profile and strident criticism of the Taliban caused Taliban leaders to meet, and in 2012 they voted to kill her."" The Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the assault, said Malala was ""a symbol of the infidels and obscenity."" But the Malala Fund noted that other Muslim clerics in Pakistan ""issued a fatwa against the Taliban leaders and said there was no religious justification for shooting a schoolgirl."" The organization supports projects in Pakistan, Kenya, Jordan, and Nigeria. Malala at U.N.: The Taliban failed to silence us . Malala's appeal: 'Stop misusing the name of Islam' This summer, Malala visited Nigeria and appealed to Boko Haram militants in Nigeria to lay down their weapons and ""stop misusing the name of Islam."" Boko Haram, the name of which roughly translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the local Hausa language, is trying to impose Sharia law across Nigeria and especially opposes the education of women. She made the trip in support of an estimated 276 girls kidnapped in April by Boko Haram from their school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Malala was a favorite for the Nobel Peace Prize . CNN's Joe Sterling reported and wrote from Atlanta. Journalist Adeel Raja reported from Islamabad.","Malala Yousafzai is an outspoken advocate for the education of girls .

"(CNN) -- Shelling hit areas near two key cities in eastern Ukraine on Sunday morning, intensifying fears that a ceasefire that took effect less than two days ago may be falling apart. Why is the ceasefire under strain? A variety of fighting factions in the conflict zone -- on both sides -- may not fall directly under a military chain of command. The pro-Russian rebels are mostly volunteer militias; fighting against them on the Ukrainian side are at least some far-right nationalist militias. Controlling these groups is difficult and some may have different aims, including sabotaging the truce. At this point it's been nearly impossible to figure out who's doing the firing and why. The conditions of the ceasefire agreement don't help either. The conditions are vague and at this point there doesn't seem to be an effective mechanism in place inside the conflict zone to monitor and enforce the agreement. Why can't the two sides' leaders control their forces? It's unclear if Kiev has control over all of the fighting forces in eastern Ukraine. Some of the volunteer militias fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers are far-right nationalists who've been critical of the current government in Kiev, but they're still fighting because they feel Ukraine is under attack by Russia. And who controls the pro-Russian rebels? Is it the local commanders? Is it Russian President Vladimir Putin? None of that is clear. Which side has the most to gain from the truce? If the truce leads to good-faith negotiations and a compromise, then both sides can gain. A compromise could look like something like this: The pro-Russian region of Donbas gets autonomy and self-determination under a federalized Ukrainian government, and in return the rebels drop their demand for independence and Kiev gets to protect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. There are elements on both sides that don't want a compromise, and they could certainly have the potential of undermining the truce. What happens next? We wait to see if the overnight shellings and firings are an anomaly or if they're a sign of more violence and more fighting. If the ceasefire sticks, both sides have agreed to hold talks that will address the core issues and demands on both sides that are still unresolved -- including the disarming of the rebels, a guarantee of self-determination for the pro-Russian Donbas region, the fate of Russian-annexed Crimea, constitutional reform, and a solution to the humanitarian crisis in the conflict zone. Obviously if the fighting continues, all bets are off. What effect does this have on the rest of the world? What happens in the coming days will determine the next move by NATO and Western leaders. If the ceasefire falls apart, the West will likely turn up the pressure by following through with sanctions and bolstering Western forces in NATO's Baltic-member states. Moscow has already threatened to respond if that happens. The bottom line is, the conflict will escalate and so will the prospects of a regional conflict -- although at this point that seems unlikely.","Shelling in eastern Ukraine raises fears that a ceasefire may fall apart .

"(CNN) -- Formula One team Marussia has asked for ""patience and understanding"" regarding updates on the condition of their driver Jules Bianchi who underwent emergency brain surgery following a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. Bianchi suffered a ""severe head injury"" after coming off the track and colliding with a recovery vehicle that was removing Adrian Sutil's Sauber car. The German driver had come off the track at turn seven moments earlier. The 25-year-old Frenchman was taken by ambulance to hospital in nearby Yokkaichi where he remains in intensive care. ""With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect, and be guided by, the wishes of the Bianchi family. Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority,"" a statement on the F1 team's official website said. ""Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates, which will be communicated in conjunction with the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, where Jules is being treated, when they feel it is appropriate."" Marussia say they have received a ""huge outpouring of support and affection"" for the stricken driver. Sunday's grand prix, which was won by Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, was contested in treacherous conditions as heavy rain from Typhoon Phanfone swept across circuit. The race was eventually stopped on lap 46 of a scheduled 53, after Bianchi's crash, with the track shrouded in mist and rain. Messages of support from Bianchi's fellow drivers flooded in as news of his injury filtered through. ""Our first thoughts go to Jules,"" Hamilton tweeted. ""It overshadows everything when one of our colleagues is injured and we're praying for him."" Teammate Nico Rosberg, who finished second, echoed the Briton's sentiments. ""We are all hoping for some positive news,"" the German said. The Ferrari F1 team also tweeted messages of support -- Bianchi is part of the Italian racing marque's driver academy. Born in Nice, Bianchi is rated one of the most promising young drivers in the sport and recently claimed Marussia's first points in F1 with a ninth-place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix last May. Driver safety back in spotlight . The crash has raised fresh questions about driver safety in F1. Some have criticizing the FIA's (motorsport's governing body) race control for not deploying the safety car earlier after track conditions deteriorated. ""I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track,"" Williams' driver Felipe Massa told SkySports after the race. ""But they took a bit too long and it was dangerous. So we saw that there were some crashes at the end,"" the Brazilian added. Former F1 world champion Jacques Villeneuve believes it's time to reevaluate the protocol regarding the deployment of the safety car. ""The rules have to be changed concerning the safety car,"" Villeneuve told Autosport.com. ""When I was racing, and afterwards, I was always saying that any time there is an accident there should be a safety car. ""There should not be room for judgment. If someone has to go out to pick up a car stranded on the track, it's simple. Accident - safety car, and that's it. ""It should have been like that for years. America has had that forever,"" said Villeneuve, who was Indy Car World Series champion in 1995. The FIA told CNN that they are currently reviewing safety procedures and will release a statement in due course. Life-threatening crashes like Bianchi's are rare in modern F1. The sport hasn't experienced a driver fatality during a race weekend since 1994 when three-time world champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger both died at the wheel at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. Today cockpits are extremely robust and rigorously tested by the FIA. Robert Kubica's horrific crash at the Canadian Grand Prix in 2007 displayed just how resilient the monocoque structure the drivers sit in can be.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Suspected drug cartel leaders in Mexico don't often answer reporters' questions, although one did call a radio station a few days ago to offer the government a deal. Police escort suspected drug cartel leader Jose Alberto Lopez Barron on Wednesday in Mexico City. So it was rather unusual for Jose Alberto Lopez Barron to speak to journalists shouting at him during a police lineup Wednesday, opening up a new window on how his reputed cartel operates. Lopez Barron was arrested this week in connection with the torture and killings of 12 federal police agents in Michoacan state July 13. Mexican federal officials say Lopez Barron, also known as ""El Gordo,"" is one of the top leaders of La Familia Michoacana, a drug cartel blamed for a rash of violence that has left at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers dead since July 11. Speaking in a calm manner, Lopez Barron said that even if the cartel acted outside the law, it operates in an orderly manner and under rules that not only cartel members have to obey, but also residents in Arteaga, one of the cities the cartel controls. ""You can't go around shooting off guns,"" Lopez Barron said. ""You can't go around killing people, not only us but for the whole town. You can't speed in your vehicle. You can't traffick any kinds of drugs without telling us first."" Anyone who wants to sell drugs, he said, has to go through the Familia Michoacana. ""It has to be the company's merchandise,"" Lopez Barron said. ""He has someone there who I believe is in charge of distributing cocaine."" Cocaine can be sold retail, he said, but not methamphetamine, known as crystal or ice, since La Familia has prohibited it in the whole state. Lopez Barron said his direct boss was Servando Gomez, known as ""La Tuta."" Authorities said Gomez is La Familia Michoacana's top leader. Gomez went on a radio show recently to offer a truce with the federal government. Mexican President Felipe Calderon quickly answered that the government does not make pacts with criminal organizations. Lopez Barron said authorities have tried to capture Gomez but local residents have protected him. ""Elements from the federal investigations agency arrived in town -- I wouldn't know the exact number of agents -- and we had to leave town for the hills. We arrived at a small ranch called La Peña, and they gave us nourishment and refuge."" The suspect said municipal authorities respect the cartel and it respects the local police. He said that although the sale of drugs has diminished, the cartel has not stopped paying local police for protection. Lopez Barron was one of four suspects arrested this week in connection the slayings of the 12 federal agents in southwestern Mexico. Officials said he had a handgun that was traced to one of the slain officers. The other three suspects -- Gamaliel Rodriguez Granados, Evaristo Armas Bello and Jaime Rafael Navarro -- were captured inside a taxi in a town in Michoacan, officials said. The killings were among a series of reprisals by La Familia after the federal police captured one of their top leaders, authorities said.","Jose Alberto Lopez Barron arrested in connection with deaths of 12 police agents .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's new president-elect vowed to continue her predecessor's move to fight against inequality and promote human rights and fight poverty in her victory speech Sunday night. ""My mission is to eradicate poverty,"" Dilma Rousseff said after the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal declared her the winner in Sunday's runoff election. As the nation's first woman to hold the office, Rousseff said she has a mission to fight for more gender equality in Brazil. ""I hope the fathers and mothers of little girls will look at them and say yes, women can."" Rousseff -- President Luiz Inacio da Silva's right-hand woman -- has served as his chief of staff. Previously, as energy minister, she claims to have helped turn Brazil into one of the world's leading energy giants. A left-wing guerrilla fighter during the military dictatorship rule in the 1960s, Rousseff said during a congressional hearing that she was ""barbarically tortured"" after she was charged with subversion by the military regime. Her opponent, Jose Serra, also suffered persecution during Brazil's military rule and was forced into exile during the 1960s. A centrist politician, he served as health minister during Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government. He recently left his job as governor of Brazil's richest state, Sao Paulo, to run for presidency. Millions of voters lined up across Brazil's vast territory to vote in the heated runoff. In 60 Brazilian cities, voters used their thumbs instead of ballots on a newly launched biometric system, where voters scan their fingers to log in and vote. TSE officials said all regions, however remote, will have the ubiquitous electronic voting machine. In indigenous areas in the Amazon, these voting machines were delivered by boats and helicopters. It costs the state of Amazonas 5 million reais. (U.S. $3 million) to place the voting machines. One of the most challenging trajectories, officials said, is the one to Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, a densly-forested area in the Amazon. ""There, our electronic machines first leave Manaus by plane,"" said Pedro Batista, TSE Director for the Amazon. ""It's loaded onto a helicopter, and then travels by boat before being carried on some one's back for a long walk to a remote village,"" he said. In Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, voters faced heavy rains and threats of flooding.","NEW: ""My mission is to eradicate poverty,"" Rousseff says in victory speech .

"(CNN) -- Same-sex marriage has risen into the headlines again, as the U.S. Supreme Court mulls over whether or not it should weigh in on its constitutionality. But even Sen. Rand Paul, a likely contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has suggested that it should not be a matter of federal concern. ""It is a local issue and always has been,"" he told an interviewer in South Carolina this past week. The tide on this issue seems, quite rapidly, to have shifted. Even Christians -- who once stood uniformly against same-sex marriage -- have become more comfortable with the idea, and, one by one, mainstream churches have begun to reconsider it. One thinks back to those five little words Pope Francis uttered in 2013, spoken casually on a plane flight one evening when reporters asked about his attitude toward gays: ""Who am I to judge?"" These were astonishing words, with this Pope adopting a tone very different from that of his predecessor, who condemned homosexuality as an ""intrinsic moral evil."" Francis was, of course, only echoing the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:1: ""Judge not, that ye be not judged."" That's a powerful teaching, and the pontiff opened a door by his loving attitude, one that will not easily be closed. Change has been coming quickly, in fact. Only last June, one saw the powerful Presbyterian Church officially change its position on same-sex marriage. By a vote of 429-174, the elders of the church allowed clergy to marry gay couples in states where that is permissible by law. This vote cleared the way for same-sex marriages in some 10,000 churches in the United States. Of course, the Episcopal Church (to which I belong) has been open to gay marriage (and clergy, as well) for a long time. In 2003, it elected its first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson. This bold move created a schism, with a number of parishes leaving the main body of the American church. The worldwide Anglican Communion has indeed been roiled for more than a decade by the gay question, with many African parishes strongly in opposition to homosexuality. Yet even in Uganda, one of the most anti-gay of African nations, movement has occurred, as when in August that country's Supreme Court struck down a hideous law that sent gays to prison for life simply because of their sexual orientation. Only a week ago, former President Jimmy Carter -- a lifelong Baptist and Sunday school teacher -- spoke out for gay rights at a college in Michigan. ""I never knew of any word or action of Jesus Christ that discriminated against anyone,"" Carter said, provoking huge applause. He has, for some time, approved of civil ceremonies for gay people, although he maintains that each church has the right to make its own decision on same-sex marriage. ""I'm a Baptist,"" he said, ""and I believe that each congregation is autonomous and can govern its own affairs."" Where he stands personally, however, is not in doubt. Much of the opposition to homosexuality among Christians over the centuries can be traced to the letters of Paul, the apostle, who also had difficulties with women -- although I do believe that, in context, Paul's attitudes are more complex than many assume. It's important to remember, though, that he was raised an orthodox Jew, a Pharisee by training, and there was a strong prohibition against homosexual acts in many strains of Judaism, as in Leviticus 20:13. But Judaism is a religion of many voices -- a quick glance at the Talmud will make that obvious. Nobody gets the last word on any issue of note. So what did Jesus think about homosexuality -- or sexuality itself, for that matter? In Matthew 19, he offered his well-known teaching on marriage: ""Have you not read that the One who made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh'? Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.'"" This verse provided a basis for the traditional Christian bias against divorce -- a bias that has, necessarily, eased in the past century, when the facts on the ground simply demanded that a change in attitude occur. So many Christians were divorced that it became impossible to hold this line firmly. But it's important to see these words of Jesus about divorce in context, too, especially in the context of gays. In fact, Jesus went on to comment on his own teaching when questioned further: ""Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can."" (Matthew 19:11-12) Now that's complicated. So what is a eunuch? In Greek, the word is eunochos, and it occurs eight times in the Greek scriptures. The word usually refers to castrated men, but it has many meanings, and one of them is ""an ineffectual, powerless, or unmasculine man."" One recalls that Alexander the Great, in fact, had a male lover called Bagaos, who was described as a eunuch. So a eunuch was, in some instances, a gay man. If I read correctly what Jesus says about eunuchs who ""who have been so from birth,"" he may well refer to this sort of person. Certainly, there has been a lot of discussion of this topic among gay Christians. I myself believe that God has a loving eye for all of his creation and judges harshly only those who choose to judge -- and condemn -- others. As the poet William Blake put it beautifully: ""Everything that lives is holy."" The mainstream Christian churches seem to be moving in this direction, however slowly, and this is cause for celebration.","Jay Parini: Some religions comfortable with same-sex marriage; others still struggle .
He says Pope changed things for Catholics when he said of gays, ""Who am I to judge?""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the countries hard hit by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not able to cope, a health worker said, calling on the international community to step up support. Anja Wolz, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, spoke to CNN on Tuesday from an Ebola facility in Kailahun, Sierra Leone. ""I think that the government and the ministry of health here in Sierra Leone is not able to deal with this outbreak. We need much more help from international organizations -- as WHO, as CDC, as other organizations -- to come to support the government,"" Wolz said. ""Still we have unsafe burials; people who are doing the burial without disinfection of the body; still we have patients who are hiding themselves; still we have patients or contacts of patients who are running away because they are afraid."" Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are at the center of an Ebola outbreak that has already killed more than 800 people. The global concern over the spread of the virus has reached Saudi Arabia, where a man is in critical condition after recently returning from Sierra Leone. The 40-year-old man has symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever, the Saudi Health Ministry said Tuesday. The source of his infection is unknown, but Ebola cannot be ruled out, the ministry said. ""This is the biggest and most complex Ebola outbreak in history,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement. ""It will take many months, and it won't be easy, but Ebola can be stopped,"" he said. ""We know what needs to be done."" The virus has already been confirmed outside of the three main countries. A Nigerian doctor has been diagnosed with Ebola nearly three weeks after a Liberian-American man with Ebola died after traveling to Lagos, Nigerian officials said Monday. Nigerian Minister of Health Onyebuchi Chukwu told reporters that the infected physician had been treating Patrick Sawyer, a top government official in the Liberian Ministry of Finance who died of Ebola in a Nigerian hospital July 20. Eight other people are being quarantined and three are awaiting Ebola test results, the health minister said. Read more about Patrick Sawyer's death . Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports an outbreak of the virus in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria is believed to have infected 1,603 people and killed more than 887 this year, as of Friday. The United States is planning to send 50 health experts to West Africa to help contain the outbreak, which President Barack Obama addressed in remarks Tuesday, saying the citizens of the affected countries are in Americans' thoughts and prayers. Frieden said the 50 experts from the CDC will work to combat the outbreak and help implement stronger systems to fight the disease. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. An Ebola patient had not been treated within U.S. borders until last week, but the CDC has spearheaded efforts to prepare for the deadly virus. 5 reasons not to panic about Ebola in the U.S. It helped create an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital, which is being used to treat American doctor Kent Brantly, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was evacuated to the facility in Atlanta over the weekend. A second American patient, Nancy Writebol, arrived from Liberia on Tuesday. She will undergo treatment at the same unit. Emory is one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment. But in the nations hardest-hit and not as prepared, the reality is grim. Even in the best-case scenario, it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in West Africa, Frieden said. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. It has no cure. The most common treatment requires supporting organ functions and maintaining bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection. Ebola also claimed the life of a medical director at a hospital in Liberia's capital, Monrovia. Dr. Patrick Nshamdze tested positive Tuesday after being sick for two weeks. He died Saturday. In Sierra Leone, where government officials have asked citizens to stay away from work, the military has deployed at least 750 medical officials to 13 locations, military spokesman Col. Michael Samura said. Health officials are screening incoming and outgoing passengers at the country's main international airport with a device that takes people's temperature from their eyes at a distance. People showing signs of fever are quarantined and their blood is tested. On Tuesday, Liberia responded to British Airways' decision to suspend service to Monrovia because of the outbreak. ""The government of Liberia regrets that British Airways has suspended flights to and from Liberia until the end of August. However, we fully understand that international airlines must keep the safety of customers and crew as their highest priority,"" it said. ""We will continue to work around the clock with our international partners to ensure all our key international ports of entry are secure from any transfer of Ebola, both incoming or outgoing.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- In the largest settlement in the history of U.S. securities fraud cases, Enron shareholders and investors will split more than $7.2 billion from financial institutions accused of playing a role in the energy giant's downfall. About 1.5 million people will share the $7.2 billion Enron settlement, an attorney said. About 1.5 million people and entities are eligible to share in the distribution of the money, according to Dan Newman, a spokesman for the law firm that represented the lead plaintiffs. ""Investors will get an average of $6.79 per share of common stock and an average of $168.50 per share of preferred stock,"" Newman said. To be eligible for the settlement, investors and shareholders needed to have purchased Enron or Enron-related securities between September 9, 1997, and December 2, 2001. Texas-based Enron collapsed in 2001 after revelations of fraudulent accounting practices. Several former executives were convicted and sentenced to prison terms on charges relating to the accounting scheme. The fall of the company cost 4,000 employees their jobs and many of them their life savings, and the collapse led to billions of dollars of losses for investors. Newman said that the firm hopes to make a distribution by the end of the year. ""The order approving the plan of allocation is a big step toward that goal,"" he said. U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston, Texas, approved the plan Monday. Harmon also granted attorneys' fees in the amount of 9.52 percent of the recovery, or approximately $688 million, plus interest. ""We're pleased that the court recognizes the tremendous amount of work, skill and determination required to overcome significant obstacles in this complicated case and recover over $7 billion for defrauded investors,"" said the attorney for the lead plaintiffs, Patrick Coughlin of Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP. The settlement includes payments of $2.4 billion from CIBC, $2.2 billion from JPMorgan Chase and $2 billion from Citigroup, according to court documents. Smaller amounts come from Arthur Andersen, Lehman and Bank of America. The deal and the attorneys fees are the largest in history in a U.S. securities fraud case, according to court documents. The financial institutions were accused in the lawsuit of participating in fraudulent accounting practices leading to Enron's collapse.","Enron case is largest settlement awarded in U.S. securities fraud case .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- When the sun dips below the Rocky Mountains and the streets of Denver go dark, Lokki, his girlfriend Magic and their friend Tripp head home. They climb in between the rafters of a highway overpass, crouching as they sit under the concrete structure that rumbles with every car that crosses overhead. It is where they will sleep tonight. It is where they say they can live safely after escaping from abusive homes. ""It's pretty hard,"" says Magic, 18, when asked about living on the streets. ""But most of the time it's just life, you know. Life's not going to be easy."" She refuses to talk about what caused her to leave home. Her boyfriend Lokki has a different outlook: He says he enjoys the fun and freedom of life on the streets. ""I don't really have to worry about anything,"" says Lokki, 20. ""I get some food and kick back with the homies."" Out of the three friends, Tripp seems to be the most concerned about the future. He says he began living on the streets two years ago, after escaping a violent relationship with his stepfather. ""If I defended myself against him, I always got looked at badly,"" he said. ""So when I turned 18, I left."" He stops talking as he watches a homeless man walk by. ""I'd hate to think that's the way I'm going,"" says Tripp. ""That I'm going to end up being 40 years old and on the streets."" Getting off the streets is a daunting challenge for these young adults and others like them, who have no address, no job, very little education, and many times drug addictions and mental health issues. ""We see a lot of kids really since age of 7 or 8 [who] haven't had any real roots to call their own,"" according to Tom Manning, spokesman for Covenant House, which helps those who are young and homeless. ""Those are the 18-year-olds who [have] very limited education and really need to start from square one."" Manning, who has worked with homeless youths for 20 years, said a key goal is reaching these young adults before they ""disappear into the streets."" ""It sounds like a movie, but it's true: Pimps and traffickers, they spot these kids and go after them,"" Manning said. ""If we don't get to them, many will end up on drugs or in prison."" The youths can be helped, he said, if they can learn to establish healthy relationships with others. ""It's a trust issue: Most of these kids have been abused and taken advantage of by every adult they've met,"" Manning said. Trust is at the heart of the family that Lokki has created for a small group of his friends living on the streets of Denver. They call themselves ""Juggalos"" -- the name for fans of the rap group Insane Clown Posse. But now, the name has a  more important meaning. ""Juggalos started as a family for people who feel like they don't have family,"" Lokki explained. ""Other people see it as a gang, but we just look out for each other any way we can."" They mostly hang out, swimming in the Platte River or -- if they manage to panhandle a few dollars -- buying beer or marijuana. Most days, they eat lunch at Sox Place, which was set up in 2002 by Doyle ""Sox"" Robinson.  He got his street name after spending a year handing out clean socks to street kids. Every day, about 100 young people come by to eat lunch, use the computers, watch movies and also pick up a fresh pair of socks. ""They are just like any other kids out there, they have the same struggles, the same issues,"" Doyle said. ""They still want love, they want acceptance, they want protections, they want rules, they want to be held accountable."" Robinson said his goal is simply to provide a stable place where they can be loved for who they are. ""I don't try to change them,"" he said. ""If they want to change, we're here for them.  If they don't want to change, we're still going to love them."" Robinson, 55, says his Christian faith motivates him to help these kids, although he doesn't try to push religion on anyone at Sox Place.  He says he lies awake at night after hearing their stories of abuse and neglect. ""It shakes my faith in people,"" he said.  ""How can we allow this to happen in our own country?"" Read more about Robinson's perspective on faith . The Obama administration recently unveiled a plan to end homelessness in the United States over the next decade.  The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness will ""harness public and private resources to build on the innovations that have been demonstrated at the local level nationwide,"" according to council chairman Shaun Donavan. Robinson is skeptical about whether the government can adequately address the root causes of homelessness. ""We need less government and more grass roots,"" he said.  ""We need taxes not to go to renovating parks, but renovating lives."" All the government can really do is put a roof over someone's head, he said.  And that doesn't necessarily constitute a ""home."" ""They don't have a home, the sense of family,"" Robinson said.  ""All we're doing is pushing them to the sides, we're not dealing with the real issues."" Belle wandered into Sox Place one afternoon in June, a pretty young woman with an air of confidence that contrasts with the cuts across her cheek and the brace on her knee, injuries she said were inflicted by her pimp. ""People think it's a choice to be on the streets, but it's never a choice,"" said Belle, 18. She said she has been sexually abused since she was 6 years old and was in and out of foster care until recently. Now, she is living in a camp with other homeless kids, hiding from her pimp. ""Yeah, it's not a house, but a house isn't everything,"" she said.  ""Family. Love. Friends. This is my family. All I ever wanted was a family."" She wants to go to college to study psychology and help other street kids, but she knows the odds are against her. ""I don't have the building blocks to get up in life, to be able to do what I need to do, because I never learned it,"" she said.  ""I have to learn that on my own."" The odds were against Liz Martinez, who left home at age 12 and eventually became a member of the Juggalos. ""They were better than my own biological family,"" said Martinez, who is now 21. ""They didn't put their hands on me, they fed me, they kept me safe, they cared about how I felt."" After nearly a decade on the streets, she has just gotten her first apartment with her boyfriend and is looking forward to a more stable future for her 5-month-old daughter. ""I have almost $1,000 saved up from selling plasma and doing day labor, and hopefully in the next month and a half to three months, I'll have my GED,"" she said. Martinez has drawn strength from living on the streets, and she thinks others can do the same: . ""If you can survive off of living on the street and sleeping on cold concrete or behind a Dumpster when it's snowing, you know you have the strength to do just about anything.""","Hundreds of homeless teens and young adults live in Denver, Colorado .

"(CNN) -- The flare-up in gun violence igniting the streets of Chicago caught a 3-year-old boy in the cross fire early Saturday morning, local police said. The child is in critical condition. The boy was with his mother and another man, in the city's Brighton Park neighborhood, when the shooting occurred outside a home on South Sacramento Avenue, police told CNN Chicago affiliate WLS. The woman told investigators that three people -- two women and a man -- walked past them, and the man opened fire when they reached the end of the block. Medical personal rushed the toddler to Mt. Sinai Hospital with gunshot wounds in his right hip and stomach, hospital officials said. Police continue to investigate whether the shooting is gang-related. This latest episode comes less than 24 hours after a shooter sprayed bullets outside a convenience store on the city's West Side, killing 12-year-old Samuel Walker and wounding six others. Samuel had just finished a day at summer school Friday and stopped at the store, probably to buy a snack, when he was shot, his aunt Maribell Ruiz told CNN affiliate WLS. ""He was like a little man in the house,"" she said. ""He helped his mother. He helped everybody."" Top cop: Blame weak gun laws for Chicago violence . Witnesses said the gunman got out of a car and started shooting. Chicago police said the wounded included two 14-year-olds, two 15-year-olds and two men ages 21 and 25.

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Backgammon . Other than chess -- the history of which is well-covered elsewhere -- the most enduring table game of the last few centuries is backgammon, also known as ""tables"" early in its history. Backgammon itself is a descendant, at least in spirit if not in direct lineage, of the games of Senet and Ur. The missing link may be the Middle Eastern game Nard or Nardshir, with rules nearly identical to backgammon's and appearances in Babylonian and Persian literature between 300 and 850 A.D.; when the Arabs conquered Persia in the 6th century, the game spread throughout the Muslim world, moving up the Caucasus and into Central Asia as well as Spain, from which it headed further into Europe. Mental Floss: 5,000 years of boardgames (Part I) Willard Fiske, author of the misnamed Chess in Iceland (which includes histories of many table games beyond chess), argues for Nard as the connection between tables/backgammon and the table games of antiquity, while David Parlett identifies its entry into Europe as Table, later Tabula, by way of the Byzantine Empire and then Greece. Tabula first appears in literature through an epigram written by the Byzantine Emperor Zeno, who lamented a particularly unfortunate throw of the dice in verse that was reproduced several decades later by the Greek poet Agathias. An early variant of Tables, called Tick-Tack (derived from the game tric-trac, where the goal was achieving certain scores or positions rather than bearing off all of one's pieces), even earns mention in Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"", as Lucio says to Claudius in response to the latter's plea for Lucio to talk to Claudius' nunnery-bound sister: ""I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her."" The term ""backgammon"" itself first appears in 1645, spelled ""baggammon,"" in a letter that also referred to Irish, a simpler predecessor that didn't include doubles or the levels of winning found in the modern game. Mental Floss: 5,000 years of boardgames (Part II) 2. Othello . Popular today under the trademarked name Othello, the game previously called Reversi predates the Othello brand name by more than a half-century, but the name Reversi fell into the public domain several decades after its invention and publication. The inventor of Reversi remains in dispute; the original patent went to Briton Lewis Waterman in 1888, but he was later accused of theft by James Mollett, whose Annexation game purportedly dated to 1870. Othello differs from Reversi only in name, in starting placement (in Reversi the first four pieces go in the center, but not necessarily in the familiar diagonal pattern), and in origin myth, as Othello was ""invented"" in Japan in the 1960s by Goro Hasegawa. 3. Risk . Risk was first published in France in 1957 as La Conquete du Monde, or ""World Conquest,"" the name under which Parker Brothers first published it in the United States. The game was invented by Oscar- and Palme d'Or-winning film director Albert Lamorisse, who was also the author of the children's book ""The Red Balloon,"" adapted from his Academy Award-winning short film of that name. Game historian Bruce Whitehill has written that the choice of the Risk name reflected the first initials of the four grandchildren of the company salesman who suggested the name, although the story seems to be apocryphal. Mental Floss: Settlers of Catan: Monopoly Killer? 4. Diplomacy . Diplomacy, tabbed by one gamer friend of mine as ""Risk for grown-ups,"" was developed by Allan Calhamer in the early 1950s but was not published until 1959, when Calhamer decided to print it himself after existing game houses weren't interested. A favorite of John F. Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, and Walter Cronkite, the game has sold over 300,000 copies since its 1960 publication by Games Research, and the game has endured the vicissitudes of the game-publishing industry, going to 3M, Avalon Hill, and now Hasbro. Calhamer, a Harvard graduate, drifted through law school and a few other jobs before settling on a career as a postal worker. He never published another game. Mental Floss: Card Game World Domination: The Rise of 'Dominion' Part of the brilliance of Diplomacy is that it involves no luck whatsoever. Seven players (no more, no fewer) represent seven great powers in Europe at 1900. They must form and break alliances with each other to try to be the one player left at the end who controls the majority of the 34 spaces on the map of the continent. The game relies entirely on negotiations and player strategy, with numerous strategy guides abounding online, including an entire Wikipedia article on a popular opening sequence for Italy called the Lepanto opening. One of a handful of games (with Risk) in both the GAMES Magazine and Origin Awards Halls of Fame, Diplomacy is an excellent choice if you enjoy knife fights with your friends and holding grudges that last well beyond the final move. Mental Floss: The story behind settlers of Catan . 5. Checkers . The game known today as checkers or draughts likely traces back to Alquerque, a game that first appears in a 1283 treatise by Alfonso the Wise, summarizing the state of dice, table, and board games in that era. The ""de doze"" variety of Alquerque, where each player began with twelve pieces, was played on a five-by-five grid, with only the central space unoccupied at the opening. A player moves by sliding any piece horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to an adjacent, vacant space, or by jumping over an opponent's piece to a vacant space, thereby capturing the piece he jumped. The game could, and arguably should, end in a draw, as there is no luck involved and the second player can always simply counter the first's moves. Alquerque was found throughout southwestern Europe from Sicily to France to Catalonia. Alquerque itself was related to the games known collectively as ""merels,"" from the Latin merellus meaning a token or game piece. Parlett asserts that merels were viewed on par with chess and tables by the aristocracy of the Middle Ages, where the wealthy could afford the specially-designed boards required for these games, often owning two-sided boards to allow for the play of two of the three games. Merels were two-player games where each player is trying to line up three of his pieces in a row, a style of game largely fallen into disuse but recognizable in Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as ""noughts and crosses"" in the U.K.) and the 1970s staple Connect Four. 6. Scrabble . In 1938, architect Alfred M. Butts revised his own word-tile game, Lexiko, calling the new version Criss-Cross Words and -- stop me if you've heard this before -- found his idea rejected by the game-publishing establishment. (Among those rejecting it: Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, and Simon & Schuster.) When early demand proved more than he could handle while holding down a full-time government job and some freelance work as an architect, Butts sought a publisher, eventually selling the rights to James Brunot, executive director of the President's War Relief Council, in exchange for a royalty on future game sales; Brunot tweaked the board, retitled the game Scrabble, and lost money for three years before his fortunes turned. For reasons lost to history, sales started to increase radically in the summer of 1952, led by a large order from Macy's. From sales of just 1632 units in 1950 -- a drop of about 33 percent from 1949 -- Scrabble moved just under 3.8 million copies in 1954, by which point Brunot had licensed the game to Selchow & Righter. If you're interested in Scrabble, I highly recommend Stefan Fatsis' entertaining history of both the game and his own obsessive efforts in the world of competitive Scrabble players, Word Freak. Mental Floss: 10 words that will help you win at Scrabble . 7. Hex . One entire class of games that has largely disappeared since its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s is connection games -- largely abstract games where players would try to capture areas or block opponents' paths by connecting disparate points on a board of lines or pegs. The best-known example is Hex, invented independently in the 1940s by two mathematicians: Piet Hein of Denmark, and John Nash of the United States and ""A Beautiful Mind"" fame. (Parlett actually gets this one wrong, referring to Hein as ""a Princeton University student,"" conflating the two men.) First commercialized in 1952 by Parker Brothers, who gave it the name ""Hex,"" the underlying game is played on a board of variable size but equal length and width where the game spaces are hexagonal, thus each bordering six adjacent spaces. The players play at perpendicular angles to each other, and each player's goal is to connect from his side to the opposite side. Nash proved that the game is a determined game: There can be no tie or draw, as the only conclusion is when one player completes a path between two opposite sides of the board. 8. TwixT . TwixT, now out of print, was invented by Alex Randolph in 1962 and published by 3M as part of its ""bookshelf games"" series a decade later. TwixT's board is a 24×24 grid of holes, where each player places pegs to connect to his pegs already on the board. The only permitted placement mimics that of a chess player's knight -- two holes in one direction, then a 90-degree turn and shift of one more hole. The goal of TwixT, as in Hex, is to connect from one side to the other, but in TwixT the chain would be a series of pegs and connectors. TwixT, unlike Hex, is in GAMES Magazine's Hall of Fame, but is not commercially available, as the rights went to Hasbro when the company purchased legendary board game publisher Avalon Hill.

"(Mashable)  -- When Apple's alarm clock app failed, letting down a multitude of users on New Year's Day and January 2 due to the bug the company still hasn't fully explained, we started looking around for alternatives. Apple said yesterday that the failure of its clock app only happens when you set a one-time alarm, and it will somehow fix itself on January 3. We have made a call and sent an e-mail into Apple asking why this happened. Meanwhile, we were thinking it wouldn't hurt to look around for something that might be dependable 365 days a year. In this post, we mentioned one alarm clock app that costs $0.99 and gets the job done, but its design leaves much to be desired. What about free apps? Are there acceptable alternatives to Apple's clock that's included in every copy of its mobile operating system? And most importantly, do those other clocks suffer from the same alarm problem? We confirmed that the alarm failure problem in Apple's app is still happening today, when we set an alarm and nothing happened. We found five free alarm clock apps that don't have that problem. We picked these acceptable alternatives out of the hundreds of choices available, and they all were able to reliably sound an alarm today. Each one has certain limitations, but the impact of those deficiencies is lessened by the fact that these apps are all free. Nightstand Central Free . This ad-supported alarm clock reminds us of the Android operating system with its flip clock on top. We like its helpful weather report included just below the timepiece. It works when you have the phone sleeping and the screen is locked, but for that background alarm capability, you'll be limited to just four different sounds with the free version. Clock Pro Free . Another ad-supported app, this one can also multitask, so the app doesn't need to be running for its alarm to sound. We like the way it offers a choice of pleasant-looking analog clock faces in addition to the usual digital look. An unusual feature is its ability to display almanac information such as sunrise, sunset, the exact time of midday and even your latitude and longitude. Theme Clock Alarm . Swipe from side to side, and you're offered a choice of a dozen different clock styles. Some of them are stylish. Others, not so much. Surprisingly, this app is not ad-supported, and you can wake to vibrate-only alarms without sounds. What's the catch? Although you can lock your screen and put it in sleep mode, the app must be running for its alarm sounds to work. This one would work best in a dock overnight. Alarm Tunes Lite . Here's another ad-supported app that has fast app switching for background alarms. However, there's only a few choices for alarm sounds if you want to use that feature. If you're willing to leave it in a dock overnight and keep it running, it can wake you up to any song in your device's music collection. A slight limitation: Its orientation is vertical-only. iClock Free . At first glance, iClock Free seems surprisingly full-featured, but maybe that's because it's ad-supported. It automatically adjusts for landscape or portrait orientation, but although you can turn the alarm off for different days, it only allows you to set one alarm time in this free version. Still, it has a lot going for it, with its alarm sounds that work when you're not running the app, and for heavy sleepers, it offers a puzzle that you must solve before you can silence the alarm. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"London (CNN) -- A British man left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago lost his High Court battle Thursday to gain a legal right to end his life when he chooses. Tony Nicklinson's condition means it is impossible for him to take his own life -- and he wants the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution. Since he suffered the stroke in 2005, the former rugby player, now 58, has had to endure what is known as locked-in syndrome. ""This means that most of my body is paralyzed but my mind is as it was before the stroke. All I can move is my head, and the stroke took away my power of speech. Now I talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks,"" he told CNN in an interview in June. But while expressing sympathy for his situation, the High Court ruled Thursday that such a significant change to the law -- involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia -- would have to be decided by lawmakers. The judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering locked-in syndrome, named only as Martin. ""The Court recognised that the cases raise profoundly difficult ethical, social and legal issues, but it judged that any change to the law must be a matter for Parliament to decide,"" a statement from the court said. The ruling upset Nicklinson, who cried as his wife, Jane, told the waiting media that the family was ""bitterly disappointed"" and would file an appeal. In the meantime, her husband will have to continue living as he is, or starve himself to death, she said. In a statement given via his computer, Tony Nicklinson said: ""It's not the result I was hoping for but it isn't entirely unexpected. Judges, like politicians, are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgement is not an exception to the rule. ""I believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life -- me or the state."" His daughters, tweeting on his behalf Thursday, urged people to sign a petition via his Twitter account supporting his ""right to die with dignity."" Within hours, more than 2,200 people had added their name. Jane Nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to Switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die. She and their two daughters fully support his battle in the British courts, which has already lasted several years. Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the ""life and soul of the party,"" making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear. ""He was a big bloke, ex-rugby player, he worked hard but he played hard. He was full of life, great sense of humor, loved the sound of his own voice,"" she said. And she said she wanted the judges to understand ""the injustice of it all,"" as they considered his case. ""You or I could go out and take our lives at any time we want, whereas Tony, being the one who really needs that right, can't do this -- and he's only asking for what everyone else has got really, his right to take his own life, he wants that given back to him,"" she said. Before his stroke at age 51, the couple lived a comfortable life in the United Arab Emirates and traveled extensively. Tony Nicklinson was a senior manager with a Greek civil engineering contractor, a job he enjoyed, and was chairman of the local sports club. Although he does not necessarily want to end his life straight away, he is frustrated by the indignity and tedium of his current condition, which hasn't changed for seven years and which doctors say could continue for years. ""Some people have in the past spoken to me in the loud, slow and deliberate tones normally reserved for the deaf or daft. I am neither,"" he said. ""All too often, well-meaning able-bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide, he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice. ""I say that where a person has the mental ability, he should have the choice of his own life or death. The only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life."" Nicklinson has embraced Twitter as a way to communicate his views to the world and has more than 40,000 followers. He describes himself, with wry humor, as a ""Twitter novice with locked-in syndrome dribbling his way to an uncertain future."" But asked if social networking service had made a difference to his quality of life, he said he views it ""as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Life is too painful for too many reasons for Twitter to make a significant difference."" Nicklinson does not believe it unfair to ask doctors to end life, one of the arguments against a change in the law, saying it is not uncommon for doctors to make such decisions already in the course of their career. ""Doctors pledge to save life and to relieve suffering wherever possible. If it's necessary to end a patient's life to relieve someone's suffering, tough. Doctors can't pick and choose which bits they will do and which bits they won't -- they signed up for the whole package,"" he said. ""There is too much emphasis on saving life at all costs and not enough thought given by society to the quality of the life saved. I am not advocating that doctors make the life or death decision at the time but the patient should be given the option of assisted dying, if he requires help."" Lawyer Saimo Chahal, who is acting for Nicklinson, said ahead of Thursday's ruling that it would involve a ""very significant change in the law"" since there is no legal precedent in the United Kingdom. She said that Nicklinson would be devastated if the ruling went against him, but that he is a ""fighter"" who would want to carry on the legal battle against what he sees as discrimination on the grounds of disability. The Ministry of Justice had opposed a change in the law. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Laura Smith-Spark, Erin McLaughlin and Dominique Van Heerden contributed to this report.","NEW: Tony Nicklinson sets up a petition in support of his right-to-die case .

"(Sunset) -- By the time we arrive at Ceàgo Del Lago Winery, on the northwestern shore of Lake County's Clear Lake, we've seen far more birds than people. Western grebes, thousands of them, bob peacefully until our boat gets directly in front of them. Then they dive upside down like toy ducks, showing their black-and-white behinds before disappearing under the surface. Lake County, California, is a haven for water recreation. So when we pull up to Ceàgo, we're almost surprised to see a couple of bass fishermen casting right off the dock. People at last! ""Catch anything?"" my husband calls out. ""Nah,"" says one, without looking up. His friend chimes in, ""But at least it's a nice place to hang out."" And then, gesturing to Ceàgo: ""And the wine over there's pretty good too."" The scene sums up what's so nice about visiting Northern California's Lake County. Even with a burgeoning wine scene, Lake County is still first and foremost a haven of water recreation and summertime fun. If you're looking for the opposite of tony Napa, it doesn't get much more un-Napa than this. The fun center of the wine country . Two-and-a-half hours north of San Francisco and two hours northwest of Sacramento, Clear Lake has long been party central for college kids drawn here for water-skiing, boating and concerts at Konocti Harbor. Though that element certainly still exists, now there are also a few very sophisticated restaurants and hotels (the Blue Wing Saloon and the Tallman Hotel, most notably), as well as 10 or so worthwhile wineries. Among those is the only boat-in winery we've ever heard of. (Travel planner: Hotels, restaurants, wineries) It's a concept we can't resist. Roy Disney, of Disney's Boat Rentals, sets us up at the boat launch in Lakeport, instructing us to head east first to ""the Narrows,"" where the north arm of the lake connects to the south arm, before the lake gets choppy. He tells us how to use Mt. Konocti -- the once-active volcano that looms several thousand feet above the lake -- as a landmark, and invites us to call his cell phone if we lose our bearings. Though it's still morning, we're dying to check out Ceàgo -- we'll have just a sip, we rationalize. We head north toward the lake's western shore, passing Clear Lake State Park. We briefly consider stopping here for a hike (the park has boat access as well), but decide against it, figuring that today should be all about boat rides and decadence. A few miles northwest of the park, we glimpse the dock of Ceàgo, looking like an arm outstretched in a gesture of welcome. After we've chatted with the fishermen, we tie up the boat and walk up the dock into a Mediterranean-style garden that could easily be mistaken for one beside Italy's Lake Como. A lavender-lined path leads through gardens framed by olive trees. In front of us is a courtyard where a fountain burbles and festive music plays. People come and go in and out of a tasting room tucked into a series of hacienda-style buildings. The place feels more like a spa than a winery -- and in fact, it will eventually be both, Jim Fetzer tells us. Fetzer, whose family produced an annual 2.5 million cases of wines in the 1980s and '90s, discovered Lake County as a teenager, when his father used to take him on grape-buying trips. After the Fetzer family sold the company and the name, Jim bought a 163-acre piece of prime lakefront property in the then not-so-nice town of Nice (pronounced like the city in France) and set about creating the county's first resortlike destination. He plans to break ground on the spa as well as a restaurant in two to three years. ""Lake County could be the fun center of the wine country,"" Fetzer says, gesturing out to the lake, where a seaplane is floating, flanked by a group of teenagers sunning themselves on inner tubes. After calling out a welcome to the group -- which, it turns out, is celebrating a birthday out here on the lake -- Fetzer tells us about the seaplane access he's just created, and the ferry system he's working on putting in place. He talks about Lake County's clean air (the best in the state, he claims), the lack of fog, the tremendous birdlife. ""Being on the lake, making wine, it doesn't get much better,"" he says. On the way back to Lakeport, at Fetzer's urging, we stop at Rodman Slough, a wetlands preserve just a few miles west of Ceàgo. We kill the engine, and slowly, an Audubon scene comes to life before our eyes: A great blue heron stands stately in the tule reeds; a grebe dives for its prey. I say that I can't believe all the birdlife here. ""Why not?"" my husband replies. ""It's a pretty nice place to hang out.""  E-mail to a friend .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's oldest son, Prince, takes another step into the public eye this week with his first commercial endorsement. Prince Jackson, 14, revealed in an interview that while he can't sing or dance like his father, he wants to be a television and movie actor. He has previously said he wanted to be a director. While some Jackson fans may object, saying Prince Jackson is too young to be involved in an endorsement, the lawyer for grandmother Katherine Jackson said steps are being taken to ""make sure that going forward everything with the children is done by the book."" Prince isn't doing it for the money, but as a favor for his uncles, the four surviving original members of the Jackson 5 group that featured his father. None of the marketing materials for the jackets includes Prince's name or image, but he did join Jackie, Marlon and Tito Jackson recently when they autographed 1,000 replicas of Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" and ""Thriller"" leather jackets. Jermaine Jackson also signed the jackets, which go on sale Thursday through Amazon.com. The J5 Collection, which is based on the styles of the Jackson 5, will introduce Michael Jackson's style ""to a new generation,"" Prince Jackson told CNN. He might wear them to ""dress up parties,"" he said. ""It's not casual, but it's nice to wear to events."" Prince Jackson, who's about 5-foot-10, is showing signs of a young man who is ready to make his own mark on the world. Jackson's three children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- were famously sheltered from public view until their father's death on June 25th, 2009. It wasn't until the pop icon's memorial service that the world got a close look at them. Paris, now 13, spoke for her brothers then, saying her ""daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine."" Prince Jackson spoke up on the Grammys stage in February 2010 when he accepted his father's lifetime achievement award. ""To all his songs, his message was simple, love,"" then-12-year-old Prince said. ""We will continue to spread his message and help the world."" Since then, Prince talked briefly to Oprah Winfrey when she visited his home last year to interview grandparents Joe and Katherine Jackson. Prince also walked a red carpet and answered a few questions from reporters during a recent trip to Germany to accept an award to his father. He smiled broadly and appeared confident on stage at the tribute show to his father in Wales last month when he introduced Beyonce's song. Prince said he's hoping to travel with Jackie, Tito and Marlon Jackson when they perform shows in Japan next month. The plan is to have Prince introduce his uncles on stage, Marlon Jackson said. Perry Sanders, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, said Prince has indicated he is determined to make his own money, even though he will inherit many millions from his father's estate. Taking care to make the right decisions about what deals to accept and what to reject is crucial to protecting his brand as the eldest son of the King of Pop, he said. His uncles asked Prince to support the ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It"" jacket sales, a line that is authorized by the executors of the Michael Jackson estate. ""These limited quantity collector's items are exact replicas of the iconic originals and were created by the original designer of the jackets,"" according to a news release. Michael Jackson debuted the red ""Beat It"" and red and black ""Thriller"" jackets, designed by Marc Laurent, in 1983. The Jackson brothers signed 500 of each jacket, which will sell for $2,350.","Prince Jackson shows support for his uncles with jacket endorsement .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday signed the most sweeping overhaul of America's food safety system since 1938. The legislation gives the federal Food and Drug Administration the authority to impose new rules to prevent contamination and allows the agency to order, rather than simply suggest, the recall of tainted foods. It also authorizes the creation of a food tracking system to quickly pinpoint the source of outbreaks. The legislation requires producers to assess ways in which their products could be contaminated and to take steps to prevent such problems. It also requires importers to verify the safety of all foods they bring into the country. The result will be a fundamental shift in the FDA's approach to food safety from reacting to foodborne illness outbreaks to preventing contamination in the first place, agency Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telephone briefing on the bill Monday that the legislation will give the FDA power for the first tiime to require proven, science-based policies that will reduce contamination of food grown and produced both in the United States and abroad. Most food safety experts agree that the legislation will ultimately make breakfast, lunch and dinner safer for Americans. But the most immediate impact may be higher food prices, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. ""In the near term, we may see some of the cost of implementing this bill passed on to consumers,"" he said. That may be the most tangible aspect of the legislation for most people, Hedberg said. While the legislation will help improve safety practices, most of its work will be invisible to consumers, who likely will notice few changes in food packaging or retailing, Hedberg said. ""I think it will mostly be operating behind the scenes,"" Hedberg said. ""And if it stays behind the scenes, that may be a good thing."" Any impacts consumers might notice are likely to be felt no sooner than three years from now, Hedburg predicted, when FDA regulators finish writing rules required by the legislation and begin implementing them. And that is only if the FDA gets the money needed to implement the bill's many provisions from a divided Congress already set to argue over reducing the ballooning federal budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill's provision would increase net government spending on food safety by $1.4 billion over five years. Hamburg told reporters Monday that she is optimistic Congress will provide the necessary resources to implement the bill's key provisions. Here's what to eventually expect from the new bill: . -- Swifter food recalls. Under the bill, the FDA will have to give companies a chance to recall an unsafe food, but if they refuse to act, the agency will be allowed to issue a recall on its own. Most food producers work well with the FDA, eager to protect the public and their own brands, Hamburg told reporters Monday. But there have been some instances where regulators had to apply pressure from states or even the courts to get companies to agree to a recall, she said. The new power to issue direct recalls will eliminate those problems, she said. The legislation also makes it easier for regulators to stop potentially tainted foods from moving through distribution channels or even shut down a food processing facility that's the suspected source of contaminated food, according to the FDA. The agency will also be required to improve its ability to track food as it moves around the supply chain, making it easier to trace an outbreak back to its source. -- More information. The legislation requires the FDA to create a searchable database on its website naming each product under recall and the status of the recall. -- More food inspections. The bill requires the FDA to inspect high-risk food processing facilities at least once in the next five years and every three years after that. The FDA also is required to inspect 600 overseas facilities in the next year, and double the number of those inspections annually for the next five years. The legislation requires all imported foods to meet FDA food-safety standards. About 15 percent of the U.S. food supply, including 60 percent of fresh fruits and vegetables and 80 percent of seafood, is imported, according to the FDA. --Greater responsibility for food producers. The bill requires producers to evaluate hazards to their products posed by people, animals and the environment, create measures to prevent contamination and to develop written food safety plans. It also requires the FDA to develop scientific standards for producers to use in the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Advocates argued the legislation, pushed through in the waning days of a lame duck Congress in December, was much needed to protect the food supply against intentional tampering and reduce the incidence of foodborne illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated recently that one out of every six Americans gets sick from foodborne illnesses each year, and 3,000 die. Some consumer and food safety advocates have argued the legislation does not give the FDA enough enforcement authority, such as the ability to file criminal charges against procuders who knowingly distribute contaminated products. But most experts support the new legislation. ""Everyone who eats will benefit from this historic legislation,"" Michael Jacobson, executive director of Center for Science in the Public Interest, said in a statement following congressional approval of the legislation in December. ""FDA will have new tools to help ensure that America's food supply is safer, causing fewer illnesses and deaths."" The bill is widely considered to be the most significant overhaul in U.S. government oversight of the food supply since the 1938 passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. That legislation established authority for government inspection of food processing facilities and authorized standards for food quality, labeling and food additives. Among other things, It's also the law that gives most food colorings their name. Its approval was spurred by a 1937 crisis in which 107 people died from ingesting a medical ingredient, according to the FDA. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Tom Cohen and Saundra Young contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama signs the food safety bill .

"(CNN) -- A couple of Colorado women were recuperating after a moose attack northwest of Denver over the weekend.

""All of a sudden, I looked up and he was looking right at me and grunted and then charged,"" Jackqueline Boron told CNN affiliate KDVR. ""I tried to get up, and he kept coming back and stomping on me."" ""When I fell back he got me here,"" Boron said, pointing to her arm. ""Then, when I curled up forward, that's when he got me on the head."" The attack left Boron with staples in the back of her head, 15 stitches on her leg and four broken ribs, KDVR reported. Ellen Marie Divis was also stomped on by the moose, but was able to get away to find help. ""I heard 'help me, help me, help me,'"" neighbor Chris Hockley told KDVR. ""This lady comes running up to her house and she's covered in blood."" The sheriff's office issued a warning after the attack. ""If you encounter a moose: walk away from it -- DO NOT walk towards it; moose are agitated by dogs; make sure your dog is on a leash, control the dog(s) and walk away,"" the warning said.

"(CNN) -- When discussing his favorite images from the ""Greatest Photographs of the American West"" traveling photography exhibit, National Museum of Wildlife Art president James McNutt, who curated the exhibit, starts with the oldest: William Henry Jackson's ""Mountain of the Holy Cross."" Taken in Colorado on August 24, 1873, the photograph would become as legendary as the mountain itself -- not for the effort it took to get the picture, but for what it signified to a country healing from the Civil War and pushing ever westward. Hauling hundreds of pounds of photo equipment up to a vantage point on an opposite ridge to capture snow-filled crevasses that created a perfect vertical cross on the mountain face, Jackson produced an image that, according to McNutt's introduction in the exhibit's companion book, came to symbolize ""the union of America, Nature and God that fulfilled a romantic destiny."" Jackson's famous shot became one of the country's favorite photographs of the 19th century and effectively introduced photography in the West. It's just one of the thousands McNutt and his curatorial team of Rich Clarkson, Adam Harris and Kate Brainerd considered from the National Geographic archives when putting together a landmark exhibition that's currently on display at select museums around the country (see below). The final cut -- winnowed to 185 images for the show and 75 for the award-winning book -- shows the West's myriad faces thematically grouped into Legends, Encounters, Boundaries and Visions, corralling into categories an epic visual record of almost a century and a half of exploration of the American West with the camera. There are cowboys and debutantes, Northern spotted owls and bison, cityscapes and pueblos, mesas and dams, gathering storms and controlled burns. From early documentary efforts like Edward S. Curtis' celebrated North American Indian portraits to David Alan Harvey's contemporary impressions of modern Native life, from the pristine glories of awe-inspiring landscapes to the gritty exploitation of the region's resource wealth, McNutt's opus is both a loving gaze at the magnificence that attracts so many to the West, and an unblinking eye on the pressing challenges of keeping the romance alive.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- Sears Tower is history. As of Thursday, the iconic Chicago, Illinois, skyscraper is now named Willis Tower. It still looks the same, but Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, will have a new name: Willis Tower. At least that's what the owners of the 110-story skyscraper now call it after its new main tenant, the London, England-based insurance broker Willis Group Holdings. However, there are plenty of people who refuse to call it that. More than 90,000 people have joined the group ""People Against the Sears Tower Name Change,"" on the social networking Web site Facebook. ""This name change is absurd,"" one member wrote. ""Would Paris change the name of the Eiffel Tower? Or London change Buckingham Palace? Or New York, the Statue of Liberty? I believe the Illinois Congress needs to proclaim the Sears Tower a recognizable landmark that is known all over the world by people who have traveled to Chicago."" The group has gathered more than 34,000 signatures on an online petition against the name change. The name change seemed to be a fait accompli, though. A renaming ceremony was scheduled for Thursday with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. The skyscraper's Web site also features the new name.  Watch sky-high perspective of tower » . ""Having our name associated with Chicago's most iconic structure underscores our commitment to this great city, and recognizes Chicago's importance as a major financial hub and international business center,"" Willis CEO and Chairman Joseph J. Plumeri said in a news release. The landmark opened in 1973 with its original occupant, Sears Roebuck & Co. The retailing giant has since moved its headquarters to suburban Chicago. That doesn't matter to those against the name change. ""I asked a cabdriver to take me to the Willis tower. He said, 'Where the hell is that?'"" a member of the Facebook group wrote. ""That pretty much sums it up. No one will start calling it the Willis Tower.""","Chicago's Sears Tower renamed Willis Tower after London insurance broker .

"(CNN) -- As the U.S. partial government shutdown continues into almost a third week, the stakes are growing. Of upmost concern is not a lengthy closure of the federal bureaucracy, but that Washington could default on its debt around October 17, unless the debt limit is raised by Congress. The impact of default could be catastrophic, and not just economically. As Secretary of State John Kerry asserts, this would send a message ""of political silliness"" that we ""can't get our own act together"" so we need to ""get back on a track the world will respect."" In other words, the country's reputation as a responsible international power, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy, is being undermined. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, President Barack Obama cancelled his important week-long trip to Asia to try to secure a breakthrough. Internationally, the spectacle of what is perceived as Washington's growing political dysfunction in recent years is as bemusing as it is alarming. And, according to some data, this is a driver behind a decline in the country's international reputation. For instance, the 2012-2013 FutureBrand Country Index shows a continued fall in the international ranking of the United States compared to other nations. Based on a sample of about 3,600 people in 18 countries, it concludes that the country is ""in decline,"" partly because of ""successive fiscal crises."" This builds on earlier studies by the organization, including in 2011-12 which highlighted ""intensified speculation about America's long-term stability,"" partly as a result of the downgrade by Standard & Poor's of the country's credit rating. This was prompted by the last near debt default of Washington in 2011. These findings on the U.S.'s reputation are echoed by the 2013 BBC Country Rating Survey, which interviewed about 26,000 people in 25 countries, and also the 2013 Pew Global Study based on a sample of about 37,600 in 39 countries. The BBC poll recorded a fall in positive views towards America for a second consecutive year, while the Pew survey found that pro-U.S. sentiment is slipping, after a strong bounce following Obama's election in 2008. To be sure, the scale of reputational damage is not -- currently -- as serious as that which faced the country during the previous Bush administration. For much of that period, surveys indicated profound international concern with U.S. foreign and military policies. Indeed, the country's reputation had fallen to its lowest level since at least the Vietnam War. Then, as now, however, the country retains attractive qualities for many foreigners, including its popular culture and economic innovation. And the fact remains that, in times of major urgency, Washington can transcend partisan divisions and work in the national interest. This was demonstrated, for instance, during the 2008-9 financial crisis when Congress and the administration acted more swiftly and comprehensively than many other countries to counteract the worst economic turmoil since at least the 1930s. This has been key in enabling the country to recover more quickly from recession than some other areas of the world. While current problems should therefore be put into context, the situation is nonetheless troubling. And this is not the first time this year that a Washington political impasse has threatened negative economic repercussions. Only at the 11th hour did Congress in January agree a deal to prevent the U.S. falling off the ""fiscal cliff."" It is estimated that the automatic tax increases and spending cuts might well have taken the U.S. economy back into recession. At the core of the current troubles is not just growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans, but significant intra-party divisions too. This is especially so between moderate and right-wing Republicans (and the Tea Party faction). Thus, although House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, has pledged that Washington will not default, his efforts are being undercut by more conservative colleagues. He may therefore have to rely on Democratic votes to secure approval for raising the debt ceiling in the House. Political infighting looks likely to only intensify in the build-up to next year's congressional elections. This threatens key reforms on the horizon, including an immigration overhaul, which is of interest to many internationally. The perception, in many foreign capitals, is that growing partisanship is also infecting U.S. foreign policy. And, this is feeding angst over the reliability of Washington as an international partner, as has been vocalized in recent days by several countries, including China, Japan and Mexico. Already this month, Obama has lost the opportunity to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal as a result of the cancellation of his Asia trip. Meanwhile, U.S. trade officials were forced to postpone second-round negotiations with Brussels over the proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The gravity of this reputational issue for U.S. foreign relations was recently acknowledged by two former defence secretaries. Republican Donald Rumsfeld asserted that ""lack of leadership is sending a signal around the world that the United States is in decline, that that we're withdrawing, that we as a country are not going to behave in a rational manner."" Meanwhile, Democrat Leon Panetta bemoaned that by ""governing by crisis after crisis after crisis...the world will view the United States as less able to back its word with power."" Looking ahead this month, it remains most likely that a deal will be done before October 17 to raise the debt limit. And some scholars believe Obama has the constitutional power to raise the ceiling without congressional approval, a claim that the White House has so far rejected. With uncertainty growing, the only sure thing is that default would send seismic economic and political shockwaves across the globe. This would not just further undermine the U.S.'s reputation as a responsible international power, but potentially send it into freefall again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.","Impact of U.S. default would send out global economic and political shockwaves .

"(CNN) -- Three days after U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford revealed personal details about legal disputes with his ex-wife, the South Carolina Republican's scheduled court hearing Monday was postponed. A family court judge in Charleston, Daniel E Martin Jr., told reporters that the two parties will attempt to work out their issues through mediation, according to CNN affiliate WCSC-TV. Marie-Louise Ramsdale, an attorney for Sanford's former wife, Jenny Sanford, confirmed to CNN that the hearing was continued but declined to offer more details on the case. Sanford announced online Friday in a lengthy Facebook post that he was being summoned to court in what he described as ""yet another lawsuit"" from his ex-wife as part of a long-running custody battle. Also in the Facebook post, Sanford wrote that the complications had placed a strain on his relationship with his fiancÃ©e, Maria Belen Chapur, and the couple had called off their engagement. The two got engaged in 2012, a few years after Sanford -- then the governor of South Carolina -- publicly admitted he had been cheating on his wife with Chapur, who's from Argentina. Chapur said over the weekend she didn't know Sanford was going to share the break-up with the world through Facebook and found out about the post through media reports. The origin of the breakup was a disagreement over a wedding date, Chapur told The New York Times. She had wanted to wed sooner, but Sanford wanted to wait another two years until his youngest son would no longer be a minor and at the center of the custody fight. According to Sanford's Facebook post, Jenny Sanford's attorneys were asking the court to place more requirements on the congressman's visits with his youngest son -- criteria that included taking ""psychiatric and psychological evaluations."" ""Mrs. Sanford has always put their children first and will always stand up for the boys' best interests and safety,"" her attorney said in a statement. ""Mr. Sanford's Facebook post directly contradicts his filing in court on Friday (before he posted on Facebook) wherein he requested a gag order regarding this case for, as he stated, 'the protection of our sons,' "" she continued. ""Apparently, he only wants a gag order after he has publicly laid out his position and disparaged my client.""","Mark Sanford and his ex-wife will try to settle custody battle in mediation, report says .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Five militants were killed in the volatile eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk on Monday after they took part in a large coordinated assault on a border guard base, an official at the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service told CNN. Also Monday, the White House announced Vice President Joe Biden would lead a U.S. delegation to Ukraine to attend the inauguration of Petro Poroshenko as president on Saturday. The attacks in Luhansk began early Monday when least 100 militants tried to storm the border unit on the southern edge of the city, said Oleg Slobodyan, the spokesman for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service. The guards repulsed the first few attacks, but then the militants changed positions and began to shoot from inside nearby buildings where local people live, Slobodyan said, adding that the attackers weren't letting residents out of their homes. He said border guards were refraining from returning fire because they didn't want to cause civilian casualties. As of 9 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), an estimated 500 militants were still attacking the base, Slobodyan said. Fighters observed a roughly 20-minute truce in the afternoon for the removal of injured militants and border guards, the border service's website said. Five militants were killed and eight were wounded in the fighting, Slobodyan said. Eight border guards have also been wounded in the fighting, Slobodyan said. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the casualty numbers. Video from the scene shows at least one rocket landing on the edge of the compound. The separatist unrest that has gripped Ukraine in recent weeks has been centered in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine's military sent air support for the border guards Monday, but residents' proximity to the guards' base ""limits the full-scale use of the military aviation,"" said Vladislav Selezhnev, a spokesman for the Ukrainian government's Anti-Terrorist Operation. Still, the military was able to take out two mortar sites from the air, he said. Meanwhile, seven people were killed Monday by an explosion at the regional government building in Luhansk, health officials said. Journalist Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Vice President Biden to attend inauguration for new Ukrainian president .

"(CNN) -- Have you ever been caught in a shoot-out, dodging bullets as they scatter across walls? Or participated in a bank robbery in broad daylight? No need to duck. Modern-day fans of America's outlaws can safely step into one of the most famous gunfights in history and the first successful daylight robbery. Although famous outlaws John Dillinger and Jesse James aren't usually embraced for their violence, their exploits are a part of America's history. The birthplaces, graves and trails once traveled by these famous American criminals can be found all over the United States. Here are some of the best locations to relive the most well-known rogues of yesteryear. John Dillinger, Wisconsin and Arizona . American gangster John Dillinger, whose criminal run was featured in the 2009 Johnny Depp movie ""Public Enemies,"" robbed two dozen banks and four police stations during his Depression-era crime spree. With all the violent criminals running rampant at the time, Dillinger is probably the most infamous of all: His crimes inspired the FBI to develop their organized crime unit and made it a priority to catch Dillinger. Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, was the site of the famous 1934 Dillinger gang shootout with the FBI in which Dillinger, attempting to hide and evade law enforcement, narrowly escaped with his life. With hundreds of bullet holes in the windows and walls, it's preserved just as it was 80 years ago. The lodge is still open for dining, but with an updated menu. Another famous Dillinger site is Hotel Congress in Tucson, Arizona. Dillinger was arrested after a fire at the hotel, transferred to Indiana and escaped prison months before the Little Bohemia shootout. Jesse James, Missouri . Jesse James was one of the most prolific outlaws of the Wild West, believed to have robbed dozens of banks and trains. Although he lived and died in the state of Missouri, the James gang was responsible for major heists in many other states. After being pursued by law enforcement for nearly 20 years, ironically James was shot and killed by one of his fellow gang members for a $10,000 reward. The 2007 Brad Pitt movie ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" focuses on the outlaw's death and his relationship with Robert Ford, the friend who shot him in the back of the head. The Jesse James Farm and Museum in Kearney, Missouri, is the birthplace and childhood home of James, born in 1847. Visitors can tour the restored home and see where the adventure began. The town hosts an annual Jesse James festival in September. Liberty, Missouri's Jesse James Bank Museum is known as the site of the nation's first successful daylight peaceful bank robbery in 1866. Although the culprits were never caught, this robbery has been attributed to the James gang. In nearby St. Joseph is the Jesse James Home Museum, where James was killed. This museum holds artifacts of James' life and death, including the evidence from his 1995 exhumation that laid to rest the rumors that he wasn't really dead. Bonnie and Clyde, Texas and Louisiana . Immortalized in the 1967 movie ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow traveled the central United States and robbed banks during the Great Depression. In 1934, only a few years after their killing spree began, the couple was ambushed in Bienville Parish, Louisiana by Texas and Louisiana law enforcement who had been in pursuit. Caught off-guard, it's said they were shot to death in their car without ever returning fire. Bienville Parish, eight miles South of Gibsland, Louisiana, has a monument at the ambush site that tourists can visit. The cement marker is repeatedly vandalized and scavenged by souvenir hunters and has to be replaced often, but remains standing. Both natives of Dallas, numerous places from their past can be found in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The pair's gravesites and Parker's elementary school are just a few of the sites that can be visited. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Wyoming . To relive the adventures of the real-life Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, featured in the 1969 movie starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, head to Cody, Wyoming. The town holds Cassidy's home in Old Trail Town, Outlaw Cave and trails commonly traveled by his gang, and several others, for safe passage and places to hide out. Hole-in-the-Wall pass, in the Big Horn Mountains, once held the log cabin where Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang met. Located in a secluded area, lawmen couldn't approach without the gang knowing, keeping them safe. The cabin is preserved at the Old Trail Town Museum. Some 20 miles west of Kaycee is the Outlaw Cave Recreation Area, another spot where the gang used to hide out. The cave was well hidden and bordered Colorado, allowing for a quick exit from authorities and rival gangs. Al Capone, Pennsylvania and Illinois . Perhaps the most notorious of all American mobsters was Alphonse Capone, the infamous leader of the Chicago mafia during prohibition. The 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in which Capone's men lured and killed rival bootleggers, turned the mob boss into a household name, as the media went wild. Despite all the killings for which he was responsible, Capone was convicted of tax evasion in 1931 and served only seven years in prison. He died at his home in 1947, immortalized as one of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century. Robert De Niro played Al Capone in the 1987 box office hit ""The Untouchables,"" which recounted FBI agent Eliot Ness's fight to bring Capone to justice. Al Capone spent eight months at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's Eastern State Penitentiary in 1929. This was Capone's first prison sentence, for carrying a concealed and deadly weapon, and he spent his time in a cell on Park Avenue Block with fine furniture, a cabinet radio and other luxuries. Capone's grave is just outside Chicago at Mount Carmel Cemetery, with a stone monument and flat marker. It's not unusual for visitors to leave icons of his legendary status, such as cigars and bottles of alcohol. Billy the Kid, New Mexico . Billy the Kid only lived to be 21, dying in 1881, but it's believed he killed eight people in his short life. A frontier outlaw of the Wild West, Billy the Kid started his life of thievery and crime early, eventually joining the Regulators, a gang of lawmen-turned-outlaws. Paul Newman also took on the role as a young Billy the Kid in a 1958 movie that portrayed the outlaw as a misunderstood young man. In 1880, Billy the Kid was arrested for killing a Lincoln County sheriff and subsequently escaped jail after being sentenced to death. A year later, he was found and shot to death by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The Billy the Kid Museum in Fort Sumner opened in 1953 and is filled with over 60,000 relics of the Wild West, many of them historic. The adjoining state monument, Old Fort Sumner, was once a familiar haunt of Billy the Kid's. With plenty of friends nearby and no lawman within a day's travel, it was an ideal place to lie low. When strangers arrived, locals would alert ""The Kid,"" so he could disappear into the countryside until it was safe to return. Bugsy Siegel, Nevada . A vital part in developing the Las Vegas strip, Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1906 but became famous for his role in the development of the Las Vegas strip 40 years later. Before moving to Nevada, he spent years in New York and California as a bootlegger and ruthless killer. The 1991 Warren Beatty film ""Bugsy"" depicted the mobster's life in California and his rise to power in Las Vegas. A lifelong gambler, it was Siegel's dream to open a huge casino in the burgeoning Nevada desert, and with funding from the East Coast mob, he built the $6 million Flamingo Hotel in 1946. When Siegel's associate, Meyer Lansky, discovered the high cost was due to Siegel's theft and mismanagement, Siegel was gunned down in his Beverly Hills home only one year after the casino opened. Although Lansky was never officially linked to the crime, it's almost undoubtable that he ordered the hit. One of the first resorts to open on the strip, the Flamingo Hotel (the earliest incarnation of the modern hotel standing today) remains a popular destination in Las Vegas. A bronze plaque memorial remains at the hotel, set in front of the wedding chapel, making for some very distinctive wedding photos. The Crime Museum, Washington, D.C. If you don't have time to travel the country in search of outlaws, Washington's Crime Museum holds one of the country's largest collections of criminal artifacts. Visitors can see relics of some of the most famous outlaws and gangsters, such as John Dillinger's car and items from Al Capone's restaurant, Colosimo's. There are even galleries featuring the history of crime dating back to the Middle Ages.","Outlaw museums and landmarks can be found all over the country .

"(CNN) -- In the largely male-dominated world of the motorsport, South African super bike racer Janine Davies is an anomaly. ""They still can't seem to grasp the concept that 'hey listen, we are as good as you,"" laughs the 26-year-old Cape Town native. ""We're all there to achieve the same goal: Get to the checkered flag, and beat you."" So far, Davies' ambition has served her in good stead. She is currently the first South African woman to compete at the South African National Championships on a 1000 CC motorbike. That first taste . Despite her many accomplishments, Davies' introduction to bike riding wasn't smooth. She actually crashed in her first race at the Derby Development Series. But then, she'd only learned how to ride the week before. Still, she wasn't put off by the accident -- which fortunately only resulted in a few scrapes. ""It was actually hilarious because the first race went amazing. I loved it,"" she recalls. ""I came back to the pit and was like 'Oh my first crash, look at my scratches!'"" Davies was less fortunate in 2007, when she crashed into a tire wall during a race that nearly ended it all. ""It was my first race for the season and my mum was very nervous,"" recalls Davies. ""The tire wall is there for safety, but unfortunately I tried to protect my bike. So it was kind of like: tire wall, me, bike and I was just lying there."" The titanium woman . As a result of that accident, Davies fractured her neck, ribs, sternum and hand. When she was rushed to the intensive care unit, doctors also found blood in her lungs. She needed a lot of patching up. ""I've got titanium all over my body,"" she concedes. During that time, she admits she started to rethink her career. ""I said to my parents: 'No way, I don't want to go through this again,'"" she says. When her doctor came in to explain one of her surgeries, however, she found she couldn't focus on his words. ""Racing came on the TV, so I said to him, 'just wait, I want to watch this.'"" Despite the seriousness of her crash, Davies found her passion for the sport was too strong to let her quit. ""You forget about what you've gone through and you just kind of want to go back to it, especially when you haven't done what you want to do yet,"" she says. Helping the next generation of riders . Today, Davies is back on her super bike and soaring up the ranks. She's competing at the national level. This year, she debuted in the SuperM championship series, and won third place at the Phakisa Freeway in March. She is also trying to open the sport up to women. Her ambition is to one day manage a team that includes more speed-racing femmes. ""There are a lot of young women in racing at the moment at a regional level. I want to grow them,"" she admits.","Janine Davies is a superbike racer from Cape Town, South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Ever been to Gettysburg National Military Park in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania? How about the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood in St. Petersburg, Russia? If not, you're missing out on two of the world's top 10 landmarks, at least according to TripAdvisor, which on Tuesday released the results of its second Travelers' Choice Attractions Awards. Machu Picchu, the 15th-century Inca citadel located in Peru, tops the travel website's list of the world's top landmarks. The awards list the top landmarks, as well as the top parks, in the world and United States. There are also dedicated lists for Asia, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Mexico, South America, the South Pacific and UK. Stanley Park in Vancouver, Canada, is the world's top park, according to the website, followed by the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, which edged out Central Park in New York as the top park in the United States. The awards identify leading travel spots around the world ""based on the millions of valuable reviews and opinions from TripAdvisor travelers,"" said the travel website in a statement. ""Winners were determined using an algorithm that took into account the quantity and quality of reviews for landmark and park attractions worldwide, gathered over a 12-month period."" The world landmarks top 10 list includes numerous religious sites, including Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. (#2); the Great Cathedral and Mosque in Cordoba, Spain (#4); St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City (#5) and Bayon Temple at Siem Reap, Cambodia (#7). The U.S. landmarks list includes four sites that honor the country's soldiers and war dead -- Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania, the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Korean War Veterans Memorial, both in Washington, D.C. The list features a number of head-scratchers, not so much for what's included, but for what isn't. Portland Head Light lighthouse in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, for example, comes in at number 22 on the list of U.S. attractions, but there's no mention of New York's Statue of Liberty or Arizona's Grand Canyon (both operated by the National Parks Service) or even Seattle's Space Needle in the U.S. top 25. The Cloud Gate, a modern stainless steel public sculpture at Millennium Park referred to by locals as ""the Bean,"" is the only Chicago attraction to crack the U.S. top 25 -- none of Chicago's architectural classics, including the Willis (Sears) Tower, Wrigley Building and John Hancock Center appear in the top 25 U.S. landmarks. Likewise, Egypt's pyramids (or any site in Egypt for that matter) are nowhere to be found in the world's top 25 landmarks list. ""TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Attractions highlighted landmarks and parks as these are places people can visit as part of their trip to a destination,"" TripAdvisor spokesperson Erin Millard tells CNN. ""National and state parks are often destinations and trips in and of themselves. ""We defined landmark as a historically, architecturally or culturally significant attraction, and they are typically owned or run by a governmental or non-profit organization.

"(CNN) -- For the past 20 years, the copyright industry has waged a war against teenagers sharing culture and knowledge with each other. First, it was music (""home taping will kill music""), then games, then movies, then books. The copyright industry has tried to portray the teenagers and others who are thus sharing as if they were somehow being immoral. The problem with this depiction is that it resonates very poorly with the people doing the actual sharing -- to them, sharing a record or a game with a friend or a stranger is a good social act. Read related: How mobile tech affects the family . Thus, we have a severe disconnect in how different parts of society regard the activity of sharing culture and knowledge on the sidelines of the established distribution chains -- or in violation of copyright, if you like. As mobile devices develop, it becomes increasingly clear that this is a war that cannot be won. Today, our mobile devices can typically house some 16 to 64 gigs of data. Hard drives that can hold 60 terabytes have been announced and are just around the corner. As this storage capacity becomes affordable and even expected for one person to carry around, each and every person can hold a complete copy of all music ever produced. Read related: We never talk any more: The problem with text messaging . When connecting this phenomenon to mobile devices that can broadcast information anonymously, over technologies like Bluetooth and ad-hoc wi fi, it means that anybody can sit in a café and copy the entire collection of human music to anybody else in the café, completely without traceability: they wouldn't even know themselves whom they were copying to and from. Train and subway cars will form spontaneous clouds of connections that keep owners of mobile devices up-to-date with all music ever produced. Shortly thereafter, personal storage capacities will also be enough to house all movies ever produced. Regrettably, cellphones are a centralized, trackable technology -- they have been called ""governmental tracking devices that you can also use to make phone calls"", and rightly so -- the built-in trackability possibilities are something that goes far beyond what existed east of the former Iron Curtain. Read related: On second thought: Maybe smartphones make us 'SuperStupid'? But mobile phones can also connect directly to each other, without central trackability, logs or traces -- as long as they are within short range of one another. ""Short range"" usually means about 10 to 25 meters in practice. This kind of person-to-person distribution of digitizable material -- sometimes called a ""sneakernet"", as people use their feet to move data -- is not as effective in distributing information as the internet, but effective enough. It's how we shared primitive games on the early computers, before we had BBSes, and before we had the internet. It took about three days for a new game from its release somewhere in the world to reach everybody who wanted it. That's fast enough. So realizing that people cannot be stopped from sharing knowledge and culture, in violation of the distribution monopoly we know as copyright, because of the rapid development of mobile devices -- seeing that it cannot be stopped with any amount of applied violence, is there a flip side to this? It turns out that there is a rather strong flip side. For the first time in history, all of humanity -- at least everybody with an internet connection, which is increasingly fast becoming ""everybody"" -- can access all of humanity's collective knowledge and culture, as well as contribute freely to it. That is a huge leap ahead for us as a civilization. Read related: Handheld device that saves lives . It's not even a fantasy project with a ridiculous price tag to it, like the space elevator, vacuum-tube satellite launcher, or moon base. All the technology has already been developed, all the infrastructure has already been built, all the tools have already been rolled out. All that we have to do to achieve this leap of civilization is just to remove the ban on using the greatest library mankind has ever built.

"(CNN) -- By the end of the Super Bowl on Sunday night, one or more professional football players will be hailed for their valor, for their guts, for their devotion to their teammates. They will be called heroes. And more than 100 million people will be watching. But because, predictably, those laudatory words will be thrown around so casually on Sunday, perhaps we can take a few minutes here to address an act of genuine valor that happened exactly 70 years ago today. It wasn't televised. There were no sponsors. On February 3, 1943, an Army transport ship called the Dorchester, carrying American soldiers through the icy North Atlantic on their way to serve in World War II, was about 100 miles off the coast of Greenland in rough sea. More than 900 people were on board. Many of them were little more than boys -- young soldiers and sailors who had never been so far from home. The journey had been arduous already, with the men crammed into claustrophobic, all-but-airless sleeping quarters below deck, constantly ill from the violent lurching of the ship. In the blackness of night, a German submarine fired torpedoes at the Dorchester. One of the torpedoes hit the middle of the ship. There was pandemonium on board. The Dorchester swiftly began to sink. The soldiers and sailors, many of them wakened from sleep by the attack, searched desperately in the dark for life jackets and lifeboats and a route to safety. With them on the ship were four military chaplains, from four disparate religions. They were Father John Washington, born in Newark, New Jersey, who was Catholic; the Rev. Clark Poling, born in Columbus, Ohio, who was ordained in the Reformed Church in America; Rabbi Alexander Goode, born in Brooklyn, New York, who was Jewish; and the Rev. George Fox, born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, who was Methodist. In the chaos onboard, according to multiple accounts by survivors of the attack, the four men tried to calm the soldiers and sailors and lead them to evacuation points. The chaplains were doing what chaplains do: providing comfort and guidance and hope. ""I could hear men crying, pleading, praying,"" a soldier named William B. Bednar would later recall. ""I could also hear the chaplains preaching courage. Their voices were the only thing that kept me going."" With the Dorchester rapidly taking on water, there were not enough life jackets readily available for every man on the ship. So, when the life jackets ran out, the four chaplains removed their own, and handed them to soldiers who didn't have them. More than 600 men died that night in the frigid seas, but some 230 were rescued. And some of the survivors, in official accounts given to the Army, and in interviews after the war, reported what they saw as the ship went down: . Those four chaplains, men of different faiths but believing in the same God, their arms linked, standing on the deck together in prayer. They had willingly given up their futures, their lives, to try to help the men who had been placed by the Army in their care. The U.S. Army War College has in its records a narrative of what happened that night. One of the men who survived the sinking of the Dorchester, a Navy officer named John J. Mahoney, is quoted as recalling that before heading for the lifeboats, he hurried in the direction of his quarters. Rabbi Goode, seeing him, asked where he was going. Mahoney said he had forgotten his gloves, and wanted to retrieve them before being dropped into the cold sea. Rabbi Goode said that Mahoney should not waste fleeting time, and offered Mahoney his own gloves. When Mahoney said he couldn't deprive Rabbi Goode of his gloves, the rabbi said it was all right, he had two pairs. Only later, according to military historians, did Mahoney realize that of course, Rabbi Goode was not carrying an extra pair of gloves. He had already decided that he was going down with the ship. According to the Army War College account, another survivor of the Dorchester, John Ladd, said of the four chaplains' selfless act: . ""It was the finest thing I have seen or hope to see this side of heaven."" The story of the four chaplains was quite well known in America for a while; in 1948 a first-class 3-cent postage stamp was issued bearing their likenesses. There are still stained glass windows in some chapels across the U.S. that pay tribute to the four men, including at the Pentagon. But the national memory is short, and they are no longer much discussed. February 3 was, years ago, designated by Congress to be set aside annually as Four Chaplains Day, but it is not widely commemorated. This Super Bowl Sunday, with its football heroes whose televised exploits are bracketed by commercials for beer and corn chips, will be no exception. The nation's attention, this February 3, will be focused on the game. But perhaps, at some point in the day, we can pause for a moment to reflect upon what valor and courage and sacrifice really mean. How rare they truly are. And to recall the four men who remain, in the words with which their grateful and humbled country honored them on the front of that long-ago postage stamp, ""these immortal chaplains."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: On Super Bowl Sunday, football players will be called gutsy, heroic .

"(Careerbuilder.com) -- Problem: Even though rest is how your body rebuilds, there's virtually no time or space to do it at work. But we really need rest -- much of the population is sleep-deprived. It's even more severely rest-deprived, which fouls up mood, performance and health. If you do too much at once, you'll feel overwhelmed. If you do the same thing too much over and over, you'll get exhausted. Taking breaks is often the only way to prevent the error that being tired and unrested can cause, yet it's hard for most workers to rest -- and still be efficient -- at work. You have to be the right kinds of breaks. Solution: You probably can't take naps at work -- about half of Fortune 500 corporations will fire you or reprimand you if you nap on the job. Instead, take an UnNap Nap using the paradoxical relaxation technique. Careerbuilder.com: What does your cubicle say about you? UnNap Naps can be taken in a very short time, one to three minutes, though you can certainly take longer ones. Where and when you can take an UnNap Nap: Anywhere, any time . What it is: It's all about paying attention to muscle tension -- that's it. Why it is ""paradoxical"" relaxation? Because you rest and relax by not relaxing -- thus the paradox. How to take an UnNap: . 1. Sit in a comfortable place (try this first when you're not at work). 2. Start with any muscle in the head that feels tight. Can't find one? If you're looking at a screen all day, the middle of your forehead should feel tight; others find that some spot on their neck is always a bit tight. 3. Put one hand over your closed eyes (if asked at work, you can say you have a little headache you're trying to fix). 4. With your other hand, point at the muscle that's a bit tense in order to focus on it; put your hand back. Careerbuilder.com: 7 questions not to ask . 5. Continue to focus all your attention on the tense muscle. Feel it. Sense it. Don't relax it or tense it. Just focus on it. You can also visualize the muscle. Muscles work like a set of teeth in a comb -- when they're tense, they bunch up; when relaxed, they pull away from each other. 6. Sense that muscle and its tension for 30 seconds. 7. Pull your hand away from your eyes and open them. Now, think about how the muscle feels. Does it feel relaxed? What about the rest of your body? Here's where the paradox comes in -- with all your attention focused on one spot, the rest of the body relaxes. Now, sense other muscles on your face or head that are tense. Choose one. For the next 15 seconds, just sense that muscle alone. Feel it with your complete attention. Continue until you feel more relaxed. Extending the UnNap Nap To make the UnNap Nap as close to a nap as possible, do a mental scan of the body, focusing on different muscle groups one at a time, stopping at any that are feeling tense. Careerbuilder.com: 5 ways to rehab your resume . Go down the body muscle by muscle. Sense each muscle group for 15 seconds. Go from head to toe. After awhile, you'll be able to easily pick them out, especially if you work at a desk. When you feel fully relaxed, notice your attention level. You should feel more relaxed and focused. Using the UnNap Nap You can use the UnNap Nap to relax anywhere, any time, and with practice it can be done in 15 seconds or less. It can be used to: . • Improve concentration quickly . • Relieve stress almost anywhere, any time . • Help you nap or fall asleep when you have the time . • Help teach you active rest -- the many different techniques to power you up when you're exhausted or calm you when you're stressed. • Help you relax and de-stress in the middle of a exam -- academic, medical, whatever. Rest rebuilds and revives the body. Active rest helps you direct that rebuilding, so it goes more the way you want -- it, making you more productive, more alert, more relaxed -- and often looking and feeling younger, too. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"London (CNN) -- After pleas to spare the life of British aid worker Alan Henning went unanswered by the so-called Islamic State terror group, his family is ""numb with grief"" with the news that he has been beheaded. ""It is the news we hoped we would never hear. As a family we are devastated by the news of his death. There are few words to describe how we feel at this moment,"" his wife, Barbara, said in a written statement released Saturday by the United Kingdom's Foreign Office. ""... We always knew that Alan was in the most dangerous of situations but we hoped that he would return home to us. That is not to be."" News of Henning's beheading was made public Friday in a video released by ISIS, which blamed the killing on the UK for joining the U.S.-lead bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and Syria. In the same video, the group threatened the life of American aid worker Peter Kassig. UK Prime Minister David Cameron called Henning's murder ""absolutely abhorrent"" and ""completely unforgiveable,"" saying Britain must work with its allies to defeat ISIS. ""What we see with this organization is there's no level of depravity to which they will not sink. No appeals made any difference,"" he said, speaking Saturday at the Prime Minister's country house retreat, Chequers. ""...The fact this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they murdered him in the way they did, shows what we are dealing with, and this is going to be our struggle there. With others, we must do everything we can to defeat this organization"" But Cameron also warned the fight against ISIS, also known as ISIL, would not be quick. The Prime Minister said he had held briefings with senior military and intelligence advisers and others, ""to make sure we do everything that we can, whether that is taking down these hateful videos from the Internet, whether it's stopping preachers of hate, whether it's prosecuting those who glorify terrorism, whether it's working with others to defeat ISIL in the region."" ISIS video of 4th Westerner killing similar to others, but doesn't run as long . Pleas ignored . The news of Henning's beheading came just days after Britain joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, following overwhelming approval from Parliament. UK jets began flying reconnaissance flights over Iraq a week ago, and on Tuesday dropped their first missiles on an ISIS heavy-weapon position and an armed pickup truck in Iraq, according to the UK Defense Ministry. The White House released a statement condemning Henning's murder and vowing to work alongside the United Kingdom and its allies to ""degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL."" Henning appears to be the fourth Westerner to be beheaded on camera by ISIS. This summer, ISIS beheaded American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- showing their gruesome killings in videos posted online. ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13. After receiving an audio file with her husband's voice, Henning's wife attempted to contact those holding him. When she was unable to reach those who sent the file, she made public pleas last month to ISIS to spare her husband's life -- an appeal joined by voices of Muslim leaders around the world. But those pleas were ignored. ""On behalf of the entire family, I want to thank everyone who campaigned for Alan's release, who held vigils to pray for his safe return, and who condemned those who took him,"" she said, according to the statement. ""Your efforts were a great support to us, and we take comfort in knowing how many people stood beside us in hoping for the best."" A taxi driver from near Manchester in northern England, the 47-year-old Henning was part of a team of volunteers who traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver aid -- food, water and medical supplies -- to people affected by the country's devastating civil war. He was abducted by masked gunmen the day after Christmas, other people in the aid convoy said. ""Alan was a decent, caring human being. His interest was in the welfare of others,"" Barbara Henning said in the statement. ""He will be remembered for this and we as a family are extremely proud of him and what he achieved and the people he helped."" Who is the ISIS? 'Our local and national hero' At a ceremony at Manchester Central Mosque on Saturday, a joint statement mourning the loss of Henning was read out on behalf of mosques throughout the north of England. ""Alan Henning was our local and national hero,"" it said. ""We will remember him as a tireless and selfless volunteer aid worker whose only concern was to help people in need. ""...The killing of Alan Henning was a cowardly and criminal act of appalling brutality by a group who do not represent Islam at all and in fact are an insult to the Islamic faith."" Some 200 mosques and organizations put their names to the joint statement, together representing about a million people, according to mosque officials. Talha Ahmad, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, told CNN on Saturday that the organization was ""devastated and disgusted"" by Henning's murder, which he called ""the latest round of despicable violence by ISIS."" The murder, according to Ahmad, confirmed that ISIS is ""not a religiously inspired organization"" but rather a militia group ""hell-bent on inflicting pain and cruelty."" He does not believe a very large number of people sympathize or are even prepared to tolerate the kind of attitude shown by ISIS, he said. ""The challenge we have is to make the case again and again that however tempting, however lucrative it may appear to support a group which stands up to the Western 'bully,' if you like, the reality is ISIS do not represent a hope,"" he said. One heartening thing to come out of the tragedy of Henning's death, he said, is that Muslims ""of all shades and colors and theology, have come together to condemn ISIS and we just need to keep doing that."" UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them. Cameron last month laid out new measures to tackle the threat posed by would-be UK jihadists, days after Britain raised its terror threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe."" How ISIS is run .

"Washington (CNN) -- With the official business of the 57th inauguration out of the way, Washington began preparing Sunday for a day of revelry -- and for the challenges facing President Barack Obama over the next four years. Satisfying the constitutional obligation to be sworn in on January 20, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden took quiet oaths the day before the public ceremony at the Capitol, which is expected to attract a crowd of up to 800,000 on the National Mall. Obama will become only the 17th U.S. president to deliver a second inaugural address before leading the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Monday's events will be smaller than Obama's first inauguration in 2009, when nearly two million people witnessed the swearing-in of the country's first African-American president. Less intensity this time reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first four years. For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascent to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades. Obama to acknowledge divided Washington in inaugural address . However, a list of challenges that included an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending only hardened the opposing positions in Washington. Obama's signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery. A second-term Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy -- proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals -- and oversee the implementation of Obamacare. And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda. CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans -- 54% -- believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he'd be poor or below average. And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president's policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail. Obama's senior adviser, David Plouffe, said on Sunday that ""the challenges and opportunities are enormous"" in the president's second term, and that those challenges would be confronted as soon as the inaugural celebrations play out. The tone of Obama's inaugural address on Monday will be ""hopeful,"" Plouffe told CNN on Sunday, explaining that Obama would ""remind the country that our founding principles and values still can guide us in a changing and modern world."" 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN platforms . ""He's going to talk about the fact that our political system doesn't require us to resolve all of our disputes or settle all of our differences but it doesn't compel us to act where there shouldn't and is common ground,"" Plouffe added. ""He's going to make that point very clearly."" Plouffe underscored that Obama's State of the Union address, to take place February 12, will present a more specific ""blueprint"" of the next four years. Obama's swearing-in on Sunday took place in the ornate Blue Room, an oval-shaped reception space in the president's official residence, where he was joined by his wife, Michelle, and his two daughters. Obama placed his left hand on a Bible held by Mrs. Obama that was from her family. He then raised his right hand. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath - his third time to hold that honor. After Roberts flubbed the order of words during the public ceremony in 2009, a do-over took place in the White House Map Room the next day to erase any question that Obama was officially the president. Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service . Roberts didn't have any trouble with the oath this time around. He read from a white note card. Slash marks where Roberts paused to have Obama repeat the words were clearly visible. The event took less than a minute and Obama didn't make any formal remarks or statements. He did take a moment to hug his wife and daughters, exclaiming: ""I did it!"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president's extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony. Katy Perry brings 'Fireworks' to inauguration kids' concert . Both Obama and Biden went to Arlington National Cemetery after Biden's swearing-in for a traditional wreath laying. The president and his family also attended services celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the most historic churches in Washington. Inauguration activities kicked off on Saturday with Obama and Mrs. Obama and Biden and his wife, Jill, leading volunteers across the country in National Day of Service Activities. Later Saturday, singer Katy Perry headlined a concert for children of military families and Washington schoolchildren, hosted by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden. Singer Usher and the cast of the TV show ""Glee"" were among others who performed. Sunday evening, the Obamas will watch Latino acts at ""In Performance at the Kennedy Center,"" which is followed by the Let Freedom Ring concert. The Red, White and Blue Inaugural Ball and Hip-Hop Inaugural Ball are also scheduled in the capital. Viewer's guide to the inauguration .

"(CNN) -- Jim Jefferies is one of Australia's most successful stand-up comedians, but fans Down Under don't get to enjoy their native son live on stage as much as they'd like. ""I haven't really done comedy in Australia,"" he says. ""I did it for a year before I moved to the UK. I go back and do it now for a couple of weeks a year but, to be honest, I do it because you got to visit your mom."" Good boy. It was in England where Jefferies' career really began to flourish. However, success didn't come without a few lumps along the way. Quite literally. Many people are aware of the 2006 Manchester Comedy Store incident where Jefferies was viciously attacked on stage. He recounts this story in our video interview. (And, yes, we've got the actual footage.) But there was also the time (again in Manchester) when he, along with his friend and girlfriend, fell victim to a home invasion that led to having his car stolen and Jefferies being tied up and sliced in the head with a machete. This story was told in hilarious detail on the Opie & Anthony radio show, where Jefferies explained that the cops caught the intruders and pretty much nailed them for everything, including grievous bodily harm, aggravated robbery and attempted rape. ""They also got 'em for possession of drugs, which was brilliant because they were my drugs,"" he says of the little bag of weed the robbers took from his house. Later, when the police questioned him about the drugs, explaining that his fingerprints were all over the bag, Jefferies replied, ""They made me touch it."" Over the years, Jefferies has established himself as one of the funniest and most irreverent comedians on stage. And, for a good long while, he was also known as being a bit of a heavy drinker. But those days are over; they ended rather abruptly when his doctor told him he had an enlarged liver. To this, he jokes, ""You'd think a large one would be able to handle more pressure."" Fortunately, his comedy is as strong as ever, and a sober Jefferies is rapidly becoming a bigger name throughout the States. Of course, he still performs occasionally back in Oz. You know. For mom.

"Paris (CNN) -- There's more to being a model than just looking pretty, according to Liu Wen. And she should know. Liu is one of the world's highest-paid models and the first Chinese face to crack the top five in Forbes' annual list of top earners. She says that far from being a week long party, Paris Fashion Week is an arduous mix of shoots, shows and limited sleep. Models, even well-known ones like Liu, turn up at fashion week with no shows booked and are often slotted in just 24 hours before the shows are scheduled to start. In the meantime, they just have to sit it out and wait for a designer to call, although when you are as big as Wen, you know the phone will ring. Next come fittings, and although models like Liu look exquisite in whatever they wear, not every collection will suit her body shape or complexion. ""(A designer might) design a big coat,"" explains Liu. ""So ... the model (must have) big shoulders to hang the clothes."" That means, that even after a fitting, Lui still won't know if she'll walk the show. The 26-year-old admits it can be a whirl: ""When I am in Paris, I have no idea what my schedule (is) ... everything is always last minute. You don't know exactly what you are doing. You only know you have to wake up, the driver take you, you go in the back seat, you have make-up, hair, and then walk in the show and then the driver take you and you go and walk in another show. ""Sometimes you know, we have a crazy schedule. One time, I did 27 shows in London, and 22 or 23 shows in Paris. I don't know how I did it!"" Looking fresh in the midst of a tough schedule requires insider knowledge. Here Liu shares with CNN the survival secrets that get her through fashion week. Always be prepared . ""During Fashion Week, you always know about your schedule at the last minute,""says Liu, who walked a record 74 shows during the Fall/Winter 2009 season. This means models must always be ready to dash out to a fitting, casting or catwalk at the drop of a hat. Get plenty of beauty sleep -- when you can . Between early call-times and late-night runway shows, Wen can be up and about from 5am to midnight. But it's still important for her to squeeze in as much sleep as possible. ""I think (sleep) is really good for skin,"" she says. ""When you sleep very well and eat healthy, you look well and very beautiful."" Stay hydrated . ""For Fashion Week, the girls are always running around backstage from a show to another show,"" Liu says. ""I always have one bottle of water because sometimes you are very thirsty."" It's also not rare for stylists to use bottled water to rinse wash a model's hair when there are no sinks available. Find your relaxation technique and stick to it . For Wen, this means bringing her own music to listen to backstage, as well as a good book. And to unwind physically? ""I bring a very cute massage ball. Sometimes in the evening I do a little bit massage to make my body more relaxed."" Show off your personal style . Wen may have made her fortune showing off others' designs, but she feels that showing off her own style is also important. ""I think the personal style for model is very important because I think it can show that all the girls have very different personalities,"" Liu says. ""When you have your own style you just represent yourself."" Make time for your friends . ""Most of the time we live in different countries or different cities,"" Liu says. ""We don't have that much time to hang out, and only (during) fashion week we can see each other a lot backstage. That's why I love to take a picture, and then sometimes just have fun!"" Don't forget your map (or at least Google Maps) ""After six years doing shows I still don't know Paris very well!"" Enjoy yourself . In spite of the stress of the shows, Wen is appreciative of the chance to be working in the City of Lights at all. ""I do love Paris Fashion Week because Paris is a very beautiful city,"" she says.

"London (CNN) -- As News Corporation faces more scrutiny into allegations of phone hacking by its journalists, the spotlight has once again fallen on senior executive James Murdoch who has been recalled to the parliamentary committee hearing. Before the hacking scandal, James Murdoch was widely regarded by media watchers as the heir apparent to his father's powerful empire -- a remarkable turnaround for a college dropout once viewed as the family's black sheep. As its deputy chief operating officer and head of international operations, Murdoch, 38, is the third most senior figure at News Corp, wielding considerable influence through the stable of newspaper titles at his command. But unless he can shrug off the turmoil that threatens to engulf the company, even after it stepped away from a controversial bid to acquire full control of its UK-based broadcasting arm, his widely anticipated succession of Rupert Murdoch could be under threat. James Murdoch's close links to the papers at the heart of the phone-hacking scandal could be pivotal. It was James Murdoch who announced the closure of the News of the World amid public fury about the paper's tactics. He has always denied being aware of the phone-hacking activities -- although he did authorize payments to appease victims. But he is now being recalled to a UK parliamentary investigation which is trying to establish the extent of illegal phone hacking by reporters working at the company's titles. In evidence to an earlier hearing in July, James Murdoch said he could not recall seeing a key document known as the ""for Neville"" e-mail. It implied that the practice was being conducted by more than one journalist, but this statement is directly contradicted by two of the company's senior employees and may be the focus of fresh questioning. It is another intriguing chapter in a varied career to date. James Murdoch, the third child from his father's second marriage, once appeared to be the least likely of the media tycoon's offspring to succeed, despite his evident intelligence. Born in London, but raised in New York, James Murdoch went on to attend Harvard University, where he studied film and animation before dropping out in the mid-1990s to help launch a hip-hop music label, Rawkus Records. It wasn't long before Murdoch was brought into the family business. Rawkus was eventually bought by News Corp. and in 1996 Murdoch was persuaded to take over the company's nascent internet operations, with mixed results. By 2000 Murdoch was in charge of News Corp's Asian satellite business, Star TV, where he appeared to find his feet. In 2003 he took over its UK-based sister operation, Sky, quickly dispelling doubts about his business acumen by meeting ambitious profit targets. Murdoch continued to rise through the ranks, taking on his News Corp executive roles in 2007. At the time, Rupert Murdoch described his son as a ""talented and proven executive with a rare blend of international perspective and deep hands-on experience."" His new position handed him overall control of News International, an umbrella company that includes the Sun newspaper, the Times and the defunct News of the World -- the paper whose activities triggered the current UK media crisis. Although regularly cited as one of the most influential figures in Britain, Murdoch's political allegiances have never been clear. A 2007 profile in the Observer newspaper says Murdoch has been ""unimpressed"" by then opposition leader David Cameron. The Telegraph, meanwhile, described him as a ""close confidant"" of Cameron. Murdoch himself told the Financial Times in 2007: ""I don't comment on politics."" Murdoch, who has two children with wife Kathryn Hufschmid, is said to be a black belt in karate. He is also proficient at corporate combat. In 2006 he steered BSkyB into the acquisition of a 17.9% stake in UK broadcaster ITN, blocking a rival move by Virgin Media. But it is his and News Corp's plans to acquire full ownership of BSkyB that have put them on a collision course with British lawmakers in the wake of the phone hacking scandal, eventually deciding to back down under government pressure. Media observers say it is too early to predict whether Murdoch can survive the scandal with his News Corp. prospects intact or will be edged out by contenders including older brother Lachlan or second-in-command Chase Carey.

"(Wired) -- This is a selfie made of blood. Yes, real, straight-from-veins-of-a-human blood. The human you're looking at is Ted Lawson, an artist living in Brooklyn. These are his first blood paintings. Lawson created the works for an upcoming exhibition, The Map Is Not the Territory, opening September 11 at the Joseph Gross Gallery in NYC, and it should be noted that he didn't originally set out to paint with his vital fluids. Then again, who does? The whole weird thing came about as a larger investigation into how Lawson could use a CNC milling machine in new ways to create his artworks. You'll notice the blood is actually dispensed onto a brush controlled by the CNC's robotic arm. One day as an experiment, Lawson hooked up a pen to the CNC machine's arm to see how it might draw. It drew really well! ""I was doing a drawing of the moon and thought, 'Oh, this could be really cool to do in my own blood,"" he recalls. ""It was a logical progression."" Any logicality involving drawing with your own blood is debatable, but Lawson persisted and adapted his process to replace traditional ink with body ink. To make his selfie, Lawson began by taking a photo of himself in the nude. In Illustrator he rendered the photo into vectors then used Rhino to turn the art into code that the CNC machine could read. Lawson hooked himself up to a needle and funneled his blood into the machine like one might do with ink. The machine dispensed lines of blood, creating a pixelated version of Lawson's original photo. ""If you're right up close to it, you can almost see the lines of code,"" he says of the artwork. Blood Isn't an Easy Medium . The issue with blood, or any other liquid for that matter, is that it tends to pool on paper. To combat this, Lawson constructed a completely flat table and used a vacuum to suck the paper against it as tightly as possible. This allowed the blood to dispense evenly onto the paper, reducing the risk of globbing. After the paintings were finished, Lawson sprayed them with an acrylic fixativeâ€”""So they don't rot,"" he notes. There's a trick to making a good blood painting. Lawson's involves lots of water and a pre blood-letting cheeseburger. ""I found that fatty foods make for a nicer flow,"" he explains. Lots of practice helps, too. Lawson experimented with making two full-sized selfies before he finished the final painting. The selfie painting took around three hours to complete, but Lawson says the total blood used is probably less than what you'd regularly donate. Despite describing himself as squeamish when it comes to blood and needles, the artist has found that if you stick a needle in your arm enough times, it gets easier to ignore. ""Blood is just a medium,"" he says. ""When you focus on something other than yourself, like making a drawing, it becomes ink and stops being blood."" More from Wired: .

"ANDORRA LA VELLA, Andorra (CNN)  -- Getting to Andorra, a tiny country wedged in the mountains between France and Spain, is no easy feat. No airport, no train station, and the nearest city Toulouse is at least a 2 hour drive away. Andorra, a beautiful mini-country in the Pyrenees, offers its residents a peaceful life. Perhaps that's part of the secret of this tiny principality high up in the Pyrenees Mountains: that its quiet isolation has created a relatively stress-free life-style which has made them the world champions in the global longevity sweepstakes, at least according to the latest U.S. Census Department estimates. The average Andorran today can expect to live at least 85 years -- longer than anywhere else on the planet. Meeting Andorrans from all walks of life, it soon becomes clear that the concept of living longer was not on everyone's mind, but the idea of living well and living healthy came up in nearly every conversation. From doctors in town to the elderly shepherd in the mountains, they speak of eating good natural food and of the exercise which comes naturally in walking up and down the hillsides. Dr. Albert Font, Director of Andorra's Geriatric Clinic, is convinced that living in the mountains is, in general, healthier both for mind and body: ""It's because we have this natural environment that we have such a balanced health,"" he told CNN. Watch a report on the secrets of long life in Andorra » . Elderly Andorrans have a daily routine that would put much younger people in the shade: outside their Assisted Living Residence, a group of about 30 senior citizens in their 80's and 90's out for a cold morning's walk went slowly but surely and easily negotiated two or three flights of stairs built into the mountainside. After that 'warm-up' most of them headed for the gym for stationary bike riding and exercise class. Diet and nutrition awareness also seems to play a role in keeping Andorrans alive and healthy. Nestled in valleys between France and Spain, there is very little cultivatable land and strangely enough, tobacco seems to be one of the few crops raised on the little farmland in the country. But meat, vegetables and fish from its larger neighbors make their way to the dinner tables in Andorra, resulting in a high-altitude version of the Mediterranean diet so many strive for elsewhere. But even in this land-locked little country, times are changing and the older generation worries that the slow invasion of fast food and the passivity of video games and the like, may have a negative impact on the life expectancy of the young. Seventy-six-year old farmer Pierre Font Vergas remembers the days when just taking his herd of cattle to pastures and back home again would easily mean hiking 30 kilometers (18 miles) up and down the mountain trails each day. A new lifestyle has come to the principality, the old farmer told CNN. Skiing and tourism are the country's new profit centers, life is getting increasingly stressful, more people are eating fast food instead of the traditional diet and not getting enough exercise, he added. It would seem that the secrets to long life in Andorra are not really secrets at all. They are well documented. Good health care, clean water, proper diet, plenty of exercise and a low-stress, positive life . However, there's one other thing to consider when trying to understand the Andorran's penchant for life and living long: the feeling of community and an unusual closeness to friends and family. Filming at an elderly care home, it was full of families including young children spending an hour or two on a weekday with an aged parent or grandparent. And even to stop to ask a question or a direction, people seemed to know about everything and everyone else in the country. Some might find that intrusive, or even boring. But there seemed to be a marked sense of peace in the way people here see life. Dr. Font thinks there is a specific reason for that sense of happiness in Andorra: ""We don't have any violence. I think it's one of the safest countries in the world."" ""And after all,"" one Andorran told CNN, ""unlike the rest of Europe, we haven't been touched by a war in more than 700 years.""","The average Andorran lives 85 years, longer than anywhere else on the planet .

"(CNN) -- It's a big dilemma: Be with your wife for the birth of your first child, or stay at work with the hope of an $11 million payday. For golfer Billy Horschel, it's a no-brainer. ""There wasn't much discussion. I brought up the question, she said: 'You're staying.' "" Horschel is one of five players who can claim the $10 million jackpot for topping the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoff series by winning the $1.44 million Tour Championship finale in Atlanta. The 27-year-old made the best possible start Thursday as he tied for the first-round lead with longtime friend Chris Kirk, who heads the FedEx standings from second-placed Horschel. Horschel won last week's BMW Championship and was joint runner-up in the second of the four playoff events, so his hopes are high that he can secure his family's financial future this weekend. ""My wife is totally on board,"" he told the PGA Tour website after his four-under-par 66. ""She's a golfer. She understands what it all means. I've probably got the greatest wife out here."" Their daughter, to be named Skylar Lillian, is due on September 27 but could arrive earlier. Horschel said if his wife Brittany does go into labor in the next few days, he doesn't want to be told until he completes his round. Then, with a private jet standing by, he will make the one-hour flight back to Florida. Because of the tournament's restricted 29-man field -- there would usually be around 150 players for the first two rounds of a regular PGA Tour event before the halfway cut -- he will have time to get back to resume playing the next day. ""I won't find out on the course, because my focus may be taken away from the task at hand,"" Horschel said. ""But after the round's over with, I will be flying home, spend a few hours and then flying back later that day or the next morning before the round of golf. ""Having a chance to win $10 million and our first child on the way -- it's pretty amazing."" Last year, Hunter Mahan -- who carded 74 Thursday to be well off the pace -- withdrew from the Canadian Open while he was leading to be at the birth of his first child. ""Hunter did a great thing last year pulling out,"" Horschel said. ""But I would think if he was in my position with winning, having a chance to win, roughly $10 million more, if you had the Tour Championship winner's check and everything, I think it would be maybe a no-brainer to stay put and keep playing and go home in between rounds."" Impending fatherhood is only adding to the excitement for Horschel, who partnered the comparatively calm Kirk in the final group to go out Thursday. They have known each other since playing at rival schools and progressing through the amateur ranks. ""He looks like he's a Fred Couples walking slow and nothing affects him,"" Horschel says of the 29-year-old Georgia native. ""And I think I walk slow, but as I've seen on the coverage last week, it looks like I'm sprinting around the greens and the golf course ... The emotional level is a little bit different."" They were one shot clear of another four players tied for third: Masters champion Bubba Watson, fellow Americans Jim Furyk and Patrick Reed, plus Australian Jason Day. World No. 1 Rory McIlroy -- who like Kirk, Horschel, Watson and Mahan can secure the bumper jackpot with victory Sunday no matter where any other player finishes -- was tied for 11th on 69 with Adam Scott, Sergio Garcia and Ryan Palmer. If none of the top five win, then the permutations get complicated, but it's possible for any player in the entire field to claim the $10 million with victory.","Billy Horschel shares lead with Chris Kirk after round one of Tour Championship .

"(CNN) -- The smells of oil, tires and hard work surround Monwabisi Bokwe as he stands on the Volkswagen production line. He's one of the thousands of employees at the auto plant in the South African town of Uitenhage, a cog in Eastern Cape's crucial sector: car manufacturing. ""It's not easy working in this industry, it's got its challenges,"" says Bokwe. ""But I frequently go to the Western Cape and when you see a VW car go down the road and you tell your friend that you were part of that process that puts the car together...that fills you up with pride."" Regional economy . After a decade working with Volkswagen cars, Bokwe has seen a lot. As a production operator at the factory in South Africa's self-proclaimed Garden Town, he's not far from the ocean in a province known for its auto-sector. ""If you look at the Eastern Cape it's one of your poorest provinces in the country,"" says Bokwe. ""My understanding is that we've got about three car factories in the Eastern Cape and I cannot imagine what kind of province we would have had those factories not been in the Eastern Cape,"" he continues. David Powels, a native of the region and VW's managing director in South Africa, says auto-companies in the area are catalysts for economic growth. ""Whilst we employ 4,000 people, we create a multiply effect through the economy,"" he says. One way this effect is made manifest is in the number of companies making car components in the area. In fact, the Eastern Cape Development Corporation says there are 40,000 auto-sector jobs in the province, 75% of which are created by supplier companies. And it's not just the jobs VW creates that makes it popular in South Africa. The company's products dominate the roads, accounting for almost 23% of South Africa's passenger car market according to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa. That means the company sold more passenger cars in South Africa than any other brand -- a title VW celebrated for the fourth consecutive year in 2012. But VW is not the only global car brand with production plants and ambition in the region. Auto giants like Toyota, Ford and General Motors have big operations in the Eastern Cape. While Ford is focused on making engines in the country, Toyota has produced some of their best-selling cars in South Africa. The region puts together half of the country's passenger vehicles, according to the Eastern Cape Development Corporation, but it is also essential for other markets. Over half of South Africa's vehicle exports are produced there. Engines of growth . What's changing is where these cars are being sold. While America and Europe have been the key markets, these days more cars are being exported to other African markets. In fact, African countries are the second biggest market for car components made in South Africa after the E.U. It's this aspect of the market that executives think will drive growth. Brian Olson, vice president of sales, services and marketing at General Motors, says that Africa's middle class will be buying two and a half million new cars a year by 2020. Given that current new sales are around 1.7 million vehicles, he's optimistic about Africa's future. The auto sector makes up about 7% of South Africa's economic output -- a crucial chunk. With the Eastern Cape being so key to the country's vehicle exports, some compare it to America's Motor City: Detroit. ""We have Mercedes, GM, Ford and Volkswagen with all the production in the Eastern cape province,"" says Powels. ""So to some extent we could fairly say that we are the Detroit, but with that comes quite a responsibility. If you look at the history of Detroit, it's gone into decline because of the over dependence on the auto-sector and the number of companies in the auto-sector that went through the very difficult times,"" he continues. ""The auto-sector is an anchor tenant in the province, we are an important driver of growth -- but we have to recognize that that brings risks."" Risky Business . Challenges are fresh in the minds of the region's auto executives. In 2013 weeks of strikes meant production lines lost over 45,000 vehicles which translated into lost revenues of about R20 billion -- approximately $1.8 billion. It was only after the NAAMSA union, which represents auto workers, negotiated a new pay deal that workers went back to the factories. Another serious issue weighing on the minds of car manufactures is the disposable income in consumers' pockets. Indeed, the union says that's why the latest data shows new vehicle sales are falling. With sales of new vehicle at 55,722 in August 2014, they're down 1.4% compared to the same period last year. And these difficulties are clear to executive and workers alike. ""If the Eastern Cape had to close down all its factories,"" Bokwe reflects, ""we will not be a ghost town -- we will become a ghost province.""","The Eastern Cape provides 51% of South Africa's vehicle exports .

"(CNN) -- As oil continues to pour into the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, comfort may come from an unusual direction: the largest oil spill in history. Between five and 10 million barrels of oil poured into the Persian Gulf in 1991 when Iraqi troops, retreating from their occupation of Kuwait, set fire to desert oil wells and opened the valves on oil rigs and pipelines. The spill -- at least five times the most recent estimate of that spilled in the Gulf of Mexico -- devastated marine wildlife and coastal habitats in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Yet, against all the odds, the Persian Gulf appears to have shown amazing resilience in response to the ecological disaster. Nicolas Pilcher is a marine specialist with the International Union for Conservation of Nature. He was in neighboring Saudi Arabia as oil began washing ashore on the beaches. It had flowed south along the coast from Kuwait. ""It was huge,"" Pilcher told CNN. ""It's hard to describe for people who weren't there but it was basically a coast of black."" By the time Saudi authorities and international contractors initiated clean-up efforts, pumping oil from the sea into holding areas, much of the oil had sunk, evaporated or washed up on beaches, according to Pilcher. ""You would see oil on the beach or along the shoreline in the water, but it wasn't there for more than about a month,"" he said. But oil slicks had an immediate and catastrophic impact on local wildlife. Christophe Tourenq, science and research manager at the World Wildlife Fund's UAE office told CNN that researchers estimate 30,000 water birds were killed by the oil. Fish eggs and larvae were killed by slicks, which in turn reduced the breeding success of some bird species by 50 percent in the year after the spill, he said. More on oil spills: Read about Spain's 'Coast of Death' But, according to researchers, in the years following the spill the Gulf's ecosystem began to make a remarkable comeback. A 2008 joint German-Saudi research paper on the effects of oil pollution in the Persian Gulf stated that by 1994, fish and bird populations had returned to pre-spill levels. Whale, dolphin and turtle populations were largely unaffected, according to the same study. The fishing industry was decimated after the oil spill and Iraqi mines made the Gulf a no-go area for Kuwaiti and Saudi fishermen. But, it too, had started to show signs of improvement by 1994, the same study shows, and is widely considered to have made a full recovery from the after effects of the spill today. ""What they found, and they've found in other places in the world, is that nature does recover,"" said Pilcher. Although a colossal amount of oil was released into the Gulf, Pilcher said up to half may have simply disappeared from the water by a combination of evaporation and degradation by bacteria in the sea. In the Persian Gulf, the local climate -- very hot and humid for most of the year -- would have helped. Abdul Nabi Al-Ghadban of Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research has studied the impact of the spill. He told CNN: ""If you have a higher air/water temperature the lighter fraction of the oil, which is more toxic, evaporates, and the heavy fraction, which is least toxic, goes to the bottom."" ""That's why with an incident like the Exxon Valdez, although in terms of volume it was far less than the spill in the Arabian Gulf, in that part of the world, because of the colder water the impact can be stronger. ""The lighter fraction stays there for a longer period and can inflict a lot of damage compared with hot areas."" Nonetheless, the oil spill has left the Gulf with some scars that have not yet healed. Ghadban said coral reefs have been damaged, particularly off the coast of Saudi Arabia. And the heavier oil fractions, which don't evaporate or dissolve, have sunk into coastal sediments. A 2003 U.S. study found huge quantities of oil in the sediment of salt marshes, mudflats and mangroves on the coast of Saudi Arabia. Laila Hayat, of Kuwaiti activists Green Line Environmental Group, told CNN she feared that oil buried in beach sands could be released by the erosive action of coastal currents. It's a fear shared by Ghadban, who said studies are being carried out to test the likelihood of that occurring. So, can any lessons from the Persian Gulf spill be applied to the ongoing Gulf of Mexico spill? According to the latest U.S. government estimates, up to 855,000 barrels of oil have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico since a 5,000-foot-deep well erupted after an explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20. Gulf Coast Oil Spill . ""There are probably similarities [between the spills], although it's too early to tell,"" said Pilcher. ""One issue in the Gulf of Mexico is the sunken oil -- whether that ever makes it up on the surface and on the shores, or will it just sink to the bottom. ""In terms of the clean up, I think some coastal habitats are just way too fragile to be touched. ""Some of those coastal marshes will probably be more damaged by clean-up activities than they would be if they were left to deal with the disaster on their own."" For Ghadban, the lessons from the 1991 oil spill are all too relevant to the Gulf of Mexico spill. ""If you have an offshore operation you need to have a good contingency plan in case of spillage, damage, earthquake, or a problem with the pipeline. ""We learned the lesson that we have to have an action plan -- you have to expect the unexpected.""","1991 oil spill in Persian Gulf was biggest in history .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published in December by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian Zelizer says Woodrow Wilson got his Nobel Peace Prize at the end of a presidency marked by failure. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Did President Obama deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? That debate will likely continue for weeks to come. But the more interesting question may be about what impact the prize will have on President Obama himself and the key decisions he must make about national security. The case of Woodrow Wilson, the last sitting president to be awarded the prize, offers some useful lessons. On December 10, 1920, Albert Schmedeman, the American Minister to Norway, accepted the Nobel Prize on behalf of President Wilson, who was being honored for his work in creating the League of Nations. The president had first been nominated in 1918, but strong internal disagreement within the committee delayed his receiving the prize. It was his actual campaign to gain ratification for the League of Nations agreement in 1919 that persuaded the committee he had earned the recognition. Schmedeman read a statement from Wilson, who was in poor health after suffering a stroke, that said: ""In accepting the honor of your award, I am moved by the recognition of my sincere and earnest efforts in the cause of peace, but also by the very poignant humility before the vastness of the work still called for by this cause."" Wilson realized that the award came toward the end of a presidency where he had failed to achieve many of his goals. There was a certain irony that the prize was awarded right at the time that President Wilson had failed to persuade the U.S. Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, the agreement signed at the end of World War I. One of the Norwegian newspapers, the Aftenposten, ran an editorial that stated: ""After disappointment in Versailles he returned home a beaten man, ridiculed by his adversaries and fellow-citizens. By circumstances out of his control he was restrained from promoting his international peace work. As President of the United States he was unable to do anything more, but history will keep memory of him as creator of the League of Nations. ""To Europe and to great parts of America President Wilson looms as the man of peace who broke with the old doctrines and showed the way toward new ideas. He is, first and last, the great peace promoter -- popular among the victorious and among those beaten."" When Wilson received the Nobel Prize, his presidency was one of dashed expectations. In addition to the fact that the U.S. Senate had refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles -- despite a massive campaign by the president to pressure them into doing so -- many other things had been difficult in Wilson's second term. Though he had run for reelection in 1916 as a president who would keep the nation out of war, Wilson led American troops into a bloody battle. Although Wilson had promised fellow progressives that he would not abandon the domestic principles he had embraced in his first term, once the nation was at war, his administration violated civil liberties, imprisoned wartime opponents, and abandoned much of an interest in creating domestic programs that were unrelated to the war. And while many peoples of the world had been deeply inspired by President Wilson's calls for self-determination, he backed off from pursuing those principles in exchange for international support for the League of Nations. Without American participation, the League of Nations ultimately proved ineffective in preventing war. Obama is fortunate that his Nobel Prize comes much earlier in his presidency. The Nobel Prize Committee granted the award to President Obama for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples."" The secretary of the Nobel Prize Committee stated that Obama's achievement has been to shift the international climate toward issues such as diplomacy and negotiation, arms control and disarmament, multilateral institutions, as well as democracy and human rights. The good news for President Obama is that while he has had a tough few months in office, he still enjoys strong approval ratings in the U.S. and, as the award indicates, has significant prestige abroad. In other words, even after all the town hall meetings and the challenges with his agenda, expectations remain high about what this president can do. The president enters a period when he will be making critical decisions that will help shape the ""international climate."" He will need to decide how strongly to push for climate control legislation, what to do about the requests for more troops in Afghanistan, how to handle counterterrorism policy with regard to issues such as the closure of Guantanamo, and how to respond to Iran's nuclear program. As he makes these decisions, this award can serve as a powerful reminder about what his supporters were hoping he could achieve, and as a source of energy to pursue those goals. In his speech on Friday, Obama indicated that he was thinking in these terms. He said: ""I will accept this award as a call to action -- a call for all nations to confront the challenges of the 21st century."" When Woodrow Wilson died in 1924, he understood all too well how devastating dashed expectations could be for a presidency. ""I am a broken piece of machinery,"" he said on his deathbed. In Wilson's case, the Nobel Prize only amplified the limits of what he had been able to accomplish in the White House and the promises he had broken along the way. In President Obama's case, the award comes much earlier in his tenure and can serve a very different function, offering a compass to guide him as he makes critical decisions about national security in the weeks ahead.

"(CNN) -- On the same day that President Barack Obama spoke to the press about possible surveillance reforms—and released a related white paper on the subject—the National Security Agency came out with its own rare, publicly-released, seven-page document (PDF), essentially justifying its own practices. The entire document is dated August 9, 2013, and has no attributable names or contact details on it. Its most striking portion? A separate block of text on page six, which states: . ""According to figures published by a major tech provider, the Internet carries 1,826 Petabytes of information per day. In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches about 1.6% of that. However, of the 1.6% of the data, only 0.025% is actually selected for review. The net effect is that NSA analysts look at 0.00004% of the world's traffic in conducting their mission—that's less than one part in a million. Put another way, if a standard basketball court represented the global collection would be represented by an area smaller than a dime on that basketball court."" And, nearly directly below that section, the NSA presents its strongest categorical denial of using foreign partners to circumvent American law: . ""NSA partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission. In every case, NSA does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what NSA is itself prohibited by law from doing. These partnerships are an important part of the US and allied defense against terrorists, cyber threat actors, and others who threaten our individual and collective security. Both parties to these relationships benefit."" The document begins by referencing the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, DC, and notes that the NSA ""did not have the tools or the database to search to identify [terorrist] connections and share them with the FBI."" The NSA then argues: ""We do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security; both are integral to who we are as Americans. NSA can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both."" And how, pray tell, might an American's e-mail be accidentally swept up in a dragnet that is ostensibly targeting a foreign suspect? ""For example, a US person might be courtesy copied on an e-mail to or from a legitimate foreign target, or a person in the US might be in contact with a known terrorist target. In those cases, minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are used to protect the privacy of the US person. These minimization procedures control the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of any U.S. person information incidentally acquired during operations conducted pursuant to Section 702."" Of course, also on Friday, The Guardian published an excerpt from a document leaked by Edward Snowden showing that the NSA has the ability to search Americans' e-mails—but apparently restrains itself from doing so. The document also notes Section 215 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—the business records provision—is what gives the the government the authority to capture telephony metadata. At the end of the document, the NSA also argues that it has adequate oversight from a number of government agencies—Bruce Schneier probably would disagree with that—and also is able to police itself. As the NSA concludes: . ""In addition to NSA's compliance safeguards, NSA personnel are obligated to report when they believe NSA is not, or may not be, acting consistently with law, policy, or procedure. This self-reporting is part of the culture and fabric of NSA. If NSA is not acting in accordance with law, policy, or procedure, NSA will report through its internal and external intelligence oversight channels, conduct reviews to understand the root cause, and make appropriate adjustments to constantly improve.""

"(CNN) -- A young newlywed couple in northeastern Pakistan died a horrible death at the hands of the bride's family in the latest honor killing in the nation, police in Pakistan said Saturday. The couple, identified as Sajjad Ahmed, 26, and Muawia Bibi, 18, were married by a Pakistani court on June 18 against the wishes of the Bibi family, Punjab police official Mohammad Ahsanullah told CNN. On Thursday, the bride's father and uncles lured the couple back to the village of Satrah in Punjab province, where Ahsanullah said the pair were tied up and then decapitated. Despite the fact that there were no outside witnesses, family members turned themselves in to police and are now jailed in the Sialkot district of Punjab, Ahsanulluh said. Such killings often originate from tribal traditions in Pakistan and usually happen in rural areas. Human rights activists said bystanders, including police, don't often interfere because the killings are considered to be family matters. According to the United Nations, some 5,000 women are murdered by family members in honor killings every year. However, women's advocacy groups believe the crime is underreported and that the actual death toll from this all too common crime is actually much higher. In Pakistan, 869 women were victims of honor killings last year, according to the country's human rights commission. Earlier in June, 18-year-old Saba Masqood was found left for dead inside of a sack in a canal in Pakistan, injured by gunfire. She accused her brother and father of shooting her because they didn't approve of her marriage to a neighbor. She survived, but many aren't so lucky. Last month, the death of a pregnant Pakistani woman made headlines around the world. Farzana Parveen, 25, was attacked with bricks by about 20 people, including members of her immediate family, police said. And her husband, Mohammad Iqbal, told CNN that he had killed his first wife six years ago so he could marry Parveen. Pregnant Pakistani woman beaten to death with bricks .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A long line of people winds outside the door at The Plaza Theatre in Atlanta, but the near-sellout crowd isn't here for a new release. They are waiting to see ""The Room,"" a movie panned by critics when it was released in 2003. The majority of the people in line have seen it before, and will see it again. A few are wearing costumes, and more have brought along new friends and boxes of plastic spoons. Everyone seems to have their own way of describing the film: ""It's so much more than a movie, it's a social experience,"" says Anna Spence before her 18th theater viewing. Kate Cella, a first-time viewer, was dragged to the movie by friends. ""I've heard that it's the worst best movie ever, or the best worst movie ever, and that I should bring plastic spoons to throw at people."" Whether it's the best worst or the worst best, audiences have discovered a new cult classic movie. The story of ""The Room"" started with its premiere in Los Angeles in 2003. There was some buzz about the film, helped by a large billboard on a main drag in Hollywood. The director, producer and lead actor, all one man named Tommy Wiseau, arrived via limousine to a spotlight on a red carpet and signed autographs. The Hollywood treatment didn't last long. Some in the audience walked out of the showing. Critics were harsh, ripping every aspect of the film, from the overacting and confusing dialogue to the primitive cinematography. Actress Robyn Paris recalls, ""It was like trying not to laugh in church."" It wasn't supposed to be like this for Wiseau, who poured his life and money into this passion project. But a select group saw a hidden brilliance in the unintentional comedy. One college kid named Michael Rousselet sat and watched ""The Room"" alone in an empty theater and immediately called his friends to come to the next screening. More friends came to the next, and the next. The day after, 100 people were in the theater yelling out quotes along with the movie. After the disappointing initial two-week run in Los Angeles, fans persuaded Wiseau to continue screening the film once a month. ""It immediately struck a chord with the young, hip college crowd. They absolutely loved it."" remembers Greg Sestero, who plays the character Mark in the film. ""I showed up at a small screening and there wasn't enough room, people were sitting on the floor. These kids knew every line."" The crowds grew, selling out theaters, and have continued since, once a month for the past seven years. Shortly thereafter showings popped up in cities across the United States, and then in the UK, Denmark, India, Germany and everywhere in between. The Sunset 5 Theater in Los Angeles now sells out all 5 cinemas the last Saturday of every month for screenings of the ""The Room."" Inside the theater in Atlanta, as the lights dim, there is an energy. As the film's title displays, the audience erupts into cheers and applause. Laughter continues throughout the entire 99 minute showing of this dark tale of infidelity. Rarely a moment passes when there isn't a level of audience interaction: quoting the film aloud in unison and answering the characters' dialogue with clever jokes. The most common ritual in theaters everywhere is the plastic spoons. In the titular room, where most of the drama takes place, there are several framed photographs of the cutlery item, and every time one appears on screen, audiences yell ""spoons!"" while throwing hundreds of them in the air. Director Wiseau is clearly the force behind this movie, with his hands on everything from writing the script to funding the production out of his own pocket. The heavily accented star also provides most of the humor in the highly quotable film, intentional or otherwise. He doesn't mind, saying, ""If you can laugh at my project, I did well. I put a little happiness in your life and that's good."" While this is certainly a unique event, it's not a completely new experience. ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" has been combining cinema with audience participation since the '70's. Even Rousselet says he and his friends were intentionally attempting to make the experience like ""Rocky Horror."" But Wiseau doesn't see the comparison. ""You can't compare oranges to apple, or oranges to lemon. We're dealing with relationships and betrayal."" After seven years, it appears the aura of ""The Room"" is still growing. When cast member Kyle Vogt went to a screening, Bobcat Goldthwait came out of the audience and asked to take a picture with him. Wiseau has since made appearances on Adult Swim and Comedy Central. But the self-made star is not forgetting the movie that fans will forever remember him for. ""Next year we put 'The Room' on 3-D, and I have great support. We will do 'The Room' musical eventually."" There is a lot of mystery about Wiseau, who won't answer questions about his heritage or where he got his money. Fans gather at Q and A sessions trying to get every bit of information so often that Sestero decided to publish a tell-all book about meeting Wiseau and the making of the film. Amid the confusion, there are plenty of fans who don't need an explanation. ""I'm not confused about 'The Room' at all, I think it's beautiful,"" says Johnny McGowan. ""The more that people allow 'The Room' to be what it is ... I think the more enjoyment they'll get."" Johnny Padgett agrees, ""'The Room' is probably the greatest movie I've seen in my lifetime."" Wiseau says he is pleased with the way things have turned out, and he has few regrets. ""Everything turned out the way I wanted it. When you look at the content, I wouldn't do differently. If you look at technical, yes, maybe 20% differently.""","2003 box-office bomb ""The Room"" is now a cult favorite .

"London (CNN) -- With its remarkably realistic depictions and dramatic history, the Ghent Altarpiece (1432) is widely thought to be one of the most famous panel paintings in the world. Stolen several times (most notoriously during World War II by the Nazis, who hid it in a salt mine), the altarpiece, currently housed in St. Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, depicts among other things a 'Mystic Lamb' bleeding into a chalice. It has been admired and coveted for centuries. Now an ambitious digital documentation project is allowing scholars and art-lovers alike to pore over the minute details of Jan and Hubert van Eyck's multi-part painting in a specially-designed, open source website entitled 'Closer to Van Eyck: Rediscovering the Ghent Altarpiece.' Consisting of 12 panels (one of which is a copy, the original having been stolen in 1934) and depicting numerous complex theological scenes, the documentation project has rendered the already composite work into 100 billion pixels using the highest resolution photography. A collaboration between the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage in Lukasweb, Belgium, and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and funded with support from the Getty Foundation in Los Angeles and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the venture to digitally document the work took 9 months, initially to assess it for conservation. ""And then it grew into 'These results are interesting, how can we share this information with the widest possible audience on a website?'"" said Deborah Marrow, Director of the Getty Foundation. The documentation process -- which made use of macrophotography in visible light, macrophotography in infrared light, infrared reflectography and X-radiography -- probed beneath the painted surface to reveal the under-drawings. ""One of the big open questions surrounding the polyptych is the involvement of Hubert van Eyck, the older brother of Jan van Eyck, in the production of the painting,"" said Ron Spronk, Professor of Art History at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, who led the project. ""We ought to look for Hubert's hand in the under drawings of the panels, which were revealed with infrared macrophotography, and with infrared reflectography,"" he explained. Entirely open-source, the website that came out of the documentation process is now live and accessible to art-lovers as well as scholars, allowing users not only to zoom in on tiny details of the work, but also to go beneath the surface of the paint and see how the composition evolved over time. ""At the Getty Foundation, we've always supported the less sexy things that go on behind the scenes of great public projects -- conservation, research, planning -- things that are really crucial but less visible,"" said Marrow. ""But recently we've made a greater effort to take the results of those behind-the-scenes activities and make them more immediately available to a wider public,"" she continued. ""It's technically an amazing feat that they were able to do this so precisely and present the images in such a way that you can juxtapose the regular image, as you would normally see it, with the under-drawings,"" said Antoine Wilmering of the Getty Foundation. While the website has a wide appeal, he said, it will also be an invaluable tool for the next generation of scholars. ""The last conservation on the altarpiece took place in the 1950s with a little bit of work done in the '80s, and the technology was not as advanced as it was today,"" he said. The Altarpiece is to undergo a full, five-year-long restoration treatment beginning in September 2012. The panel will be disassembled in three stages, and the parts being restored will be taken to the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, where the public will be able to view the treatments taking place from behind a pane of glass. Spronk, who lived with the altarpiece for six months while documenting it, told CNN: ""The Ghent Altarpiece has kept many scholars -- and very different types of scholars for that matter -- busy for centuries, and will doubtless continue to do so."" He believes the website will open up a ""whole new world"" for scholars who have toiled for years either working from color reproductions or from the work itself. Still, Spronk concedes that it is no substitute for seeing the work in person. ""What you can't show on a website is the sheer monumentality of the altarpiece, the incredible realism of the painting,"" he said. ""When you are looking eye to eye with the Deity... It's hard to explain, but I can see why the polyptych still grips so many people,"" he said. See the Ghent Altarpiece up close on the Closer to Van Eyck website, or visit it in person at St. Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium.","Minute details of Ghent Altarpiece now available to view online in 100 billion pixels .

"(CNN) -- Concorde is a thing of the past, but a number of companies are racing to release the first supersonic business jet. Aerion Corporation is working on a jet that would reach Mach 1.6 and would possibly be ready for release by 2020, while Spike Aerospace has announced plans for the S-512, a business jet that could travel at speeds of Mach 1.8 and would be available by 2018. So why has it taken nearly 50 years to revisit the concept? According to Vik Kachoria, president and CEO of Spike Aerospace, one of the main issues that plagued the Concorde was the sonic boom -- the disruptive noise that results from the shockwaves created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound. ""At its worst, the sonic boom would sound like a loud thunder clap over your head. It would rattle windows and loosen roof tiles. It was pretty jarring. If you lived under the Concorde's flight path, you might hear it several times a day,"" he says. The effect was so disturbing that most countries either banned supersonic flights, or restricted them from traveling over land. Understandably, this is an issue that the aerospace industry has needed to address in order to make supersonic flight viable. A plane without windows? Kachoria notes that currently, it makes more sense to develop supersonic business jets than larger commercial aircraft, because the plane's diminutive size results in a smaller boom. While he's remained tight-lipped about many aspects of the design (some are still awaiting patent), he recently announced that the S-512 will be built without windows (except for the one the pilots see out of), a feature that will reduce drag and overall cost of the unit. ""Even at subsonic speeds, windows add a tremendous cost to the aircraft because the fuselage has to be designed to support those windows. If you eliminate all that, you create piece with less structural issues, less manufacturing costs, and less parts count,"" he says. It sounds like a claustrophobe's nightmare, though Kachoria has attempted to compensate for the windowless design by installing flatscreens, which can either display the view outside, or can be used to show a movie or PowerPoint presentation -- should a conference need to take place in the air. ""It's not a new concept, but in the past we didn't have the technology -- the flatscreens, or digital cameras to capture the resolution, or the ability to stitch together cameras to create a seamless panoramic view,"" he says. Overall, the saving in manufacturing means each unit will cost between $60 million to $80 million. It's all in the wing . According to Aerion, the main detriment to producing a supersonic aircraft in the near future isn't the boom (an issue even Kachoria admits is still another 15 years or so from being fully resolved), but the cost. ""The reasons speeds haven't changed much since the 1960s has more to do with economics than technology. You just can't have supersonic travel at the rock-bottom fares most passengers prefer"" says Jeff Miller, the director of communications for Aerion. ""Those constraints don't apply to business jets, so it's most likely supersonic technology will be applied there first. Even so, economy of operation is important, mainly in terms of fuel efficiency. If you can't find a way to reduce fuel consumption, you won't have a supersonic jet that will get you very far,"" he adds. When the Concorde slowed down to below Mach 1, it burned though more fuel. Aerion has been researching ways to compensate this with the development of the supersonic natural laminar flow (SNLF) wing, which it has been testing in conjunction with NASA. The wing, which is thinner and shorter than typical plane wings, has been proven to reduce friction drag by 80%, and overall airframe drag by 20%. ""The more drag, the more power required to push a wing through the air,"" explains Miller. A resolution? While work is being done on the sonic boom issue, neither Aerion nor Spike expect to release a jet before it's resolved completely. The early models will likely only be able to reach high speeds when traveling over seas. ""We don't have the sonic boom issue resolved yet,"" admits Kachoria, ""you wouldn't be able to fly above Mach 1 between New York and Los Angeles, for instance. But between Tokyo and LA? You'd see a big time savings.""","A few companies are developing supersonic business jets .
Spike Aerospace has a model that will be built without windows, but will instead have flatscreens lining the cabin .
The biggest challenges to supersonic flight is cost and mitigating sonic boom ."
"(CNN) -- A huge plume of black smoke soared above the picturesque Georgia city of Savannah on Saturday afternoon, prompting officials to urge people to stay inside to avoid the fumes. The fire began around 11:30 a.m. inside a warehouse located in the Georgia Port Authority's Ocean Terminal, just west off of the city's historic riverfront, said Savannah Fire Department spokesman Mark Keller. The warehouse contains pallets of solid rubber that were burning, according to Keller. Crews had contained the blaze to within half the building within a few hours, the fire spokesman said. Firefighters planned to remain on-site overnight. There were no reported injuries or evacuations. CNN iReporter captures flames, black smoke from bridge . If the sight of the large column of rising black smoke wasn't enough, people were being told not to go outside. ""If you don't have to go out, we advise to stay inside,"" Keller said Saturday. The National Weather Service issued a dense smoke advisory through 6 a.m. Sunday for much of Georgia's Chatham County, including parts of the Savannah metropolitan area. This is an extension of a previous advisory that was supposed to end at 11 p.m. Visibility was expected to be at its worst through 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., and problems could become exacerbated when fog mixes in with the smoke. ""Everyone is encouraged to stay indoors as the air quality will be hazardous. Avoid strenuous activities if you must work outdoors,"" the advisory warned. ""Motorists should be alert for sudden changes in visibilities."" The Savannah College of Art and Design tweeted that people should avoid the River Street area, a popular spot for tourists filled with restaurants and stores. Kayvon Gerami, a CNN iReporter, said that people stopped along the Talmadge Memorial Bridge to photograph the fire. ""The black smoke started to look like a tornado,"" the 28-year-old Gerami said. ""And now it smells like burnt tires everywhere."" Firefighters got some help from the weather. Winds were calm, according to the National Weather Service. ""Pretty much (the smoke) is going straight up,"" said Vern Beaver, a National Weather Service meteorologist in nearby Charleston, South Carolina. ""It doesn't seem to, right now, be producing much of a restriction to visibility."" Winds out of the north-northeast were expected to pick up and be about 8 mph, Beaver added. If they do, they'd push whatever smoke is left offshore over the Atlantic Ocean. Authorities haven't yet determined what caused the fire. Keller said it won't be until Sunday or later when investigators can get into what's left of the charred warehouse.

That microchip led Marion County Animal Services to DiBella, and they emailed him with the news he'd been hoping for. ""I was so surprised when I realized it was in Florida,"" said DiBella. ""I didn't even know where Marion County was."" DiBella made the trek to Florida this week to pick Nika up from a family friend who has been caring for her.

"(CNN) -- Beleaguered by felony child abuse charges over the spanking of his toddler son, NFL star Adrian Peterson may now be facing anguish from a past tragedy. The man charged with second-degree murder in the death last year of another one of Peterson's children is now free on bail. Joseph Robert Patterson, who allegedly mortally assaulted the 2-year-old son of the Minnesota Vikings running back in South Dakota, posted a $2 million bond on Friday, said Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead. The victim lived with his mother, who was Patterson's girlfriend. The man is also accused of recklessly causing ""serious bodily injury to the child,"" according to the indictment. And he faces charges of first-degree manslaughter, aggravated battery of an infant and abuse or cruelty to a minor. Patterson has said that the child's death was an accident, that he choked to death on food. Authorities in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, found the child unresponsive back then, and later determined he'd suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse. Soon after that son's death, Viking Peterson returned to the field, telling a sports reporter that it was God's will that he should resume playing. Current abuse scandal . Texas authorities have accused Peterson of injury to a child over the spanking of the other son. The crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $1,000 fine. Photos obtained by TMZ allegedly show Peterson's son's leg covered in marks that could have come from a switch, or thin tree branch. Some of the marks in the photo appeared to have broken the skin. Authorities haven't divulged the details of what led to the charge. But Peterson's lawyer said the ""charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son,"" explaining that his client did so while doling out discipline much like what ""he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas."" The NFL has sidelined Peterson, who is on leave with pay, while he handles the legal challenge. Peterson has defended himself, saying he is ""not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser."" Star athlete . Through the troubles in his personal life, Peterson has shined on the field. In his first pro season in 2007, he set the NFL record for yards rushed in a single game -- 296, against San Diego, according to the Vikings' website. In 2008, he led the league in rushing yards and came in second in 2012. That year, he became the third Viking to receive the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award.

"(CNN) -- The Republican campaign battling Democrat Wendy Davis for the Texas governorship filed a complaint on Thursday accusing Davis of violating state election law. The Greg Abbott campaign's complaint comes just a day after Davis returned from a campaign-funded trip to New York, where she promoted her recently released book and attended a campaign fundraising event, the Houston Chronicle reported. Davis, a state senator, soared into the national spotlight in 2013 when she helped thwart the first effort to pass an anti-abortion bill after holding the Texas Senate floor during a 10-hour filibuster. Wayne Hamilton, Republican candidate Abbott's campaign manager, wrote that Davis ""converted political contributions to her personal use"" in the complaint filed with the Texas Ethics Commission. But Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas fired back, asserting that the campaign funded the trip so Davis could attend a ""campaign event"" in New York and did nothing illegal. ""Any other non-campaign activities were scheduled by and covered by the appropriate parties not affiliated with the campaign,"" Petkanas told the Houston Chronicle. Petkanas added: ""One way you can tell this is a politically motivated and frivolous complaint is that the Abbott campaign filed it today without waiting for the legal opinion they requested on Monday."" Matt Hirsch, Abbott's spokesman, accused Davis of violating state law and called her actions ""outright unlawful."" ""From her history of profiteering at the expense of Texas taxpayers while in the Legislature to using campaign funds to promote a book that enriches her personally, Sen. Davis has demonstrated blatant disregard for ethical standards Texans expect from their candidates,"" Hirsch said, according to the Chronicle. Davis appeared on CNN, MSNBC and ABC this week from New York. Davis is the underdog in the Texas fight as Abbott, the state's attorney general, holds on to a lead of at least 8 points in polls from this summer.","Greg Abbott's campaign manager files complaint with state ethics board .

"Washington (CNN) -- With more than a dozen lawmakers absent due to travel delays caused by bad weather, the U.S. Senate postponed until Tuesday a key procedural vote on a politically charged proposal to extend long-term unemployment insurance affecting some 1.3 million Americans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid received unanimous approval for a postponement from both parties just before the chamber was scheduled to hold the test vote on the first partisan showdown of the new year on Monday evening. Backers of the bill to extend long-term unemployment benefits were nearing the 60 votes they need to clear the procedural vote. Four Republicans said Monday they will join the 55 members of the Democratic caucus to vote to begin debate on the bill. But that's still one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. GOP aides and senators differed on whether any other Republicans would vote for the measure. The vote is scheduled for Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. Big moments on Capitol Hill from here on out should be viewed through the lens of November's midterm elections, especially in the Senate, where Republicans are aiming to retake control. Extending benefits is a political priority for congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama, who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term. Obama reached out to several GOP senators to try to persuade them to support the bill. Many Republicans argue a $6.4 billion extension would hurt the economy and act as a disincentive to job creation. Others members of the GOP have signaled they might back an extension if the cost is offset elsewhere in the budget. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, a Republican who often works across the aisle, got a call from Obama but missed it because he wasn't in the office. Kirk said he wants to help people but insisted Congress must find a way to pay for the measure. ""I, obviously, have people in my state who would benefit. The better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way,"" Kirk said. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is one of the four Republicans who said she would vote to begin debate on the bill. However, she wouldn't rule out blocking it later if cost offsets aren't added. ""I want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it. Ultimately, I think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it's more closely linked to job training for the long-term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back,"" she said. The other three Republicans are Dean Heller of Nevada, a co-sponsor of the bill, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Democrats see themselves in a win-win position on the test vote. They could build momentum for the bill if Republicans back it. They get a political weapon if Republicans don't. Seventeen senators absent . In remarks just before the vote was to have been held, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, noted that 17 members were not in the chamber and urged that the proceedings be delayed ""so we can have a real debate"" and decide how to pay for the extension. Republicans and Democrats alike were delayed by rough winter weather that plunged the Midwest and much of the South into a deep freeze, triggering widespread travel delays. Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted that his commuter flight to Washington returned to South Carolina shortly after takeoff due to a possible engine problem and made a safe emergency landing. Benefits expired . Benefits for the long-term unemployed expired last month after Congress opted not to continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. Democrats insist the program is critical to help Americans who are struggling and to maintain the economic recovery. Republicans argue that the program -- which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cost $26 billion to continue for another year -- is costly and is a disincentive to looking for work. The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7% in November, the most recent Labor Department statistics show. That means more than 10 million people were out of work, a third of them without a job for at least 27 weeks. Obama: Extend unemployment insurance . Over the weekend, key Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, insisted that an extension must include cuts elsewhere to offset the cost. ""I'm opposed to having it without paying for it,"" Paul said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think it's wrong to borrow money from China or simply print up money for it."" House Speaker John Boehner will insist on such offsets before agreeing to an extension, a spokesman for the Republican leader said. Obama supports passage . During his weekly address over the weekend, President Obama underscored that failing to pass an extension could result in a drag on the economy. New year, same old fight over jobless benefits . ""It actually slows down the economy for all of us. If folks can't pay their bills or buy the basics, like food and clothes, local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers,"" he said. While Reid is optimistic about reaching the 60 votes to begin debate, conservative interests are applying heavy pressure and keeping score. The Club for Growth urged all senators to vote ""no"" on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets. ""Congress should end the federal unemployment insurance program and return the authority back to the states, which already have programs in place,"" the group said. ""Absent this, Congress should pay for this extension by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget. After six years, an extension can no longer be called an 'emergency' with any credibility. There is plenty of waste in the federal budget from which to find an offset,"" it said. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Vote is postponed with 17 Senators not present; rescheduled for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The typical South African itinerary runs something like this: Fly into Joburg and explore the urban hipster scene, hop over to Kruger for a safari, then down to Cape Town to sip wine on the waterfront with Table Mountain in the backdrop. And that's fantastic, but it means most visitors miss out on Durban. Joburg is trendy, Cape Town is glamorous, but Durban is cool. Really cool. That's why one million South Africans pack the beaches there every summer (around Christmas or New Year, book early or don't bother). If you're wondering what all those people know that no one else does, here are 10 awesome reasons to visit. The Golden Mile . Durban's beachfront was completely redeveloped for the 2010 World Cup, so it's possible to stroll the length of it on a broad new boardwalk. If it's too hot for a stroll, you can flag a Zulu rickshaw. A century ago, more than 2,000 of them crowded the streets and docks. About 20 registered pullers remain, all wearing beaded headdresses that match the decorations on their rides. Along the roadside, stalls offer beach gear and Zulu crafts. On the beach, sculptors create landmarks and wildlife from the sand. Durban's beach is one of the few places where South Africans of all stripes mingle -- surfers, women in burkinis, pensioners on a stroll and kids playing on the well-maintained public slides. uShaka Marine World . At one end of the Golden Mile is The Point, which overlooks the mouth to the city's famous harbor. Once synonymous with gangsters and dockside prostitutes, The Point now hosts high-end condos, linked by canals so you can keep your boat there. The main attraction is uShaka Marine World, a water park and aquarium. To cool off, you can book a table at the Cargo Hold restaurant (+21 328 8065) inside the shark tank, or step outside to Ocean Ventures and book a surf lesson. Durban's beaches are protected by shark nets and the water's warm enough to swim in year round. uShaka Marine World 1, King Shaka Ave., Point, Durban; +27 31 328 8000 . Moses Mbhida Stadium . At the other end of the Golden Mile is the city's sports complex, dominated by the soccer stadium built for the World Cup. Even if there's not a match on, it's worth a visit to ride up to the top of the arch that stretches over the field for an unrivaled view of the city. There's a quick way down via the Big Rush Big Swing, an 80-meter free fall over the field.

The Sharks Board maintains the nets that protect the city's beaches. It's possible to book an early morning boat ride with the crew that maintains them every morning. The boats leave from Wilson's Wharf and ride through the harbor, which gives a sense of the gigantic scale of the container ships that serve Africa's busiest port. It's rare to see a shark around the nets, but for those that really need a Jaws moment there are public shark dissections at the Board's visitor center.

At the turn of the last century, Mohandas Gandhi came to work as a young lawyer in South Africa, where he had one of his life's formative experiences -- getting kicked out of a ""whites only"" train car. His reflections on that experience eventually developed into his theories of non violence that would go on to shape his campaign for India's independence. In 1904 he bought some land that became known as the Phoenix Settlement, where he lived and opened a printing press to spread his ideas. Both his home and the press are open to the public. Bunny chow . The origins of the name are a mystery, but this curry served in a hollowed-out bread loaf is the quintessential Durban meal. No rabbits are harmed, it's usually beef, chicken or mutton. The theory goes that the dish was created as a meal-to-go that farm workers could hold in one hand. To sample one, look for any crowded takeaway counter or head to Gounden's (520 Umbilo Road, Durban; +27 31 205 5363). Art . Durban's art museum was the first in the country to start collecting African art. It's housed inside the city's neo-Baroque City Hall (Church Street, Durban), which is worth a visit to explore the markets on the surrounding streets or to check out what's on at the Tudor-style Playhouse Theatre (29 Acutt St., Durban; +27 31 369 9555). Contemporary art is best experienced at the KwaZulu-Natal Society of Arts (166 Bulwer Road, Durban; +2731 277 1705), in a custom-designed building that includes a charming shop and cafe set in tropical gardens. Old-school luxury . There's a certain amount of colonial fantasy at play, but the terrace at the Oyster Box hotel is nonetheless one of South Africa's best spots for a sundowner. The balcony overlooks a lighthouse, and the breeze makes you feel like you're floating above the ocean, cocktail in hand. The Oyster Box, 2 Lighthouse Road, Umhlanga; +27 31 514 5000 . Shopping .

For local crafts, you can save yourself a lot of walking and sunburn with a visit to the African Art Centre (94 Florida Road, Morningside, Durban; +27 31 312 3804), a well-curated non-profit that scours the province for the best of the best. For fashion, antiques and bric-a-brac, Helen Joseph Road in Glenwood is lined with retail gems. For something really special, it's worth trying the fresh market at Warwick Triangle, where there are herbal remedies to improve sex drives or chase off mother-in-laws. Honest. Low-key fine dining . Some cities keep their best restaurants in posh locales. In Durban, some of the best dining is at the docks, in a shipping container or in the parking lot of a strip mall. Bud's on the Bay (30 Grunter Gully St., Durban; +27 83 291 7835) offers wharfside dining with its own brand of upmarket bunny chow and creations like Zulu sushi (seared steak). It's in the sort of neighborhood where movie mobsters might dispose of a corpse, but it's both safe and worthwhile. Freedom Cafe (34 St Mary's Ave., Durban; +27 31 309 4453) is cut from an old shipping container parked in a courtyard in one of the city's historic districts. Their breakfast is tops, with a tart that makes kale appetizing. Cafe 1999 (117 Vause Road, Berea; +27 31 202 3406) offers a view of a parking lot, but no one cares because the restaurant is always full of beautiful people and the fresh seasonal food is so good they don't look up anyway.

"New York, NY (CNN) -- It would be wonderful to say that in 2013 things were looking up for women in Hollywood -- both onscreen and behind the scenes -- but the sad news is that the numbers have remained consistently dismal for the last decade. In 2012, in the US, women made up 18% of the directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers, and editors working on the top 250 domestic grossing films. And women directors accounted for just 9%. It's clear that Hollywood has a woman problem. It's not just that they don't trust the vision of a woman to direct; they don't trust that people want to see our stories. There's a prevailing sense that male stories are universal, for everyone, and that women's stories are just for women. Just look around at your local movie theater and you will see that the male action superhero films have become the dominant narratives of our time. Just this summer, we have already seen the release of the latest versions of ""Superman"", ""Iron Man"", ""Star Trek"", ""The Fast and the Furious"", and still to come are ""The Lone Ranger"", ""Thor"", ""Grown Ups"", ""The Wolverine"" among many, many others. The message is loud and clear -- these are the movies that matter -- not only to Hollywood, but, increasingly to the world, as the international box office now accounts for almost 70% of the grosses of these films. And none of the films above are directed by women. The reality that female directors and producers and writers deal with is the ongoing perception that women will go see movies about men and that men won't go see stories about women. The success of ""Bridesmaids"" in 2011 helped diminish the case slightly, as did ""The Hunger Games"" in 2012. But even though women buy half the movie tickets, this perception persists especially for those who want to tell women's stories. Another problem is that because there are so few movies about women, the ones that are released are held up to absurd scrutiny. If you fail the entire gender is blamed and we take two steps back, but on the other hand, if you are a success you can't get a sequel made because women's successes are still seen as flukes. We are stuck in a catch 22. It is worth noting that this summer in the sea of superhero films, there are only two films with women leads being distributed by the major studios. ""The Heat"" is an original comedy, written by a woman Katie Dippold and directed by Paul Feig, the director of ""Bridesmaids"". It stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy both at the top of their game in a genuinely hysterical film. ""City of Bones: The Mortal Instruments"" is the latest attempt to build off the success of the ""Twilight"" franchise. While neither of the movies being released by the studios is directed by a woman, there are a handful of women directed films you can see this summer, at least here in the US. We have films from Sofia Coppola, Susan Seidelman, Margarethe von Trotta, Shari Springer Berman, Rama Burshtein, Jerusha Hess, Katie Aselton, Maggie Carey and Lake Bell. The problem is that all of these films are small, don't have superheroes flying or cities blowing up. These films will be available on a limited amount of screens, so you need to live in place that has more than just a local multiplex or else you will easily miss these films and your entire summer can go by without seeing a single film by a female director. But even though the statistics are still dismal, there are women breaking through all across Hollywood. The reality is that there are women decision makers at all levels in the business. Amy Pascal has been successful as the head of Sony for several years. And just last week a new three person team was named to run Warner Brothers and it includes a woman -- Sue Kroll. And let's not forget Kathryn Bigelow who broke through and became the first female to win an Oscar for best director. She can make any movie she wants at any studio. But she chose to make her last film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" with an independent producer Megan Ellison, who has made quite a name for herself over the last couple of years. And while there are still not enough women directed films at the top tier festivals, this year for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival there was parity in both the US documentary and feature competitions. But we need more women and more female role models as directors because movies have such power in our culture. They are a reflection of who we are and what we value. They are what we talk about at work on Monday morning. They are how we socialize. When we don't see women, and we don't see women's stories, we get the message that women don't matter as much, that our stories don't count, that our experiences are less valid. And that's something that is just not acceptable.","Author Melissa Silverstein highlights Hollywood's women problem in her new book .

More female directors needed to reflect women's voice, says Silverstein ."
"Paris (CNN) -- With his razor-sharp cheekbones and youthful appearance, Olivier Rousteing looks like he could be fresh out of design school. Instead, the 28-year-old is at the helm of one of the most venerable fashion houses in the world -- Balmain. Since taking over in 2011, the Bordeaux-born prodigy has been credited with bringing a fresh, popular-culture aesthetic to the house, while staying true to its spirit and tradition. His richly embroidered, luxurious designs have earned him legions of fans, and his so-called ""Balmain Army"" of supporters includes some of the most glamorous women in the world, from Naomi Campbell to Rosie Huntington-Whitely. Rousteing, who at 25 was the youngest creative director of a Parisian label since the legendary Yves Saint Laurent took the top job at Christian Dior in the 1950s, has also been hailed as a champion of diversity, casting mixed-race and Asian models in his catwalk shows and advertising campaigns. The designer tells CNN about his love of ""wonder women,"" the meaning of luxury, and his friendship with his muse, Rihanna. CNN: What is at the heart of the Balmain DNA? Olivier Rousteing: Pierre Balmain has always been a big designer like Christian Dior or Monsieur Saint Laurent, and when I had this opportunity to take (on) the house I just felt so flattered ... it was an honor for me. And at the same time I wanted to bring back the archives because Pierre Balmain was known for the Jolie Madame silhouette, amazing tailoring and the most incredible embroideries, but I wanted to twist it with my edge, my generation. And I was excited to express all these feelings -- all my culture I had today with all the past of the house which is so huge and so interesting and impressive. CNN: How does your style differ from former creative director Christophe Decarnin? OR: I learned a lot from Christophe. And when I was working at Balmain as an assistant and managing the studio, my job was translating everything he wanted in a fashion way. But Christophe was from another age, another generation, loving different muses and icons. He was more into Kate Moss, rock and roll and Sex Pistols, the 1980s. What I loved about him was all the sex appeal that he wanted to introduce to the house. But my generation is all hip hop, a different culture. Even top models that inspire me didn't inspire him -- it is just a matter of generation. And I think what is important for me today is underlining the luxury of the house, maybe less jeans, less street wear, but keeping the DNA of Pierre Balmain and pushing the embroideries and the craftsmanship because this is something that I think is part of me, and part of the house at the same time. CNN: What is it about Rihanna that inspired you? OR: Rihanna has been my muse from the beginning. I have been listening to her albums since I was young and followed her career. I love women and I love wonder women -- those kind of women who have no boundaries and no (limits) and have this power to express themselves. And I had the chance to meet her two years ago and it was love at first sight -- literally. She showed me how to believe in myself and push the boundaries and limits at the same time keeping control of your life and that I think is the best I could learn from her. CNN: Did you feel pressure for your first show for Balmain in 2011? OR: Actually, I think the first show is the easiest one because you don't know what you expect. But the first minute that I went out on the runway I just realized that my life is going to change. From the second show you realize what it means to be a creative director -- you are more exposed and people don't see you just as a designer -- your personality is really important and they sometimes don't judge you only on your clothes. CNN: What has been the greatest advantage -- and hindrance -- of your youth in this industry? OR: For me it is really important not to lose faith. When you are a baby you just dream to be the President -- you dream to be Miss Universe or whatever -- you don't have boundaries. And I think youth helps (me) to just believe and think there are no boundaries and no (limits). If I had this job at 45 or 40, I don't think I would do the same clothes, I don't think I would express myself in the same way and thanks to my youth I believe so much and I push my boundaries so strongly . CNN: Is it hard to stay grounded? OR: No, because I am close to people who are true and down to earth, and so for me it's not like, 'Oh I am only with celebrities or the woman who is 60 and wearing my clothes.' I have met so many celebrities who are arrogant and hardcore -- they are not my friends. I am just a simple person and maybe it seems weird to say that but sometimes the greatest luxury is to remain true to yourself. CNN: Tell us about your love of Instagram. OR: What is important in my career and my way of being a designer is Instagram. Obviously people see I am selling a dress at $25,000 and that I have this life with celebrities, taking flights all the time ... but with my Instagram people can realize who I am. I can wake up and do a selfie in my flat, go to the gym like 75% of the population, you know, just be normal! CNN: Talk about the inspiration behind this collection. OR: When Rihanna came to my after party last winter she was dressed in my leather skirt a beautiful see-through top, and she was kind of naked underneath. That inspired the whole collection. But it is a happy, joyful collection showing the state of my mind today. I am enjoying my work, I am celebrating my youth, my generation. There is a lot of work behind it, still keeping the couture element, still keeping this dreamy thing that I always have. CNN: What are the last minute preparations in the atelier ahead of the show like? OR: I'm really a control freak! At Balmain, everything needs to come five days before -- that is my limit. But it is still very last minute but really exciting because obviously we get some (pieces) that are really well done, but with others you are like, 'Oh my God, I need to redo it!' I have an amazing team that believes in me and the brand. CNN: What, for you, is the sign of success? OR: When people who I am close to tell me that something is good. You know, in fashion you can't trust too many people. But the people who you trust, you can be sure of, and they are going to tell you the truth, when it's bad and when it's good and that's what I want. But the most important thing is to please myself. If you are sure of yourself, if you like your show people are also going to love it.

"Denver (CNN) -- A man suspected of planting a bomb at a mall in Littleton, Colorado, on the 12th anniversary of the attack at Columbine High School was arrested Tuesday at a grocery store in Boulder, authorities said. Earl Albert Moore was taken into custody at a King Soopers grocery store after customers and employees noticed a man they ""deemed suspicious,"" Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink told reporters at an afternoon press briefing outside the Denver office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The arrest brought to an end a search that began last week after a pipe bomb was discovered on April 20 in a back hallway at the Southwest Plaza Mall, just a few miles from the high school where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed more than a dozen people before committing suicide. The discovery of the bomb at the mall sent a ripple of fear through the community, which was marking the 12th anniversary of the rampage at Columbine. Dozens of Jefferson County schools were locked down. But authorities ruled out any connection between the bomb at the mall and the Columbine anniversary. ""This incident had no bearing on any of the schools in the Littleton school district,"" Mink told reporters. ""There was absolutely no connection."" Police took Moore into custody at the grocery store Tuesday morning, said Boulder police spokeswoman Kim Kobel. Moore, who was turned over to federal authorities, was scheduled to appear in federal court in Denver on Wednesday, FBI Special Agent Jim Yacone said at the news conference. Authorities did not take questions at the brief news conference. It was not immediately known what federal charges Moore would face for allegedly planting the bomb. Moore allegedly planted the bomb at the mall just one week after he was released from the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Estill, South Carolina, authorities said. A federal law enforcement source told CNN Sunday that Moore was serving time for bank robbery when he was released. Federal court records show Moore was sentenced to 18 years in prison for a March 2005 robbery at the Whitesville State Bank in Crab Orchard, West Virginia. Prosecutors asked later for Moore's sentence to be reduced to reflect ""defendant's subsequent substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person."" CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities: Bomb suspect to make first court appearance Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama firmly laid out his plan Thursday to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS, the terrorist organization that now controls large swaths of Iraq and Syria. But what did the American public think of the speech? CNN's Tom Foreman broke down the results of Microsoft's ""Bing Pulse,"" where viewers reacted online in real time to the President's address. Overall, Americans gave the President's speech high marks, but party lines bled through as Democrats had a consistently more favorable perception throughout the speech. And independents stuck closely to Republicans during the 15-minute address. But all viewers rallied around one point in the speech: . ""ISIL is a terrorist organization -- pure and simple -- and it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way. In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality,"" Obama said. And the lowest point in the President's speech came when he announced he was deploying an additional 475 U.S. military advisers to Iraq. It seems the President's assurances that U.S. forces will not ""have a combat mission"" and the U.S. would not get ""dragged into another combat war in Iraq"" didn't make the troop buildup any more palatable. .","Overall, Americans gave President Obama's speech high marks, but party lines did show .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was early one Sunday morning when the killer rang at a front door that was decorated with a wreath for Christmas. When his victim answered, he fired four fatal shots, ran off and disappeared. Police hope the new fingerprinting technique could detectives find new clues on murder weapons. The unsolved murder of Marianne Wilkinson, 68, in a town near Dallas, Texas, in December 2007 has left investigators with few clues and few leads. They recovered the gun used in the crime a few months later, but the gunman's identity -- and his motive -- remain a mystery. Now, a groundbreaking technique developed across the Atlantic Ocean in Britain may help Texas police and others to crack cold cases like this. The technique enables scientists to detect fingerprints on spent bullets and shell casings, even when the print had been wiped off. It works by detecting the minute corrosion of metal caused by sweat, which corrodes the metal in the shape of the fingerprint. ""That sweat is in the pattern of the original fingerprint that was deposited,"" said John Bond, a forensic scientist for England's Northamptonshire Police and a researcher at the University of Leicester, who developed the technique. The corrosion is often impossible to see with the naked eye because it's so small -- as small as a micron, which is a millionth of a meter, Bond said. His method involves dusting the metal with a fine black powder that adheres to the corroded areas, allowing scientists to see the fingerprint. A detective from the police department in North Richland Hills, Texas, where Wilkinson lived in a gabled home with her husband, went to meet Bond late last year, Bond and the department said. Bond was able to obtain a print from the shell casings in the Wilkinson case, meaning police could be able to discern who loaded the gun, if they can find a match, North Richland Hills Police Investigator Larry Irving told CNN. Police are optimistic Bond's technique will bring them another step closer to solving the case. ""Prior to (the detective) coming over, and one of the reasons he came over, is they had little or no forensic evidence for this murder,"" Bond said. ""So my own feeling would be that finding fingerprints would be significant."" Investigators believe Wilkinson may have been the victim of mistaken identity, according to a profile of the case posted on the Web site for the television show ""America's Most Wanted,"" which featured the case. A neighbor whose address is very similar to Wilkinson's told police she had recently gone through a bitter divorce, and that she and her ex-husband had an ongoing business dispute, according to the Web site. Large amounts of money were at stake, the show said, and the woman believed she was the intended target. Investigators traced the gun's history to a man who is now deceased and, authorities believe, had no connection to the slaying, according to the television show's Web site. Police believe the gun has changed hands several times since then and are still seeking information on its latest owners. The bullet fingerprinting technique won't necessarily solve crimes like the Wilkinson case but could unearth new clues, Bond said. ""It's helping police get evidence they didn't have before,"" he said. ""It's simply a new line of inquiry and can be especially valuable with cold cases."" In September, Bond found fingerprints on a shell casing from another murder case -- a 1999 double homicide in Kingsland, Georgia. In that case, the suspect or suspects entered a Title Pawn business downtown, shot and killed the two employees and stole a small amount of money, said Kingsland police lieutenant Todd Tetterton. Police assigned a full-time cold case detective, Christopher King, to the case because of ""some things that had changed."" The department read about Bond's technique in a magazine article and contacted him to see if he could help, he said. ""We were interested in trying anything we could,"" Tetterton said. Four shell casings had been found at the crime scene, but fingerprint testing using traditional techniques didn't reveal anything of use. Bond was able to find fingerprint ridges on three of the four casings, and one of them yielded enough ridge detail to possibly provide an identification, a University of Leicester statement said, quoting King. Tetterton would only say that more than one shell casing was found at the scene, and said Bond was able to get results for detectives. He declined to say more, citing the ongoing investigation. ""The results are surprising,"" the university statement quoted King as saying. ""I feel very optimistic. These results are better than I had expected and better than I hoped for."" Bond doesn't advertise his services, which he performs free of charge. ""All of the inquiries we've had from the U.S. police forces have all been initiated by them,"" he told CNN. ""We never say no, so anybody who says, 'I've got some shell casings, we have some over 30 years old' -- we always say send them and we'll have a look."" Bond says he tries to know as little about a case as possible before he looks for fingerprints, so no one can accuse him later of looking for something specific. In one case, he said, he found a partial print on a shell casing sent in by police in Boulder, Colorado. The detective told him it was a fingerprint they expected him to find. ""That was confirmation for me"" that the technique worked, Bond said. The technique won't work, however, if a person has just washed their hands or put on gloves before loading a gun. But Bond said that's not too much of a concern. ""Because of the nature of who these people are and the nature of what they're committing, personal hygiene is not foremost in their mind when they're doing this,"" Bond said. ""It's also the heat of the moment. They might be sweating, perspiring, because you know you're going to go out and break the law."" -- CNN's Ashley Broughton in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","New fingerprinting technique detects prints on weapons that have been wiped .

"(CNN) -- ""A must-have quality for figure skaters is, I think, gorgeousness."" Daisuke Takahashi throws his head back and laughs, but he is serious. His is a sport where performance is everything -- from the flamboyant routines to the glitzy outfits to the interaction with the crowd. ""The best part about figure skating is how I can have the entire audience's attention to myself,"" Japan's former world champion told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I believe performing and showing off is very important, but I constantly prevent myself from becoming too self-absorbed. The audience won't be moved if I'm performing only for my satisfaction. ""It's sort of like playing 'catch.' For me, when I'm watching musicals or performances, I feel a bit uncomfortable when the actor is too self-absorbed. I like the people who can perform while being sensitive of the atmosphere."" Takahashi was raised to national hero status in 2010 when he became the first Japanese man to win a world singles title in figure skating, having the previous month become the first to win an Olympic medal in the discipline when he took bronze in Vancouver. Despite his success -- he also won silver at last year's worlds -- the 27-year-old admits he still looks up to his rivals. ""I never thought I have anything special. I've always thought about what I don't have compared to other skaters,"" he says. ""I tend to think like other skaters get more applause than I do. I constantly think about ways I can level up, and I'm often jealous of other skaters,"" he adds, laughing. ""When I see someone's cool performance, it makes me want to be like them, and that's what motivates me."" A big part of figure skating is the outfits -- often elaborate lycra creations that might otherwise seem more at home in a musical stage show. ""I don't have long legs and arms, and I am ... short,"" quips Takahashi. ""So I want something that makes me look taller and with longer legs and arms. ""I want something will make me a bit bigger, and so something with flaps that give my arms a little flow."" The shoes, with their thin blades, are even more important. ""If I didn't have them, I wouldn't be able to skate, so it's like the heart,"" Takahashi says. ""I think it's something everyone struggles with, especially for me because my shoes don't last long. I sometimes change them every month or after every competition, and it's very difficult finding the right shoes. Depending on if the shoes are good, it affects the performance, so it's very important."" Born in the city of Kurashiki in Okayama Prefecture, Takahashi wanted to be a gymnast when he was growing up. But, as fate would have it, an ice rink was built near his home and his future was settled by the practical reality of it being closer than the gymnasium where he infrequently trained. ""My mother's co-worker, who really liked ice skating, took me and it made me realize that I really want to do this,"" he recalls. ""Figure skating wasn't famous where I grew up, and the ice rink was just built with a small club team without a professional coach, so the number of skaters was really small. But we all worked together to manage the money, learn tricks, and organize."" At junior high school he met Utako Nagamitsu, who has remained his coach ever since -- she is currently working alongside the Russian Nikolai Morozov, who is now back on Takahashi's team after their initial split back in 2008. ""We've traveled the world together, which other coaches rarely do,"" Takahashi says of Nagamitsu. ""Now it's officially a team, with a nutritionist, trainer, management company, costume maker, music mixer and level check managers, and choreographers."" Takahashi's success in 2010 was all the more satisfying because he had only just returned to full fitness after a serious knee injury that sidelined him for a year. The anterior cruciate ligament problem halted his progress after he won silver at the 2007 world championships -- another first for Japan. ""I'm afraid of injuries. The surgery was good for my mental health, but it was about three years later when I was able to get back my flow,"" he says. ""As for balancing off-ice and on-ice life, right now I try not to because all of it is part of my private lifestyle. I'll take breaks to rest my body, but I generally don't feel like I must take days off."" Takahashi took more time out in 2011 when he had to have the bolt from that knee surgery removed, but he recovered the following year to win his first Grand Prix Final -- which was held in Sochi, the Russian resort city that will host next year's Winter Olympics. ""The most significant competition for me is the Olympics. I've entered the Olympics twice, but the one at Vancouver is the one I can't forget about,"" Takahashi says. ""It was the season after recovering from my injury. It was a competition that I got so excited I started tearing up before it began, which never happened before. ""I got hurt, and I struggled, took out my feelings on the people who supported me, and even then I was able to make the Olympics, and through the season it was the only time when I felt like I was actually competing well. ""It wasn't the perfect performance, but it was my first medal, and I think that was when my life took a different turn."" Takahashi is now hoping to earn one of the three men's places in Japan's figure skating team for Sochi, though his chances were dented when he was forced to miss the defense of his ISU Grand Prix Final title last week due to a leg injury. His 19-year-old rival Yuzuru Hanyu defeated Canada's three-time world champion Patrick Chan to triumph in Fukuoka, while Takahashi's replacement Nobunari Oda was third. Takahashi, ranked third in the ISU standings, is now hoping to return to action at the Japan Figure Skating Championships later this month, needing a strong showing to earn his place for the Winter Games. ""Since three years ago when I decided to continue my career until Sochi, I think emotionally I'm doing everything I can to prepare for it, more than any other Olympics ever,"" he says. ""I don't have the Olympics gold medal, so I definitely want it.""","Daisuke Takahashi is the first Japanese man to win an Olympic medal in figure skating .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey is reacting angrily Tuesday to the French Senate's approval of a law criminalizing the denial of genocide, including that of the Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire. ""Guillotine to History"" and ""Guillotine to Thought,"" blared the front pages of two Turkish newspapers. ""He massacred democracy,"" announced another newspaper, Hurriyet, next to a front-page photo of French President Nicolas Sarkozy. In the run-up to Monday's late-night vote in the French Senate, the Turkish government made no secret it was vehemently opposed to the French law, warning it could cause permanent harm to Franco-Turkish relations. The Turkish foreign ministry put out a pre-dawn statement condemning the law Tuesday. Later, however, Turkey's hot-tempered prime minister surprised some observers, when he called for a ""period of patience"" in a televised speech. ""A mistake was made... history cannot be judged or written by parliaments,"" said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in remarks before lawmakers from his ruling political party. Denouncing the French law as racist and a ""massacre of freedom of thought,"" Erdogan added, ""We have not lost our hope yet that this mistake can be corrected."" The Turkish leader said his government would lobby for a petition of 60 French lawmaker signatures to block the law in France's Constitutional Council. According to the French legislation, ""those who have publicly denied or trivialized crimes of genocide,"" can face a year in prison and/or a 45,000-euro fine. The law does not specifically mention the World War I massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turks. But most of the seven-hour debate in the French Senate Monday focused on the memory of the Armenian genocide. Within minutes of the 127-86 vote in favor of the law in Paris, Armenia's foreign minister issued a statement of gratitude that declared France ""a genuine defender of universal human values."" ""This day will be written in gold,"" wrote Edward Nalbandian. Every year, Armenians around the world commemorate the 1915 slaughter of more than 1.2 million ethnic Armenians. The Turkish government rejects the term ""genocide"" to refer to this dark and bloody chapter of history. Many Turkish politicians and historians argue Muslim Turks were also massacred by Armenian militias in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Instead, Ankara expends significant political capital and issues threats in an attempt to block initiatives in the U.S. Congress to formally term the killings of Armenians as ""genocide."" The United Nations defines genocide as the killing of, injuring of, or displacing of members of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy the group. After the French lower house of parliament passed the genocide law in December, Turkey temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Paris and suspended military ties with France. Turkish politicians have warned of further sanctions against France if Sarkozy allows the new law to go into effect. But in an interview with CNN Monday, the head of the Turkish parliament's foreign affairs committee deliberately avoided saying what those measures might be. ""There's always ambiguity in politics and diplomacy,"" said Volkan Bozkir. ""There will be some (measures)... which will hurt France more than Turkey,"" he warned. Turkey and France enjoyed more than $14 billion in bilateral trade last year. They are also partners in the NATO military alliance.

"(CNN) -- Navigating the political waters in her own family, says one ally, likely prepared Kathleen Sebelius well for the partisan cauldron she's now enduring in Washington over the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website. The embattled Health and Human Services Secretary was the daughter of a Democratic governor of Ohio, then became the daughter-in-law of a Republican Congressman from Kansas. Her husband is a federal magistrate. ""You know, when you've got a father and father-in-law who are from different political parties, both outspoken. ... I think she learned a great deal from that and I think it has served her very well,"" says Ron Pollack of the healthcare advocacy group Families USA. Sebelius will need every ounce of that experience. Republicans in Washington are ramping up their calls for her resignation. She'll very likely face intense questioning next week, when she testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the problems with Healthcare.gov, the sign-up website for President Barack Obama's sweeping healthcare plan. Ryan: Sebelius should step down over Obamacare . Obamacare website developers: It's not our fault . The scrutiny is only getting tougher as Sebelius dodged questions about enrollment numbers and why the administration wasn't better prepared before the rollout. In an exclusive interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Tuesday, Sebelius was asked twice if she would consider resigning. One of her responses: ""I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right. And that's really what I'm focused on."" Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview . Sebelius' Obamacare damage control fuels critics' fire . The healthcare wars are nothing new to her. A Catholic, she drew the wrath of the Church when, as Governor of Kansas, she vetoed a restrictive anti-abortion bill. But as the nation's Health Secretary, she made a decision contrary to her pro-choice record, overruling an FDA recommendation to make the so-called ""morning after pill"" available over the counter to females under 17. As Governor she tried and failed to finance expanded health coverage through cigarette taxes. Earlier, as the state's Insurance Commissioner, she fought to bring premiums down. But one critic says she drove insurers out of the state. ""There was a significant rise in regulations placed on healthcare, which drove the cost of providing healthcare in Kansas up,"" said Todd Tiahrt, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas. ""I think that was the most significant reason, that's why they departed. They felt like they were in a position where it was not profitable to do business in Kansas. So it limited our choices for healthcare providers,"" Tiahrt said. But Pollack defends Sebelius on that score. ""Her first focus is how to help consumers, how to help patients. And she has been on that side all along,"" he says. Born in Cincinnati, Sebelius was the daughter of the late John 'Jack' Gilligan, who served as Ohio's Governor from 1971-1975. They became the first father/daughter pair to serve as governors, with her election in 2002. John Gilligan died in August of this year. Sebelius's husband, Gary, is a federal magistrate judge in Kansas. They have two grown sons. Sebelius's father-in-law, Keith Sebelius, was a conservative Republican congressman from Kansas from 1969-1981. One of Keith Sebelius's top aides was current Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who considers himself a longtime friend of the Sebelius family. But Roberts was among the first members of Congress to call for the Secretary's resignation. Some Sebelius allies believe Roberts turned on her because he's got a primary challenge from a tea party supported candidate. Roberts spokeswoman Sarah Little denies that. She says Roberts was a longtime opponent of Obamacare, but the ""last straw"" for him was when Sebelius went on a public speaking tour just as the rollout calamity began. ""When the ship was sinking,"" Little says. CNN's Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.","Sebelius from prominent politcal family in Kansas .

"(CNN) -- Pot smokers traveling to Denver to take advantage of Colorado's new recreational marijuana law are being warned it's against the rules to carry it through the airport. You won't be searched and there are no drug dogs patrolling Denver International Airport, but if you are searched for another reason, you could lose your weed and face a $999 administrative fine, Denver International Airport spokeswoman Stacey Stegman told CNN on Monday. On Wednesday, Colorado becomes the first state in the U.S. to license retail sales of marijuana, which could lure visitors from other states to the ""mile high city"" by way of the airport. Airport officials have imposed a zero-tolerance marijuana policy to discourage them, Stegman said. ""We don't know what to expect,"" she said. ""We hear these stories that there's going to be more people coming here. We just want to make it clear if people are traveling that they just know the rules."" Even pot smokers who are dropping Grandma off for a flight are warned to leave their stash at home. ""We don't think an airport is a place that you need marijuana,"" Stegman said. Airport visitors who get into trouble for fighting, being drunk or another infraction could be searched, but police will not routinely search for marijuana, she said. Officers at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints will not look for marijuana in carry-on bags or travelers' pockets, but if they find it incidentally, it will be confiscated and airport police would be alerted, according to the TSA's published policy. ""Law enforcement will determine how to proceed with the passenger who is attempting to transport marijuana -- can include arrest, confiscation of the substance, request to dispose of the substance or allowing passenger to proceed,"" the TSA website says. ""Passengers may be warned that if they are traveling into a state where marijuana remains illegal that they could face further consequences."" Denver police, who patrol the huge airport, will decide if a ticket will be issued, just as if it were a speeding ticket, Stegman said. An administrative law judge would hear any cases that are contested, she said. ""Signs are going up, but we still have some processes to go through,"" she said. ""Warnings will be issued for a short period of time."" Colorado cities have authority under the new law to ban marijuana from public property, including municipal airports. While some states are decriminalizing or legalizing pot sales and possession, federal laws against marijuana have not changed. ""We share a space with federal agencies, so we also have to respect their rules and regulations,"" Stegman said. We are trying to make the best of the situation. It is new, and we're all learning.""

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Pope John Paul II was a step closer to sainthood Saturday after Pope Benedict XVI signed a decree recognizing the late pontiff's ""heroic virtues"" and declaring him ""venerable,"" the Vatican said. A miracle attributed to Pope John Paul's intervention will have to be verified for him to be declared ""blessed,"" or beatified. A second miracle would have to be confirmed for him to then be officially canonized, or made a saint. It's too early to say how long that process may take, said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. ""It is recognized that he led a Christian life in a heroic and extraordinary manner,"" Lombardi told CNN. ""This is a fundamental step in the road toward sainthood. Now comes the examination of a miracle, which is the proof of the divine interceding power of John Paul II on behalf of God."" John Paul II died on April 2, 2005, at the age of 84. Several months after his death, his successor said he had dispensed with rules that normally impose a five-year waiting period before beatification. The rule is intended to allow time for evidence and witnesses supporting the sainthood cause to be prepared, as well as to wait for emotions to dissipate after death. But John Paul himself set a precedent in 1999 when he granted a dispensation and let Mother Teresa's sainthood cause begin only two years after her death. ""It's a joy, I think, for the Catholic church because Pope John Paul II is very admired and loved by so many people, not only in the church but also in the world,"" Lombardi told CNN. ""It is good news for us all."" Pope Benedict signed another decree Saturday declaring Pope Pius XII, who died in 1958, venerable, the Vatican said. ""The cause for sainthood for Pius XII was introduced a long time ago,"" Lombardi said. ""Today's decree is not a historical judgment on Pius XII or on his papacy. It is a judgment that the church gives on Pius XII's personal sanctity, on his Christian life achievements. The congregation and the pope have no doubts that Pius XII led a Christian life in an extraordinary and heroic way.""

"London (CNN) -- British authorities are investigating after various female journalists got bomb threats via Twitter amid escalating calls for action to prevent abuse against women on social media. The bomb threats come only days after feminist Caroline Criado-Perez and Labour Party politician Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape threats via Twitter, prompting a wide outcry. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said Thursday the force had ""received a number of allegations relating to threats sent to a number of female journalists on Twitter and inquiries are being made."" No arrests have been made, he said. Twitter faces new pressure to limit hate speech . Hadley Freeman, a columnist with The Guardian newspaper, was one of the journalists sent the online bomb threat Wednesday by an anonymous Twitter user. She alerted police after receiving the message, which read: ""A BOMB HAS BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE YOUR HOME. IT WILL GO OFF AT 10:47."" ""We've gone from rape to bomb threats, I see,"" she said. Another tweet by Freeman said, ""Thanks all for your concern. The police have been round and are now investigating this 'arrestable offense.' "" Freeman had written a column Tuesday titled ""How to use the internet without being a total loser,"" which looked at online misogyny, abuse and freedom of speech issues. Another columnist, Grace Dent who writes for The Independent and others, received the same bomb threat via Twitter. She shared a screen grab of the message, saying ""Well, this is a new low."" Other women to be sent it include Time magazine's Europe editor, Catherine Mayer, who described it on Twitter as a ""Not very credible-sounding bomb threat addressed to me."" Women's editor Emma Barnett of The Telegraph newspaper said she had also received the threat but, rather than report it, had headed to the pub to meet a contact as planned. Explaining her reaction, she said it was in part due to having had ""years of abuse on Twitter and in the comment box beneath my Telegraph articles,"" and in part a lack of faith in the ability of the police to do anything about it. The account from which the bomb threats were sent has been suspended. Arrests after onslaught of rape threats . Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist as well as a feminist campaigner, attracted the attention of Internet ""trolls"" by petitioning to have women displayed on British banknotes. Police in Manchester arrested a 21-year-old man Sunday. Criado-Perez contacted police after a daylong onslaught in which she received around 50 sexually abusive tweets an hour. The feminist champion, whose campaign resulted in the Bank of England agreeing to picture ""Pride and Prejudice"" author Jane Austen on every 10-pound bill, tweeted throughout the abuse: ""I actually can't keep up with the screen-capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now. If anyone wants to report the tweets to Twitter."" Twitter UK's General Manager Tony Wang said the social networking company takes online abuse very seriously, offering to suspend accounts, and called on people to report any ""violation of Twitter rules."" Creasy, who represents Walthamstow in east London in Parliament, became the target of online rape threats after she spoke out in support of Criado-Perez. She tweeted late Sunday: ""You send me a rape threat you morons I will report you to the police & ensure action taken."" A 25-year-old man was arrested in northeastern England on Tuesday on suspicion of harassment, the Metropolitan Police said, in connection with ""allegations made to police by two separate victims, who made reports of malicious communication to police on 25 and 29 July."" An online petition set up on Change.org calling for Twitter to add a ""report abuse"" button to tweets has garnered more than 110,000 signatures. ""Abuse on Twitter is common; sadly too common. And it frequently goes ignored,"" the petition states. The micro blogging site must recognize that its current reporting system ""is below required standards,"" and do more to protect its users, it says. Backlash over rape-threat tweets . Widespread 'women-hating' Vivienne Hayes, chief executive of the London-based Women's Resource Centre, a national umbrella group for women's charities, said the online abuse directed against women is ""extremely concerning."" ""You have to ask the question, where does this come from ... and why do some people think it's acceptable to do that?"" she said. Hayes suggests that the way that women's worth is commonly assessed in the media by their ""physicalness, sexuality and availability to men"" is sending the wrong message to men and women. The Twitter threats are ""one of the more serious manifestations of what appears an unacceptable level of women-hating,"" she said, adding that it points to a society-wide issue that is fairly deep-rooted. Education is key to changing attitudes and making clear that the denigration of women and violence against them are unacceptable, she said. ""I hope the horrendous level of this kind of trolling is going to push this issue into the forefront"" and prompt government action, she said. CNN's Alexander Felton, Atika Shubert and Oliver Joy contributed to this report.","A women's organization says the abuse points to a wider ""women-hating"" culture in UK .

"(CNN) -- While the Maasai delicacy of raw beef washed down with a bloody milk cocktail may not be to everyone's taste, a new class of Maasai master chefs is cooking up something special. Deep in the Kenyan Serengeti, young apprentices from the warrior tribe are tackling haute cuisine from around the world as they strive to become gourmet chefs. This is not just cooking school; this is Maasai cooking school. Opened in 2012, the school is run by the Karen Blixen Camp -- a luxury eco-friendly getaway -- set in the Maasai Mara region in Southwest Kenya, near the border with Tanzania. Students are taught how to master culinary delights from all over the world including French, Italian, Indian and Mexican as well as refining local delicacies. Inka Kanae Simion, 21, graduated last year after leaving his job as a butcher and joining the camp in 2012. He said: ""It was my dream to be a chef. [When] the school opened, I decided that I would not go and look for other schools in Nairobi."" Simion said he wants to be the first of the Maasai students to become a qualified chef, adding: ""My ambition is to run a restaurant where I will be the head chef and start training young educated Maasai students."" Read more: Maasai Cricket Warriors: 'Bowling is just like throwing a spear' The cooking school offers an 18-month course recognized by the Kenyan government and is designed to give students a comprehensive and hands-on approach to international food. ""The cuisine that interests me the most is French ... for instance coq au vin,"" Simion said. ""[I] have visions of getting outside to other countries for further education that will benefit my community."" Throughout the apprenticeship, students are taught to prepare meat, fish and vegetables; make sauces and soups; bake cakes; plan menus and cost food with a special focus on hygiene and storage. Julius Simanka Kireu, 24, is one of a current crop of students trying to make it as a chef. The eldest of eight children, he recalled how just getting to school as a child was difficult enough. ""I left my home every morning and walked five kilometers to school and returned home at 7pm,"" he said. When Julius reached high school he decided to focus on his studies on tourism, a major source of income for the Maasai Mara region. He added: ""I have learned a lot [at the] Karen Blixen Hospitality School, even though I'm still a beginner ... I can make potatoes into soup, sautÃ©, onion rings and many others."" Read more: Maasai tribe's 'last stand' to keep land from game hunters . Since the school opened, 15 students have graduated from the course, with 12-14 of the chefs finding a job and many joining local tourist resorts in the Maasai Mara region. Each year, staff from the Karen Blixen Camp puts up posters in the Mara's biggest communities advertising the program. The chefs and camp managers then begin the selection process to pick the students best suited to the school. Applicants must fill in a form detailing their qualifications from secondary school. If they pass the first stage, it's onto the camp for a written test in basic math and English before a final interview with the head chefs. The college allows students in remote areas, who want to continue their education but might not have the money to move to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, to do so, according to Rune Eriksen, a cooking instructor at the school. ""We are targeting the youth,"" he said, ""so hopefully they will have employment for the rest of their lives... Our vision is to try and equip our students with the same knowledge and skills as other schools."" In the first term, students learn basic cooking skills before taking up an internship at a camp or lodge in the second term. In the final six months, the young chefs return to school and are taught how to cook creatively and perfect presentation. Watch this: Eat like a Maasai . Eriksen, who is from Denmark, said each student pays a fee of 27,000 Kenyan shillings [$314] to attend the school, which also receives funding from the Danish government as part of a long-term aid project. But the rapid population growth in the Mara is causing a ""major problem"" for employment, according to Eriksen, and the local tourism camps are struggling to cope. ""With this expansion comes more livestock to support the Maasai,"" he said. The cattle herds prefer to use domestic dogs to guard their cattle but ""these dogs are slowly turning feral and pushing the wildlife away,"" Eriksen added, which is posing a problem for the resorts and tourists, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Serengeti's exotic animals. As a non-profit organization, the Karen Blixen school -- named after the Danish author who wrote the memoir ""Out of Africa"" -- appeals to donors to sponsor the school fees of young Maasai students for a chosen period, covering learning equipment, books and kitchen tools. In return for the fee, aspiring chefs are given full board and food and are taught additional English and IT skills to prepare them for work in the tourism sector. ""Most students don't own or have a computer at home, and some of them haven't even been exposed to a computer before,"" said Eriksen. ""The very first IT lesson is to learn how to turn on a computer, then eventually how to write an application and so on."" He continued: ""The students are often quite skilled in English, so our English lessons are focusing more on words and phrases used in the kitchen... Classes [in] business, math [and] German are turning the chefs into professionals."" When the qualified chefs complete the course, they are presented with a diploma at a graduation ceremony attended by friends and family; guests are then treated to some traditional Maasai dancers from the local community. After graduating, students are encouraged to branch out of the Mara region; to become head chefs at restaurants in Kenya's capital city, Nairobi, and even overseas while gaining valuable life experience, according to Eriksen.

"(CNN) -- South Sudanese rebels seized a strategic oil town last week, separating terrified residents by ethnicity before killing hundreds, the United Nations said. Residents sought shelter in churches, mosques and hospitals when the rebels raided Bentiu town, the world body said in a statement. ""We believe that at least 400 people were killed in Bentiu in the past week,"" said Toby Lanzer, the top United Nations official in South Sudan. In one mosque alone, more than 200 civilians were reportedly killed and 400 others wounded, according to the United Nations. Before the attacks, some rebel commanders broadcast messages on local radio warning certain groups to leave town. ""Others broadcast hate messages declaring that certain ethnic groups should not stay in Bentiu and even calling on men from one community to commit vengeful sexual violence against women from another community,"" the U.N. Mission in South Sudan said. At one hospital, Nuer men, women and children who refused to cheer the rebels were killed, according to the United Nations. People from other South Sudanese communities and the Darfuris, who hail from the war-ravaged Sudan region of Darfur, were also targeted and killed, the U.N. said. Most of the atrocities occurred on April 15 and 16. In the United States, the Obama administration said it was ""horrified"" by reports of hundreds massacred. ""Images and accounts of the attacks shock the conscience: stacks of bodies found dead inside a mosque, patients murdered at a hospital, and dozens more shot and killed in the streets and at a church -- apparently due to their ethnicity and nationality -- while hate speech was broadcast on local radio,"" the White House said in a statement. ""This is exactly the violence and suffering the South Sudanese people fought for decades to escape."" Two rivals, a lot of violence . The Nuer community backs rebel leader Riek Machar while his rival, President Salva Kiir, is a Dinka. The two leaders have been embroiled in a power struggle since December, with the President accusing Machar of trying to oust him through a coup. Since the attempted coup last year, militia loyal to both have battled each others' forces. Violence has quickly spread, with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide. """"The very future of South Sudan is at stake in this conflict and the greatest death toll of this crisis may not come from the killings, but from hunger and disease among the 3.7 million people at severe risk of food insecurity,"" Lanzer said. The White House called for both Machar and Kiir to denounce attacks on civilians. Grenades, mass killings . Armed militants attacked a U.N. peacekeepers' base sheltering civilians last week, killing at least 48 people and injuring dozens. They used rocket-propelled grenades to breach the compound where peacekeepers had been hosting and protecting nearly 5,000 civilians in Bor. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war. But numerous armed groups have remained active in the oil-rich country. More than one million people have been forced from their homes amid the violence, Lanzer said.

"(CNN) -- You probably never met Harry Stamps. I never met him either. And, sadly, now he's gone. Harry left this world last Saturday. He was 80. Of course, there's no real reason why any of us should know Harry. He's just some guy from Long Beach, Mississippi. Though I say that with complete reverence. ""Just some guy"" is usually the one who helps you fix the lawn mower. Or looks after your dog. Or loans you his truck so you can go to Costco and buy 80 cases of pudding and maybe some lobster dip. I have needs. A truck would be helpful. But while most of the world never got to meet the man, now, thanks to the Internet, countless thousands know his name. And it's all because of one of the greatest obituaries ever written. When Amanda Lewis sat down to eulogize her father there was no way she'd know her words would go viral. Generally speaking, obituaries don't get wildly passed around online, for they tend to lack cats. Which Harry hated. ""He wouldn't know what going viral means,""Amanda told the local Sun Herald newspaper. ""He would have thought that was a disease he contracted, which would have excited him to have another illness to lord over folks."" After all, Harry never lost in ""competitive sickness."" So, Amanda's humorous and touching obit for her dad quickly spread throughout Facebook and other social media sites, and readers were treated to wonderful sentiments about the man she described as a foodie and a natty dresser. To this first point -- that of him being a foodie -- Amanda notes his membership in the Bacon of the Month Club. The fact that this even exists should give us all hope. On the other hand, Harry also loved a martini glass filled with buttermilk, garnished with a chunk of cornbread, which does seem rather weird. (This, says the guy who eats dry Ramen noodles.) Weird or not, Amanda added that, ""As a point of pride, he purported to remember every meal he had eaten in his 80 years of life."" And when it came to style, there wasn't a runway in the world that would have him. Unless it was, say, an actual runway. ""His signature everyday look was all his: A plain pocketed T-shirt designed by the fashion house Fruit of the Loom ... his black-label elastic waist shorts worn above the navel and sold exclusively at the Sam's on Highway 49."" But most importantly, Harry loved his grass-stained Mississippi State University baseball cap. It was kind of his thing. And, somehow, when you look back on a man's life, that just sounds way better than, ""Yeah, Dad was really into Brooks Brothers."" Not that there's anything wrong with Brooks Brothers -- there isn't -- but it's sort of funny how, in the end, something like that grass-stained MSU baseball cap seems to matter. So long as it's not too gross. ""Ol' Wilbur wore that very same undershirt for 60 straight years. Never washed it. You could smell him from Tucson."" Yes, just like that hat, Harry enjoyed the simple things in life, and he had incredible wanderlust for the natural world around him. Amanda wrote that her dad traveled extensively. ""He only stayed in the finest quality AAA-rated campgrounds,"" the obit reads. ""Many years later he purchased a used pop-up camper for his family to travel in style, which spoiled his daughters for life."" But there were things that Harry didn't like. Besides cats, he also couldn't stand ""Law & Order,"" Martha Stewart, and daylight saving time. To the latter, Amanda made sure to point out, ""It is not lost on his family that he died the very day that he would have had to spring his clock forward. This can only be viewed as his final protest."" The whole obituary is filled with little gems like these, and there's nothing I can write here that will do it any justice. You simply need to read it for yourself. It's brilliant. When I emailed Amanda asking for photos of her dad, she wrote me back and said, ""This whole thing is surreal. My dad was the most authentic person I have ever known. It tickles me that this Every Man has resonated with so many people."" And at the obituary's conclusion, Amanda hoped her Every Man father could resonate, perhaps, a little more. It ends with a plea. ""Finally, the family asks that in honor of Harry that you write your Congressman and ask for the repeal of Daylight Saving Time. Harry wanted everyone to get back on the Lord's time."" Of course, Washington politicians probably won't listen to any protests in Harry's name. He was just some guy from Long Beach, Mississippi.

"London (CNN) -- The widening phone-hacking scandal that brought down one of Britain's biggest newspapers claimed two more casualties Sunday as authorities arrested the paper's former editor, Rebekah Brooks, and London's police chief announced plans to resign. ""As commissioner, I carry ultimately responsibility for the position we find ourselves in. With hindsight, I wish we had juggled some matters involved in this affair differently. I didn't and that's it,"" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson told reporters. His announcement came hours after authorities arrested former News of the World editor Brooks in connection with British police investigations into phone hacking and police bribery, her spokesman said. Brooks was released around midnight, but it remained unclear whether she would testify as scheduled Tuesday at a House of Commons hearing on the scandal. Stephenson stressed Sunday that he had behaved ethically, but said he decided to resign because increased scrutiny connected to the case would burden his department and detract from its accomplishments. ""I have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met's links with News International at a senior level,"" said Stephenson, who became commissioner in 2009 of the Metropolitan Police, which also is known as Scotland Yard. Stephenson's announcement came a day before British Home Secretary Theresa May is scheduled to make a statement to British lawmakers about relations between the Metropolitan Police and a former executive editor of the News of the World who was arrested last week in connection with the phone-hacking scandal. The former editor, Neil Wallis, became a communications consultant to the Met after leaving the paper. On Sunday, Stephenson denied accusations that the department suspected Wallis' involvement in phone-hacking when they hired him as a consultant. ""I had no knowledge of the extent of this disgraceful practice and the repugnant nature of the selection of victims that is now emerging, nor of its apparent reach into senior levels,"" Stephenson said. ""I saw senior figures from News International providing evidence that the misbehavior was confined to a rogue few and not known about at the top."" The Scotland Yard chief also denied that his free stay at an expensive spa earlier this year had anything to do with Wallis' connection with the resort, Champneys. In a statement earlier Sunday, the Met said Stephenson's stay was arranged by the resort's managing director, who is a personal family friend. ""There has been no impropriety and I am extremely happy with what I did and the reasons for it. ... The attempt to represent this in a negative way is both cynical and disappointing,"" Stephenson said. British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a statement Sunday praising Stephenson for his ""long and distinguished career."" ""While I know that today must be a very sad occasion for him, I respect and understand his decision to leave the Met, and I wish him well for the future,"" he said. He added that Metropolitan Police investigators must ""do everything possible to ensure the investigations into phone hacking and alleged police corruption proceed with all speed, with full public confidence and with all the necessary leadership and resources to bring them to an effective conclusion."" Earlier Sunday, authorities arrested Brooks. She was being quizzed by police in London after having come in by appointment, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said. Brooks did not know she was going to be arrested when she arrived, her spokesman Dave Wilson said. The police agency does not release names of suspects arrested and police officials referred CNN to a statement describing an unnamed 43-year-old woman's release when asked whether Brooks remained in custody. Brooks' spokesman told CNN she was released shortly before midnight and was at home early Monday morning. Scotland Yard said the woman was released on bail and is scheduled to return to a London police station in October. Brooks resigned on Friday as chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's News International, which published the News of the World. The company also did not know she was about to be arrested when it accepted her resignation, a News International source told CNN Sunday, asking not to be named discussing internal corporate affairs. It was not clear how her arrest will affect the hearing Tuesday in the House of Commons. Committee member Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament, said the committee chair was ""taking legal advice"" on the situation. Wilson said that over the next 24 to 36 hours Brooks' attorneys will be in discussion with the select committee to see whether her appearance at the hearing is still appropriate. Mark Stephens, a prominent British media lawyer, told CNN the arrest was ""somewhat theatrical,"" given that Brooks has apparently not been charged with a crime. Brooks had asked police since January whether they wanted to speak with her, but was told that was not needed, Wilson said. While she received a call Friday to come in Sunday and answer questions, she was not told she would be arrested on arrival, Wilson said, adding that it came as a shock to Brooks. Brooks is adamant that she is innocent of any wrongdoing, Wilson said. Brooks is the eighth person arrested in connection with the phone-hacking probe and the fourth arrested in the bribery investigation, police said Sunday. Two people, including Brooks, have been detained over both probes, meaning a total of 10 people have been arrested. News International said Sunday before the arrest that it would ""not tolerate wrongdoing"" and was determined to rebuild its reputation. News International said it would compensate those affected by its illegal phone hacking, cooperate fully with the police and had hired a law firm to ""examine past failings"" and recommend new procedures to make sure they are not repeated. The promise comes in national newspaper advertisements in all the major Sunday British newspapers -- a group that this week does not include the News of the World for the first time in 168 years. Murdoch closed the paper last week, less than a week after it came out that reporters working for him had illegally eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl, Milly Dowler, and deleted some of her messages to make room for more. She was later found dead. Closing the paper has not put an end to the scandal, which has exposed the close links the British press has with both politicians and the police. Media baron Murdoch apologized to the British public with full-page advertisements in seven national newspapers Saturday. ""We are sorry,"" says Saturday's ad, which was signed by Murdoch. He did not sign Sunday's ad. ""The News of the World was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself. We are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred. We are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected."" Murdoch's apology comes after his media empire lost two top executives Friday. Brooks on Friday resigned from her post as chief executive at News International, the British arm of Murdoch's News Corp. Hours later, her predecessor, Les Hinton resigned. Murdoch also visited Milly Dowler's family on Friday. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for the paper. There were also allegations that News Corp. reporters may have bribed police officers. Murdoch's campaign of contrition started 12 days after the scandal first broke and barely a week after the News of the World, Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid, was shut down by News International in the face of public outrage. Murdoch, his son, James, and Brooks are to appear before British politicians Tuesday to answer questions over the phone hacking scandal. Some of the claims Brooks faces relate to the News of the World's alleged hacking, while she was editor, into Dowler's mobile phone account. She has warned that her answers may be limited by ongoing police and judicial inquiries. ""As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt, and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place,"" she said in a statement Friday. Hinton, who most recently served as chief executive of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, wrote to Murdoch to say that although he had been unaware of alleged misconduct when he was executive chairman of News International, which operated the now-defunct News of the World, he had to take responsibility. ""The pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable,"" he said in a letter provided by Dow Jones. Cameron has been among those publicly decrying the hacking, blasting Murdoch's company Wednesday as he launched a high-powered judge-led investigation into the nation's press. Yet he has his own ties to the scandal, given his relationship with Andy Coulson. Coulson resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 after his former royal editor and a private detective were convicted of conspiracy to hack into royals' voice mails. But while offering his resignation, he insisted he had been unaware of the crimes and he was not charged at the time. After last year's election, Cameron became prime minister -- and appointed Coulson as his communications director. Coulson resigned as Cameron's spokesman in January when the scandal blew up afresh. Cameron hosted Coulson overnight in March at Chequers, the prime minister's country estate, a Downing Street source said Friday. The aim of the invite, added the source, was to thank his former communications director for his work on Cameron's behalf. Earlier this month, Coulson was arrested in connection with claims of phone hacking and corruption dating to his days as the News of the World editor. After the arrest, the prime minister took full responsibility for hiring Coulson. But while not denying this personal connection, Cameron has maintained public pressure against News Corp. Meanwhile, the FBI is also investigating News Corp. after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of September 11 survivors, victims and their families. Murdoch's News Corp. encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. News International -- a British subsidiary of News Corp. -- owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.

"(CNN) -- The animal kingdom is full of big beasts, but it's the graceful nature of the horse which speaks loudest on the artist's canvas. From the dawn of time, the horse has evoked passion and wonder amongst humans since its image was scrawled against the walls of caves. It has inspired novels, starred in films and has become the darling of the art world with collectors spending millions of dollars every year. Grace . ""Personally, I cannot think of any animal more artistically stimulating than the horse, its grace, power and speed, are all begging to be captured in pencil, paint or clay,"" Society of Equestrian Arts chairwoman Deborah Burt told CNN. ""The horse is strong, yet fragile; it has the potential for danger, whilst capable of being incredibly gentle. ""You can echo it's elegance through the fashions of Ascot or surrounding the polo field. It can be found in the wildest locations, from the vast expanses of the American plains (Remington) to the shady woodland of England's New Forest. ""I have been drawing horses since I could hold a pencil, and will do so until the day I die. More than any other animal, the horse is equally capable of taking the lead in your artwork, or as a supporting role. It's the perfect muse."" Stubbs . If Burt has been seduced, so too was the 18th Century painter George Stubbs, who captured the beauty of the horse in a way that transcended the work of other artists of his generation. Initially fascinated by the anatomical structure of the animal, Stubbs built upon his early sketch work before moving onto painting large canvases such as his renowned 'Whistlejacket' which was finished in 1762. The publication of his work, ""The Anatomy of the Horse"" in 1766 enabled him to capture the elegant nature of the animal with a skill that few others possessed. His work won him plenty of admirers and after settling in London in 1758, Stubbs began to paint for the English aristocracy. In his book, ""The Anatomist Anatomis'd - an Experimental Discipline in Enlightenment Europe,"" Andrew Cunningham explains the development of Stubbs' style. ""His dedication to the skeletal and muscular anatomy of the horse certainly enabled Stubbs to produce much more life like portrayals of horses, especially with respect to their musculature than had been achieved even by the great masters of painting,"" Cunningham wrote. ""No one portrayed horses so accurately before. In this he was more true to nature, as he wished to be."" Dollar signs . Modern collectors scramble to get their hands on anything painted by Stubbs and in July 2011, his ""Gimcrack on Newmarket Heath, with Trainer, a Stable-Lad, and a Jockey"" sold for $35.9 million making it the third most valuable old master painting to be sold at auction by Christie's. Gimcrack, one of the most famous and iconic racehorses of the 18th Century, won 28 of his 36 races, coming home unplaced just once. The painting showed Gimcrack twice -- in the foreground being rubbed down by a stable lad and also in the background where he was winning a ""trial."" ""When Stubbs came along he took it to another level as he had an anatomical interest in horses and drew the muscle structure,"" Brandon Lindberg of Christie's, the world's leading art business, told CNN. ""In terms of looking at Britain, the painting of horses became more popular in 17th Century and the restoration of British monarchy and Charles II building a palace in Newmarket. ""It followed the growth of interest in racing and was also tied in to the interest in hunting, particularly stag hunting in the 17th Century and then fox hunting in the 18th Century. ""It became an allied art -- a recording of human interest for the sport."" Cave time . Thousands of years before Stubbs was painting, the horse had been visualized in the Palaeolithic cave images which adorn the walls of the the Lascaux Caves in south west France. ""It's the most paintable subject in animal world,"" renowned artist Terence J. Gilbert told CNN. ""The horse is such a beautiful animal to and is an inspiration to all. ""With a race horse, it has so many variations in form, in color and style."" Gilbert began his work as an illustrator before moving onto painting. As a young boy, he would accompany his father to race tracks across southern England and it was there that his love affair with horses began. Since then, he has painted some of the most famous and iconic horses in history such as Denman, Kauto Star and Yeats, while he was also recently commissioned to paint Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Coolmore Stables in Ireland. Classic . ""A classic painting can take anything from two to three weeks with Gilbert currently working on a painting of the Queen's Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate. ""It is the movement of the horse which interests me,"" he added. ""You paint every aspect in the way you can and you make it perfect. It's difficult to do that with a photograph. ""In a photo, you might get one part of it that looks great but another which isn't as good. With a painting, it's possible to make it all perfect."" For some, such as Michelle McCullagh, the opportunity to capture the horse during the gallop at the racecourse is one of the most fascinating aspects of her work.. ""A large, lush field full of thoroughbred mares and foals basking in the sunlight is heavenly to see,"" she said. ""To be there, with them, drawing, adds to the very special experience. Yet there is nothing more exciting and challenging, than to be stood at the side of the gallops or at the race course, where the atmosphere is so diverse. ""There is always something for the artist -- a shining horse being washed off, walking round the paddock, jockeys jumping on, spooky, skittish horses, exhausted horses and with the fit thoroughbred, so much of the anatomy is there to see. It is excellent. I love it.""","The horse has inspired paintings, novels and films .

"(CNN) -- Fifteen hundred elections and ballot initiatives will be decided Election Day 2013. Although no congressional or presidential candidates are on the ballot, the results of the votes will have a significant impact on the everyday lives of millions of Americans. With so much on the line, we Americans owe it to our families, friends, neighbors and communities to get out to the polls. Today, September 24, is National Voter Registration Day, which gives millions of Americans who aren't on the voter rolls a chance to easily register. On Election Day, which falls on November 5, the outcomes of many major political races will be determined, including the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia. Once elected, these governors will work with their legislatures to draft their states' budgets and determine how much road improvements, parks and school systems will be funded and whether state taxes will go up, down or stay the same. Several mayoral elections will also be decided in November, including the race to lead New York City, America's largest metropolis. Parents will be asked to determine the makeup of school boards, many of which face tough decisions because of budget cuts -- one of the toughest being whether to close schools. Entire communities will need to determine the outcomes of ballot referendums that will amend state constitutions or establish or recall local laws that affect everyone in the community. It is important that all Americans help make those decisions. To that end, more than 800 organizations, including the National Association of Secretaries of State, are taking part in the largest one-day effort of the year to register voters and secure their participation in the American political system. Identified as a national day for civic action, National Voter Registration Day brings together nonprofits, volunteers, celebrities and political leaders to engage potential voters on the ground through coordinated events nationwide. From bus and rail stops, to retail stores and malls, to concerts and fairs, thousands of voter registration events are planned. Why create a day to bring national attention to voting? Because voting is the bedrock of our democracy and how every American takes ownership of the communities where we live, work and play. Voting is also the easiest way to make your opinion known on any issue -- local, state or national -- that's important to you and your family. To improve our schools, we must vote. To restore or build new parks that our kids can safely play in, entire communities must vote. To improve our transportation infrastructure, every American has to vote. In 2012, more than 300,000 Americans registered to vote during the first National Voter Registration Day. This year, we will continue to do for civic engagement what Earth Day does for global warming and environmental awareness. On September 24, we encourage and welcome all Americans who aren't on the voter rolls to join us in a celebration of our democracy by registering to vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rosario Dawson.","Rosario Dawson: Today is National Voter Registration Day, making it easy to register .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie is the founder and ""chief shoe giver"" of TOMS Shoes, a company that matches every pair of shoes it sells with a free pair to an impoverished child. Blake Mycoskie started TOMS Shoes in 2006. The company is committed to giving free shoes to poor children around the world. CNN caught up with the 32-year-old entrepreneur to talk about the inspiration behind his revolutionary business and what he has planned next. CNN: Tell us about the TOMS model. Mycoskie: The TOMS initiative is very simple: For every pair of shoes we sell, we give a pair away. When we know that say, we're going to sell 10,000 pairs this spring, we make another 10,000 to be given away. CNN: Where did you get the idea to start TOMS? Mycoskie: I decided to go back to some of the places that my sister and I had visited on ""The Amazing Race."" [Mycoskie and his sister participated in the reality TV show in 2002.] . I found myself going on to Argentina. I went to some of the villages and it was one of the defining moments of my life when I saw these kids not wearing shoes. That's where I kind of had this 'ah ha' moment. I started thinking, what if I started a business where every time I sold a pair of shoes, I would guarantee that customer that I would give another pair to someone who does not have shoes? CNN: How did you pursue your vision? Did you have any experience as a designer or shoemaker? Mycoskie: I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition. There were a lot of really cool styles of shoes in Argentina that we did not have in the United States so I picked one of them, the alpargata, and I started figuring out how to make shoes. CNN: Did you expect the company to be a big success when you launched? Mycoskie: I was not really looking to make any money on the deal. I wanted to be able to sell the shoes for enough money to give away another pair and to hire one or two people to administer it and keep it going once I went back to work. But what I found was that not only did people find this concept just very intriguing - from a fashion perspective, people loved these shoes. All of a sudden I started selling in the top boutiques. CNN: When did you realize that TOMS was going to be much more than a small project? Mycoskie: I think the crowning moment was when Vogue magazine called and that was a few months after we started. That was when I was really like, 'Wow, this is not just some small little shoe philanthropy that I have created.' This could be a real business and it could be a real player in the fashion industry and it could really set a tone for how fashion companies could give back. CNN: Has philanthropy always been a priority for you? Mycoskie: I always thought that I would spend the first half of my life making money so I can spend the second half of my life giving it all away. And one of the defining moments of my life was when I realized that I could do both at the same time with TOMS. CNN: What are some of your proudest achievements? Mycoskie: One thing that is most unique about TOMS and I think that I'm most proud of is that every single pair [of shoes] is hand placed onto a child's foot. CNN: How has TOMS evolved since you started it in 2006? Mycoskie: A big part of our business that has changed over the past year is that now we also have a travel organization that takes volunteers all over the world on these trips and [they] get the experience of giving away the shoes. CNN: Tell us about the process of producing TOMS. Mycoskie: A very big passion of mine and that of the people that run our production is finding factories that have fair labor practices and treating them more like partners in our family than people just who are going to produce for us. One of the things we have always done with all of our factories is I personally visit them and we actually show our documentary film about what we do. When you connect with the factory like that, everything goes much better. CNN: You've called yourself a serial entrepreneur. Do you have another business in the pipeline? Mycoskie: I can honestly say that TOMS is my future. I mean I have no desire to start any other company for as long as I live because this is the perfect blend of business and philanthropy to me. CNN: What's next for TOMS? Mycoskie: The future of TOMS is really creating a whole new business model of this one-for-one giving and expanding the TOMS model from shoes into other products as well. So while we are not committed to doing anything else right now, we are looking for partners out there who have great products and that want to find a way to incorporate giving back.","Blake Mycoskie talks about his innovative business, TOMS Shoes .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish authorities have scrambled divers, helicopters and coast guard ships in an effort to find and rescue eight crew members missing after a cargo ship sank in a storm off Turkey's Black Sea coast Tuesday night. An official from Turkey's transportation ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity according to Turkish bureaucratic custom, told CNN the Cambodian-flagged ship Vera sank ""due to bad weather conditions"" after it anchored off the coast of the Turkish town of Eregli. Three members of the 11-person crew were rescued after the ship initially went under, authorities said. Ten Ukrainians and a Georgian crewed the ship, which departed from the Russian port of Rostov carrying a load of scrap metal. For several days, unusually cold weather and snow have slammed central and western Turkey, as well as other regions of Europe and Eastern Europe. In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, the municipality mobilized more than 2,400 personnel and some 870 vehicles to try to keep roads open, as snow reached depths of up to 47 centimeters (1.5 feet). The unusual snowfall forced the cancellation and delay of scores of flights, as visibility was occasionally reduced to less than 50 meters mid-morning Wednesday. Istanbul also suspended its high-speed sea bus service, which ferries passengers up and down the Bosphorus Strait and stretches of the Marmara Sea. According to the Istanbul municipality's website, at least 378 homeless citizens have been brought to shelters and hotels to escape the freezing temperatures.","The cargo ship was carrying a load of scrap metal .

"(CNN) -- Ugandans voted Friday in a presidential election that could extend the term of the incumbent, who has been in power for 25 years. A new term would give President Yoweri Museveni five more years. This is the third consecutive time opposition front-runner Kizza Besigye has run against Museveni. Voters lined up early to cast their ballots at various venues including schools, government offices  and churches. In the capital, Kampala, streets were calm and empty, with increased security forces patrolling in riot gear. Besigye -- who was a former doctor for Museveni -- lost presidential bids in 2001 and 2006. His party said it anticipated rigging, and it plans to conduct its own tally as soon as the polls are closed. The government has dismissed the accusations and said the opposition is trying to undermine the election. ""We plan to have our own tally and release it in 24 hours,"" said Margaret Wokuri, a spokeswoman for the opposition Inter-Party Cooperation. ""We cannot trust an electoral commission that was appointed by the ruling party. We have to have our own check mechanism."" Museveni, leader of the ruling National Resistance Movement party, has led the country since a rebel group he was aligned with seized the government in 1986. He was once hailed for stabilizing Uganda and helping combat the AIDS epidemic, but has faced mounting criticism over corruption and lack of political transition in the country. Parliament removed presidential term limits in the east African nation five years ago, essentially allowing the incumbent to run for office indefinitely. About 14 million people are registered to vote in the presidential and parliamentary ballot. There are a total of eight presidential candidates, Wokuri said. Journalist Tom Walsh contributed to this report.","Election could extend the term of President Yoweri Museveni .

"Rome (CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi began a year of community service for his conviction on tax fraud charges on Friday when he showed up at a senior center near his hometown, Milan. The 77-year old billionaire tycoon must visit the center for the elderly at least once a week for a minimum four hours. The community service order is in lieu of house arrest. The former premier is expected to work with 20 residents with Alzheimer's disease in the home, run by the Sacred Family Foundation, Fondazione Sacra Famiglia, in Cesano Boscone outside Milan. Upon Berlusconi's arrival at the center, a member of a health care workers' trade union, Pippo Fiorito, staged a small protest against his presence. ""His place is in a jail, not here,"" Fiorito said. Berlusconi gave no comment as he entered the building. His security guards were left outside. The center's director has barred all staff and residents from taking or distributing photos or video of Berlusconi inside the building, in accordance with its privacy rules. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has dominated the lively Italian political scene for the past two decades. He was handed a four-year sentence last August -- commuted to a year -- for tax fraud at Mediaset, the large commercial broadcaster that Berlusconi founded. He has also been barred from holding public office for two years and was expelled from the Italian Senate in the fall. Last month, a Milan court ruled that Berlusconi could be assigned to social work at the elderly center as an alternative to house arrest. He also faces restrictions on his movements within Italy. Berlusconi continues to protest his innocence and says he has been persecuted by leftist magistrates. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","Silvio Berlusconi is carrying out community service at a center for the elderly for a year .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A Spanish politician accused of reckless driving after a car crash that killed two Cuban dissidents was sentenced to four years in prison, Cuban state media said Monday. Angel Carromero had faced a possible sentence of 10 years after the crash that took the life of well-known Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya in July. Paya had been one of the more prominent activists to challenge the Cuban government's authority and single-party form of rule. His death provoked an outpouring of grief in Cuba and abroad, and also questions about how the crash that took his life occurred. Read more: Dissident Cuban blogger arrested, colleagues say . Paya's widow Ofelia Acevedo said she did not believe the Cuban government's accounts that the crash was an accident. Instead, Acevedo said she believed Paya had been targeted by the government for his opposition work and that the car he was traveling in had been run off the road. In a short video released by the Cuban government following the crash, Carromero said the crash took place after he lost control of the car when the terrain he was driving on abruptly changed.

Both Modig and Carromero said they traveled to Cuba to assist Paya in his opposition work.

"(CNN) -- The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is releasing a new television ad in North Carolina on Thursday targeting Republican Thom Tillis' ties to billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch. The new 30-second spot will run statewide, and is part of a $9.1 million buy the DSCC has launched to protect incumbent Democrat Kay Hagan in one of the key Senate battlegrounds this cycle that could ultimately determine which party holds the majority in the chamber next year. The GOP needs to gain six seats in order to win control of the Senate in November. The ad charges the Kochs with laying off 100 North Carolina workers and ""spending millions"" to elect Tillis ""because they know he'll be another vote supporting tax breaks for companies like theirs that outsource North Carolina jobs."" ""Letting our jobs go overseas. Another reason North Carolina can't trust Thom Tillis,"" says the ad's narrator. Kochs turn to vets, a mom to condemn Democrats in key states . A CNN/ORC International survey released in late September showed Hagan leading Tillis 46 percent to 43 percent, with Libertarian Sean Haugh receiving the support of 7 percent of likely voters. The Koch Brothers have been a constant presence in the Tar Heel State contest, with the brothers' grassroots organization Americans for Prosperity bombarding Hagan with more than $8 million in ads this cycle. AFP has attacked Hagan on a wide swath of issues from being a rubber stamp to Obama's agenda to accusing her of improperly benefiting from stimulus funds.

"(CNN) -- What if browsing the internet felt like playing an arcade game? That's the idea behind a new website called OneTrueFan, which awards points -- and potentially real prizes -- to people just for trolling around online. The site, which opened to the public late Wednesday and launched at a conference hosted by the blog TechCrunch earlier this week, intends to apply the idea of ""check-ins"" to online media consumption. Smartphone apps like Foursquare and Gowalla popularized the idea of check-ins, which broadly refers to the act of telling people you're at a certain location or that you're doing a certain thing at that moment. It's a concept that's gone mainstream only recently. Facebook, with its 500 million members, picked up on the idea when it launched its ""Places"" feature in August. Foursquare and others let users ""check in"" to bars, restaurants and parks. Other apps like GetGlue let people check in while they're watching movies or reading books. Now those same mechanics are coming to the internet at large. After users install a Firefox plug-in for OneTrueFan, the site automatically checks you in each time you visit a new website. If it's your first time on the site, you get 10 points; if you've been there before, you get 1 point for each new page you visit within a certain domain. Those who share a link  -- on Twitter, Facebook or Delicious, the bookmarking site -- are awarded with five points. People whose links actually drive traffic back to that website get one point for each click. The scores reset every two weeks. But who cares, right? What do these points actually mean? Eric Marcoullier, who co-founded OneTrueFan with business partner Todd Sampson, says the points create a sense of competition and community among users and could also result in real prizes. Those who visit a certain site most often are given ""One True Fan"" status, similar to the ""mayor"" status people achieve on Foursquare if they frequent a certain venue more often than anyone. People who have installed the OneTrueFan plug-in automatically see who is winning the race to be the biggest fan of that page. The also see the faces of other internet heads who happen to be look at the page at that time. Marcoullier says this creates an ambient feeling of community -- much the way shopping in a crowded store makes a person feel part of a group. ""When you think about it, browsing the Web is an inherently sterile, isolated experience, but there are people at the same sites you go to,"" he said. ""And it's not like you're going to sit there and talk to them while you're browsing."" Instead, he added, it's nice just to know they're there. The site awards digital ""patches"" to people who complete certain challenges. For instance, if a person visits 1,000 different internet domains, he or she is awarded the ""browser"" patch. Sharing 100 links gets you the ""broadcast"" patch, and visiting five social networking sites in one day gets you the ""socialite"" patch. All of this feeds into the competitive spirit of the site, Marcoullier said. OneTrueFan does not let users contact each other through the site, but the service links in with peoples' Twitter and Facebook accounts, so users could get in touch that way if they wanted, he said. And as for the sites you'd rather the world not see that you visited? Users can undo check-ins on a particular site and their entire check-in history there will be deleted from OneTrueFan's servers permanently, Marcoullier said. The site does not save its users' entire browsing histories, he said. It only lists links that users have shared publicly on Facebook, Twitter and Delicious -- as well as whether a person gained or lost ""One True Fan"" status on a website. As for the real rewards, some stores give freebies or discounts to people who become mayors of locations on Foursquare. In much the same way, Web companies will be able to offer prizes to the people who achieve ""One True Fan"" status on their sites, Marcoullier said. For example, a tech-focused website might offer the top user a free iPod or a chance to preview an invitation-only site, he said. Marcoullier believes his plug-in makes the Web more social and fun. It's part of the coming ""gamification"" of our lives. OneTrueFan only had 700 ""alpha"" users as of Wednesday, before it launched to the public, he said. Those users had to request invitations to get an ""alpha preview"" of the new website. It's not the only new site trying to push the idea of website-based check-ins. Badgeville, which was a finalist in a contest for innovative startup companies at the TechCrunch Disrupt event this week, aims to work with media companies to develop loyal website users using similar techniques. ""The Badgeville Platform offers turnkey widgets & an API that allow media sites, publishers, brands, marketers, and community managers to leverage game-based techniques to create highly engaging web experiences,"" the site says in an introductory blog post. ""Users are rewarded with real-time achievements and reputation that help publishers achieve specific pre-defined and measurable business goals."" Philly.com and TechCrunch are among Badgeville's current customers, according to a press release about the company. BigDoor Media is another company trying to sell game-like features to websites. It's unclear, however, how users will react to these new services. In a post on the blog ReadWriteWeb, Ethan Stillman says that the new sites that are adding ""game mechanics"" to websites are doing a better job than their predecessors, but that adding games to Web browsing can go terribly wrong. ""Bad game mechanics are worse than no game mechanic because of that one jarring moment when your user realizes just how crappy the game mechanic is,"" he writes. ""And it's at that moment when you have absolutely no control over where their mind wanders off to. They are flying free and you're just a speck on the radar."" He adds: ""This is going to get nutty, and awesome, very quickly.""","The idea of the ""check in"" is coming to the internet .
The term once referred to the idea of telling friends where you are .
Now it applies to sharing the websites you're visiting .
OneTrueFan, Badgeville and BigDoor Media are among those competing ."
"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's first lunar probe landed on the moon in a controlled collision Sunday, marking the first phase of the nation's three-stage moon mission, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The second stage involves sending a second probe to practice soft landings, the Xinhua news agency said. The mission will culminate with the launch and landing of a rover on the moon to collect mineral samples in 2012. The probe -- Chang'e-1, named after a legendary moon goddess -- launched into space 16 months ago on October 24, 2007.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Pakistani man accused of killing his daughter because she wanted out of an arranged marriage told a judge Tuesday that he had done nothing wrong. Chaudhry Rashid, 54, later said he was ""very disturbed"" and ""not in a state of mind"" to talk because of the death of his daughter, Sandeela Kanwal. A somber and tearful Rashid made his first court appearance Tuesday. He was advised through an Urdu interpreter of the murder charge and his legal rights. A judge also admonished Rashid, of Jonesboro, Georgia, to not make any statements without clearing them with his attorney. ""My client is going through a difficult time. As you can imagine, he is distraught,"" attorney Tammi Long said after the hearing. When asked about Rashid's comments in court, Long said her next move was to speak with him in depth. ""We will work diligently to provide the best defense for our client against these charges,"" she said. She requested that Rashid's family be given privacy, but said Rashid is holding up as well as can be expected. Court records indicate that a preliminary hearing in the case has been scheduled for July 24. Officers found Kanwal dead in an upstairs bedroom of the family's suburban Atlanta home early Sunday, according to a Clayton County police report. Police discovered possible ligature marks on her body and made note of an iron and a necklace as potential causes of the bruising. Authorities arrived at the home around 2 a.m., shortly after Rashid's wife called police. She reported that she had been awakened by screaming but couldn't understand the language, the report said. She said she was afraid and left the house to call police. Rashid's wife told authorities that Kanwal recently had wed in Pakistan in an arranged marriage. The young woman's husband was living in Chicago, Illinois, police said, but Kanwal remained at her father's home and worked at a metro Atlanta Wal-Mart for a brief time. ""The victim was not interested in marrying, nor remaining married to her husband,"" the police report said, citing information authorities received from Rashid's wife. ""This was causing a great deal of friction between the victim and her father,"" so much so that the two had not spoken in two months, the report said.  Watch how an arranged marriage ended in violence » . Police found a ""distraught and possibly mournful"" Rashid sitting behind a vehicle in the driveway. ""My daughter is dead,"" he told police. When asked how she died, police said Rashid did not answer. ""He just dropped his head,"" the report states. ""Apparently she and the father had argued over the marriage and the fact that it was arranged, and at some point during the altercation he did end up killing his daughter,"" said Clayton County Police spokesman Tim Owens. Neighbor Veronda Luckett said the family had always been ""relatively quiet."" ""They seemed to be decent, lovely people,"" she said. ""Honor killings"" -- the slaying by family members of a woman or girl thought to be bringing them shame -- are usually kept quiet, making it difficult to determine how frequently they occur. The United Nations Population Fund estimated in September 2000 that as many as 5,000 women and girls fall victim to such killings each year. Ajay Nair, associate dean of multicultural affairs at Columbia University, said many immigrant families struggle over cultural and generational gaps, but that most South Asian communities in the United States enjoy ""wonderful"" relationships within their families. ""My immediate reaction was that this is an anomaly in the South Asian American community,"" Nair said Tuesday. ""This isn't a rampant problem within South Asian communities. What is a problem, I think, is domestic violence, and that cuts across all communities."" Nair said he believes a ""significant human rights campaign"" is needed to address such killings. ""It's not just a U.S. issue. I think it happens across the world, and I think people need to recognize domestic violence and any kind of violence related to women as a serious, serious issue,"" Nair said.","NEW: A tearful Chaudhry Rashid tells judge he has done nothing wrong .

"Fes, Morocco (CNN) -- Fes is Morocco's oldest city, and in many ways, it feels like a window on history. It's home to the world's largest, living medieval settlement, as well as to thousands of professionals dedicated to keeping the flame of traditional craftsmanship alive. A champion of antiquity, Fes shows off its old-world charm to all who visit. City within a city . The oldest section of Fes is the walled settlement, or medina, of Fes El Bali. Originally built in the 9th century, the area comprises a twisted network of alleys and souks too narrow for cars. The medina's 100,000 residents navigate the streets on donkeys and mules. The old town has 11,000 historic buildings, including the 14th century Bab el Guissa Mosque and the University of Karueein -- the oldest continuously operating university in the world. ""[The medina] is a mix of many kinds of details that belong to different periods historically,"" says Alaa Sadi, an Iraqi architect who has renovated a 15th century riad, or traditional house, in Fes. ""Here, there's plaster work you can see in Egypt and Babylon; it is very old."" Preserving craftsmanship . Though Fes El Bali is a UNESCO heritage site, it's fallen into disrepair over the centuries. About 4,000 buildings, including private homes, are in near ruin. To combat the damage, the Moroccan government is investing around $40 million in renovation projects. ""The medina is like a big museum; you cannot touch anything there without respect,"" says Sadi. ""What it needs is a group of people to take responsibility of preserving its architectural features."" Restoration isn't straight-forward. Often, traditional craftsman need to be called in to ensure buildings are properly restored. The Bab el Guissa Mosque, for example, needed to be repaired following a renovation gone wrong in the 60s. ""We found that the roof had been repaired with concrete. We had to remove all the concrete and restore the roof with the original cedar wood,"" recalls Fouad Serghini, the director general of Ader-Fes, a government agency dedicated the old city's rehabilitation. ""In general, our method of restoration uses the same materials we used in the past."" Hide tanning . In Fes, there's no shortage of traditional artisans (at last count, the city boasted 40,000). Perhaps one of the most iconic sites is that of the city's tanneries, including the 11th century Chouara Tannery. Artisans there have been using the same methods to wash, tread and dye animal skins for thousands of years. ""The artisans are the ones who keep this city alive. Without them, I believe Fes would have been gone a long time ago,"" says Ibrahim Mouhib, a 24-year old fashion designer who incorporates traditionally reared leather and textiles in his work. To ensure traditional craftsmanship never disappears, an artisan school called Cfqma Fes Crafts opened five years ago just outside the medina walls. There, 150 master craftsman teach the next generation of artisans a range of 25 different crafts. ""It is very difficult to find apprentices who have the ability and the desire to choose these crafts, because they are very difficult. It takes a lot of time for an apprentice to learn these professions,"" says Aziz El Ouahbi, the center's marketing manager. Aziz envisions not only preserving these ancient crafts, but one day creating an industry for them in the international arena. ""We can develop the image of the artisans and import their work abroad,"" he says. Interactive: Morocco's best food .

"(CNN) -- Actor Michael Douglas says he has beaten throat cancer. ""I think the odds are with the tumor gone and what I know about this particular type of cancer that I've got it beat,"" he told host Matt Lauer of ""Today"" in an interview to air on NBC Tuesday. ""I have to check out on a monthly basis now to maintain. I guess there's not a total euphoria. I'll probably take a couple of months of getting checked out. But it's been a wild six-month ride,"" Douglas said in his first television interview since undergoing cancer treatment. The experience left him with an appreciation of finite time, he said. ""It's put a timeline on my life,"" he said. ""I'm 66 now. You know, I'm fortunate I've got a mother who's 88 -- she'll kill me -- she may be 87. My father's 94. So, you know, I feel good about those genes. But it's definitely a third act. And so you're a little more conscious of your time in how you choose to spend it."" The radiation treatment has shut down his salivary ducts for at least a year or two, and a dry mouth affects his sleep, he said. He lost 32 pounds during the ordeal, but he has regained 12 by ""eating like a pig,"" he said with a laugh. ""I got another 20, 25 to go,"" he said about returning to his normal weight. He exercises at a gym, but he avoids cardio workouts because he wants to put on muscle mass, he said. The tabloids and paparazzi have published photographs of an emaciated Douglas as he was undergoing treatment, and while Douglas said he didn't follow the coverage, friends apparently did and called him to see how he was doing, he said. ""They kept saying, 'You sure you're OK?' "" Douglas said. ""Finally, my father, Kirk, he came back to New York. ... He came back for 10 days and came up to the apartment every day to see me because I think that some of these photographs and, you know, who knows if they're touched up,"" Douglas said. ""I was gaunt,"" he continued. ""So I think he was even concerned. And, yeah, it was not a lot of fun. It's still not. They're (photographers) there every day."" The tabloids' chronicling of his appearance during cancer treatment was ""macabre,"" he said. ""I guess curiosity's gotten them a lot of coverage -- sort of following it. And there's so many outlets now these days. I mean, I just feel for all these young kids. I mean, the generations now, with the amount of paparazzi that they have and these video cameras -- you know, you just can't do anything,"" Douglas said. ""And I resent the amount of imposition on our children, too, because it used to be at least they would try to keep them out of that, and they don't at all (now). They were having -- there was sort of a macabre enjoyment out of sort of watching me go down there for a while, I felt, by the paparazzi,"" he said. As cancer put his life in jeopardy, he developed a new regard for family and friends, he said. ""All of a sudden the affection from my family, from my friends, and from my fans hit me at a much deeper level than I would have ever imagined before,"" Douglas said. ""And it gave me a really new appreciation of just how valuable, how precious good friends are and family. And it's not that I disregard them before but there's a much deeper feeling. ""I've talked to other cancer survivors about this ... that you just really, really appreciate what's important in life,"" he said. Douglas even took his three young children to a couple of his radiation treatments. ""They came into the room and they saw all the Star Wars treatment going around. And they saw them put the mask on your face because they have to kind of bolt you down like Hannibal Lecter or something,"" he said. ""So they can specifically target the correct area,"" Lauer interjected. ""So they can -- exactly, get the area,"" Douglas continued. ""At that age it was good for them. I mean, they thought it was cool, you know, all this space age stuff. So it made up for all those days when dad was lying on the couch and couldn't get up. And their patience was really appreciated. And we've had a big celebration these last couple of days when I found out the tumor's gone."" A portion of the interview will air Tuesday on ""Today,"" and the entire interview will air Sunday on ""Dateline NBC"" at 7 p.m. ET.","""It's been a wild six-month ride,"" Michael Douglas says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Apparently in Hollywood, the hair's the hardest. Not styling it, but creating it, in this case on the back of an imaginary mammoth. Roland Emmerich grins and bears it as he poses for photographers with the stars of ""10,000 BC."" ""At the beginning of every movie,"" Roland Emmerich explains, ""I talk to my visual effects supervisor. She always reads the script, then she comes running into my office and says: 'It's impossible Roland, we can not do this.'"" ""She explained to me: 'Every hair is like a one of a million, it has to react to the other hair, and then there is the wind, and the movement of the animal, it's just a mathematical nightmare'. So I said: 'Great, let's do it.'"" The results speak for themselves. A herd of thundering mammoths takes a starring role in one of the trailers for ""10,000 BC."" They look realistic enough; certainly more realistic than the one positioned on the red carpet for the film's world premiere in Berlin.  see pictures of the world premiere » . It stands -- after some considerable effort -- at the entrance to CineStar theater in Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, the location for the first big public screening of Roland Emmerich's new film.  see the mammoth going up.. and down » . He's nervous. For a Hollywood director who's renowned for outrageous concepts and over-the-top effects, he's not very fond of fanfare. ""It's good for the movie. We want to promote the movie. That's the only reason why I do it,"" Emmerich says. He's speaking at the Regent Hotel in Berlin on the morning of the worldwide premiere of ""10,000 BC."" There's a long day ahead; eight or so hours of interviews with the world's media and film critics, then the film premiere and the premiere party. The Interviews . Warner Brothers, the film's distributors, have booked every room in Berlin's Regent Hotel. Nothing is left to chance. ""The coordinating central office where all of the press gathers for the press credentials and just to make sure that the timing is right because the schedule is quite intricate,"" says the film's producer Michael Wimer, as he leads Revealed on a tour of the hotel. Upstairs there are the interview rooms, make-up rooms ""to make sure that our people look as beautiful as possible"", and the all important ""monitor room."" Inside the monitor room is a row of television screens showing live feeds of interviews taking place down the hall. ""People get to stay in here and look and see if there's a consistency of information, to see if the interviews are going well or not,"" Wimer explains, ""and basically just to make sure that everything is going the way we want it to."" Revealed: ""Have you noticed any mistakes?"" Wimer: ""No... so far. So far we have professionals, which is pretty important because some of our actors are pretty young and for them to be doing this at such a high level, such a professional level, says a lot about how they've been prepared. I think this is going to be a good day for us."" The premiere . Hundreds of people line up three-deep along the temporary barriers outside the CineStar theater in Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, as photographers provide the familiar sparkle of camera flashes that greet every world premiere. Roland Emmerich arrives in suit and trainers and immediately bounds over to a group of fans who are waving books and photos. This is one premiere that's more about the film maker than the stars. ""I think it's interesting because you know normally it's about the stars, about the main characters,"" says Steven Gaetjen, a German television presenter who'll be compering the event. ""But he's the person that invented the story; he's the man who made the movie."" ""Anything that happens in Berlin attracts a huge crowd but tonight is very special because it's a world premiere and sort of like a lost son has returned to Germany."" And that lost son has brought people with him; a group of South African extras who played the mammoth hunters. Michael Wimer: ""Somewhere around the end of the shoot, Roland said to these guys: 'Well, the next part of it, after of course a year of production, is the premiere.'"" ""He said: 'If we have the premiere in Europe I promise I'll fly you guys up.' And Roland, true to his word, contacted them about two months ago and said: 'Hey guys, we're doing the premiere, in Berlin and I'm sending down some tickets and we'll take care of the hotel rooms.'"" ""They just got here day before yesterday and it's just the most fun thing to see the whole group getting back together again,"" Wimer says. ""It's a little odd that we call them the mammoth hunters when we're walking around Berlin, but it's pretty charming and we hope they're going to have a blast tonight on the red carpet."" The Film . A twittering spreads through the audience as the lights dim and the curtains open. What follows is an 109 minute love story set in prehistoric times. A young mammoth hunter, D'Leh (Steven Strait), falls in love with a beautiful village girl, Evolet (Camilla Belle). When she's abducted by a gang of mysterious horseman, D'Leh embarks on a journey across unchartered territory to rescue her. Along the way, he and his band of followers discover unknown civilizations. Gradually their small band turns into an army. After fending off saber tooth tigers and vicious terror birds, they confront their final challenge -- to overthrown a tyrannical God who has enslaved his people. Viewers' verdict . After the premiere, guests file up a smaller red carpet to the premiere party at Goya nightclub in Berlin. It is time to relax and share their thoughts on the film. Revealed went into the public area and asked the general public what they thought. Have you seen the film? What did you think? ""I think the action was great but the story was a little too thin,"" said one woman, a view shared by a couple of film-goers. ""The pictures were great, really, really great, but for me it was a bit too simple."" ""No, I'm sorry, it's not my type of movie, but it was fun. We had some drinks and some nachos."" Other comments ranged from the mildly enthusiastic... ""It took a long time, two and a half years for this, but it was quite amusing. I enjoyed it yes. I liked 'Independence Day' and I liked the Patriot. This one wouldn't be one of my favorites."" To the exuberant... ""It was very exciting and it was very enormous with the big mammoths and stuff. I think it's a big success for the film, hopefully for Emmerich. It's the 3rd film I've seen from him and I am of course a big fan."" ""I was amazing; it was a Roland Emmerich film. All the special effects he made, all the ideas he has... great, great."" As for Roland himself, he's put the dilemma of creating realistic mammoth hair behind him and is focusing on his next film. ""By the time the movie's out there, you have seen it probably a thousand times,"" he says, ""and you cannot watch it anymore. Because you would, like, go crazy."" ""So, I don't watch anything anymore and I don't read any reviews. I just avoid that this movie exists and concentrate on the next one.""","Woolly mammoth on red carpet for world premiere of Emmerich's ""10,000 BC""

"(CNN) -- In just a few months, Syria's rebels have transformed themselves from ragtag village defense forces into an armed movement capable of attacking the country's two largest cities, Aleppo and Damascus. Now they are bracing themselves for what one Syrian newspaper has called ""the mother of all battles."" Both the rebels and the regime are building up their manpower in and around Aleppo, Syria's largest city, where the rebels have made inroads this past week. Fighting has already begun. Syrian rebels seize military base outside Aleppo . Several world leaders have expressed deep concern about a ""devastating"" government counterattack in Aleppo. But the rebels, encouraged by the progress they've made, remain undeterred. War crimes in Aleppo, Arab League chief says . ""We will fight this dictator and all of his aircraft, tanks and rockets,"" said Ahmed Afash, a rebel squad leader based in Anadan, a rebel-controlled town just six miles north of Aleppo. ""We started out this struggle with rocks."" Now they have rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, assault rifles and other powerful weapons. Afash and other rebels in Anadan proudly showed off the artillery they had seized from Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. ""I've fired this gun about 2,000 times,"" said rebel Jamal Awar, referring to a double-barreled, anti-aircraft gun on top of a truck. Awar, a former bus driver, said he shot down a helicopter several weeks ago with the gun. ""I was ecstatic, I was very happy,"" Awar said. But even with all the new weapons, can the rebels fend off an air assault? Mustafa Abdullah, a major rebel commander, told CNN there simply isn't enough ammunition to withstand a government siege. He said it will ""be just like Homs"" and wept at the thought of a similar massacre. World leaders and outside experts have also expressed doubt that the rebels have the weaponry to counter the regime's aerial threat. While they might lack firepower, however, the rebels have plenty of commitment and passion for their cause. ""I go to war for my family, for my country,"" said Soukrot Amin, a 23-year-old Aleppo native who recently volunteered to be in the Free Syrian Army. ""Because (al-Assad) has killed everyone. He killed my cousin. He destroyed my village. He destroyed my home."" The rebel militias are composed in large part of defector soldiers. But there are also many civilians, including students, shopkeepers, real-estate agents, and even members of al-Assad's ruling party. More: Faces of the Free Syrian Army . Ahmed Habib spent a decade working as a bureaucrat with the Aleppo branch of the Ba'ath party. But eight months after joining the rebels, he was dressed in improvised military fatigues, carrying a Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale assault rifle slung over his shoulder. ""We wished to have a new democracy when Bashar al-Assad became president,"" he said. ""We wished to have freedom for the people. But that never happened. We just got new cars and computers. It's ... nothing. ""We tell Bashar al-Assad, very soon we will be in Damascus, in the president's palace, we promise that."" Last week, a bombing in Damascus killed several of the regime's top defense officials, including al-Assad's brother-in-law. But the rebels' progress into the Syrian capital seems to have faded as a result of a strong government counterattack. Q&A: A bloody mess could get messier . The rebels now see Aleppo, the country's economic hub and its most populous city, as crucial to their cause. And they're throwing much of their manpower in the north of the country to fight for it. Some other nearby cities have been abandoned. In Atareb, Bashar al-Assad's troops left behind a bullet-riddled ghost town patrolled by rebels and a handful of shell-shocked residents. The Bab el Hawa highway, which ran through the center of the town, was renamed the ""Street of Death"" by rebels. Until recently, they said, anyone who dared set foot on the highway became a target. Now it's a mini-graveyard of burned-out armored personnel carriers. ""This used to be a very classy area. ... The Turks would come here to see our village,"" said a fighter named Abdullah Behri, who lost his left eye to shrapnel during a battle there in May. ""Now it has all turned to hell,"" he said, pointing at the town's deserted streets. Is a similar fate in store for Aleppo? In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that U.S. officials are concerned ""that we will see a massacre in Aleppo -- and that's what the regime appears to be lining up for."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the escalation could lead to a ""devastating loss of civilian life and a humanitarian disaster."" But the rebels know the risks and they are ready to fight. One veteran fighter named Khorshid had no illusions that the battle for Aleppo would be easy. He choked back tears Tuesday after burying his slain friend Housam Abdul Rashid. Then he swore to return to the front lines. ""Tonight,"" Khorshid said. ""We must fight Bashar al-Assad, because if not, he will kill us."" CNN's Ivan Watson inside Syria: Rebels attack army base . Tense Syria prisoner exchange turns into sitcom .

"New York (CNN) -- A woman who admitted to stealing a 19-day-old infant from a Manhattan hospital in 1987 was sentenced Monday to 12 years in prison. Ann Pettway, who pleaded guilty in February to one count of kidnapping, expressed remorse in a brief statement to the federal court in Manhattan. ""I would like to apologize to the family,"" Pettway told U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel. ""I am deeply sorry for what I've done. If they don't accept it, it's understandable,"" said Pettway, adding, ""I'm here today to right my wrong and ask for forgiveness."" According to prosecutors, the parents of the baby girl, named Carlina Renae White, had taken her to Harlem Hospital on August 4, 1987, because she had a fever. Early the following day, hospital personnel discovered the baby was gone. For 23 years Pettway raised the girl under another name and as her own child, prosecutors said. In January 2010, when the victim sought to get prenatal care during her own pregnancy, she had difficulty getting a birth certificate from Pettway, prosecutors said. The victim became suspicious and contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. DNA confirmed she was Carlina White, the daughter of Carl Tyson and Joy White. Pettway turned herself in to the FBI in Bridgeport, Connecticut, shortly after the victim, now in her mid-20s, was reunited with her birth parents. Pettway, now 50, told authorities she took the baby because she had suffered two stillborn births, one just months before the abduction. The birth parents both read statements Monday during Pettway's sentencing hearing. ""I never had a chance to put my daughter on a school bus,"" said Carl Tyson, making direct eye contact with Pettway. ""What they should give you is 23 years for what you took from me."" A teary-eyed Joy White told a packed courtroom, ""I only spent 19 days with (her daughter) from birth, and those were the most memorable days of my life."" Both parents admit to difficulties trying to get to know their now-adult daughter.

"(CNN) -- November 30th marks the end of the Atlantic hurricane season, and although it was extremely active, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is calling 2010 a ""gentle giant."" The season wraps up with a total of 19 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and five hurricanes that were category three or higher.  That makes 2010 the third busiest season when considering all named storms, and second busiest season on record when considering hurricanes. ""The excellent verification of the seasonal forecast points out, once again, why one cannot use this forecast as an indicator of personal risk. The good fortune of relatively minimal impact on the United States in spite of 19 storms, 12 of which were hurricane and 5 of which were category 3 or 4, will serve as yet another reminder that from a hurricane readiness viewpoint, one must prepare every season as if a major hurricane will impact them,"" said Bill Read, director of the National Hurricane Center. Remarkably, there were zero U.S. hurricane landfalls in 2010.  On average, approximately two hurricanes hit the United States per year.  Less fortunate was Mexico, which was slammed with a number of storms including Hurricane Karl, which intensified into a major hurricane before hitting land -- the only hurricane to do so in the Bay of Campeche.  Central America also had a share of the tropical activity, where storms caused deadly flooding and mudslides. Jack Hayes, director of the National Weather Service, said the season's forecast was a success. ""As NOAA forecasters predicted, the Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active on record, though fortunately most storms avoided the U.S.  For that reason, you could say the season was a gentle giant."" The final season tally coincides well with the forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was issued on May 27th.  At that time, the organization was predicting 14 to 23 named storms, eight to 14 hurricanes, and three to seven major hurricanes of category three or higher.  A qualifier to that forecast was that it was likely the final numbers would be on the high end of the predicted ranges. Although the National Hurricane Center knew a busy season was coming, they were careful to say that a busy season doesn't always mean extreme impacts on the United States or other countries.  ""We can have quiet seasons overall that are devastating to communities, and very busy seasons like this one with hardly any U.S. impacts,"" said James Franklin, branch chief of the Hurricane Specialist Unit at the National Hurricane Center.  ""We want folks to be prepared each and every season regardless of what kind of activity we're expecting."" Environmental factors lined up early for an intense season.  North Atlantic sea surface temperatures were at record warmth, which combined with favorable winds due to the presence of La Nina.  However, the large-scale atmospheric flow over the Atlantic and position of the jet stream over the United States also allowed the tropical cyclones to re-curve back to sea without impacting land. Although the Southeast was lucky in landfalls in 2010, the lack of rainfall that usually accumulates during hurricane season is expected to intensify the drought situation in the region.  Tropical storms bring much-needed moisture to replenish lakes and reservoirs.  The lack of tropical rainfall combined with ongoing La Nina conditions could mean the Southeast will see a drought in 2011 much like that of 2007.","2010 hurricane season was second busiest on record .

"(CNN) -- It was a tight squeeze for a giant new cruise ship sailing from Europe to its home port in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, over the weekend. Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas passed under Denmark's Storebaelt Bridge with about a foot to spare, drawing applause from people on board the ship. The captain called it ""the great excitement of the day."" The normal height of the ship from the water level to the top is about 73 meters (240 feet), said Capt. Hernan Zini, but the vessel couldn't be higher than 65 meters (213 feet) in order to safely go under the bridge, the captain said. To make that happen, the crew lowered the ship's retractable twin smokestacks, carefully adjusted the ballast so the ship wouldn't be too light (and therefore sitting too high in the water) and boosted its speed. ""When you increase the speed in relatively confined waters, the ship has a suction effect from the bottom, and that actually makes the ship go a bit deeper into the water,"" Zini said. The plan went off without a hitch, and the ship safely cleared the bridge. Video: Watch from up close (advance video to 2:05) YouTube: Watch from the shore . The vessel is the sister ship of the Oasis of the Seas. The pair are the largest cruise ships in the world. The Allure of the Seas is scheduled to arrive in Florida on November 11. Its official naming ceremony will take place on November 28, and the ship will sail on its inaugural cruise in early December.","Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas safely passes under Denmark's Storebaelt Bridge .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine says it will lift restrictions on tourism in the zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 2011, formally opening the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident to visitors. A limited number of visitors already are allowed into the 30-kilometer (19-mile) exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which exploded and burned in 1986. The Ukrainian government will present a detailed plan for lifting the remaining restrictions on travel to the area December 21, said Viktor Baloga, the former Soviet republic's emergency situations minister. Background radiation in the accident zone is still well above normal. But far from being a wasteland, wildlife has rebounded in the exclusion zone and trees are reclaiming the ghost city of Pripyat, said Mary Mycio, author of ""Wormwood Forest,"" a 2005 book on the area. ""It is very moving and interesting and a beautiful monument to technology gone awry,"" Mycio said. The April 1986 accident killed 32 plant workers and firefighters directly, and the International Atomic Energy Agency estimates nearly 4,000 more will die of related cancers from the radioactive material released by the disaster. Currently, guides from the Chernobyl Zone Authority take about 20 to 30 people into the exclusion zone a day during the summers, said Yuri Rozgoni, whose Toronto-based travel agency, Ukrainianweb, books tours to the site. The tours typically take between five and six hours, not counting the drive to and from the Ukrainian capital Kiev, he said. While travel is no longer restricted to scientists and researchers, ""The only way to enter the zone (now) is with a certified guide on a certified tour group,"" Rozgoni said. ""That's a huge restriction."" Guides monitor radiation levels and ""know where the people can go and where the people cannot go,"" he said. Mycio said tourists should wear ""something that you wouldn't mind leaving behind in case it does get dirty."" But most radioactive material has sunk into the soil, and visitors receive a dose comparable to the exposure they would receive on a trans-Atlantic flight. ""The only concern I would have is if too many people come in and it becomes this nuclear Disneyland,"" Mycio said. ""That would take away from a wildlife sanctuary (that has thrived) in the absence of people.""

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. astronauts in space, and their support staffs on Earth, will keep working through the government shutdown that began Tuesday. But almost all the rest of NASA has been shuttered, just one of many federal agencies affected when the government shut down at midnight Tuesday because of Congress' inability to pass a budget. Many of those agencies took to social media and other online venues to share the news. Twitter was a popular choice for the messages. Among them? If an asteroid starts hurtling toward Earth ... well ... good luck. ""In the event of government shutdown, we will not be posting or responding from this account,"" NASA's Near Earth Object Office tweeted from its @AsteroidWatch account Monday, just hours before the deadline in Congress. ""We sincerely hope to resume tweets soon."" The office is responsible for tracking and reporting asteroids that threaten the planet, like the 150-foot chunk of space rock that came closer to Earth than the moon in February. The office later noted that observatories, academics and other astronomers continue to monitor the skies. In all, about 18,000 NASA employees, or 97% of its work force, were furloughed on Tuesday. Among those still working will be astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Which may be just as well -- it's not like they could get away from the office even if they wanted to. NASA's Mission Control will also stay open to support astronauts Karen Nyberg and Mike Hopkins. ""To protect the life of the crew as well as the assets themselves, we would continue to support planned operations of the ISS [space station] during any funding hiatus,"" reads a NASA furlough plan submitted last week. ""Moreover, NASA will be closely monitoring the impact of an extended shutdown to determine if crew transportation or cargo resupply services are required to mitigate imminent threats to life and property on the ISS or other areas."" Other NASA spacecraft, like the Curiosity Rover on Mars and the New Horizons craft hurtling toward Pluto, will be largely left to their own devices (literally) during the shutdown. The funding mess may be enough to have them all jealous of the Voyager 1 space probe, which was launched into space in 1977. Last month, NASA confirmed that the original Voyager left the solar system. Maybe the Voyager 2 probe, in protest of the impasse in Congress, will follow suit.","About 97% of the U.S. space agency is furloughed .

"(CNN) -- Chile poured firefighters and police into the battle against a wildfire that swept through hundreds of homes in the Pacific coastal city of Valparaiso, leaving at least 12 dead, according to an official. Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo reported at least 2,000 homes had been destroyed by the blaze, leaving some 8,000 people without a place to live. Earlier, Chile's National Emergency Office's website, citing police, had said that at least 16 people were dead. It was not immediately clear why the reported death tolls were different. More than 1,200 firefighters worked to control the wind-whipped blaze in Valparaiso and the suburb of Vina del Mar, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said Sunday. The wind hampered firefighters' ability to create firebreaks, and the blaze had spread to more than 2,000 acres, Penailillo said. ""It's been one of the worst fires in history,"" said Fernando Reseio, the fire superintendent in Vina del Mar. Bachelet said the firefighters were backed up by 17 aircraft and that additional police were being brought in to prevent looting in the areas abandoned by their residents. Many of the survivors suffered burns, and the most seriously burned patients were being transferred to hospitals in the capital, Santiago, about 75 miles away, the president said. In images broadcast by CNN sister network CNN Chile, residents could be seen fleeing the flames overnight. The network reported that the sweeping fire is endangering thousands more homes. In addition, plans were being drawn up to evacuate inmates at Valparaiso prison as a preventive measure, Mayor Jorge Castro said. The city is under a red alert, said emergency office spokesman Ricardo Toro. Earlier, Bachelet had declared a state of emergency, which legally allows armed forces to get involved. CNN's Michael Roa and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Strong winds are fanning the flames in Valparaiso .

"(CNN) -- Before super yachts, luxury sailboats and passenger ferries, the preferred method of water travel was by steamboat. Until the first steamboat was built in the late 1700s, boats were powered by wind and sail. Since steamboats didn't depend as much on wind direction and currents, they offered more control. Steam engines function similarly to a tea kettle on a stove, says Matthew Schulte, executive director of the Steamship Historical Society of America. Water is heated to a boil, creating steam that's controlled under pressure. The steam is then released, mechanically powering the vessel and getting the engine moving. By the mid-19th century, steamboats became a popular mode of transportation in America, Schulte said. ""The rivers, lakes and oceans could serve as a network of transportation long before trails, railroads and highways could accommodate the masses,"" said Schulte. While steam and sail boats operated simultaneously into the early 1900s, steamboats remained dominant into the mid-20th century, when ships powered by diesel engines started to become mainstream. Because of their immense size and weight, and the large crew necessary to operate them, steamboats were much more expensive to operate than ships powered by smaller, lighter, modern diesel engines. With steamboats, ""You can see, smell and hear what's happening, and then understand why they work just from going on one,"" Schulte said. ""The Belle of Louisville turns 100 this year, which offers a great opportunity for people to participate."" Here are seven steamboats -- including the Belle -- that visitors can still enjoy in the United States. Some are old, some are new and one offers more fun beyond sightseeing. 31 can't-miss U.S. beaches . Belle of Louisville, Kentucky . Celebrating its 100th birthday in October, Kentucky's Belle of Louisville,located in the town for which it was named, is one of the oldest operating steamboats in the world. The boat still has its original steam engines, and no modern navigation equipment. It's propelled by paddle wheel, operating as it did 100 years ago. When the boat was built in Pittsburgh, it was designed as a ferry and freight vessel but outfitted for passengers for its later use as an excursion boat. During its lifetime, seven million people have traveled on the 200-foot-long Belle. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Celebrate at the Centennial Festival of Riverboats in Louisville from October 14-19. The festival will include six days of festivities on the water and on land, with a showcase of food and beverages, children's educational areas, concerts and fireworks. Katahdin, Maine . In the 1800s, steamboats were abundant on Moosehead Lake in Greenville, Maine. But by the 1930's, the Katahdin was the only one left on the lake. Built in 1914, Katahdin is another steamboat celebrating its 100th birthday this year. In the 1920s, Northern Maine was a popular vacation spot for visitors from Philadelphia, New York and Boston desperate to escape the summer heat and pollution. With the stock market crash in 1929, the leisure travel industry declined, as did lake transportation on Moosehead. A decade later, Katahdin's new purpose was hauling logs along the river. It was used that way until 1975, when it participated in the nation's last log drive. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places three years later. The Moosehead Marine Museum acquired Katahdin several years after the museum's founding in 1976. In 2010, the museum raised more than $1 million to restore the Katahdin and rebuild its wharf. In the summer and fall of 2013, more than 7,000 passengers cruised the lake on the Katahdin, enjoying a ride on a piece of maritime history. 50 states, 50 spots: natural wonders . Minnehaha, Minnesota . The steamboat Minnehaha was launched in 1906 to ferry residents from across Lake Minnetonka to the town of the same name, where streetcars sat waiting as land transportation. The Minnehaha was also used by people wanting a tour of the lake, and it remained a popular means of transportation for both groups until the late 1920s, when steamboats began to fade away. Although it cruises the same water today, the Minnehaha spent decades on the bottom of the lake. The steamboat sank in 1926 and wasn't raised until 1980. Ten years after Minnehaha was brought to the surface, the restoration began and was completed in 1996. The wood hull was rebuilt because of damage caused by spending a decade on land, and the original boiler that burned coal was converted to a model that burns fuel. While the ship's engine isn't the original one, it dates back to the late 1930s. African Queen, Florida . Perhaps the most famous steamboat still in operation, Florida's African Queen starred alongside Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn in the 1951 film of the same name. The boat was built in 1912 in Lytham, England, for use by the East Africa British Railways Company. It originally carried cargo, hunting parties and missionaries along the Victoria Nile and Lake Albert, on the border of Congo and Uganda. The boat continued to operate in Africa until 1968 when it was brought to the United States, working in San Francisco, Oregon and finally in Florida. The African Queen has been in Key Largo since 1982, providing cruises for visitors wanting a ride on the famous boat. Sabino, Connecticut . Mystic, Connecticut's Sabino is believed to be the oldest wooden, coal-fired steamboat still operating in the United States. Built in 1908 in East Boothbay, Maine, the Sabino was originally named the Tourist, carrying freight and passengers in Maine's waters. After a private restoration, the Sabino was purchased in 1974 for use as a working exhibit at the Mystic Seaport museum. The Sabino still has the two-cylinder steam engine that was installed in 1908, carrying passengers on daily cruises along the Mystic River. The Sabino is a ""bell boat,"" with control of the engine handled directly by the engineer who receives orders from the captain via bell. One ring means forward, two mean reverse. 10 stunning waterfalls across the U.S. American Empress, Washington . The youngest steamboat on the list, Washington's American Empress was launched this past April. The ship was actually built in 2003, cruising Alaska as the Empress of the North for five years. The boat remained out of service until it was purchased and renamed by the American Queen Steamboat Company in 2013. Ports and excursions on the multi-day cruises along the Columbia and Snake Rivers include Sacajawea State Park, the Walla Walla wine trail, Mount St. Helens and numerous stops in Oregon. Cruises often feature a ""riverlorian"" to share the history and culture of the region with curious visitors. Miss Belterra Riverboat Casino, Indiana . If it's a roll of the dice or slots you seek rather than just sightseeing, Florence, Indiana's Miss Belterra  might be the boat for you. Opened in 2000, Las Vegas casino-inspired and design and dÃ©cor elements grace the interior, with the exterior resembling classic riverboats of the 1800s. Miss Belterra is 370 feet long and features 38,000 square feet of game tables and slots on two of its decks. The boat holds about 3,000 people and offers the sounds and atmosphere of a land-locked casino. Although gambling laws no longer require Miss Belterra to leave port, guests can still enjoy the historic feel and thrill of gambling on the water. 10 wilderness spots turning 50 .","Once a popular form of transportation, few steamboats cruise the waters today .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong is facing an acute shortage of one the engines of its dynamic economy -- cheap domestic help. More than 290,000 foreign domestic helpers -- mainly Indonesians, Filipinas and Thais - live and work in the special administrative region of Hong Kong, according to Hong Kong's Department of Immigration. But fears that Indonesian plans to wind up the foreign export of its low-skilled workers by 2017 will lead to a shortage of cheap hired help has the city's employment agencies looking elsewhere in the region. This week Hong Kong received its first batch of domestic helpers from Bangladesh, a country that agencies hope will provide a rich source of women willing to work in a foreign country for just $HK3,920 ($505) a month. ""There are not enough Filipino and Indonesian domestic helpers these days,"" said Teresa Liu Tsui-lan, the managing director of the Technic Employment Service Centre. ""We have a good training course for them in Bangladesh over three months where they learn Cantonese and Chinese cooking. ""We think that employers will be able to accept that,"" she told CNN. She said there was now a lot of competition from other countries -- mainly Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan -- for Indonesian maids, making it harder for Hong Kong to recruit them. ""Even though the salary offered in Hong Kong is higher, these countries are a lot closer to Indonesia so it's easier for domestic helpers to return home when they need to,"" Liu said. She said Indonesian maids were in demand as carers for the elderly because, with limited English skills, their Cantonese has a tendency to improve quickly. Filipinas, by contrast, who often have high levels of English before they come to Hong Kong, normally rely on English to communicate with their Hong Kong employers, she said. Another 75 Bangladeshi workers will arrive in Hong Kong over the next three months, followed by 150 to 200 every month after that. There are currently just 71 Bangladeshi domestic helpers in Hong Kong, compared with 152,557 Indonesian and 149,009 Filipino domestic helpers in the city, according to 2012 figures from the Department of Immigration. The Bangladeshi helpers said they paid an agency in Bangladesh about $HK13,000 - more than three times their monthly salary - to apply for the job in Hong Kong. One of the helpers, Khadiza Akter, 24, who is married with a son, told a press conference in Hong Kong that she planned to work in the city for five years. ""My husband is a driver and I want to buy another car for him so that we can start our own business,"" she said. ""I also want to give my son a better education."" Indonesia's Manpower and Transmigration Minister Muhaimin Iskandar last year announced the country planned to stop sending domestic workers abroad from 2017. While the government has no authority to prevent people from seeking work abroad, he said workers would have to have a clearly defined position and working status before taking up a foreign job. ""The recipient country would have to recognize them as formal workers with certain rights, such as working hours, the right to holidays and leave as well as to a set salary,"" Iskandar told the Jakarta Globe. While Hong Kong has strong laws in place to protect the legal minimum wage of $HK3,920 (U.S.$505) a month, domestic helpers are sometimes subject to abuses such as long working hours, sub-standard living and sleeping arrangements and employers that attempt to cut deals to pay below the legal minimum. Indonesia slapped moratorium on domestic workers to Malaysia in 2009 after multiple cases of abuse there. While the country has since lifted the ban, it only resumed sending migrant workers after more than a year of protracted negotiations on protecting the rights of domestic workers in Malaysia. Indonesia's economy has shown stellar growth in recent years, expanding 6.02% in the first quarter of 2013, according to figures from Indonesia's Bureau of Statistics. With jobs available domestically, analysts say many Indonesians were are electing to stay at home. An Indonesian Business Forum held in Hong Kong recently outlined the thrust of government policy, which aims to boost the skill sets of Indonesian foreign workers, particularly those working in building and construction. ""In five years it will be a very different situation,"" Indonesian government economic advisor Professor Hermanto Siregar told the forum. ""These changes are already happening in the likes of South Korea and Japan. There are many semi-skilled workers employed there now on much better wages than they would earn as domestic helpers.""","Hong Kong faces a shortage of domestic helpers, a vital part of its economy .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- A defense attorney Tuesday tried to poke holes in the highly emotional testimony of the first witness in the murder trial of Olympian double-amputee Oscar Pistorius, as another witness said she also heard screams the night model Reeva Steenkamp was killed. On the second day of the trial, testimony continued with the questioning of Pistorius' neighbor, Michelle Burger, who said Monday she was awakened by screams, followed by gunshots, when Pistorius shot and killed his girlfriend on Valentine's Day last year. Defense attorney Barry Roux attacked Burger's credibility, accusing her of using her husband's statement to craft her own. Paragraph by paragraph, Roux pointed out similarities between their two statements. Burger repeatedly explained that the statements were similar because they both heard the same thing. ""I'm as honest as I can be to the court,"" she said. Pistorius has admitted he killed Steenkamp but pleaded not guilty, saying that he mistakenly believed he was shooting a burglar. He only realized after firing four shots that his girlfriend was not in bed but in the bathroom he was firing at, his defense team said on his behalf Monday. Burger cried when she described the gunfire. ""It was awful to hear the shots,"" she said through tears. On Monday, Burger testified that, ""Something terrible was happening at that house."" She called the shouts and screams ""petrifying."" Roux questioned how Burger had heard the screams from far away: ""You heard that out of a closed toilet in a house 177 meters away?"" Clearly rattled at times, she was granted a small reprieve as the court adjourned to investigate claims her image had been seen on television -- a violation of her right to remain anonymous. The case has fascinated South Africa and much of the world, with its high-profile defendant, the double-amputee track star so talented that he competed not only in the Paralympics but against able-bodied runners in the Olympics two years ago. Neighbors heard shouting . A second witness, another of Pistorius' neighbors, told the court Tuesday she also was awoken by shouting on the night Steenkamp was killed. In brief testimony, Estelle van der Merwe said she heard loud voices that went on for about an hour and put a pillow over her head to try to get back to sleep. She said she heard four sounds but could not be sure what they were. Burger's husband, Charl Johnson, was the third witness to take to the stand before the court adjourned for the day. Describing what he heard from his home that night, he said the ""intensity and fear in (the woman's) voice escalated and it was clear that her life was in danger."" ""That's when the first shots were fired. I remember hearing a succession of shots,"" Johnson said. ""I heard the lady scream again and the last scream faded moments after the last shot was fired."" Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, reading a report from an expert, told the court that of the four bullets that were fired toward Steenkamp: ""The fourth bullet hit her in the head. She then died."" At this remark, Pistorius clutched his head in his hands. LIVE UPDATES: Pistorius on trial for murder . Testy testimony . Burger's testimony has been marked by confusion at times. After Roux had asked her a question several times Tuesday, Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa intervened: ""When counsel asks a question, you answer that question ... The quicker way to get out of that (witness) box is to answer exactly what counsel is asking."" During Nel's questioning Monday, Burger told the court that she heard a woman's screams and a man yelling for help. ""Just after 3, I woke up from a woman's terrible screams,"" she said. ""Then I also heard a man screaming for help. Three times he yelled for help."" She assumed a nearby home was being invaded by criminals. She later told her husband that she feared the woman had witnessed her husband being shot ""because after he screamed, we didn't hear him."" Roux spent hours hammering Burger with questions in Monday's cross-examination, asking repeatedly if there could have been shots before she woke up, if she was sure about the sequence of events and about her knowledge of guns. He asked if the ""bang"" sounds she heard might not have been gunshots, but rather a cricket bat bashing at a bathroom door. She answered that she had clearly heard gunshots, testily answering Roux's questions about how much time had elapsed between them by saying she ""didn't sit there with a stopwatch and take down the timing of each shot."" Moments of low comedy . Despite the serious subject of the trial, there were lighter moments, such as when Roux described the voice of Pistorius as sounding ""like a woman screaming"" when he's anxious. ""I'm 100% certain I heard two different people that evening,"" Burger insisted. There also was repeated confusion, irritation and befuddlement over the language in which Burger testified. She spoke Afrikaans, her native language, and had an interpreter translate her words into English. Personal essay: What my son taught me about Oscar Pistorius . But she regularly corrected her interpreter's English and had a brief discussion in English with the judge about whether she should testify in that language. It was agreed she would continue to testify in Afrikaans, but she repeatedly lapsed back into English. Pistorius pleaded not guilty Monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing, as well as two gun indictments unrelated to Steenkamp. It's expected to take at least three weeks for Judge Masipa to hear the case and decide whether Pistorius mistook Steenkamp for a burglar or killed her in cold blood. In South Africa, which abolished jury trials in 1969, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge. INTERACTIVE: Explore each side's argument . If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of ""culpable homicide,"" a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts say. Parts of Pistorius' trial are being televised live -- a first in South Africa -- after a judge's decision last week allowing cameras in the courtroom. But witnesses have the option of not having their images televised. The witnesses so far have taken that option. June Steenkamp, Reeva Steenkamp's mother, was in the courtroom for Monday's testimony, marking the first time she had laid eyes on Pistorius in person. The two had never met before. Steenkamp's parents have avoided previous court appearances because they wanted privacy. Dream couple . Pistorius, now 27, and Steenkamp, 29 when she died, were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles. Pistorius, nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" because of the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double-amputee runner to compete in the Olympics, in London in 2012. Cover girl Steenkamp, who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right. Everything changed before dawn on Valentine's Day 2013, as Steenkamp lay lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor of her boyfriend's house in an upscale gated community in Pretoria. Moments before, Pistorius says, he had pointed his 9 mm pistol toward an upstairs toilet room and fired four bullets through the locked door. In court documents, Pistorius has said he heard a noise from the bathroom in the middle of the night and -- feeling vulnerable without his prosthetic legs on -- charged toward the bathroom on his stumps. He has said he shot through the toilet door in order to protect himself and Steenkamp. ""I felt a sense of terror rushing over me,"" he said in his court affidavit. ""There are no burglar bars across the bathroom window, and I knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside."" ""It filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet. I thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window. As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself."" Prosecutors are painting a different picture. They say the pair had an argument and that Steenkamp locked herself in the toilet. At last year's bail hearing, the state said Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs, collected his gun from under the bed and walked down the hall leading from the bedroom to the bathroom before unloading a flurry of shots through the door. Pistorius is not claiming self-defense; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self-defense. He is denying that he intentionally, unlawfully killed Steenkamp. He has never denied killing her. The case has put the spotlight on South Africa's rampant gun violence and high crime rates. Roughly 45 people are murdered every day, according to police statistics, and the number of home burglaries is up 70% in the last decade. In 2012, more than half of South Africans told the country's police force that they were afraid of having their homes broken into. In his affidavit, Pistorius said he had been the victim of violence and burglaries before, including death threats. CNN's Robyn Curnow, Nick Thompson, Ashley Fantz and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.","NEW: Second witness says she was awoken by shouting .

"(CNN) -- Fallujah and Ramadi may have been sites of heavy bloodshed in recent days, but the Sunni Muslims of Iraq's Anbar Province, where the two cities are located, have long held a contemptuous attitude towards the embattled government of Prime Minister (and Shia Muslim) Nuri al-Maliki. Iraqi politics and many aspects of economic and social affairs have come to be dominated by antagonistic relationships between the country's Sunni and Shia populations. Nowhere is that more evident than in Anbar. For all intents and purposes, Fallujah and Ramadi are now out of the control of the central government and are now ruled under the authority, to differing degrees, of Sunni militiamen, local (tribally influenced) police, and extremist militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. READ MORE: Maliki demands Fallujah expel ""terrorists"" Having already launched a substantial military offensive targeting ISIS in Anbar's desert terrain on December 23, the Iraqi Army has now shifted much of its attention towards securing the province's key towns and cities. Arresting Ahmed al-Alwani, a powerful Sunni MP from Ramadi -- and killing his brother Ali -- on December 28 enraged the people of Anbar. But the coordinated military operation to shut down the city's expansive anti-government protest camp two days later was simply one move too far. Most tribes issued calls to arms and demanded the withdrawal of all federal armed forces from the province. Heavy fighting soon followed, the army withdrew personnel from all cities, and the convoys of heavily armed ISIS militants streamed into Ramadi and Fallujah, where security resistance was quickly subdued. As things stand today, the army stands poised to launch a major assault on Fallujah, where ISIS militants and local tribesmen are now the predominant force. Meanwhile in Ramadi, Sunni tribesmen -- particularly from the Albu Bali and the Al-Ghanim tribes -- have taken a more pragmatic approach and cooperated with local security forces in limited operations against ISIS militants. READ MORE: 5 things to know about Iraq crisis . Iraqi security was in dire straits well before the outbreak of deadly violence in Anbar. 2013 has been the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008. Much of this can be attributed to ISIS' rapid escalation of operations in Iraq, which has undoubtedly been aided by its expansion into Syria's civil conflict in April 2013. And with Iraqi elections scheduled to take place in April, Prime Minister Maliki is likely feeling pressure to present a strongman image, particularly to his core Shia constituents. At times in recent months, Maliki has adopted sharply sectarian rhetoric when referring to Sunni elements opposed to his government and has often presented the Sunni protest movement (including the Ramadi camp) as inherently connected to al Qaeda. With no substantive evidence to back these claims, it increasingly appeared that ""al Qaeda"" was being used as a political tool. This is not in any way to suggest ISIS (a structure that in fact ceased to officially be ""al Qaeda"" in 2007) does not pose a threat; quite the contrary. But tribes wield great influence in Anbar, and their dominant position within local security forces -- particularly the police -- meant ISIS had previously been restricted to an existence in the desert. Ironically, it was probably Maliki's crackdown on the Ramadi protest camp and the botched arrest of Ahmed al-Alwani that created the conditions for ISIS militants to move into the cities. But they're not the only force on the ground. In Fallujah, defected local police personnel and armed tribesmen opposed to the federal government arguably represent the superior force. For Maliki, neutralizing the protest movement before the elections was of paramount importance. Exploiting the threat of ISIS in order to exert military authority over the heavily tribal Sunni heartland of Anbar was a bold move. And the deployment of large numbers of army personnel from the predominantly Shia provinces of Maysan, Dhi Qar and Basra underlines the need to bring fiercely loyal forces into what will inevitably become a bloody fight. READ MORE: Tribesmen join in fight against al Qaeda . Fallujah now looks set to be the major flashpoint. While the military assault on the city has been temporarily suspended to allow for tribal negotiations to take place, at least some measure of military assault appears inevitable. It is likely the army will employ air strikes, artillery and mortar fire in preparation for a ground assault. Unfortunately, such tactics tend to incur heavy civilian casualties, which will only fuel greater anti-government sentiment and encourage tribal hostility. As U.S. and coalition forces discovered to their grave dismay in 2004, a siege of Fallujah won't end in days or weeks. Given the inherently social-level aspect of the tribal opposition to Maliki's government and the complexity of defeating any insurgent group in an urban environment, army forces will likely be deployed in and around Anbar's urban centers for some time to come -- risking prolonging tensions even further in the process. Considering the overwhelming attention given to the role of ISIS role in this grim state of affairs, it is unsurprising that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has pledged to support Maliki's offensive in Anbar -- albeit not with troops on the ground. The U.S. sent 75 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles to the Iraqi military in December and has pledged to accelerate the sale of a further 100 this spring. U.S. ScanEagle and Raven reconnaissance drones are also set to bolster the army's capability to combat terrorism. This may be a reasonable policy on paper, but when placed within recent geopolitical dynamics in the region it risks bolstering the widespread perception within the Middle East's Sunni communities that the U.S. has recently undertaken a fundamental policy shift -- now aligning with Shia powers at the expense of Sunni ones. The September 14 deal agreed between the U.S. and Russia on Syria's chemical weapons -- not to mention the interim nuclear deal the U.S. signed with Iran two months later -- has damaged U.S. relations with Gulf states and weakened U.S. relations with all sectors of Syria's opposition. The provision of sophisticated military equipment to the ultimately Shia-commanded Iraqi military, which is deploying Shia loyalist forces into a hostile Sunni tribal environment, risks further consolidating this emerging interpretation of international geopolitics. Maliki may be heartened by an Iranian offer to provide military equipment and advisory support in Anbar -- a politically astute move by Iran -- but it certainly won't help the U.S. dispel the perception that it has to some degree switched sides. For Maliki and Iraq, ISIS remains an extremely concerning problem. ISIS has now established an urban presence in Anbar -- particularly in Fallujah and, to a lesser extent, in Ramadi -- that must be overthrown. In this situation, and indeed in many in the Middle East, the tribes will play the role of kingmakers, and for those who have not already pragmatically sided with federal authorities, Maliki must change the perception in Anbar that he -- and not ISIS -- is their bigger enemy. Crucially, local -- and not federal -- security forces enjoy productive structural links with the tribes, and should form the backbone of any urban fighting force in Anbar -- as already appears to be case in areas of Ramadi. If the army launches an all-out offensive on Fallujah, ISIS will likely be the main benefactor. Ten years ago, the U.S. military led two major offensives on militants in Fallujah. While the actors may have changed or evolved since, history appears to be repeating itself.

"(CNN) -- A man who worked as a civilian military contractor at an air force base in Florida faces federal charges for improperly getting military housing and failing to report the weapons he had at the location. The U.S. attorney's office in Tampa said Scott Allan Bennett hasn't been indicted but has been charged by criminal complaint for actions last year at MacDill Air Force Base, the headquarters of both Central Command and Special Operations Command. The complaint -- dated December 16 in U.S. District Court in Tampa and unsealed two days ago -- said Bennett made a false statement and violated a defense property security regulation. A statement from MacDill Air Force Base said Bennett legally possessed the weapons but he had failed to register them as the base required. Bennett had an initial court appearance in Washington on Wednesday and was released on his own recognizance, and his preliminary hearing will be next Friday at U.S. District Court in Tampa, the attorney's office said. An affidavit from an air force detective laid out this timeline: . Early on April 23, Bennett was selected for random screening when he entered a gate at the base. Two knives and an empty gun holster were found in the inspection of the man's car. When Bennett was asked if there were more weapons in the car, he said there weren't any. Officers ""noticed that Bennett appeared dazed and confused"" and they called in Tampa police, who ran a field sobriety test and then arrested the man for driving under the influence. Bennett was searched and authorities found a ""concealed, loaded handgun."" Police also searched his vehicle and found another loaded handgun, three more knives, a box of throwing stars, a machete, a collapsible baton, Mace and a slingshot with BBs. After he was released by police, he returned to the gate at the base. Authorities read him his rights and Bennett asserted his right to remain silent and asked for a lawyer. Military officials wanted Bennett's permission to search his home at the base but Bennett denied it. After a military judge OK'd a search warrant, weapons and ammunition were found at Bennett's residence, including seven loaded firearms, about 9,389 more rounds of ammunition, several knives, brass knuckles, an electric stun gun, and a collapsible baton. MacDill required him to register any weaponry he intended to keep in his residence but he had not reported any of the items. Also, he was not permitted to carry concealed weapons on base. During the probe, the affidavit continues, investigators learned that Bennett ""obtained housing on MacDill Air Force Base by subterfuge."" Active duty orders are required to live on the base. While Bennett is a member of the Army Reserves, his commander said he ""has not been on active duty orders at any time relevant to this complaint and has only been on active duty orders one time during his membership in the Army Reserves to attend a week-long training session."" Bennett was employed as a contractor by Booz Allen Hamilton ""during some time periods relevant to the complaint,"" and his supervisor at that company said he ""was operating strictly as a civilian."" The affidavit says Bennett ""repeatedly held himself out to officials in the Housing Office"" at the air base as being on active duty and eventually was approved for the on-base living quarters. Bennett said his ""incoming unit assignment"" was Central Command and he was transferred from ""11th PSYOP Battalion."" which was his ""assigned unit in the Army Reserves."" And, he visited the base housing office ""dressed in a military uniform"" and said he was working as ""Admiral Olsen's aide and that Admiral Olsen had directed him to obtain government housing as quickly as possible,"" the affidavit says. David Chalela, Bennett's attorney, said the DUI case has not been resolved. As far as the accusations made in the affidavit, he said Bennett was just following his orders. Regarding the charge concerning the weapons, Chalela said Bennett had moved on base ""just a few days"" prior to the April 23 incident. He said Bennett hadn't completed all the paperwork required of him, including the form telling the Air Force what weapons he had in his home. At present, Bennett is no longer living on the base; he is in a Tampa condominium, Chalela said. The attorney said Booz Allen Hamilton had let Bennett go and his client is looking for work. The company said Bennett ""no longer works"" there, but ""the incident was not in any way related to his employment with us."" Chalela said he has been working with the Air Force to settle the matter. A statement from MacDill Air Force Base mirrors the information in the affidavit. It said Bennett ""was apprehended by base security forces during a random base entry vehicle check."" It said ""the security forces members followed established procedures and discovered legal weapons in his vehicle, but the weapons were not properly registered with the 6th Security Forces Squadron.'' Later, authorities determined that Bennett ""falsely presented himself on active duty status to gain residence on the installation. Once his status was verified, his eligibility for base housing was revoked.""

"(CNN) -- Volcanic ash from an Icelandic eruption could reach British airspace Tuesday, sooner than previously predicted, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority warned Monday. Scotland's Loganair announced that all flights will be canceled Tuesday due to forecasts that indicate ""a high density of ash will be present in large parts of Scottish airspace."" British Airways and Dutch airline KLM also canceled dozens of scheduled Tuesday flights to and from locations in Scotland. The eruption forced U.S. President Barack Obama, who was in Ireland on Monday, to move up the departure for his next stop on a six-day European tour. ""Due to a recent change in the trajectory in the plume of volcanic ash, Air Force One will depart Ireland for London tonight. The schedule for tomorrow will proceed as planned,"" White House official John Earnest told CNN. Get more information from the UK's National Weather Service . The Barcelona football club was also considering flying early to London for its Saturday match-up against Manchester United in the Champions League Final. The ash forced the closure of Icelandic airspace over the weekend, raising the specter of the kind of disruption of trans-Atlantic and European air travel that took place last year. But Britain's CAA said new arrangements have been put in place since last year's eruption of another Icelandic volcano, and those changes should reduce the number of flights that have to be canceled if the ash cloud spreads. The main international airport in Iceland reopened Monday evening, according to the airport's website. There were no international flights in or out of the country on Sunday after Grimsvotn -- Europe's most active volcano -- began to erupt on Saturday. Last year, trans-Atlantic and European air traffic was snarled for weeks by an ash cloud from the other volcano, Eyjafjallajokull. The Grimsvotn volcano under the Vatnajokull glacier erupted Saturday, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The last eruption of the volcano was in 2004, CNN affiliate TV2 Iceland reported. Grimsvotn is Iceland's most frequently active volcano. In 1783, a 16.7-mile fissure system from the volcano produced the world's largest known historical lava flow over a seven-month period, damaging crops and livestock, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. A resulting famine resulted in the loss of one-fifth of Iceland's population, according to the Smithsonian website.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pennsylvania landowners around the September 11, 2001, crash site of Flight 93 have reached an agreement with the federal government allowing construction of a permanent memorial there, the government announced Monday. Family members take part in a memorial service for Flight 93 on September 11, 2008, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the National Park Service has ""reached agreements with all the landowners needed"" to establish the permanent memorial for the 40 people killed in the terrorist hijacking nearly eight years ago. Salazar said the government will pay the landowners approximately $9.5 million. One of several airliners hijacked on September 11, 2001, by terrorists who intended to use them as flying bombs, United Airlines Flight 93 went down near Shanksville, in western Pennsylvania. Salazar described the negotiations as cordial, with landowners wanting ""to walk away saying we've done it for the right reasons."" A National Park Service Web site says the permanent memorial will honor ""the 40 passengers and crew members whose actions thwarted an attack on our nation's capital"" as they fought to regain control of the hijacked jetliner. Authorities believe the hijackers meant to crash the plane into either the White House or the Capitol. Architects have already sketched out the design, whose features will be situated to take advantage of a natural basin in the terrain. A Park Service official expects construction to begin in November. The announcement of an agreement with property owners around the crash site will not immediately change the public's ability to visit the location, according to Park Service site supervisor Joanne Hanley. ""Nobody has access to the crash site,"" she told CNN, ""and although you will be able to see the construction, it will be from the temporary viewing area."" Soon after the crash in 2001, local volunteers established an overlook from a hillside in cooperation with private property owners and the Park Service, which continues to provide support for visitors. Many of those who have come to pay respects have left memorial objects at the temporary site that are then cataloged and stored. Hanley told CNN Monday the Flight 93 National Memorial Collection now holds more than 25,000 objects. Lisa Linden, spokeswoman for the Families of Flight 93, issued a statement welcoming the agreement and saying that ""we are on track for the dedication of a substantial permanent memorial to the heroes of Flight 93 on the tenth anniversary of the events of 9/11.""","National Park Service plans memorial for 40 people killed in terrorist hijacking .

"(CNN) -- Holiday gatherings can be rough. You have a sneaking suspicion Uncle Joe is going to have a drink or five too many, and you're still wincing about that great gift your brother's girlfriend gave you last year, when you didn't get her a thing. You probably know how to handle these situations with grace and poise. But how would you really like to do it? Comedian Rob Riggle is here to provide a little inspiration. We asked Riggle -- a former ""Daily Show"" correspondent who also appears in CBS's ""Gary Unmarried"" and films including ""The Hangover"" -- to suggest some mischief for those awkward holiday moments. And for those without the comedic chops to follow his lead, we've also sought expert advice from stress management consultant Kathleen Hall, founder and CEO of The Stress Institute, and Stephanie Smith, a licensed psychologist in the Denver, Colorado, area and contributor to the American Psychological Association blog ""Your Mind Your Body."" Scenario 1: Someone gives you a gift, but you didn't get him/her one . Riggle's take: Thank goodness for current events. ""This is a good year for that,"" Riggle says. ""If that happens this year, you pat down your pockets, or pull them out and show that they are empty, and you say, 'Aw, man, I'm so sorry -- the recession and all.' ""And that's it, you're off the hook. And you're one up on presents."" Expert advice: Smile graciously, say thank you, don't feel guilty, and don't decide on the spot that you're going to give something in return, Smith and Hall say. Gift-giving doesn't always need to be reciprocal. ""[Being thankful] is more important than stammering, 'I forgot your gift and I'll bring it tomorrow,' "" Smith says. Scenario 2: A relative bugs you with personal questions . Riggle's take: Is the spotlight on you after Uncle Jim asked about your unemployment? Use it. ""If you can deliver it with a straight face, tell them you're thinking about becoming a rapper,"" Riggle says. ""That will get them off your back. ""Give them a little demo of the rapping skills. That's always nice, have a little rap in your pocket. Give them a taste. But you have to commit to it, like, 'My name is Rob, and I like corn on the cob' -- something that's awful, but make them believe you're sincere about it. ""That usually will work on at least getting them to talk to each other instead of you."" And if you're interrogated about your nonexistent dating life? ""I think being a little obnoxious at the top would signal you're not appreciating the conversation,"" Riggle says. ""If they ask when you are getting married, say, 'Tomorrow.' That's letting them know, 'OK, he's not going to answer me seriously,' and they'll be off your back."" Expert advice: Come up with canned responses now -- ones that answer the question sufficiently but put a period on the topic. ""Somebody that has been out of work a long time probably doesn't want to talk about being unemployed,"" Smith says. ""You may say something like, 'Thanks so much for asking. I've had a lot of interesting conversations with a lot of people about a lot of jobs, and I'm looking forward to 2010.' ""That leads to the next topic. You can say, 'Speaking of 2010, what are you doing for New Year's?' "" Scenario 3:  You arrive with a new significant other, but your friends and relatives are loyal to the previous one . Riggle's take: ""You have to sell how happy you are,"" he says. ""This is where it falls on you to be your absolute best. You really have to sell your joy and love for the world. You're leading the carols. Then they'll have to say, 'Wow, you're really happy. Your joy cannot be denied.' "" And what will the new date think? ""The new partner will love it,"" Riggle says. ""She won't know why you're happy. She'll think, 'Hey, this guy loves family. Maybe I'll want to marry him.' It just works all the way around."" Expert advice: The best defense is a great offense. Walk straight up to people and confidently introduce him or her. ""That can take people who thought they had the upper hand off guard, because you're showing confidence,"" says Hall, the Stress Institute founder. In case someone gives you a weird look, have an escape plan. ""Say [to your date], 'You wanted a drink, right? Let's get one.' Or, 'Look over there, there's Fred. I wanted you to meet him, too,' "" Hall says. Scenario 4: A relative is drunk and becoming obnoxious . Riggle's take: Now might be the time to put the fun in dysfunction. ""Generally speaking, when people drink, it's bad-decision time. That can be a lot of fun,"" Riggle says. ""That's an opportunity to talk them into doing something stupid, like getting them to take off their shirt or wrestle in the living room."" ""Also, alcohol serves as a truth serum, so that's the time to ask those tough questions. Get that family gossip out there, like the time cousin Eddie pooped his pants or something along those lines. ""These opportunities only come around so often -- weddings and holidays, that's it. Milk them for all you can get. That's the time to get the family dish."" Expert advice: Hall and Smith say it's generally best not to engage the heavy drinker, lest you risk an ugly scene. Hall, though, adds that someone with a good relationship with the person may want to kindly ask him or her to tone it down. ""Don't shame them in front of others -- take them into the next room and talk to them,"" Hall says. Smith says visitors can prepare an exit strategy: ""Talk with your partner or kids and say, 'If Aunt Suzie starts screaming, that's our cue to go home.'

"(CNN) -- When Chuck Pagano showed up for work Monday, he drove by a giant inflatable Indianapolis Colts player at the team's entrance. The player had a sign on his chest saying ""Welcome Back Chuck."" It was a moment to celebrate. Pagano, the Colts head coach, missed nearly three months battling leukemia. He was cleared to return to work last week. Monday was his first day back at the Colts team facility. ""It's really great to be back,"" Pagano said Monday at a press conference. ""Like a kid in a candy store, get to come and be around the guys again, be doing what I love to do, what I've done my whole life."" Pagano hasn't been on the sideline since September 23 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. This week, if all goes as planned, Pagano will return to the Colts sideline for the team's final regular season game, a home game against the Houston Texans. Players, coaches, and staff welcome Pagano's return, including Colts owner Jim Irsay. ""I'm very confident that he is ready, that it is the right decision, the right time for him to grab the reigns and put the head coaching cap back on and take over,"" Irsay said. Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians stepped in as interim coach while Pagano went through treatment. Arians led the Colts -- the NFL's worst team last season -- on an improbable run, winning nine of their next 12 games. On Sunday, the Colts defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 20-13 to improve to 10-5, clinching a playoff berth. ""What a masterful, masterful job you did, Bruce,"" Pagano said. ""You carried the torch, and all you went out and did was win nine ballgames, and got us our 10th win yesterday, and you got us into the playoffs. You did it with dignity and you did it with class, and you're everything that I always knew you were -- and more."" Pagano also thanked his family, particularly his wife, Tina, for their support through his treatment. He said that Tina never left his side at the IU Simon Cancer Center, where he spent 25 days. ""She's a soldier, a warrior, my soul mate,"" Pagano said. Although Pagano could not be at the team facility and at games while going through chemotherapy, the team and staff showed their support for him. The Colts began a campaign dubbed ""CHUCKSTRONG."" The purpose was to raise funds for leukemia research while also giving Pagano and his family support and well wishes. About 30 Colts players and coaches, including star rookie quarterback Andrew Luck, shaved their heads while Pagano underwent treatment. On November 25 in a game against the Buffalo Bills, two Colts cheerleaders had their heads shaved in response to the Colts organization raising money for cancer research. On Monday, Pagano said it was a ""privilege"" and a ""blessing"" to be back. ""I'll go about my business as a football coach and those type of things in the same manner,"" Pagano said. ""But what I asked the guys to do was to every day they walk in this door, the same way our coaches do, and the same way I'm going to do, is I'm going to work as hard as I can and take advantage of this great opportunity that was given to all of us and live every day to its fullest.""","Chuck Pagano was out for nearly three months battling leukemia .

"Cleveland (CNN) -- The Cleveland woman who was held the longest at Ariel Castro's house of horrors was there to see it shortly before it was torn down Wednesday. Michelle Knight handed out yellow helium-filled balloons Wednesday morning to people who'd gathered for the demolition of the 1,400-square-foot house where she and two other women were raped and held captive for roughly a decade. Minutes later, a hydraulic excavator began reducing the house to rubble, destroying the site of one of Cleveland's most notorious crimes. Knight told reporters that she was at the demolition site in part to remind relatives of abducted children that all is not necessarily lost. ""I want the people out there to know -- including the mothers -- that they can have strength, they can have hope, and their child will come back,"" she said. Castro forfeited the house on Seymour Avenue as part of a July plea deal with prosecutors that took the death penalty off the table in exchange for a life sentence, plus 1,000 years in prison. Castro's victims resilient after years of abuse . Demolition began around 7:30 a.m. as an aunt of another former Castro captive, Georgina DeJesus, made the first hit on the house, operating the excavator with assistance. By 10 a.m. the house had virtually been leveled, and the excavator's arm was dropping debris into a garbage truck. Before the demolition, Knight gave out balloons and, standing not far from the house where she lived an 11-year nightmare, she led a group in releasing them into the air. She said they represented abducted children who were never found. ""I go from here as being a motivational speaker and let everybody know that they are heard, that they are loved, and that there is hope for everyone,"" she said. The goal is to tear the house down and get the property filled in, graded and seeded in a single day, said Gus Frangos, president of Cuyahoga Land Bank, which is supervising the demolition. Castro pleaded guilty last month to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping. The charges stem from his kidnapping, rape and assault of three women: Knight, abducted in 2002; DeJesus, abducted in 2004; and Amanda Berry, abducted in 2003. Also held was Berry's daughter, who was born at the home six years ago. DNA tests confirmed that Castro is the girl's father. Berry and her daughter escaped from the home with the help of a neighbor on May 6, calling police in her now famous 911 call: ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry. I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here. I'm free now."" Knight's visit to Castro's home was at least her second in a week. On Friday, she stood outside and looked at the house at 2207 Seymour Ave., a neighbor said. Victim returns to Cleveland house where she was held for 11 years . She also attended Castro's sentencing Thursday, telling him ""I spent 11 years in hell. Now, your hell is just beginning."" Castro's friends and family removed personal items from the home Monday, including musical instruments and photographs. Police said most of the items removed Monday were personal items left over after investigators collected evidence. Berry also visited the house this week, collecting pictures drawn by her daughter. Ariel Castro's son: I won't visit dad in prison . Castro reconfigured the home to keep the captives' whereabouts a secret, FBI agent Andrew Burke testified during the sentencing. The back door was outfitted with an alarm, bedspreads and curtains obscured parts of the home, and a porch swing was placed in front of the stairs leading to the rooms where Castro held the three.
