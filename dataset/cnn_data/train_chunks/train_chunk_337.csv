"(CNN) -- California's high court ruled Thursday that retailers don't have the right to ask customers for their ZIP code while completing credit card transactions, saying that doing so violates a cardholders' right to protect his or her personal information. Many retailers in California and nationwide now ask people to give their ZIP code, punching in that information and recording it. Yet California Supreme Court's seven justices unanimously determined that this practice goes too far. The ruling, penned by Justice Carlos Moreno, overrules earlier decisions by trial and appeals courts in California. It points to a 1971 state law that prohibits businesses from asking credit cardholders for ""personal identification information"" that could be used to track them down. While a ZIP code isn't a full address, the court's judgment states that asking for it -- and piecing that 5-digit number together with other information, like a cardholder's name -- ""would permit retailers to obtain indirectly what they are clearly prohibited from obtaining directly, (therefore) 'end-running'"" the intent of California state laws. ""The legislature intended to provide robust consumer protections by prohibiting retailers from soliciting and recording information about the cardholder that is unnecessary to the credit card transaction,"" the decision states. ""We hold that personal identification information ... includes the cardholder's ZIP code."" Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association, said it is ""ironic"" that a practice aimed partly at protecting consumers from fraud is being taken away. ""We think it's a terrible decision because it dramatically expands what personal information is, by including a ZIP code as part of an address,"" Dombrowski said. ""We are surprised by it."" The court decision applies only in California, though it reflects a practice that is increasingly common elsewhere. It does not specify how or if all businesses that take credit cards, such as gas stations, would be affected -- though it does state that its objection is not over a retailer seeing a person's ZIP code, but rather recording and using it for marketing purposes. The discussion began with a June 2008 class-action lawsuit filed initially by Jessica Pineda against home retailer Williams-Sonoma. In her suit, Pineda claimed that a cashier had asked for her ZIP code during a purchase -- information that was recorded and later used, along with her name, to figure out her home address. Williams-Sonoma did this tapping a database that it uses to market products to customers and sell its compiled consumer information to other businesses. Pineda contended the practice of asking for ZIP codes violates a person's right to privacy, made illegal use of her personal information and gave a retailer, like Williams-Sonoma, an unfair competitive advantage. Williams-Sonoma claimed that a ZIP code doesn't constitute ""personal identification information,"" as stated in the 1971 state law. The state supreme court ruling, only addressing the ""identification information"" issue, determined that a ZIP code should be protected, since the law specifically mentions protecting a cardholder's address. The court concluded requesting a ZIP code is not much different than asking for a phone number or home address. It is not illegal in California for a retailer to see a person's ZIP code or address, the ruling notes: For instance, one can request a customer's driver's license to verify his or her identity. What makes it wrong is when a business records that information, according to the ruling, especially when the practice is ""unnecessary to the sales transaction."" In reversing the Court of Appeals judgment, the supreme court remanded the case back to a lower court to order specific changes and policies ""consistent with this decision.""","California Supreme Court justices vote 7-0 to overturn two lower court decisions .

"(CNN) -- The construction of what would be Seoul's tallest building has hit a snag following the appearance of a number of mysterious sinkholes in and around the neighborhood where it is being built. Residents of South Korea's capital are alarmed by the increasing incidence of sinkholes -- depressions, measuring up to several feet in depth and diameter, which have suddenly appeared around Seoul. The first one was discovered in June, and since then several others have appeared, local media have reported. Now, in a climate marked by increased safety concerns, the construction of a huge skyscraper in the city has come under scrutiny. Last month, two holes within a couple of meters of each other were discovered near the National Assembly in the Yeouido district of the capital. Several examples of this unexplained phenomenon have occurred near the site of the Lotte World Tower, a half-constructed commercial and office development by Korean conglomerate Lotte which, when completed, will be the sixth tallest tower in the world. Holes have appeared in at least two streets in the Songpa district, where the new tower is being built, including a 50 centimeter (20 inch) wide hole only half a kilometer (a third of a mile) from the Lotte World Tower construction site. So far, authorities are baffled. ""We do not know the cause yet,"" a police officer told the Korea Times. ""In cooperation with Seoul Metro and Seoul Metropolitan Government, we investigated the problem and only found that the holes have nothing to do with sewerage."" A lake near the site, which appears to be shrinking, is also cause for concern. Water levels have fallen about 70 centimeters (27 inches), although Seulki Lee, a spokesperson for Lotte Group, told CNN that it would be ""nearly impossible"" for the water to drain into the tower's foundations due to a slurry wall between the lake and the construction. The spokesperson also said that the company was looking into the mysterious sinkholes. ""We are working on an investigation of sinkholes but it will take some time to figure out what's going on,"" she said. She said that academics and engineers from Lotte have told the construction company that the sinkholes are not related to the site but it is ""necessary to figure out what is going on"" to provide assurance for the public. Plans for the 555-meter (1,821-foot), 123-story tower were first put forward almost two decades ago, but planning permission was slow in coming, due to security concerns from a nearby military base. Construction of the tower, designed by American firm KPF, is underway and more than half of the tower's floors have been completed. The architecture firm was, at the time of press, unavailable for comment. Professor Hong Gun Park of Seoul National University's Department of Architecture and Architectural Engineering was a consultant on the project, completing an ""outsider's evaluation."" He told CNN that the foundations of the building were solid, and that Seoul had no history of subsidence. ""People found sinkholes near the building site, (and) since there is a small lake, they are worried about the robustness of the foundation of the building. ""However, recently many sinkholes were found here and there in Seoul. Furthermore the foundation of the building is deep and is sitting on the deep hard rock. Thus in my opinion there is no problem (with) the structural safety of the building."" He said that it was unlikely that the Seoul municipal government would halt construction without reasonable cause. The safety concerns over the building come months after the country was shocked by the sinking in April of the Sewol ferry, which led to widespread criticism throughout South Korea that safety was not a priority. Almost 300 people, mostly teenagers on a school trip, died when the ferry capsized. orv . Corvette museum reopens after sinkhole swallowed pricey cars .

"(CNN) -- A convicted drunken driver was sentenced Wednesday to 51 years to life in prison for a crash that killed Los Angeles Angel pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others, the Orange County, California, district attorney said. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 23, of San Gabriel, California, received the maximum sentence after a jury found him guilty in September of three felony counts of murder, felony drunken driving and two other felonies, according to District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and court spokeswoman Carole Levitzky. Gallo had previously been convicted in San Bernardino County, California, for driving under the influence in 2006 and was on probation at the time of the April 2009 crash, the district attorney said. Authorities say Gallo's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit when he sped through a red light and crashed into a car. Adenhart, 22, of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who was beginning his first full season in the majors, was killed. He had pitched just his fourth Major League game hours earlier. The crash also killed Courtney Stewart, 20, a student and former cheerleader at California State University at Fullerton, and law student Henry Pearson, 25, who was working toward becoming a sports agent, authorities said. A fourth victim, 24-year-old Jon Wilhite, a former baseball player for the Cal State-Fullerton Titans, was critically injured and is now in stable condition, the prosecutor said. ""Before drinking, set up a plan to have a sober driver,"" Rackauckas said in a written statement. ""If you make the decision to drink and drive, we will make the decision to charge you with vehicular manslaughter or murder and you may spend the rest of your life in prison. During this holiday season, think about the pain on the victims' families' faces before you drink and drive."" In addition to being drunk and on probation, Gallo was driving on a suspended driver's license when his minivan, going about 65 mph in a 35 mph zone, crashed into Adenhart's vehicle at 12:23 a.m. on April 9, 2009, authorities said. His license had been suspended because of a prior drunken driving conviction, the prosecutor said. Gallo's 21-year-old step-brother was a passenger in the minivan. After the collision, Gallo fled on foot, but was arrested less than 30 minutes later about two miles away by Anaheim police officers, authorities said. Two hours after the crash, Gallo had a blood alcohol level of 0.19%, well above the legal limit of 0.08%, authorities said. Rackauckas released remarks made during Wednesday's sentencing by relatives of the crash victims. In a written statement submitted to the court, Adenhart's family said: ""Our pain is not a state of being but a condition of life. We live with this hole in our family, our heart, our belief and our lives. No amount of words will ever fill that hole or in any way replace the loss of our dear Nick. Nick was beautiful. That phrase describes him best."" Jon Wilhite's mother, Elizabeth, said her son has had ""to learn to walk, talk, swallow, and eat."" ""All the things we take for granted, Jon had to learn. His life before the crash was very active. He will never be able to turn his head to look up at the moon or to play baseball, which he loves so much. But he takes it in stride. Jon is the strongest person I know. He's our hero and didn't deserve what happened to him,"" the mother said. Jon Wilhite wrote a statement that was read to the court, explaining how his life is forever changed. He said he believes Gallo should be severely punished for taking the lives of three people whom he thinks about every day.","Andrew Thomas Gallo, 23, was on probation from a prior drunken driving conviction .

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Big-box stores are stealing Thanksgiving, and their workers aren't happy about it. After Target decreed that Black Friday would start at midnight Thanksgiving night and that employees must report to work at 11 p.m., an Omaha worker, Anthony Hardwick, posted a petition at Change.org asking the company to move the official start of Christmas shopping back to 5 a.m. Friday. Response from workers and others has been stellar: 192,000 signatures by Monday. Best Buy will also be opening at midnight, so Rick Melaragni, a Tampa employee, posted a similar petition. It currently has 14,000 signatures. Why did this hit such a nerve? Hardwick's petition says, ""A full holiday with family is not just for the elite of this nation -- all Americans should be able to break bread with loved ones and get a good night's rest on Thanksgiving!"" But he will have to cut out on the family to grab some sleep, because he'll be up all night working. Melaragni told The Huffington Post that Best Buy will be showing a Harry Potter movie to customers camped outside, so some employees will have to report to work by 8 p.m. to set up. Walmart is the leader in this year's great race to gobble up employee turkey time. It announced its opening at 10 p.m. Thursday. Since two-thirds of Walmart's hourly workers are women, many will arrive exhausted after cooking the family feast. Americans already work longer hours than in most countries, and as incomes shrink, lots of low-wage workers have multiple jobs. Many families' work schedules make it impossible to have weekends or even dinner together. That's why holidays provide the only opportunity for so many extended families to see each other. Our current obsession with corporate values, however, leaves no space for human values anymore. The just-in-time workforce means just no time for the family. If these workers had unions, companies would have had to negotiate these schedule changes and a lot else too, but the retail giants hate unions worse than missing Black Friday. Just last summer, Target workers in Long Island tried unsuccessfully to get a union. Their last pay increase amounted to eight cents, according to the union. Target did all it could to get the no vote, including a veiled threat to close the store. It's Walmart that sets the pace in union busting. One former employee told me that when Walmart found out he was trying to organize at his store in Texas, it assigned him his own personal supervisor, who stuck to him like glue. A January 2011 report by Nelson Lichtenstein and Erin Johanson found that Walmart is also the leader in driving down wages and working conditions for the nation's 14.4 million retail workers. The median hourly retail wage is $10.58, which is considerably less than the median for all workers of $15.95. Without unions, workers have no leverage to get raises or even livable schedules. But retailers say they can't help it. Shoppers are the ones demanding that workers sacrifice Thanksgiving. A Target spokeswoman says, ""We have heard from our guests that they want to shop Target following their Thanksgiving celebrations rather than only having the option of getting up in the middle of the night."" You'd think these box-full-of-billions retailers are just little mom-and-pop corner stores at the mercy of shoppers' whims when in fact the biggest eight of them control 85% of the general merchandise market. A National Retail Federation representative says shoppers will ""dedicate themselves manically to finding the best deal."" Pitting shoppers against workers is much easier than looking into why shoppers sometimes act like mobs or why workers want some voice in their work lives. In fact, big-box shoppers and workers have a lot in common. Most are barely getting by. A recent study of Walmart found that 28% of sales are to people making less than 200% of the federal poverty line ($44,100 in 2010 for a family of four) . Meanwhile, 22% of Walmart workers make less than $9 an hour, and 64% make less than $12. While some Black Friday shoppers may indeed be fixated on the cheapest new Nintendo game system, even more have to stretch their slim paychecks just to buy necessities for the family plus an occasional toy. There are solutions. One retail employee, commenting at the Best Buy petition site, suggested that the company take out an ad and say it's giving Thanksgiving back, but it'll be open Friday and all weekend with great deals. Simple. Show some leadership, appeal to something besides greed and reverse the trend. That study of Walmart showed that raising workers' minimum wage to $12 would have minimum impact on prices, even if Walmart passes all its increased costs on to consumers. It suggested that cities set minimum wages and standards for big-box stores. Some communities are passing community benefits agreements to set standards for big-box stores. To get these things, and also long-overdue labor law reform, we need more workers willing to stand up like petitioners Hardwick and Melaragni and the Long Island Target workers, and we need consumers to recognize that they're workers, too, and that paying the lowest prices has a hidden cost for their children and our society. That cost is less opportunity for good jobs, more job offshoring and an ever-declining standard of living. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Judy Ancel.","Big-box stores are stealing Thanksgiving, and their workers aren't happy, Judy Ancel says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors have unsealed an affidavit that details a rendezvous in a Washington hotel room last month between a prostitute and a client who a source tells CNN was New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Gov. Eliot Spitzer, with his wife, Silda, by his side, apologizes to his family and to the public. The affidavit does not mention Spitzer by name, but a source with knowledge of the case said the subject identified as Client-9 is the governor. Spitzer took office in January 2007 after serving eight years as the state's attorney general, when he rose to national prominence as a hard-charging prosecutor. He has not been charged. Spitzer, who is married with three children, went before reporters Monday to confess to an undisclosed personal indiscretion, saying he had acted ""in a way that violates my obligations to my family, that violates my or any sense of right and wrong."" He did not acknowledge the allegations, which were revealed Monday in The New York Times, nor did he take questions.  Watch Spitzer's apology » . His alleged involvement with the ring was caught on a federal wiretap, the source said. The prostitute, identified only as ""Kristen"" worked for the Emperors Club, which charged between $1,000 and $5,500 an hour and operated in New York; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; London, England; and Paris, France, according to court papers. According to the affidavit, defendant Temeka Rachelle Lewis -- who is accused of working as a booking agent for the club -- wrote a text message Monday, February 11, asking the operation's day-to-day organizer to ""pls let me know if (Client-9's) 'package' arrives 2mrw. Appt wd be on Wed."" Prosecutors say the message was a reference to a deposit. On Tuesday, according to the affidavit, Lewis sent a message to Kristen, saying Client-9's deposit had not arrived but she should be able to ""do the trip"" if it arrived the next day.  View a gallery of recent political sex scandals » . In a later conversation, Lewis and Kristen discussed when the prostitute could take a train from New York's Penn Station to Washington's Union Station, the affidavit says. Client-9 would be ""paying for everything -- train tickets, cab fare from the hotel and back, mini bar or room service, travel time, and hotel."" The affidavit says that, about 5 p.m. Tuesday, February 12, Lewis spoke with Client-9 on the telephone and told him that his ""package arrived today."" The client asked Lewis whom he would be meeting and, when told it was Kristen, said, ""Great, OK, wonderful."" The two discussed how the woman would get a key to his room for a Wednesday rendezvous and how they could arrange credit for future services. ""Client-9 asked Lewis to remind him what Kristen looked like and Lewis said that she was an American, petite, very pretty brunette, 5 feet 5 inches and 105 pounds,"" the affidavit reads. In a call to Lewis, Client-9 was told the balance would be $2,712.41, but Lewis suggested he give Kristen $1,500 or $2,000 more so that he would have a credit. According to the affidavit, Kristen called Lewis about 9:32 p.m. Wednesday, February 13, and told her she was in Client-9's room -- No. 871 -- at the Washington hotel. Four minutes later, Client-9 was in the hotel, Lewis told Kristen in another call. No more calls were logged until 12:02 a.m. Thursday -- Valentine's Day -- nearly 2½ hours later. At that time, Kristen told Lewis Client-9 had left and she had collected $4,300. Lewis told the prostitute she'd been told that Client-9 ""would ask you to do things that, like, you might not think are safe -- you know -- I mean that ... very basic things,"" the affidavit says. Kristen told Lewis, ""I have a way of dealing with that. ... I'd be like, listen dude, you really want the sex?"" ""I don't think he's difficult,"" Kristen is quoted as saying. ""I mean it's just kind of like ... whatever ... I'm here for a purpose. I know what my purpose is. I am not a ... moron, you know what I mean."" Spitzer, who built his career on rooting out public corruption as New York attorney general, became a national figure with a series of high-profile Wall Street investigations. He is also known for prosecuting prostitution rings.  See a timeline of his life » . Now his lawyers may be questioned about how he paid for the alleged hotel encounter, whether the trail was concealed and whether any banking laws were circumvented as a result, the source said. The investigation into the Emperor's Club, which began in October 2007, included evidence from a confidential source identified in court papers as a prostitute who worked at the club in 2006 and was given immunity. It also included statements from an undercover officer who posed as a customer, more than 5,000 intercepted phone calls and text messages, more than 6,000 e-mails recovered with search warrants, bank records, travel and hotel records and physical surveillance. Despite the high cost of the club's services, the job was not alluring to one potential employee, who sent an e-mail to the club's management January 28 after speaking to a friend who was working for the agency. ""I wasn't very happy to find out that it's only 500 ph + over 50% commission fees ... This is the kind of money I make very easily in photo shoots and the reason I wanted to join your site [was] to make an extra money."" She added: ""The other think [sic] I was a little bit shock and confuse that she had a sex with him twice in an hour and without her taking her out for dinner before. ... So I am very sorry I don't think this is my kind of thing."" People who know Spitzer, 48, were surprised by the allegations. ""To say this is a shock is an understatement,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who went to law school with Spitzer. Toobin called Spitzer ""the straightest arrow I know."" ""I think there's no question if he is involved -- and I'm not saying he is, because we don't know all the facts -- I would say he'd have to resign,"" said James Tedisco, the Republican minority leader in the state Assembly. Tedisco said that Spitzer's push to reform government ""loses all validity if he was involved in something illegal like that."" The Republican Governors Association called on Spitzer, a Democrat, to resign to ""allow the people of New York to pursue honest leadership."" ""The American people are tired of corrupt and hypocritical politicians. The governor of New York is just another in the long list of politicians that have failed their constituents,"" said Nick Ayers, executive director of the Governors Association.

"Washington (CNN) -- GOP critics cranked up the political heat Thursday on Attorney General Eric Holder, threatening impeachment and accusing him of withholding information from Congress about Operation Fast and Furious, a severely flawed and discredited federal gun-sting program. At the end of a long, combative day of testimony before the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee, California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa compared Holder to disgraced Nixon-era Attorney General John Mitchell. Holder shot back by comparing Issa to Sen. Joe McCarthy, the infamous Wisconsin Republican censured by the Senate in 1954 for leading what critics called a Communist witch hunt. ""As they said in the McCarthy hearings, have you no shame?"" asked Holder, referencing a famous retort to McCarthy. Holder acknowledged mistakes were made, but said he would not resign over the controversy. The attorney general, accusing the GOP of playing political games, said he also didn't think any of his top aides should step down. Operation Fast and Furious, which started in 2009, allowed illegally purchased firearms to be taken from gun stores in Arizona across the Mexican border to drug cartels. The intent of the operation was to monitor the flow of weapons to their ultimate destination. However, hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for, and a storm of outrage erupted when two of the missing weapons were found at a site where Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in December 2010. Democrats and Republicans have since been at odds over who knew what about the operation and when. Wisconsin GOP Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told Holder Thursday that ""heads should roll"" over the matter. ""There is really no responsibility within the Justice Department,"" Sensenbrenner said. ""The thing is, if we don't get to the bottom of this -- and that requires your assistance on that -- there is only one alternative that Congress has and it is called impeachment."" Sensenbrenner did not make clear whether he was referring to the possible impeachment of Holder or other top Justice Department officials. Blame for the botched operation ""must go to your desk,"" Issa, the GOP's point man on investigating Fast and Furious, told Holder. Congress has been ""systematically lied to"" by department officials, he alleged. For his part, Holder told committee members the operation relied on ""unacceptable tactics"" and was ""inexcusable."" But he insisted that Justice Department officials have cooperated with congressional investigators, and he said that any previous misleading information provided on the matter was not part of an intentional deception. ""It all has to do with your state of mind and whether or not you had the requisite intent to come up with something that can be considered perjury or (a) lie,"" Holder said. The attorney general tried to turn the tables on his GOP critics, accusing them of engaging in ""inflammatory and inappropriate rhetoric ... in an effort to score political points."" It's time to end ""politically motivated 'gotcha' games,"" he said. While Holder and his critics vehemently disagreed over the extent of executive-legislative cooperation in the Fast and Furious investigation, they agreed that the deadly fallout from the operation is not over. Fast and Furious is ""going to continue to have tragic consequences,"" Holder said at one point in Thursday's hearing. ""More people are going to die, probably,"" said Rep. Ted Poe, a Texas Republican. ""Unfortunately, I think that's probably true,"" Holder replied. Last month, Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the controversial operation ""should never have happened, and ... must never happen again,"" hitting hard at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives practice that has now tarnished his tenure at the Justice Department. Despite Holder's insistence that Congress has never been intentionally misled in the matter, a number of Republicans have called for him to step down. Last month, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar said the attorney general's ""refusal to take responsibility for the actions of his department is inexcusable."" Earlier this week, Issa, head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he is broadening his investigation to also include recent allegations of U.S. agents laundering money for Mexican cartels -- accusations that have infuriated officials on both sides of the border. ""These allegations, if true, raise further unsettling questions about a Department of Justice component engaging in a high-risk strategy with scant evidence of success,"" Issa said in a letter to Holder. ""The existence of such a program again calls your leadership into question,"" Issa added. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday that Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer should also resign because he misled Congress about his awareness of a February 4 letter that denied any gunrunning operation existed. The Justice Department recently withdrew the letter due to inaccurate information, and Grassley said that e-mails turned over to congressional investigators showed Breuer saw various versions of the letter -- including the final one submitted to Congress -- before it was sent in February. In addition, Grassley said Breuer knew in 2010 of a previous gunrunning operation by the ATF in the Bush administration, but he failed to notify superiors or Congress about it. ""Mr. Breuer's failure to be candid and forthcoming before this body irreparably harms his credibility,"" Grassley said, later adding: ""Mr. Breuer has lost my confidence in his ability to effectively serve the Justice Department. If you can't be straight with the Congress you don't need to be running the Criminal Division. It is time to stop spinning and start taking responsibility."" In response, Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said Breuer ""has acknowledged his mistake in not making -- and therefore not alerting department leadership to -- a connection between the allegations made about Operation Fast and Furious and the unacceptable tactics used years earlier."" But Holder ""continues to have confidence"" in Breuer's ability to lead the department's Criminal Division, Schmaler said. Breuer and Holder previously apologized to a Senate committee and to Grassley in particular about the false information in the February letter. Both have insisted they did not know the assertions were wrong when the department sent the letter. However, Grassley said Wednesday that the additional documents recently provided to congressional investigators show that Breuer should have been aware that the letter contained false assertions, due to his knowledge of a similar previous program called Operation Wide Receiver. In Mexico, the case has drawn nationwide attention and sharp criticism from top officials, who have long stressed that U.S. weapons are fueling the country's drug war. The Mexican attorney general's office demanded a quick U.S. investigation of the matter in March and said authorities must hold accountable anyone who was responsible for the operation. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen, Terry Frieden and Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","NEW: Issa compares Holder to Nixon AG John Mitchell; Holder asks Issa if he has ""no shame""

"(CNN) -- The recipe for bingsu, Korea's beloved shaved ice dessert, used to be simple. A little bowl of shaved ice, red beans boiled in sugar water, a little bit of condensed milk and maybe some fruit or ice cream heaped on top. That was before the Park Hyatt Seoul debuted the first so-called luxury bingsu three years ago, to spectacular sales and a frenzied following. Competing Seoul hotels promptly entered the fray with spoons blazing. With bingsu now at the top of every hotel restaurant's summer agenda, the battle to come up with the most luxurious, inventive, delicious variation of the dessert has gotten more intense this year. Here are the hotels that are currently winning the war. Park Hyatt Seoul . This Gangnam luxury hotel started it all. In 2010, the hotel dreamed up a sweet pumpkin bingsu, made with a base of dunggulle tea made from the dried root of Solomon's seal, and an omija bingsu using shaved frozen berries. While most bingsu in Korea is made with frozen ice, the hotel debuted bingsu with a frozen milk base, and found that customers loved the change. They bought an expensive shaving machine in 2011 and also ordered traditional Korean pottery known to keep cold food insulated longer. Seoul's bingsu fanatics promptly fell in love with the new menu. The hotel's berry bingsu in particular came as a shock. Korea's best bars for summer . The combination of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, black currant compote with handmade dark chocolate, whipped cream, pistachios and mint created a completely new taste. The hotel became mobbed at meal times and on the weekends, and raked in several hundred thousand dollars of profit in a season, to the amazement -- and likely some envy -- of its competitors. Since that memorable debut, the Park Hyatt has had to top its own bingsu menu each year. In 2012, it introduced a peach bingsu and a chocolate bingsu. And this summer? The Bingsu Colada, made with pineapple, coconut chips, caramel sauce and macademia nuts, is new to the menu. Another new addition is the Tirami Bingsu. It's made with mascarpone cream, espresso sauce, Kahlua, Amaretti cookies and almonds. Despite the new dishes, the Berry Bingsu remains the hotel's most popular. Park Hyatt Seoul, 606 Teheran-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul; +82 2 2016 1205; bingsu prices start at ₩33,000 ($29) a bowl . Intercontinental Seoul Coex . The effort that the Intercontinental Seoul Coex has put into its bingsu menu has been extreme. Since the beginning of the year, the hotel's top chefs have created approximately 30 variations of the dessert, presenting a different version each week for tastings and deliberation. From this process, a final three bingsu have ended up on the menu. The Kurumba bingsu is made with shaved frozen pure coconut water from the Philippines, mixed with coconut biscuits and coconut jelly, all made at the hotel. The Mango Rosa Sparkling bingsu is dubbed the ""19-plus"" bingsu, for its alcoholic content (19 is the legal drinking age in Korea). The sweet Rosso Degli Anjelli Rose Sparkling Wine is frozen, shaved, then blended with frozen mango shavings and fresh mangoes. 10 best Korean restaurants in Seoul . When creating the latter bingsu, hotel chefs went through dozens of trials to capture the ""sparkling"" aspect of the wine in the actual bingsu. In order to make the perfect red bean paste, which can be ordered separately with each bingsu, a designated red bean chef has the arduous job of boiling the red bean until wrinkles form, then pouring cold water until the wrinkles are stretched out again, and repeating the process over and over until the perfect moist texture is reached. Some of the hotel's bingsu are sweetened with natural xylitol from Finland.

Upon returning to South Korea, he created green tea syrup using a maturing method at low temperatures, and also came up with the perfect red bean recipe by soaking the beans in water for a day, then boiling them for eight hours and adding three kinds of sugar at varying intervals.

"San Diego (CNN) -- With the Supreme Court poised this week to hear arguments in the legal challenge to Arizona's immigration law, it's a good time to explain what this law and the ruckus surrounding it are really about. The left says it's about racism and political extremism; the right claims the issues are border security and public safety. Wrong. In the two years since Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law, it's become clear that this law, and the debate over it, are really about three things: fear, power, and freedom. It's about fear. As someone who lived in Phoenix and wrote for the Arizona Republic in the late 1990s, I can tell you that Arizonans only recently reached the conclusion that they wanted to get rid of illegal immigrants. The 'Zonies I knew couldn't live without them. Not a lot of U.S. citizens were lining up to do the hard and dirty jobs that the undocumented were doing. That includes landscaping or other jobs that require you to work outdoors in 115-degree weather. In 1994, when Californians passed Proposition 187 -- an anti-illegal immigration ballot initiative that intended to deny public services to illegal immigrants but was ultimately struck down by the courts -- and when President Bill Clinton launched ""Operation Gatekeeper"" to beef up enforcement on the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who had been headed to California took a detour through Arizona. Those who crusade against illegal immigration in the Grand Canyon State will say that this is when the ""invasion"" began. In truth, it was more like a gigantic job fair where employers eagerly gobbled up illegal immigrants to do everything from cleaning houses to raising children to cooking in restaurants. At the time, few people seemed concerned about verifying legal status. I once asked the crew washing my car at a popular Phoenix carwash if they had fake green cards, and one of the young men chuckled and said there was no need, since the employer never asked if they were legally eligible to work. Fueled by illegal immigrant labor, cities like Phoenix boomed, and this was fine by the Phoenicians -- many of whom envisioned their city growing into a desert metropolis with all the amenities. But the problem was that they weren't prepared for the demographic side effect: the fear that they were losing control, and the realization that whites would soon become a statistical minority in Arizona just as they are in California, Texas and New Mexico. Something had to be done to readjust the ethnic balance. And that something was SB 1070, or as local activists have dubbed it: ""The Mexican Removal Act."" It's about power. One of the main things that makes the law so controversial is also one of the things that the lower federal courts have said makes it unconstitutional -- that it essentially deputizes local and state police, who typically haven't been trained to enforce immigration law, and gives them the power to act as surrogates for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Constitution is pretty clear that regulating immigration policy is exclusively a federal responsibility, which is the reason that Proposition 187 was struck down. And the scores of police chiefs who resist enforcing federal immigration law are correct that it erodes the trust between law enforcement and local communities. But perhaps the best argument against giving local and state police this power is that they almost always misuse it. You see, this job is tougher than it looks, if you want to surgically remove illegal immigrants without harassing or disrupting the lives of U.S.-born Latinos, including some whose families have been in the Southwest for nearly 500 years. That is especially true in the place that used to be called the Arizona Territory. For those of us who support the role of federal agents to enforce immigration law, including deporting people when appropriate, the problem isn't that the law is being enforced. By all means, the law should be enforced. The problem is who is doing the enforcing. If the dirty work of asking people for birth certificates and other forms of identification to prove they have a legal right to be in this country is being done by amateurs, it is more likely that there will be mistakes. People will be profiled. Dark skins and accents will take the place of hard evidence and probable cause. Civil rights will be trampled upon. That's the concern in Arizona, where state lawmakers made a power grab and foolishly gave local and state police officers something that most of them never wanted: the authority to enforce federal immigration law. That authority has to be held in check and closely monitored, and that is where the courts come in. This is the role that U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton fulfilled when, in July 2010, she struck down some of the most grotesque parts of the law -- a requirement that local police determine the immigration status of individuals they suspect of being in the country illegally, a mandate that people carry documents that prove they have a legal right to be in the United States, and a provision making it a crime for laborers to solicit work. And it's about freedom, because U.S.-born Latinos should be free from harassment. They shouldn't have to prove they belong in their own country. In this case, they should be spared the additional humiliation of having to prove they have the legal right to be in a region to which they are indigenous. They have the right to be left alone without mischief-making bureaucrats or lawmakers calling their ""American-ness"" into question. They and their families have earned it the hard way -- by answering this nation's call, enlisting in the military, and often making the ultimate sacrifice dating back to the days of the American Revolution. Conservatives get worked up over perceived threats to freedom all the time. Whether it's a smoking ban or a government mandate to buy health insurance, those on the right know how to raise a fuss over big government. What could be worse that police agencies using the blunt instrument of racial and ethnic profiling to ferret out suspected illegal immigrants? How does government get any ""bigger"" than that? This debate was never about the rights of illegal immigrants. It's about the rights of those U.S. citizens and legal residents whom the untrained and uninformed might mistake for illegal immigrants. It's about the kind of country we've always been, and the kind that we want to remain. We sometimes forget that personal liberty is the cornerstone of the United States of America. Once again, it's up to the Supreme Court to remind us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Arizona's immigration law not all about racism or border security .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Jean Baptiste Vanise suffers the anguish no mother should have to bear. She received a text message from her 12-year-old son Tuesday afternoon asking, ""Where are you?"" Since then, nothing. Her only child, Marc Valends Louis Charles, played the violin at Holy Trinity School and Craft Center in Haiti. That's where she believes he was when Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened large parts of Port-au-Prince and turned this mother's life upside down. She returned to the school Thursday, just as she did Wednesday and Tuesday. A sign at the gate says ""Visitors Welcome."" The music classroom where she believes her son remains entombed sits in a corner of the teal building with its open courtyard. She has heard from someone at the school that Marc Valends was not there when the temblor hit; that he was with another child or that one of the teachers dropped him off somewhere. As much as she might want to, she does not believe that's the case. So she returns to the school. A Holy Trinity official will not let her near the classroom because an overhanging roof could fall. Aftershocks continue to be felt, with strong jolts waking people in the early morning hours Thursday. Still, several young men are digging through the rubble. Armand St. Louis, 30, says his 8-year-old cousin and a 19-year-old girl are still trapped. He has talked with them, St. Louis said. He is digging his way down from the computer room, which collapsed onto the music room. ""It's dark, and she's scared,"" St. Louis says. But he is determined to get to young Clautide Nelom. ""I'm about to go back in there,"" he said. ""I'm doing my best. There are other people in there. We're getting no help to get them out. ""Nobody's coming."" Vanise, the anguished mother, asks for quiet so she can call out to her son although she's a good 30 yards away. ""Louis Charles,"" she shouts a couple of times. ""Marc Valends,"" she then shouts a few times. Nothing. Silence. She breaks into sobs. The bereaved mother does not know what to do, where to go next. She has looked for him everywhere, she says.

"(CNN) -- Just within the past week, a disturbing video released by the hacktivist group Knight Sec exposed details surrounding the alleged sexual assault of a teenage girl in Steubenville, Ohio; more protests erupted over the horrific gang rape of a young woman in India; and the final sessions of the 112th Congress did not reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Whether it's here in the United States, or in other parts of the world, violence against women persists and justice often falls through the cracks. The Steubenville rape case has come back into the spotlight due in large part to online activists who felt that it wasn't being taken seriously. While the case against two teenage football players is being investigated, with a trial set for February, we as a society must do all we can to end sexual violence against women. The video footage and messages that surfaced on social media, which appear to depict the sexual abuse of a girl, highlight horrible attitudes and unacceptable behaviors toward women. One thing is clear: Those ""bystanders"" who were present on the night of the alleged rape bear a responsibility. Why didn't any one of them assist her or respond to what was happening? And while three members of the football team have come forward to testify in the case, more should have. The ""code of silence"" that is often found among athletes, fraternities and other similar groups must be addressed. We call upon our athletic teams and coaches to speak up because they can play an important role in prevention. Coaches can educate young men about the need to treat women with respect, encourage healthy relationships with the opposite sex, and promote non-misogynist behavior. We must ensure that young men see sexual violence against women as despicable and do all they can to stop it. According to a recent national survey, 1 in 5 women in the U.S. reported having been raped. Most rapes are perpetrated by someone the victim knows. Victimization can start early in life. We still live in a culture where young women are not given a voice and victims of sexual violence are sometimes not believed. Opinion: Why don't some boys see it as rape? The Ohio incident has sparked outrage since it first was reported. Advocates and community members were glad that the case was turned over to special prosecutors in the Office of Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine to avoid potential conflicts of interest. When Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter Rachel Dissell took up the story in September, it inspired people who had been sexually assaulted to come forward about their own experiences. These people know that they were no longer alone. Fewer than half of Ohio's 88 counties have rape crisis services available for individuals who have been sexually assaulted, and many existing programs lack the adequate resources to provide needed prevention and community outreach to address the myths about sexual violence and promote a culture that supports rape survivors. In Steubenville, there is no prevention funding to address sexual violence. As for survivors, how can they seek justice and healing if they have little support and resources available? We call upon House Speaker John Boehner -- who's from Ohio -- to help us end sexual violence. Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013 . The Violence Against Women Act includes provisions for engaging men and boys as allies to ending sexual violence, providing bystander intervention and prevention in high schools and on college campuses. Contact your Congress member and encourage him or her to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Survivors and communities across Ohio and the nation deserve your support.

"(CNN) -- A month after the deadly school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, the National Rifle Association is taking heat again -- this time for releasing a mobile video game that lets players learn how to shoot at targets. The game, ""NRA: Practice Range,"" puts the user in a gun range, where they fire a variety of handguns and rifles at stationary targets and earn points for accuracy. Critics are questioning the timing of the game's release Monday -- a month to the day after the December 14 shootings -- and accusing the NRA of hypocrisy because one of its leaders recently blamed video games for stoking gun violence. ""It's outrageous. The NRA never seems to be able to amaze me,"" said Joel Faxon, a member of Newtown's Police Commission, who described himself as a longtime gun owner. ""There's no reason that they can't espouse safe, effective, appropriate gun usage,"" he said. ""Why do they have to come out with something like this at a time when the nerves and emotions are so raw in Sandy Hook?"" See details of President Obama's actions on guns . ""It strikes me that this is totally inappropriate,"" George Ferguson, a member of the Newtown Legislative Council, said Tuesday. Ferguson said he had not seen the game, and added that he was speaking for himself, not the council. ""I think video games should be part of the dialogue"" about gun violence in the U.S., he added. Requests for comment from the NRA were not immediately returned Tuesday. The NRA's membership has spiked by 250,000 people since the Newtown shootings, the group said. That brings its membership to more than 4.2 million. Most criticism of the app, which is available for the iPhone and the iPad, focused not on the content of the game but on the timing of its release. In nationally televised comments a week after the slayings, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said, ""There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people, through vicious, violent video games."" Related: NRA video game smacks of hypocracy . Gene Grabowski, a longtime crisis-management expert who has advised gun manufacturers, called the timing of the app ""startling."" ""But the NRA has long ignored what anyone but its base cares about,"" he said. ""They are not worried in any way about what the general public or the chattering class thinks. That's why this looks cynical, because it is cynical. ""I'm not so sure it's a bad strategy from where the NRA sits,"" Grabowski added. ""If the goal is to firm up the base of the organization and to accelerate the influx of dues and support money, then the strategy is successful."" Victims of other mass shootings also were upset about the app. ""How two-faced of the NRA to introduce a violent video game on the heels of their blame game,"" said Lori Haas, whose daughter survived a mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007. ""NRA: Practice Range"" is listed on iTunes as an ""official NRA licensed product,"" created in conjunction with MEDL Mobile, a mobile-tech startup. The game is free, although for 99 cents, players can upgrade their firearms and ""unlock"" an MK11 sniper rifle. The game includes a handful of tips on gun safety. On iTunes, the only current marketplace for the game, the game was initially rated as appropriate for children 4 and up. On Tuesday afternoon, the rating was updated to age 12+. CNN didn't hear back from the developer when it inquired what led to the change. The game's release date may have been an unfortunate coincidence. Apps must be approved by Apple before they appear in its App Store, and the minimum time frame for Apple to review and approve an app is about 10 days, said videogame designer and theorist Ian Bogost, professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In some cases, Apple has taken three weeks to approve apps. ""We're both speculating if we try to guess whether NRA and the developer had this in their back pocket, waiting for the right time, or whether the release date is mere accident,"" Bogost said. ""It's also not clear exactly how involved the NRA was in its release. The game seems to have been an officially licensed NRA product, but that might just mean that the developer had the rights to use the NRA name."" At least one left-leaning group, the California-based Courage Campaign, launched an online petition Tuesday urging Apple to pull the NRA game from its App Store. Apple did not immediately respond Tuesday to requests for comment. Former House Speaker and Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich defended the app Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning."" ""My understanding is that it's a gun safety app, and it's for young hunters to learn gun safety,"" he said. ""But I would just recommend that people watch the entire app before they render judgment."" Bogost, the videogame theorist, believes the debate about the NRA's new game boils down to perspective. NRA opponents will reflexively see the game as inappropriate, but to gun-rights supporters, ""a firing-range game that embraces the NRA's overall position on safety and gun rights probably seems like a welcome alternative to public discourse about gun control,"" he said. ""In its post-Sandy Hook press conference, the NRA blamed violent media instead of gun ownership for the tragedy, singling out video games in particular. But from the NRA's perspective, the practice range game is not a violent game. The player only discharges firearms at paper and clay targets. For the NRA, it offers a model of responsible gun use,"" Bogost said in an e-mail. It's not the first time the NRA has been involved with a video game. In 2006, it endorsed a shooting game called ""NRA Gun Club"" for the PlayStation 2 console. And in 2008, the NRA lent its name to three shooting games: ""NRA Varmit Hunter, "" ""NRA High Power Competition"" and ""NRA Xtreme Accuracy Shooting."" Politicians and conservative groups have long condemned video games that challenge players to gun down enemies, saying that the games glorify and instigate real life violence. But scientific research on the topic has been inconclusive. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that video games deserve the same First Amendment protections as books, comics, plays and other entertainment. Most such games, called ""first-person shooters,"" are rated M for Mature by the rating board indicating content is generally suitable for ages 17 and older. Though, of course, many younger teens play them. CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this story.","NRA target shooting app comes after the group blamed games for stoking gun violence .

"(CNN) -- Economists might not like how quickly the economy has or has not rebounded from the recession, but if the country is still struggling financially, someone forgot to tell the Tooth Fairy. American children are receiving an average of $3.70 per lost tooth this year -- up 23% from last year's $3, an annual survey said. Visa Inc.'s annual survey, based on 3,000 telephone interviews, reported that 90% of U.S. households will be receiving a visit from the Tooth Fairy this year. The fairy was most generous to children in the Northeast, who earned an average of $4.10 per tooth. In the Midwest, children received $3.30 per tooth; and the South and West fell in the middle, at $3.60 and $3.70, respectively. Male tooth fairies leave more than female, and in 36% of households, tooth fairies left less than a dollar. Families with a household income of $40,000 to $45,000 gave more than any other income group. Jason Alderman, senior director of global financial education for Visa Inc., said the reason for that might be that it's an ""area where parents can feel like they can be generous."" While the study isn't necessarily proof of out-of-control inflation, Alderman said the study, inspired by his daughter, will hopefully inspire other parents to give their children a financial education. ""My daughter had zero interest in money,"" he said. ""Money management wasn't interesting to her."" But, he said, she was transfixed by the idea of the Tooth Fairy leaving something behind when she finally lost a tooth. Alderman saw this as an opportunity for a ""teachable moment."" ""Parents can then talk to their kids about how they plan to spend their money. They can use real money to talk about saving and giving,"" he said. That's a great idea, unless, of course, you give your child an antique typewriter. That's exactly what Alderman said one of his son's classmates received for a lost tooth. ""I'm still not sure how you fit a typewriter under a pillow,"" he said. While elaborate gifts are the exception, 6% in the survey said the Tooth Fairy left $20 or more; 2% said she left $50. With such a wide spectrum, parents of children losing their first teeth might find it hard deciding what the Tooth Fairy should give. ""Nobody wants to be the cheapskate; no one wants to give too much,"" Alderman said. For those parents, he said, Visa created an app that allows people to enter demographics information -- like household income and age -- to give a better idea of what tooth fairies who live like them are giving. Alderman said he's always given his kids a dollar for their lost teeth, which seemed to be the standard in the neighborhood (minus the typewriter, of course). ""No one wants to be the parent their kid is talking about on the playground,"" he said.","Among its annual surveys, Visa Inc. looks at how much children get from the Tooth Fairy .

"(CNN) -- The years preceding World War I in Europe are generally referred to as the ""Belle Epoque"" -- a cultural and economic golden age. The period was hardly one of utter utopia for all citizens. But in the wake of the conflagration that would shake the globe beginning in August 1914, it came later to be seen as a period of calm before the storm. Its cultural practices, too, seem tinged with an almost naive optimism. Modernism in art and literature had gathered momentum well before the First World War, which began in earnest 100 years ago this fall. But with its eruption, those earlier Victorian forms no longer seemed adequate in the face of the period's upheavals, the destruction to bodies, to landscape, to culture itself. New experiments took up the task. Opinion: The promise World War I couldn't keep . The violent disjunctures of Cubist collage, for example, were a fitting way to of express the political and geographic revolution. Picasso already practiced the form during the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, often using the very newsprint that announced the latest battles. On the Great War itself, the pacifist Picasso remained silent. His innovations with different media and materials, however, influenced movements -- from war-mongering Futurism in Italy to pacifist Dada in neutral Switzerland. While many artists claimed Cubism itself as a renewed form of classicism, French nationalists derided it as a decadent German import (and spelled it ""Kubism"" accordingly). In France as elsewhere, then, culture formed a parallel theater of war. As many artists became enemy combatants with the stroke of a pen, the cosmopolitan idyll of prewar Paris gave way to an increasing xenophobia. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . The war and its representations indeed seemed bound up with one another at every turn. ""I very well remember,"" wrote Gertrude Stein, ""at the beginning of the war, being with Picasso on the Boulevard Raspail when the first camouflaged truck passed. ... Picasso, amazed, looked at it, and then cried out, yes, it is we who made it, that is Cubism."" The British Vorticist artist Edward Wadsworth not only painted canvases in the sharp lines characteristic of his circle's aggressive imagery, but also supervised the ""dazzle"" camouflage (an angular patterning of black and white paint) of over 2,000 ships for the British Admiralty. The seemingly gratuitous bewilderment of modernist abstraction was thus put in the more practical service of confusing rangefinders and eluding enemy fire. Opinion: Should nations pay the price for their leaders' misdeeds? But it was the Italian Futurists who most enthusiastically embraced the war, using their works to agitate for intervention against Italy's traditional ally, Austria. The Futurist ringleader, F.T. Marinetti, declared that only a giant international conflict could shock Italy out of its cultural slumber.  Marinetti's hymns to danger, speed and mechanized violence found their consummate realization in the Great War -- an event he deemed ""the world's greatest poem."" As volunteers along Italy's northern front, the Futurists served as avant-gardists in the literal, military sense. Along with their rhetoric of jingoistic virility, Futurist painting and poetry nurtured a playful and subversive ""anti-aesthetic"" that would inspire artists for the rest of the 20th century. Ironically enough, it was the anti-war stirrings of Dada that bore out its most immediate influence, first in Switzerland and then post-war Berlin. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . From Futurism, Dada borrowed strategies of shock and illogic, assaulting received truths and bourgeois morality alike. To these, however, the Dadaists married a resolute anti-nationalism, rejecting both the war and its institutional origins. Yet even politically progressive artists turned to the war's new spectacles as sources of stimulation and dynamism. Painted while he convalesced from a mustard gas attack, Fernand LÃ©ger's ""The Card Party"" (1917) depicts the artist and his fellow French soldiers as virtual extensions of military machinery, their jointed arms mobile like metallic prostheses. Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' Many drew their inspiration from a newly transformed theater of hostilities, whether the shock of trench warfare, mobile X-ray machines or the terror and poetics of flight (the first pilotless drones were notably developed by the U.S. Navy from 1916-17). The British sculptor Jacob Epstein's notorious ""Rock Drill"" (1913-15) features an armored, machine-like body mounted atop an actual rock drill, glorifying an inhuman mechanization and anticipating even the battle droids from the Star Wars franchise's prequel, ""The Phantom Menace,"" at the century's end . Not all European artists figured the period's anxieties -- or witnessed its havoc -- in the same manner. Following in the tradition of Goya and the Dutch Renaissance alike, Otto Dix would later complete grotesque renderings of soldiers wearing gas masks and battlefields strewn with trenches and corpses. In works made just after the war, he (like his German compatriot George Grosz and other Dadaist artists) incorporated collage into his canvases, evoking the scores of amputated veterans visible in Germany's city streets, themselves virtual assemblages of prostheses. Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . These artists drew not only upon Futurist experiments with newsprint, but also the Metaphysical cityscapes of the Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico, which conjure up a sense of both post-apocalyptic stillness and disquieting anticipation. A girl rolls her hoop across a sundrenched square in de Chirico's ""Melancholy and Mystery of a Street"" (1914), unaware of the hearse that looms in the arcade's shadow -- the metaphor, perhaps, of a continent hurtling toward the void. The war's traumas also spurred utopian cultural projects after the guns fell silent. During the war, AndrÃ© Breton worked in a neurological ward in Nantes. His contact with the stream-of-consciousness ramblings of soldiers suffering from head wounds sparked his interest in the unconscious as a source of radical social and political transformation. Opinion: How WWI gave us drones . Breton's Surrealist movement transformed Dadaist despair -- at both the war and the technologies that had led to it -- into a constructive assault on social and sexual norms. Holding seminars and publishing questionnaires, the Surrealists campaigned in the 1920s and 1930s against the nationalist enmity that had caused the last war and that was leading inexorably toward another. At war's end, modernist tendencies such as Cubism, Futurism and Expressionism came -- rightly or not -- to be associated with its violence. Opinion: When chemical weapons killed 90,000 . But artists generally abandoned the depiction of armored trains and disintegrating forms after the guns fell silent, rendering less threatening subjects in more soothing styles. Dubbed the ""Return to Order"" by Jean Cocteau-- the Surrealist painter, poet, playwright, novelist and filmmaker -- this period following the Great War witnessed a reprisal of neoclassical motifs, suckling mothers and other emblems of reassuring stability. With the gradual rise of fascism, such stability proved itself increasingly illusory, as even the most decorous of aesthetic traditions were put in the service of an aggressive, murderous ideology, and another war -- even more terrible than the first -- tore open the century.

"(CNN) -- Even during the harshest periods of the communist era, being Shanghainese had a special cachet in China. The city and its residents were a synonym for Western fashion and open-minded attitudes, as different as could be from their Mao-pin wearing comrades. Its personality remains just as strong today. Shanghai is an unusual place. It's Chinese, but not entirely; its hybrid of Eastern and Western business and social traditions is found nowhere else in mainland China. Here are the things that make China's booming commercial hub a unique place in the world's most populous country. The Bund . A number of pockets in China have impressive Western buildings -- the German Quarter in Qingdao, Russian buildings in Harbin -- but none provide the surreal feeling of ""elsewhereness"" like the Bund. The Bund refers to Shanghai's waterfront on the west bank of Huangpu River. Two dozen colossal Western structures, ranging in style from art deco to Victorian Gothic, stand side by side, forming a massive marble curtain. View it from afar and you'd think you were sailing into Liverpool. The 1,500-meter-long strip is a legacy passed down by one of the city's former rulers, Great Britain. It was largely built in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to establish Shanghai as the British Empire's trading hub of the Far East. The most magnificent building is today's number 10-12, the former HSBC building. When completed in 1923, the seven-story neoclassical landmark was dubbed ""the most luxurious building from the Suez Canal to the Bering Strait."" The building's original ceiling mural managed to survive the Cultural Revolution; the octagonal mosaic painting is one of the best-kept secrets in Shanghai. It's now in the lobby of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, the building's current occupier. With the financial center's move to the east bank of Huangpu River, the old Bund has become a new home for world-class hotels, restaurants and retailers. Skyscrapers . According to Emporis, a global real estate data provider based in Germany, Shanghai ranks sixth among world cities with the most skyscrapers. There are 241 skyscrapers in Shanghai, eight fewer than Dubai, 14 more than in Seoul and 103 more than the second mainland city on the list, Guangzhou. Although towering blocks mushroom throughout the metropolis, the skyscraper center point is the Lujiazui Financial District. On the opposite side of the traditional Bund, Lujiazui appears so futuristic that it's become a Hollywood favorite as a setting for films, most recently featured in ""Her"" with Joaquin Phoenix. Lujiazui is home to the most recognized high-rises in China, including the 468-meter Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the 421-meter Jinmao Tower and the 492-meter Shanghai World Financial Center. Since 1994, each of them has had a turn as the tallest structure in China. Next in line is the 632-meter Shanghai Tower. Scheduled to open in 2015, the 121-story building is set to host what it claims will be world's tallest luxury hotel, J hotel. The 258-room hotel -- a joint venture between Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel Group and Interstate Hotels and Resorts -- will occupy the 84th through 110th floors of the Shanghai Tower. International events and entertainment . When international events set up in China, Shanghai is as often as not the default host city. Large-scale events in Beijing tend to carry political messages, while those in Shanghai focus more on fun and glamor. The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix is one of the biggest annual events in Shanghai. It's the only Formula One stop in mainland China. The Shanghai Masters (October 4-12) tennis championship is attended by the highest-ranking players of the year. The week-long event is part of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000. Shanghai is also building a Disneyland. Set to open toward the end of 2015, Shanghai Disneyland will be the first Disney theme park in mainland China (Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005) and the sixth in the world. The $5.5-billion investment will further promote Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in the realm of the Monkey King. International food . High-quality international restaurants are springing up in Shanghai so quickly that it's hard to keep track of them all. New kitchens often set up on the Bund, around Xintiandi and in the former French Concession, as rivals to the established fine-dining scene in Beijing. But look beyond the glitzy restaurant menus and into the homes of private residents, and you'll see a tradition of international cuisine found nowhere else in China. The city's British rulers and Russian refugees may be long gone, but their food has remained. Worcestershire sauce, that classic condiment from the United Kingdom, has a brother some 9,000 kilometers from home. Known locally as ""spicy soy sauce,"" Shanghainese Worcestershire sauce was first produced in 1930 to cater to the large expat market. Nowadays, the yellow-labeled bottle is ubiquitous in supermarkets. Shanghainese usually use it to accompany deep-fried pork chops. When Russians fleeing the October Revolution of 1917 came to Shanghai, they brought their borscht. The hearty beef and vegetable soup has evolved into Shanghai's favorite comfort food. Local mothers usually cook it to treat friends and families. Pidgin English . Colonial history has trickled down to Shanghai's local lingo. Shanghai dialect is filed with localized English words and pidgin English cultural identifiers unique to Shanghainese. A spring lock is called ""si ba lin."" Cement is ""si men ting."" In Shanghainese, ""on sale"" can refer to a ""cheap"" person. Shanghai dialect is incomprehensible to a typical Mandarin speaker, whose language is largely based on pronunciation and vocabulary from northern China. Shikumen . Shikumen is Shanghai's indigenous alleyway housing. Series of stone buildings were built in the 1870s as a way to accommodate the city's rapidly growing immigrant families. When the Communist Party took over in 1949, shikumen architecture was at its height -- there were around 200,000 shikumen buildings throughout central Shanghai, each divided into tenements to house five or even ten families. As modern high-rises in Shanghai have grabbed international attention, however, these local architectural treasures have been ignored or even shoved aside. Since the 1990s, shikumen buildings have been getting pulled down more quickly than the skyscrapers rise. But you can still find them in a few corners. In Xintiandi, high-end restaurants, pubs and clubs have taken over the revamped old buildings. Tianzifang is a more Bohemian area. In its labyrinth of alleyways, indie designers hang up cocktail dresses next to self-employed vendors selling replica communist souvenirs in the courtyard. For more authentic shikumen neighborhoods, CitÃ© Bourgogne on Shaanxi Nan Lu, and Jing'an Villa on Nanjing Xi Lu, are throwbacks to a uniquely Shanghai experience that's rapidly disappearing. Now based in London, Tracy You is a native and longtime resident of Shanghai and a former CNN travel producer.","Shanghai has long been a unique city in China .

"(CNN) -- A newly discovered asteroid will pass ""very close"" to Earth on Sunday, NASA says. The space rock is estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long. It's expected to fly over New Zealand about 2:18 p.m. EDT (11:18 a.m. PDT / 18:18 UTC.) It won't hit Earth or any of the thousands of satellites orbiting the planet, NASA says. It will give astronomers and scientists a chance to study it. The asteroid won't be visible the naked eye, but amateur astronomers should be able to see it with telescopes. Called 2014 RC, the asteroid was discovered on August 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Arizona. NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked are expected to hit the planet anytime soon. Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people. The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth. NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.","Asteroid 2014 RC will fly ""very close"" to Earth on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- For five years, they pursued her, always one step behind as she used aliases and altered her appearance to elude them. But Janet Killough Barreto's luck ran out at a shopping mall in Portland, Oregon, where the U.S. Marshals Service caught up with her -- the lone female fugitive in their 15 Most Wanted list. ""The crimes they are alleged to have committed are nothing short of horrendous and despicable,"" Union County, Mississippi, Sheriff Jimmy Edwards said, about Barreto and her husband. His department aided in the search because her alleged crimes took place in his jurisdiction. ""Now it is time to let justice be served."" Abuse leads to death . Barreto, 43, and her husband, Ramon, allegedly traveled to Guatemala on multiple occasions in 2005 and 2006 to purchase children from a local adoption agency. Authorities say the children were brought back to the United States and were malnourished, physically abused, and forced to sleep on beds with plywood bottoms. ""The children were purportedly often punished with beatings and on various occasions duct-taped to their beds, punched in the stomach, and forced to endure having their heads submerged under water,"" the Marshals Service said. In 2008, the abuse allegedly led to the death one of their adopted children, a 2-year-old girl. Barreto was arrested in May of that year for child abuse, neglect, and manslaughter. She was released six months later on bond. On the run . In March 2009, Barreto was arrested again for tampering with a witness and later released on bond. Two months later, she never appeared in court to face the charges against her, authorities said. The Union County Sheriff's Office began searching, aided by the U.S. Marshals when Barreto was added to their ""15 Most Wanted"" list in June 2013. Authorities asked the public for any information leading to Barreto, offering a $25,000 reward. A ""Wanted"" poster distributed by the Marshals Service said Barreto was known to change her appearance using wigs. It also said Barreto would evade law enforcement through the use of several aliases, fleeing before her true identity was discovered. Cornered . The call came in on Monday. According to authorities, the five-year investigation gained considerable momentum when a ""concerned citizen"" called the U.S. Marshals task force in Oxford, Mississippi, with information that placed Barreto in either Oregon or Washington. The caller also told authorities that the Barretos might have a small child with them. The investigation moved swiftly. Less than 24 hours after that initial tip, a lead about a possible location sent agents to Oregon. They cornered Barreto and her husband late Tuesday afternoon at the Jantzen Beach Center, a shopping mall in Portland. At first, the Barretos refused to identify themselves, but the husband was identified on the spot when his fingerprints were verified digitally. Though Barreto continued to be uncooperative, her identity was revealed once she was fingerprinted at a local jail. ""Janet Barreto is a malicious individual. Through her alleged crimes, Barreto demonstrated a blatant disregard and lack of respect for life other than her own,"" said U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia Hylton. The infant found with the Barretos during their arrest was placed with child protective services, authorities said. Six years after the death of their daughter, it's uncertain what the Barretos will face upon their return. Both are currently being held at the Multnomah County Detention Center in Portland, awaiting extradition to Mississippi, authorities said. It is unknown whether either has retained an attorney.

"(CNN) -- Linda Bazzi awoke in the middle of the night and found her two-story home unusually warm. Her husband investigated and found no ordinary fire downstairs. Their suburban Detroit house was firebombed about 1 a.m. Wednesday. Their outdoor surveillance camera captured an individual running up the front yard and throwing a Molotov cocktail through the front window, suggesting the family with four children was targeted. ""I woke up my husband, and I screamed, and I said something smells funny and the house is warm. Instantly he ran,"" Bazzi told CNN affiliate WDIV. He descended three steps and saw flames. ""He screamed at the top of the lungs: 'Get the kids! The house is on fire!'"" Bazzi told the station. The fire left the Dearborn Heights home uninhabitable. ""I lost everything. Everything, everything, everything. Everything can be replaced, but I'm so happy, I'm so blessed that they didn't win: I have my children and I have my husband next to me,"" Bazzi said, according to the news outlet. The house's front facade is charred, and yellow tape cordons off its front door. ""I don't know who did it. The way it seems to me (from) that video is that it is intentional. It was targeted to my house, directly,"" Bazzi told the affiliate. ""I'm scared. I'm really scared for my life right now."" The family is hoping someone will recognize the individual in the grainy video and call police. In the tape, the firebomber throws the fiery device with his left hand. ""This, to me was, a nice community, nice area, and there have been a lot of thefts in the neighborhood and there have been a lot of break-ins. This is where I draw the line,"" Bazzi said. Dearborn Heights police didn't immediately respond Thursday for a comment.","Linda Bazzi's husband discovers a fire in their home in the middle of the night .

"(CNN) -- A strong odor from an unidentified gas led firefighters to evacuate 151 homes in a Philadelphia-area community, a fire department said. Firefighters began evacuating homes from part of Skippack Township after a resident complained of an odor early Sunday evening, the township's fire department said. With the help of meters, firefighters learned a gaseous volatile organic compound was coming from the basement sump pumps in several homes, the department said. They didn't immediately know what the gas was. Samples were taken to two labs for tests, and results are expected Monday afternoon, Skippack Township Fire Chief Haydn Marriott said. Volatile organic compounds cover a wide range of gases that can come from thousands of products, such as paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides and permanent markers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Red Cross opened a shelter at an elementary school for evacuated residents who needed a place to stay, the fire department said. Firefighters were testing homes' gas levels again Monday, and evacuated residents were being allowed to return to homes where levels were low, Marriott said. Skippack Township is about 25 miles northwest of Philadelphia. United flight diverted due to odor .

"(CNN) -- It rarely makes sense to draw big conclusions or make public policy on the basis of anecdotes. But the plural of ""anecdote"" is data, and sometimes one-off events are useful in crystallizing lessons to guide policymakers and inform the public. So it was with the Pittsburgh-area rampage this week in which a teenager bearing two kitchen knives is accused of injuring 21 high school classmates and a security guard -- but none of them were killed. It's hard to imagine an anecdote that better illustrates what decades of data show: that for purposes of life and death, the weapon matters. It's called ""the instrumentality effect,"" and we owe the original scholarly findings (more than four decades old at this point) to the eminent University of California criminologist Franklin Zimring. Others, including one of us (Cook), have validated and built upon his insights. The idea that the weapon matters emerges in studies of robberies and assaults. When committed with a gun, these crimes are far more likely to result in the victim's death than are similar violent crimes committed without a gun. For example, the likelihood that a victim will die when robbed by a firearm-wielding attacker is three times as high as when the victim faces an attacker bearing a knife and 10 times as high as when the attacker has another type of weapon. For victims injured in an assault, the likelihood of death is also greater when a gun is involved, especially in cases of domestic violence. Of course, the choice of weapon could be simply a product of the perpetrator's focus on killing; perhaps it's this intensity, not the choice of weapon, that is really to blame. In light of Wednesday's knife attacks in Pennsylvania, Zimring's findings are particularly telling. To separate the effects of the weapon vs. the intent of the perpetrator, he looked at fatality rates for different calibers of guns. If perpetrator intent were really to blame, zeroing in on attacks with guns would ""control"" for that effect. Zimring found, as the instrumentality perspective would predict, that people shot by larger caliber guns -- which carry bigger and more destructive bullets -- were more likely to die than those shot by smaller caliber guns. Adding more evidence to the case that the weapon matters, Zimring and Gordon Hawkins later demonstrated that overall crime rates aren't that much higher in American cities than in comparable cities in other developed countries. We just have higher rates of homicide, and that is because our criminals are more likely to be armed with guns and thus their attacks are more likely to end in the victim's death. The most important and interesting implication of the instrumentality effect is that if public policy could reduce gun use in crime, the murder rate would go down -- even if the overall crime rate did not. As it turns out, about half of American states have enacted policies that add prison time to felons who use a gun when committing their crimes. These so-called sentencing enhancements, most of which were adopted in the 1970s and 1980s, were intended to reduce the use of guns in violent acts. Scholarly evaluations based on data, not anecdotes, offer some evidence that these policy innovations have been effective. This week's tragedy can't help but invoke memories of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School some 16 months ago. The difference today is that, because the Murrysville, Pennsylvania, perpetrator chose to use knives, victims' families can look forward to a future with their loved ones -- instead of planning their funerals.","Authors: Injury, not death, came from school stabbings in Pennsylvania .

"(CNN) -- Marikana lies on South Africa's platinum belt, where the world's richest deposits of the metal are located. Together with Russia, South Africa produces 90% of the world's platinum demand. The people of Marikana know the land is mineral rich, and last year they demanded a taste of that wealth. In August 2012 thousands of workers at a Marikana mine owned by Lonmin, a London-based firm, went on a wildcat strike, demanding better wages and improved living conditions. 34-year-old Mgcineni Noki was among them. ""All we want is more money,"" he told CNN at the time. ""As you can see, we are not fighting, we are just sitting here, waiting for the employer to address our demands so we can go back to work."" But Noki never made it back to work. He and 33 others were gunned down by police in the bloodiest labor dispute in South Africa since the end of apartheid. Police say they acted in self-defense against a mob of protesting miners armed with clubs and machetes. A commission of inquiry was set up to probe the incident, but a year later the inquiry is incomplete and marred by delays. Amnesty International has criticized the South African government for failing to hold those responsible for the massacre responsible. Noel Kututwa, the group's deputy program director for Africa, said: ""The long-term consequences for the respect and protection of human rights in South Africa will be severe should the South African authorities fail in taking all necessary steps to achieve accountability"". CNN tracked down Noki's family on South Africa's Eastern Cape, where most of the dead miners hailed from. The family says they have no choice but to wait and hope that justice will be served -- but in the meantime, they're preoccupied just trying to survive. Noki's sister, Nolufefe, said Noki's five children, wife, siblings, nephew and niece all depended on his pay. He sent $200 home every month to ensure they didn't go to bed hungry. ""He was responsible for everything in this household. First our parents died, then our eldest brother,"" Nolufefe said. ""He was our last hope"". Now they survive on an $80 grant she gets from the government for taking care of her deceased brother's daughter. Labor unions say the average South African mine worker supports at least eight dependents. Last year many were given hefty pay hikes after the series of strikes in the platinum belt, but as production costs rose, mass retrenchments have followed and poverty is on the rise. Back in Marikana the community is finding it hard to cope with the loss of jobs and loss of life. ""We have seen a series of suicides,"" said Chris Molebatsi, a field researcher with the Bench Marks Foundation, a non-profit group that monitors corporate social responsibility in South Africa's mining sector. At least 10 people who witnessed last year's massacre have taken their own lives since then, according to the group. Two of them were policemen who were on duty that day. Molebatsi said the appalling living conditions of mining communities in South Africa have been a source of despair for years -- and he believes nothing has changed as a result of the tragedy in Marikana. Lonmin has announced several initiatives aimed at improving its relationship not only with workers but with the communities where they mine. New CEO Ben Magara said the firm has made land available for housing and will build infrastructure and a recreation center with a library. The people of Marikana say they have heard promises like these before. But their anger is not just aimed at the mining company; the resentment of the government is palpable here. Million of dollars in royalty fees paid by the industry into a government administered banking account have allegedly vanished, and three independent probes have been launched to trace the cash that was meant to improve the lives of mining communities. Meanwhile, violence continues to plague South Africa's platinum belt. Another 20 people were killed following last year's massacre, according to labor unions, and experts say the conditions that led to the tragedy still haven't been addressed. ""South Africa changed politically in 1994, but not economically,"" Moeletsi Mbeki, an economic analyst, told CNN. ""The relationships of exploitation that are 350 years old have not changed."" ""We are more likely to have Marikana's more often,"" he continued. ""If you look at the negotiations in the gold mining sector now, they're demanding 100% (pay rises) and so on. If they don't get what they want they will go on strike. The state depends on mining revenue, so it will try to force them back to work, and that is where you will see more violence."" This is a sad and disturbing scenario for a country whose economy was built on and still revolves around the mining sector.","In August 2012, workers at a Marikana mine demanded better wages and living conditions .

"(CNN) -- It was described as a ""dramatic shift"" and a ""bombshell."" One writer dubbed it a ""stunning change."" Even the Human Rights Campaign, the LGBT advocacy organization, announced a ""seismic shift in Rome."" So it was all the more disheartening that the Catholic Church's Synod of Bishops decided to backpedal on its surprisingly welcoming language for LGBT people and their families from earlier in the week with the release on Saturday of the final document from its meeting. Or it would have been disheartening if the interim report hadn't used theological arguments that would virtually have guaranteed that same-sex couples and their families would remain second-class citizens in the church. True, the synod's initial report employed a language of welcome that few LGBT Catholics and their friends and allies have ever heard from the Vatican. And many participants in the synod did indeed embrace the orientation toward the marginalized that has been a hallmark of Pope Francis' papacy. Both the synod's initial draft and final document acknowledged the blessings that can be found in different forms of family life (although the final draft explicitly limited itself to talking about ""a stable and true relationship between a man and a woman""). Yet even if the more welcoming language of the synod's first document had survived subsequent editing, a closer reading reveals that the theological framework it used to articulate its views had its limitations. In thinking about families whose lives fall outside the church's norms, the synod's initial document took its cues from a theological model first developed at Vatican II, a model that at first had to do with interreligious dialogue. But here, instead of teaching that other religious communities have only partial access to the truth about God, the synod claimed that nontraditional families only partially reflect God's intentions for human relationships. These families have ""seeds of the Word [of God] that have spread beyond [the church's] visible and sacramental boundaries,"" the document stated. In thinking about them, the synod said it turned ""respectfully to those who participate in her life in an incomplete and imperfect way."" So, although the language of intrinsic disorder and grave sin -- the vocabulary that Catholic leaders have so often used to talk about same-sex relationships -- was laudably absent from both the initial draft and the final document, the language that the synod initially proposed still relegated LGBT persons and others to second-class status. If the synod were to have taught that same-sex couples, like those who live in other nontraditional family arrangements, are theologically akin to members of other religions, then implicitly it also would have taught that the only way that they can be fully recognized or received by the church is if they undergo conversion. After Vatican II, the council's theological framework was perceived in some quarters as patronizing and paternalistic. The synod's newer framework might not have fared much better. The theological tensions that swirled just underneath the surface of the synod's original draft may explain much about the seeming backpedaling we have seen. That original draft surrounded its positive statements about LGBT people and same-sex couples with qualifiers -- qualifiers that some commentators missed or downplayed. For instance, the draft stated unequivocally that same-sex relationships ""cannot be considered on the same footing"" as opposite-sex marriage, and it prefaced its praise for the sacrificial love of same-sex couples with the caveat that it was not ""denying the moral problems connected to homosexual unions."" The final version, which received mixed support from synod participants, was less welcoming still: ""There does not exist any basis to establish even remote analogies between homosexual unions and the plan of God for marriage and the family."" Many believe that the synod reversed course with regard to LGBT people and same-sex unions. But that reversal seems much less dramatic when one considers the full implications of the synod's much-celebrated initial document. Far from accepting and celebrating same-sex relationships as the signs of divine and human love that so many people -- gay, straight, Catholic, non-Catholic -- are finding in them, that document actually charted a path where those relationships could at best have only been tolerated in the church. It is clear that by avoiding a more searching examination of the presumptions about gender and sexuality that Catholic theology has inherited, the synod members did not fully confront the truly seismic anthropological, cultural and theological shifts that have occurred in the past few decades. For many of the rest of us, it is unfortunate that in rushing to celebrate the steps that the synod took last week toward a more inclusive church, we may have turned a blind eye to theological assumptions that might have given us much pause.","Vatican's interim report discussing same-sex couples was widely seen as major shift .
But theological arguments used suggest it wasn't revolutionary, says Patrick Hornbeck .

"(CNN) -- This isn't a real-life recreation of ""Armageddon."" There's no clear and present threat to Earth. But NASA says it's working on plans to send astronauts into space to land on an asteroid. The NASA mission isn't planned to take place until the 2020s. That isn't stopping astronauts from simulating an asteroid landing in a 40-foot-deep swimming pool at a Space Center in Houston. ""We're working on the techniques and tools we might use someday to explore a small asteroid that was captured from an orbit around the sun and brought back by a robotic spacecraft to orbit around the moon,"" said Stan Love, one of the astronauts participating in the tests. Testing tools . ""When it's there, we can send people there to take samples and take a look at it up close,"" he said. ""That's our main task; we're looking at tools we'd use for that, how we'd take those samples."" Love and his colleague Steve Bowen, who between them have clocked up more than 62 hours on real spacewalks, took a dip in the swimming pool at NASA's Johnson Space Center last week to practice climbing out of a mockup of the Orion spacecraft onto a fake asteroid. Being underwater creates the lack of gravity that allows astronauts to practice walking in space. The two men were working with engineers to try out tools that might be used, like a pneumatic hammer, as well as the type of spacesuit that might be worn on the asteroid. Searching for targets . NASA says it's already trying to pick out an asteroid that a robotic mission could reach, capture and bring into an orbit around the moon. Astronauts would then travel on the Orion spacecraft to explore the asteroid and collect samples. Material from the asteroid's core could contain information about the age and formation of the solar system. The agency says the approach ""makes good use of capabilities NASA already has, while also advancing a number of technologies needed for longer-term plans: sending humans to Mars in the 2030s.""

"Nihiwatu, Sumba, Indonesia (CNN) -- ""This has been voted one of the best left-hand breaks on the planet. But watch out for the reef if you get dumped -- try and shallow fall."" The surfing instructor knows who he's dealing with -- an uncoordinated, naturally ungifted sportsman on the wrong side of fit and very embarrassed at being Australian yet unable to surf. And totally in awe of the view back to the beach and surrounding coastline while floating impressively ungainly between wave sets. A scene like this, of the beach, gardens and hillside of the unassuming Nihiwatu resort on Indonesia's eastern island of Sumba island, makes a morning of shallow falling (read: tumbling like a drunken cat in a washing machine) totally palatable. The beauty is immense and the urge to dole out ""paradise""-riddled cliches is equally immense. Yet, there's something more tranquil about this setting, a sense of harmony in the way the resort blends in effortlessly with its surroundings -- even with this surfer wannabe in the frame. Finding the 'perfect place' The hotel is the remarkable result of a vision of colorful resort founder Claude Graves, who in 1984 with his wife, Petra, packed up their life in Africa to go in search of the perfect wave. The ambition, he says, was to create a ""perfect place"" around that perfect experience. It has so far proven a story well worth retelling. ""I wanted to create something totally experiential that didn't detract from the area,"" says Grave. ""The best travel is around the best experiences."" After four years, and finding what has become known locally as The Wave, he and Petra ended up here in Nihiwatu on the southern coast of the relatively unknown Sumba, an island about an hour's flight east of Bali. Land time almost forgot . The couple camped on the beach, an idyllic 2.5-kilometer-long stretch of sand. The beach is still difficult to access for anyone other than local villagers, and thus serves as something of a private beach for guests. It's hard to imagine this same sand was the scene, barely six months before the Graves' arrival, of a massive battle between 2,000 local tribesmen. Indeed, Sumba could be easily labeled an island that time almost forgot. That clash was an illustration of the fiercely traditional, territorial and tribal nature of Sumbanese culture -- reinforced by the swords the village men strap to their sides to this day. It's also, by Western standards, incredibly poor with little to no utilities access and infrastructure for many, if not most, villages. This lack of standard resources posed a challenge for Graves and his plans. Becoming Sumbanese . Through years of assimilation, negotiation, trust and countless pig sacrifices, Graves ingrained himself with the local community. ""We always said that if we found and developed a place, it had to be inclusive,"" says Graves, who confesses to not being a ""hotel man."" ""Tourism has the best potential economically in Sumba but if locals are not connected to it, it will be a big disaster. ""We couldn't imagine building a hotel here without including the locals so that all would benefit."" Claude began building what became the only resort on the island -- training and employing locals from various tribes and encouraging inter-tribal marriages, to assist in easing tensions. The hotel soft opened in 2001 and had its first full year in 2005. Keen to protect the highly regarded surf spot from the overuse and abuse displayed in places like Bali, Graves restricted the number of surfers allowed at the hotel at any one time. He eventually acquired around 600 acres but developed only a small portion of that, impacting as little of the environment as he could. The Sumba Foundation . Quickly, the location became something of a surf icon, attracting to this day those chasing that perfect wave. A natural reef provides a clean, rolling break. It also drew Sean Downs, a U.S. businessman who was so taken by the location, the people of Sumba and their needs, that he established the Sumba Foundation with Graves in 2001. The foundation now impacts and supports around 120 square miles around the hotel and has directly reduced malaria infection rates by 85% in the 400-plus villages in that area. There are now five health clinics as well as malnutrition programs in the area, created from some of the approximate $5 million donated to the foundation so far. The foundation supports several schools and has built more than 60 water wells and around 250 water stations. The latter has been key in helping to empower communities, says Rudi Weru, the on-the-ground manager and part of a team of around three dozen full-time Sumba Foundation staff. ""Now people don't have to spend their whole day traveling to fetch water. Instead, children for instance can go to school and learn,"" Weru says. The Sumba Foundation is independent financially from the hotel, but draws on donations from Nihiwatu guests, the wealthier of which account for a high percentage of donations and thus impact directly the tens of thousands of locals the foundation supports. ""More and more these days people want to have a purpose with traveling. It's not enough where people go and lie down on the beach and have a drink,"" says Dr Claus Boch, the foundation's health program director. ""You can't just come and enjoy the beauty of the place without giving back. So I think it really works extremely well between the hotel, the foundation and what we do."" Due to its association with the foundation and integration with the environment and local communities and customs, the hotel has won a raft of responsible and sustainable tourism awards. Graves hopes his model is transferable elsewhere. ""Places like this that are leading the way will influence older hotels and sections of the industry. Clients will demand it. People will say I am not going to that hotel and instead go to where they feel their money is being well spent,"" Graves says. The hotel is the largest employer on the island with around 300 full-time Subanese staff plus 150 daily workers -- making up more than 90% of its total workforce. Dato Daku is among the original employees. For him the experience at Nihiwatu -- from a daily worker to gardener to restaurant waiter -- is easily summed up. ""I want to die here,"" the father of three boys and three girls told CNN during a visit to Sumba last year. ""In Sumba it is difficult to find a job. It has helped a lot of local people find work. ""I can send my brothers and sisters and children to university or other parts of Indonesia now."" More than surfing . The hotel has 22 exceptional open-plan villas, designed to be low impact, drawing on Graves' philosophy and vision of integration by utilizing local designs, materials and construction techniques. Experiences for Nihiwatu guests can include trips to nearby villages and clinics or programs the Sumba Foundation runs or supports. ""You can go into the villages, you can experience daily life, you can go to the markets and you can contribute if you want. And most do because they want to and it's not a tough sell. They really want to be a part of it and they really want to keep coming back to see the good work they've done,"" says James McBride, managing partner at Nihiwatu. The Wave remains the most famous draw card, luring surfers from the world over, and limits itself to 10 surfers at the break per day. Another 10 villas are due to be completed by March 2015 -- part of a plan to host those keen on more than just surfing. Indeed, for those like this writer, not able to ride a board, there's a lot more to Nihiwatu than surfing. The range of activities available includes a full range of spa options, waterfall hikes, biking, scuba diving and snorkeling, yoga, day trips and horseback riding. A stand up paddleboard trip to nearby Wanukaku river is thoroughly recommended, but be warned of smiling local kids who dive bomb paddlers at every opportunity. Graves recently stepped back from his role at the hotel, selling it to new owner Chris Burch, who has partnered with shareholder and established hotel manager, McBride. Graves is in and out of Sumba and still focused on the Foundation now that there are a regular batch of guests that keep returning -- many of them keen to see the continued progress their support for the foundation has made. ""We've proven that if you get it right, guests will come back. Guests get involved and it is beneficial for all,"" Graves says. And this guest just might even be able to surf next time around. How to get there . All profits from Nihiwatu go to the Sumba Foundation. You can make donations or find out more about the foundation here. Rates are all inclusive (food, drinks, activities) with some optional extras. Accommodation starts at $495 per person per night for the rest of 2014, based on double occupancy and are exclusive of VAT and service charges. From March 2015, full board rates (food and non-alcoholic drinks) start at $900 per room per night based on the size of the villa. Activities are at an additional cost. There's a minimum stay of three or seven days, depending on the season (high season runs mid-June to mid-October). Nihiwatu is closed January and February. There are three flights daily to Sumba's Tambolaka airport on the west of the island (plus a weekly charter flight) and the hotel will organize transfers. Flight connections are made via Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar. Click here for more Nihiwatu villa and reservation/rate details.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge struck down key parts of a new Texas abortion law, considered among the most restrictive in the country, on Monday, one day before they were scheduled to take effect. The lawsuit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleged the law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. The lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services, and usage controls on RU486, a drug that induces abortions. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel blocked the law's admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it ""places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her."" He also blocked a part of the law that deals with medication-induced abortions but allowed restrictions on the same issue to move forward. Provisions such as requiring strict use under Food and Drug Administration protocol and mandatory follow-up visits remain in place. ""The medication-abortion provisions may not be enforced against any physician who determines, in appropriate medical judgment, to perform a medication-abortion using the off-label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother,"" Yeakel wrote. Abortion-rights groups say the judge did not go far enough on the issue of medication-induced abortion, believing doctors should be able to use it with few restrictions. ""Today's ruling marks an important victory for Texas women and sends a clear message to lawmakers: it is unconstitutional for politicians to pass laws that take personal, private decisions away from women and their doctors,"" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. ""While this ruling protects access to safe and legal abortion for women in many parts of the state, part of this ruling will make it impossible for many women to access medication abortion, which is safe and effective early in pregnancy,"" she said. Conservative groups were disappointed by the ruling. ""Blocking this law only puts vulnerable women in greater danger. We are very disturbed that a judge would partially block a law that is grounded in the latest science and in common sense,"" said Anna Higgins, director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council. The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Texas Gov. Rick Perry then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. In response to the judge's ruling, Perry vowed he and others will keep fighting. If the state decides to appeal, the case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. ""Today's decision will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren't exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently,"" the governor said. He added: ""We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly-elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans."" Separately, the law prohibits abortions past 20 weeks of gestation. That ban takes effect, as scheduled, on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's perilous democratic transition has been rocked by the ongoing anti-government protests. The standoff between the government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and opposition parties continues to accelerate the political uncertainty and damage the fragile economy. Sharif was elected 14 months ago in an election that witnessed unprecedented voter turnout. While most opposition parties accepted the results, Imran Khan -- the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek I Insaf (PTI) party -- claimed there was widespread rigging. There's not much evidence, however, beyond the usual irregularities of Pakistan's outmoded electoral system, to back this up. But a successful campaign, aided by sections of Pakistani media, to de-legitimize last year's vote has convinced a large number of people that somehow Khan's mandate was ""stolen"" in 2013. Another opposition group, Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by a Pakistani Canadian cleric, Tahir ul Qadri wants a systemic change and has a list of undeliverable promises to the electorate. His immediate grievance is the brutal police action against his supporters that left 14 dead in June of this year. Both the groups have mobilized their supporters since early August and have been camping in Islamabad's red zone -- a high security area where many state buildings and diplomatic missions are located. In the last few days the sit-in turned violent as the protestors attempted to enter the parliament and prime minister's residence, leaving hundreds injured and at least three dead. On Monday morning, mobs entered the state television premises and managed to suspend the transmission for some time until the military intervened and restored order. This was a most embarrassing situation for Sharif's government as the civilian law enforcement apparatus appeared helpless. Role of the military . In such situations, it is Pakistan's powerful army which usually intervenes; it has taken over the reins of government four times during country's 67-year history. Relations between Pakistan's prime minister and the military have been far from smooth for months. The civilian government and the courts have proceeded to try Pervez Musharraf, the former army chief and president for treason. In May, the government was seen as sympathetic to the country's largest television channel that, rather unprofessionally, named the intelligence chief as responsible for an attack on its leading journalist Hamid Mir, who was shot in Karachi but survived the alleged assassination attempt. Under pressure, the government later backtracked and penalized the channel but mistrust grew. On key foreign policy issues, such as India and Afghanistan, the government and the military are not on the same page either. Sharif is an ardent advocate of making peace with India, while the military's strategic worldview has historically been determined by the threat from India. Sharif has been regularly meeting the army chief, General Raheel Sharif, and also consolidating his position by mobilizing other political parties in parliament. However, the media, on balance, has critical, in some measure propelled by the high-handed tactics of the government as it quelled protests including beating up journalists in recent days. Earlier, the protestors have been attacking journalists at will expressing their anger towards media houses viewed as ""partisan."" There has been chaos all over and even the Pakistani Taliban mockingly stated that they too could paralyze the country's capital. In the current stalemate the military has maintained an ostensibly neutral position. Pakistan's Dawn.com news service described this as a ""carefully constructed veneer"" and suggested the military may not be fully siding with the government, which the constitution says it must do. The army has issued three statements in the past week wherein it has emphasized dialogue and negotiation with Khan and Qadri, as well as avoiding the use of force. Game changer? On Monday, the former head of Khan's party, Javed Hashmi, claimed the recent turmoil was planned by the protesting parties with the backing of sections within the army and possibly judges from the country's top court. But in a carefully worded statement, the army reiterated its position as ""an apolitical institution"" and reminded all of ""its unequivocal support for democracy at numerous occasions."" However, this has been a game changer of sorts as it allows the civilian government to reassert its political power. The recent breach of security at parliament and other state installations in Islamabad did not result in any attempt by the military to repel protestors. Yet the military is concerned about its image. It has regained its popularity by conducting operations against militants along its border with Afghanistan, and also by regaining its space in a powerful broadcast media that had played a pivotal role in ousting Musharraf in 2007-8. But Sharif is fighting back and has convened a special session of the parliament on Tuesday, which is likely to reiterate support for him. A parliamentary committee will restart negotiations with the protestors. A coup may not be imminent. Until recently, it was widely speculated that Sharif may be forced to resign, given the turn of events. But Sharif might come out of this crisis as a weakened prime minister with the military controlling foreign and security policies. Having said that Pakistan's political history is fraught with unexpected events; and continued standoff may lead to a further meltdown where the army shall act as the sole arbiter of political events. Meanwhile, the majority of Pakistanis crave stability.","Standoff between government and opposition creates uncertainty, damages economy .
Pakistan's powerful army often intervenes but has so far remained neutral .
However, a coup cannot be completely ruled out .

"(CNN) -- The bullets that killed Beatle John Lennon were given to Mark David Chapman by an Atlanta police officer who was his friend, Chapman told a parole board as he made his case -- for an eighth time -- to be freed. Chapman said he sold a Norman Rockwell painting to finance the assassination plot, which he described as ""very well thought out."" It involved ""incredible planning, absolutely, incredible stalking."" Chapman, 59, fired five rounds into Lennon outside New York's Dakota Hotel on the evening of December 8, 1980. But in the 34 years since then, Chapman has found God, he testified to three New York parole commissioners August 20. ""I found my peace in Jesus,"" Chapman said. ""I know him. He loves me. He has forgiven me. He has helped in my life like you wouldn't believe."" He also told the parole board that he was ""an idiot"" for killing Lennon ""and choosing the wrong way to glory."" But the ""bright light of fame, of infamy, notoriety"" was irresistible, he added. 8th bid for release . Chapman's testimony last week was his eighth request for freedom since he became eligible for release under the 20-years-to-life sentence for his second-degree murder conviction. The commissioners denied parole as they've done seven times before -- in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. The decision said the board found a ""reasonable probability that (Chapman) would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the law"" and that his release ""would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate the serious nature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law."" The hearing transcript and the decision were made public Wednesday. The commissioners questioned Chapman about why he decided to kill Lennon and how he carried out the murder. ""I was confused,"" he told them. ""I needed a lot of attention at that time, and I took it out on him."" Chapman, who was 25 at the time, said his life had ""sunk to a depressed state"" and he was drinking. ""I just saw that as my way out, you know, a lazy way out of my doldrums. It was a horrible decision, but I knew what I was doing."" Decision was made at a young age . The idea of killing Lennon began when he read a book about the Beatles as a child, a time when be was ""feeling left out,"" he said. ""I just said to myself what would happen if I killed him,"" Chapman said. ""I remember that, and then the idea just avalanched on me that this was something I am going to have to do. It grabbed ahold of me and wouldn't let go."" He acknowledged to the board that he had several ""alternate targets"" to kill, although the names were redacted in the published transcript. The commissioners noted that all of the former targets are now dead. Retired cop reveals letters from Lennon's killer . The police officer who arrested him showed CNN letters sent to him by Chapman in 1983 saying that actors Marlon Brando and George C. Scott, former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis and CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite were on his hit list. He made two trips to New York to stalk and plan, he said. His first trip ended when his wife convinced him to return to their home in Hawaii, where he said he tried to get counseling. ""They said that there was a backup and they couldn't see me,"" Chapman said. He convinced his wife that he had thrown away his gun and she had no idea his second trip to New York was to kill someone, he said . ""I told her I was coming to New York to write a book, a children's book, and that I kind of needed space to find myself and she believed me,"" Chapman testified. ""She really did. I think if she would have thought otherwise she would have stopped somebody or called somebody. I was very convincing."" He sold a Norman Rockwell painting to pay his airfare to New York from Hawaii and his hotel expenses, he said. Mark David Chapman Fast Facts . Bullets came from police officer . Chapman, who grew up in Atlanta, said he stopped in his hometown on the way. He asked a friend who was an Atlanta police officer for help. ""I told him I had the gun, but I couldn't get bullets, and I needed protection while I was in New York,"" he said. ""He gave me five bullets."" Lennon was ""very kind"" to him when Chapman encountered him before the shooting, even signing a copy of his latest album, he testified. He knew he ""could have turned it around"" and not killed Lennon, but he chose not to, he said. ""That bright light of fame, of infamy, notoriety was there,"" Chapman said. ""I couldn't resist it. My self-esteem was shot, and I was looking for an easy way out. It was a bad way out, but it was the way I chose and it was horrible."" Lennon a 'great and talented man' He told the parole board that he realized the pain he has caused by killing Lennon, who he said was ""a great and talented man."" ""I am sorry for causing that type of pain,"" he said. ""I am sorry for being such an idiot and choosing the wrong way to glory."" He's no longer seeking notoriety, he said. ""Got enough of that. I don't need anymore."" ""I am interested in one thing and that's ministering to prisoners,"" he said. ""Me and my wife have a ministry. We distribute brochures that tell people about Christ."" His wife has stood by him for 35 years. She visited last year and is planning to visit later this year, he said. ""I can't believe she stuck with me all these years but she has,"" he said. ""We're closer to the Lord now than we were on the street, so I am going to credit him with keeping our marriage together and our sanity, but she is still with me."" If freed, he has a job lined up with a New York minister, he said. His skills include fixing wheelchairs, which he does as a prison job, he said. He told the commissioners he expected them to deny his parole and he understood they are just doing their jobs.

"(CNN) -- During the weeks of debates triggered by Edward Snowden and his release of information about a classified National Security Agency spying program, the story has moved further and further from the actual surveillance and centered instead on the international cat-and-mouse game to find him. What has been remarkable is how Democrats have expressed little opposition to the surveillance program. Many Democrats have simply remained silent as these revelations have emerged while others, like California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, have openly defended the program. President Barack Obama, while initially acknowledging the need for a proper balance between civil liberties and national security, has increasingly focused on defending the government and targeting Snowden. When former President George W. Bush offered comments that echoed much of the president's sentiment, some of his supporters couldn't help but cringe as these two one-time adversaries came together on the issue of counterterrorism. The loss of a Democratic opposition to the framework of counterterrorism policy has been one of the most notable aspects of Obama's term in office. Although Obama ran in 2008 as a candidate who would change the way the government conducted its business and restore a better balance with civil liberties, it has not turned out that way. Obama has barely dismantled any of the Bush programs, and sometimes even expanded their reach in the use of drone strikes and the targeting of American citizens. He has also undertaken an aggressive posture toward those who criticize his program. Opinion: Why we're all stuck in the digital transit zone with Snowden . Equally notable has been how silent many liberals, who once railed against Bush for similar activities, have become in recent years. Whenever Obama has encountered conservative pushback for minor efforts to change national security operations, there has been little pressure from liberals for him to move in a different direction. If there was any moment when liberals might use a scandal to pressure the president into reforms, this was it. But there is little evidence that this will happen. Where is the outrage? Where has the Democratic opposition gone? Part of the story simply has to do with political hypocrisy. Whether or not we like it, partisans tend to be harder on the opposition party than their own. This was clear when Republican opponents of a strong national security system, who gave then-President Bill Clinton trouble when he went after home-bred white extremists in 1995 and 1996 in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, remained silent when President Bush took the same steps against terrorism after 9/11 -- such as in the use of roving wiretaps on cell phones. Democrats have been reluctant to weaken a president who has moved forward on domestic policies they care about by giving him trouble on an issue where their party has traditionally been vulnerable. The silence on national security is also a product of presidential leadership. One of the functions of a president, as party leader, is to send strong signals about what the party should focus on. When Obama backed away from closing Guantanamo early in his first term, and has been reluctant to do much about the issues of interrogation and aggressive use of American power, he made it much harder for Democratic liberals to do this on their own. By embracing so much of President Bush's national security program, Obama has forged a bipartisan consensus that further marginalized the left and made it harder for them to gain much traction. Opinion: Edward Snowden, want my advice? Finally, liberals have been split on this issue. The intense animosity toward Bush created the appearance of unanimity, but, in reality, divisions loomed all along. Now that Democrats have been able to debate national security with their own president in the White House, it is clear that many liberals, like Feinstein, believe the government needs to take these steps. Efforts to attack the United States, ranging from the failed plot to bomb the New York City subways to the Boston bombings, have offered a reminder of the chronic risks the nation faces. ""What do you think would happen if Najibulla Zazi was successful?"" Feinstein asked, referring to his effort to bomb a New York subway. ""There would be unbridled criticism. Didn't we learn anything? Can't we protect our homeland?"" But Democrats must also remember that too much consensus can lead to bad decisions. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, many liberal Democrats feared being seen as ""soft on communism,"" and allowed reckless and random attacks on Americans accused of allying with the Soviets. This dangerously eroded civil liberties and destroyed many lives. During the early 1960s, Lyndon Johnson's refusal to listen to the many critics of his Vietnam policies led him deeper and deeper into the quagmire of that war. And during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Democratic fears of being seen as weak on defense led to a ratcheting up of concern about Iraq that helped give Bush the political space he needed to send American troops off to war. It is possible that further revelations supplied by Snowden to The Guardian newspaper's Glenn Greenwald will energize liberal opponents of national security policy and build pressure in Congress for serious investigations and possible reform. But the odds are slim. Opinion: U.S. intelligence community is out of control . It's more likely that most liberal critics of the administration will remain silent and our equivalent of what President Dwight Eisenhower in 1961 called the military-industrial complex -- the intricate web connecting defense contractors, the military, members of Congress and the executive branch -- will continue to grow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: There's less emphasis on NSA spying than Snowden's whereabouts .
Zelizer: Democrats silent on intrusion of the surveillance program; some defend it .
Zelizer: Partisans are harder on the opposition, but this can be dangerous .
He says liberal critics of NSA will probably remain silent as excesses in security grow ."
"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama hit back at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over Ebola on Tuesday, warning that quarantine policies based on fear could discourage US health care workers ""doing God's work"" in Africa to battle the epidemic. Obama issued a veiled but clear public rebuke to the tough-talking Republican who strode back onto the national stage in a tussle with the White House on Friday after ordering the isolation of a nurse who had just landed at Newark from Sierra Leone. The president warned that health workers who do a ""really tough job"" in Africa should be applauded, supported and monitored in a prudent fashion once they come back home. He said anti-Ebola precautions should be based on science not ""on our fears."" The public disagreement marked the latest twist in the odd couple relationship between the cool, no drama president and the no-nonsense governor, who bonded two years ago after Hurricane Sandy. Widening disagreements are likely if Christie decides to run for president in 2016. Christie justified his decision to contradict federal Ebola procedures by quarantining the nurse, Kaci Hickox by saying that the inconveniencing of one person was outweighed by wider concerns for public safety. But the confinement of Hickox, who exhibited no symptoms of Ebola, stirred a public relations mess for the governor and on Monday he relented and allowed her to return home to Maine for monitoring. Another governor, Democrat Andrew Cuomo of New York also climbed down on tough new quarantine rules under pressure from the White House. But Christie remained defiant on Tuesday, saying he had no regrets over how the drama had unfolded in his state. The Ebola episode offers another example of challenges Christie faces as the Republican governor of a Democratic state with his eyes on the White House. He has to avoid alienating conservative primary voters -- many of whom are still bitter about Christie's embrace of President Barack Obama days before the 2012 election after Hurricane Sandy ravaged his state. But he can't hew so close to the conservative line that he upends his image as a straight-talker willing to take on both parties. That dynamic was on display Monday after Hickox was released. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Christie himself should be quarantined after again lining up with Obama on a key issue shortly before a critical election. ""Obama and his gang are flipping out.... so one week before the election, once again Gov. Chris Christie has caved,"" Limbaugh said. ""We need to quarantine Chris Christie, is what we need to happen here folks."" Still, the White House that was once so eager to embrace Christie's post-Sandy bear hug of Obama's leadership is now rebuking the state's the treatment of Hickox, saying medical staff returning home must not be stigmatized. ""Her service and commitment to this cause is something that should be honored and respected. I don't think we should do that by making her live in a tent for two or three days,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. The jab was a reflection of how the political circumstances of both Christie and Obama have changed since their interactions in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Back then, with Christie seeking a thumping re-election win to set up a 2016 run, and keen for federal relief cash, he had sound political reasons to offer Obama a disaster photo-op â€” much to the fury of Mitt Romney's supporters. Now, with Christie seeking a national stage, polishing his reputation after the Bridgegate scandal, and keen to capitalize on Republican claims Obama is incompetent, it makes sense to stand firm on Ebola. PHOTOS: The Ebola epidemic . The White House noticed the shifting dynamic from a politician who now has more incentive to confront Obama than to embrace him. A senior administration official told CNN on Sunday that the White House told Christie and Cuomo it was concerned with ""the unintended consequences of policies that are not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa."" The saga reveals two sides of Chris Christie â€” likely to be vying for prominence if he decides next year to run for president in a campaign that will likely contrast his abrasive style of management with the cool, 'no drama' persona adopted by Obama, which critics see as evidence of disengagement. ""What I think Christie did here was he managed once again, just like Hurricane Sandy, to reassert himself as a very strong and powerful leader, someone who will seize the bull by the horns,"" said Brigid Harrison, an analyst who has watched the governor's fast rising career from Montclair State University. In standing up to federal health authorities, Christie assumed leadership of those suspicious of Washington officials who insist their risk to Americans from Ebola is miniscule. ""Being an undeclared candidate in a hotly contested primary ... Christie's calling card is going to be that bold leadership â€” and he is going to show it time and time again,"" said Jonathan Jaffe, a public affairs consultant who runs a daily newsletter on New Jersey politics.","Chris Christie struck a defiant tone in responding to Ebola .
Christie's response shows the tone that will be on display if he runs for president ."
"(CNN) -- Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed legislation that would have allowed concealed pistol license holders who undergo additional training to carry concealed pistols in schools and other public places, his office said Tuesday in a statement. Snyder rejected the bill because it did not provide an opportunity for public places -- such as schools, day care centers and hospitals -- to exempt themselves from the provision, the statement said. At present, Michigan law does not prevent holders of concealed pistol licenses from carrying guns in these areas as long as they do so openly. Snyder recommended that the bill be modified so that it would not permit the open carrying of weapons in these public areas, but would permit concealed carry for license holders who undergo additional training, his statement said. But even with this modification, he would still want property owners to be able to decide whether to allow concealed weapons on their premises, he said. Analysis: Guns and the law . ""These public venues need clear legal authority to ban firearms on their premises if they see fit to do so,"" he said. Also Tuesday, Snyder signed two bills that streamline the process for handgun purchases and eliminate restrictions on interstate rifle and shotgun transactions. The bill was approved Thursday by the Republican-controlled state Senate and House. In a news release, Snyder's office said the governor ""had committed to give the bill additional scrutiny"" prior to Friday's school shootings in Connecticut ""in an effort to ensure that public safety remains a priority."" But Speaker Jase Bolger, R-Marshall, said in a statement that the bill ""would have had no impact on that tragedy"" in Connecticut. He said it was ""unfortunate a compromise was not reached"" and added, ""It also is unfortunate that this veto does not make Michigan citizens safer in gun-free zones.

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has dismissed an allegation that he was behind the death of a lawyer who left a video blaming the president if anything happened to him. A video with Rodrigo Rosenberg appears on YouTube in which he accuses Guatemala's leader in his death. The lawyer, Rodrigo Rosenberg, was shot and killed Sunday while riding a bicycle in Guatemala City. On Monday, a video surfaced in which Rosenberg -- seated behind a desk and calmly speaking into a microphone -- linked Colom and an aide to his death. ""If you are watching this message,"" Rosenberg said on the video, ""it is because I was assassinated by President Alvaro Colom, with help from Gustavo Alejos,"" the president's private secretary. Rosenberg mentions a third person who he believes would have been involved in his death and also mentions those three people as well as the president's wife in connection with two killings last month. In a broadcast to the nation Monday night, Colom denied any connection. ""We categorically reject the accusations that pretend to tie the president, first lady and private secretary as those responsible for this assassination,"" Colom said. A dated and signed transcript of the video's content indicates Rosenberg made the recording last week. It surfaced Monday after his funeral, and was posted on YouTube and distributed to other media outlets by the newspaper El Periodico de Guatemala. Rosenberg's video said he was targeted for talking about the death of prominent businessman Khalil Musa and his daughter in April. They were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted. Rosenberg said he had been speaking out about his belief that Colom and others were behind the slaying. Carlos Castresana Fernandez, the head of a U.N.-Guatemalan commission set up to investigate corruption and political violence, told CNN that his agency will support an investigation by the country's attorney general. ""We must be sure the investigation is a proper one and are demanding of the government to take the necessary distance -- to be sure there are no influences over the investigators that could make questions of the reliability of the investigation itself,"" he said. Castresana's organization, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, was set up because of an ""almost complete failure"" of the country's legal system following a decades-long civil war that ended in 1996. He said the facts were ""serious enough"" that his organization was assisting prosecutors to mount a transparent investigation. Radio journalist Mario David Garcia told CNN en Español on Tuesday that Rosenberg was supposed to detail his allegations Monday afternoon on Garcia's program, ""Hablando Claro"" (Speaking Clearly). Garcia, also an attorney, said Rosenberg came by his office last week to talk about the allegations against the president. Garcia said he asked for proof. In the video, Rosenberg wears a blue-gray suit, white shirt and solid sky-blue tie. A blue cloth backdrop drapes the wall behind him and a large red broadcast-type microphone sits on the table in front of him. He speaks in a calm, deliberate voice and mentions that he is the 47-year-old father of ""four divine children, with the best brother that you could ask of life, with incredible friends and very much wanting to live in his country."" But he adds that he could not have lived with himself if he had not come forth with the accusations. Mario Gonzalez, manager of the business Musa owned, told CNN en Español that Rosenberg relayed to him Friday afternoon his plan to release the information to the media. Rosenberg knew he was targeted, Gonzalez said. ""He felt threatened,"" Gonzalez said. ""[But] he was not afraid. He had been threatened but he knew that sooner or later he would be killed. 'They are going to kill me,' he said."" The lawyer's niece, Mariela Rosenberg, said her uncle learned to accept his fate. ""He had many threats,"" she told CNN en Español, ""and when he saw it was inevitable, he taped a video."" In addition to Colom's broadcast address, the government posted a seven-point statement on its Web site rejecting the assertions and saying the claims were meant to create ""political chaos."" In the posting, Colom's administration blamed Rosenberg's death on organized crime and welcomed international assistance in the investigation. ""The government of Guatemala categorically condemns the hostile, malicious way some sections of the population are using these events in order to create political instability in the country,"" it said. ""The murder of lawyer Rosenberg as well as the recording and written declaration distributed have to be analyzed very carefully,"" the government said, ""because the murder as well as the accusations are very serious offenses that are severely punishable by the law and are attempts against the state of law and democracy."" Some analysts say they have no knowledge of Colom or others in his inner circle being involved in the killings, but point to Guatemala's history of corruption and large-scale involvement in the drug trade. ""Guatemala has been particularly known for the complicity of the government with the dark forces of the nation,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute. In his video, Rosenberg bemoans the ""narcos, assassins and thieves"" who have taken over the country. ""Those thieves are sinking all of Guatemala,"" he said. ""They kill people like dogs."" About 200,000 people have been killed in Guatemala since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime and drug-trade violence, Birns said. The violence has gotten worse, he said, since Mexican President Felipe Calderon started waging war on that nation's drug cartels a couple of years ago. Mexico shares a 541-mile (871-kilometer) border with Guatemala and many Mexican narcotraffickers moved their operations to the neighboring country. Guatemala is also known for money-laundering. ""There isn't a single serious banker in this country,"" Rosenberg said in the video. ""There isn't a single correct banker in this country."" Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank, said Guatemala has a reputation for corruption and the drug trade. ""It is a country where one of two presidents ends up being seriously charged with corruption,"" he said. The government also offers scant public services. ""Guatemala has the lowest tax collection, the lowest government expenditures of any country in Latin America,"" Hakim said. Colom was elected in November 2007 on a promise to lessen Guatemala's horrendous poverty. It hasn't worked out that way. ""He proved to be a disappointment,"" Birns said.","Lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg shot dead while bicycling in Guatemala City .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Tyler Perry has, for the first time, revealed graphic details about the sexual, physical and emotional abuse he says he suffered as a child. ""I'm tired of holding this in,"" Tyler Perry wrote on his Web site, ""... so I've decided to give some away."" Perry recounts in a message posted on his Web site and in an e-mail to fans that a prescreening of the film ""Precious,"" due out later this year, dislodged ""some raw emotions and brought me to some things and places in my life that I needed to deal with but had long forgotten. It brought back memories so strong that I can smell and taste them."" Perry is an executive producer of the movie, which tells the tale of Claireece ""Precious"" Jones, an illiterate, obese 16-year-old girl from Harlem who is emotionally and physically abused. The 40-year-old producer says he can identify with the character, and he recalls a number of incidents from his childhood. Emmitt Perry Sr., a construction worker, uttered profane insults at him and relentlessly beat and belittled him, Perry says. The random, violent beatings were commonplace until Perry was 19, he said. ""You ... jackass! You got book sense but you ain't got no ... common sense,"" he quotes his father as saying. ""I heard this every day of my childhood,"" says Perry. Attempts to reach Emmitt Perry Sr. for comment were unsuccessful. Tyler Perry was born Emmitt Perry Jr. but changed his name to distance himself from his father. One night when his mother was gone, Perry says, his drunken father ""got the vacuum cleaner extension cord and trapped me in a room and beat me until the skin was coming off my back."" Perry says that while at a playmate's house when he was about 10 years old, his friend's scantily clad mother locked the friend in the bathroom and told Perry to leave. ""I was at the front door trying to get out, when she came in and laid on the sofa and asked me if I wanted the key. I told her I had to go home as it was getting dark. ""She put the key inside of herself and told me to come get it, pulling me on top of her,"" Perry writes on his site. Perry said he was sickly as a child, and that made his father angry. His grandmother contended the family was wasting money on allergy shots. She said Perry had germs on him. One day when Perry's mother was away, he said, his grandmother decided ""to kill those germs on me once and for all. She gave me a bath in ammonia."" The violence in the home caused Perry's mother to pack up the car with him and his sisters and drive from Louisiana to California. Her husband reported the car stolen, and the family members went to jail until the father came to get them. Perry said his father beat his mother all the way home. The producer said he got through by turning to God, and he forgave his tormentors to help himself heal. Perry, who previously has spoken publicly in more general terms about his childhood abuse, explains his latest revelations this way: ""I'm tired of holding this in. I don't know what to do with it anymore, so I've decided to give some away."" In October 2008, he told Ebony magazine: ""I tell people, if you're thinking about suicide, all that stuff I've attempted and thought about it. If you think about it, life gets better. The key to life when it gets tough is to keep moving. Just keep moving."" Perry also is the writer, director and actor in boisterous comedies such as ""Madea's Family Reunion"" and ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself.""","Tyler Perry said seeing ""Precious"" brought back memories of abuse .

"(CNN) -- Conventional wisdom tells us that natural remedies are simply gentler alternatives to prescription drugs like Viagra and Cialis, right? Not so fast, say experts. Not only are many dietary supplements marketed for erectile dysfunction and other male sexual problems ineffective, they may not even be ""natural."" In fact, a number of these supplements are adulterated with the very prescription drugs they claim to replace, according to a recent report published in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine. The editorial by Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, sheds light on this growing concern. Cohen cites several alarming incidents in which over-the-counter sexual enhancement supplements were found to contain other substances. For example, one study in Singapore found that 77% of so-called natural sex supplements on the market contained undeclared pharmaceutical drugs, often in higher-than-recommended doses. And in 2012, a supplement called Rock Hard for Men was found to contain both counterfeit Cialis and glyburide, a diabetes drug. A similar combination found in other sex supplements has been tied to the deaths of more than a dozen men in Asia. Even more disturbing, such supplements may contain analogues, or chemical variants, of prescription drugs like Viagra. Indeed, more than 45 new analogues have been identified in sexual supplements, according to Cohen. One Dutch study found that about three-quarters of the products sold in the Netherlands contained at least one analogue, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently discovered three analogue drugs (as well as counterfeit Viagra) when it analyzed a product called Mojo Nights. Other tainted supplements include those sold under the names Vicerex, Bullet Proof and Lightning ROD. Analogues are particularly troublesome, says Cohen, because they have never been tested in humans, so their potential side effects remain a mystery. We do know, however, the risks associated with prescription medications such as Viagra and Cialis. These drugs, known as PDE-5 inhibitors, can cause side effects like headaches, nasal congestion and vision problems -- and they can have dangerous interactions with the heart medication nitroglycerine. That doesn't mean PDE-5 inhibitors are unsafe for everyone, but it does mean that they need to be prescribed and monitored by a doctor. Unfortunately, when you take a sexual enhancement supplement, you have no real way of knowing whether that product is adulterated with PDE-5 inhibitors or other drugs that could have harmful effects when used without supervision. ""It is my hope that by educating men, deaths from sexual enhancement products can be prevented in the United States,"" Cohen said. He urges men with sexual dysfunction to avoid sexual health supplements altogether. If you really want to try something natural, Cohen suggests asking your doctor about yohimbine, a prescription medication for erectile dysfunction that's derived from yohimbe, a compound naturally found in the bark of a West African evergreen tree. It's important, however, that you take the prescription version and not the supplement yohimbe, which has been shown to contain varying amounts of the active ingredient. While it's true that men may seek out natural remedies for sexual dysfunction because they believe they are safer and gentler than their conventional counterparts, it's my experience that some men may be using these supplements as way to avoid discussing sexual issues with their physicians or because they are too embarrassed to fill the prescription at their local pharmacy. To address such concerns, Pfizer has started selling Viagra online. Although men still need a valid prescription for the drug, they will be able to order the medication on the Internet and have it sent directly to their home. According to a recent article in the New York Times, a 2011 survey by Pfizer found that 80% of pills sold online as ""Viagra"" were counterfeit drugs that only contained about 30% to 50% of the active ingredient sildenafil. Worse, some were contaminated with pesticides, paint and printer ink. By selling real Viagra online, Pfizer hopes to guide men to the legitimate drug. This is one way to help guys feel less embarrassed about sexual dysfunction. I also recommend that men and their partners get comfortable having open, candid conversations about sex. You might feel nervous at first, but learning to communicate honestly with your partner about your sex life can make it easier to discuss sexual health with your doctor -- and it's the most natural approach of all.","Men may think natural supplements are gentler alternatives to prescription drugs .

"(CNN) -- Ah, the '80s. In popular memory, which is forever determined to turn everything to kitsch, the Decade of Reagan is now reduced to pastel colors, overworked synthesizers and parachute pants. John Oates, left, and Daryl Hall formed one of the most successful duos in pop music history. And Hall & Oates? A tall guy with feathered blond locks, a short guy with a fat mustache and the ever-present beat of ""Maneater"" on MTV. Perhaps it's time to set the record straight -- which is what Daryl Hall and John Oates have in mind with ""Do What You Want, Be What You Are"" (RCA/Legacy), a four-CD boxed set that spans their career, including rare tracks, live cuts and all the hits that made them one of the top-selling duos of all time. The set is out Tuesday. ""It always has bothered us"" to be dismissed as shallow popsters, adds Oates, 60, in a phone interview. ""Early rock journalism tended to fluff us off as prefab hitmakers with some sort of formula. ... [But now] we have a whole new respect and a whole new generation of musicians and fans who look at our music from a much broader, much more objective point of view."" Fellow musicians have been some of the first to pay tribute. In the boxed set's liner notes, there is praise from Mick Jagger, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen and Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard (who says 1984's ""Big Bam Boom"" was the first record he ever bought with his own money). CNN caught up with Hall, just turned 63, and Oates on separate calls and asked them about their first meeting, the stories behind some of their songs and what they've been up to recently. Herewith a few answers; supply your own beat. In the beginning ... Both men were raised in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area and attended Temple University in the late '60s, but didn't formally meet until their respective bands were set to play an R&B teen dance in 1967. Oates: ""We were waiting backstage to go on and a big gang fight broke out and we went down the service elevator and we left. And as we were going down we kind of met."" Gang fight? Gunfire and clubs and dog chains? Hall: ""Typical Philadelphia scene. We didn't even blink an eye."" Developing a sound . The pair's work is known for its combination of smooth R&B and punchy rock. The blend comes from their backgrounds, with Hall originally on the ""B team"" (his words) for Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philly productions and Oates' roots in folk and rock. Hall: ""We were just putting together the sounds that were around us and trying to put our version of it together. One reason we didn't stick around in Philly -- I remember having a conversation with Kenny Gamble, and he said, 'Why don't you come and be artists on Philadelphia International -- we're starting this new label.' And I said, we want to do our own version of the Philly sound, so we need to separate ourselves from you. And so we moved to New York with that idea in mind."" Creating ""She's Gone"" Hall: ""I heard John playing this chord progression on an acoustic guitar, going 'She's gone, whoa I, whoa I' ... it sort of reminded me of a Cat Stevens song. So I said, let's get funky with it. So I sat down at my Wurlitzer piano and started playing that riff ... and we sat down and wrote about the things that were happening to both of us at the time."" That evocative line about ""Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away""? ""That was coming straight from living in the streets,"" says Hall. ""An English person once said, 'You know, it's carbon monoxide, not carbon and monoxide.' And I said yeah, but it doesn't sing right!"" (The song, unsuccessful upon first release in 1974, became a huge hit on its second try in 1976.) How Hall & Oates changed . Though the group continued to have hits through the '70s, it wasn't until 1981 and ""Kiss on My List"" they became blockbuster hitmakers. Oates attributes the change to moving back to New York from Los Angeles, California, and assuming production duties. Oates: ""We worked with David [Foster] on an album called 'Along the Red Ledge,' and during that time we were going back to New York and getting involved in the punk and New Wave scene. ... And then we did one more album called 'X-Static,' and I remember distinctly while we were making the album, David said, 'Why am I here? You know what you want to do.' ... ""And we went on to produce ourselves, and we never looked back. The next album was 'Voices' and you know the story from there."" What Michael Jackson borrowed . During the making of ""We Are the World,"" Hall crossed paths with Michael Jackson, who told him he nicked a Hall & Oates song for his own ends. Hall recalls, ""Michael was trying to break the ice with me -- I'd never really talked with him much, I'd met him -- and he said, 'I hope you don't mind. I took ""[I Can't Go for That] No Can Do"" and made ""Billie Jean,"" the groove, out of it.' And I said no, of course not. It's all part of [the process]."" Two sides of ""Every Time You Go Away"" Paul Young took this Hall tune to No. 1 in 1985. Hall: ""I thought he made a great pop record out of a song that I'd never really related to, in the beginning, as a pop song -- it was a gospel song to me, with secular words. ... It has a lot of similarity, in spirit, to 'Sara Smile.' "" And the hits just keep on comin' Hall & Oates' record includes 29 Top 40 hits -- including six No. 1s -- but they say they never knew what would make the charts. Oates: ""The hits were a byproduct of the albums that we made. We never really set out to have all these hits. That was just a bonus."" iReport.com: Hall, Oates on ""Sara Smile,"" social networking . Method of modern music . Hall, who's doing ""quite well"" after a bout with Lyme disease several years ago, lives in upstate New York; Oates in Colorado. The two are friendly and do occasional concerts, including the final show at Philly's Spectrum arena October 23, but in general stay busy with solo projects, including Hall's ""Live from Daryl's House"" and Oates' songwriter series. Still, Oates says there's something special about the combination of their talents, and he's happy others appreciate what they've done -- whether through covers, sampling or simply listening. ""We've done what we've done, it's a moment in time, we've put it out there for the world, and I think for other artists to then reinterpret it is in the great tradition of pop music,"" he says. ""It's very much in the tradition of how pop evolves.""","Hall & Oates have a ""whole new respect"" from musicians, listeners, says Oates .

"(CNN) -- ""Sometimes I ask myself, why me? Why did this have to happen again?"" says 31-year-old Andile from the Khayelitsha township in Cape Town, South Africa. ""But the problem is I could have got it anywhere, on the bus, in a taxi, in my work. It's everywhere."" Andile has extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a form of the airborne disease that is resistant to the four main groups of drugs used to treat it, meaning treatment can take years and requires alternative drugs that have more side effects. He's had tuberculosis for more than two years but it's not the first time he's been infected. ""Where I stay, the environment is not right, it's not clean. I could have got TB there, or on the taxis we use as they never open the windows,"" he says. TB has long been known as a disease of poverty. Dense housing, shared living space, poor ventilation, poor nutrition and poor healthcare systems are the prime conditions for the infection to spread, and thrive. This ancient disease was known as the ""White Plague"" in 18th century Europe and still kills more than one million people a year globally. It's a complicated disease with the potential to affect many parts of the body and it can remain latent in people for many years, leaving them unaware they are infected. The main active form of the disease affects the lungs; if left untreated it can cause considerable lung damage, resulting in eventual death. 'Public health emergency' After repeated exposure, Andile has extensive damage to his lungs, leaving him reliant on an oxygen tank as he receives his treatment from Medecin Sans Frontiers. The NGO plays a large role in treating TB in Khayelitsha, one of the largest townships in the country. Andile is one of thousands of people who contract the extensively drug-resistant form each year and he makes a crucial point -- TB is everywhere in South Africa and is the leading cause of death. It's estimated that up to 80% of drug-resistant forms of the disease are now transmitted directly between people, rather than developing over time. ""The disease has reached a public health emergency in South Africa,"" explains Keertan Dheda, professor of medicine at the University of Cape Town. ""We treat half a million cases a year and today, the epidemic has taken a turn with drug resistance. We treat 8,000 cases of resistance a year and now a chunk of those have developed resistance beyond XDR-TB -- incurable TB."" Looking at the disease globally, in 2013 there were 72 cases of drug-resistant TB in the United States. In 2012 there were 64,000 cases in India and 59,000 in China. The more people and the closer their proximity, the easier the disease spreads. Drug resistance can develop for a variety of reasons. For TB, the origins lie in incomplete treatment regimens where people did not complete their course of antibiotics due either to poor health systems or personal preference or complacency. Incomplete treatments mean the bacteria behind the disease -- Mycobacterium tuberculosis -- have had some, but not full, exposure to the drugs prescribed to kill them, giving them the opportunity to mutate and become resistant. The result today is such vast resistance that in some settings, all known drugs have been rendered useless and these forms are now transmitting between people. ""We now have patients who are therapeutically destitute,"" explains Dheda. Global problem . The problem is now global. XDR-TB has its highest prevalence in Russian, Eastern Europe, China and India, with the latter reporting cases of total drug resistance. But according to the 2013 Global TB report from the World Health Organization (WHO), this extensive form of resistant TB has been reported in 92 countries, and is likely to be in more. ""It's probably in every country,"" says David Heymann, head of the Center on Global Health Security at think tank Chatham House and chair of the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom. ""The disease has spread internationally and is a real concern."" The 67th World Health Assembly took place last week and it approved a long-term global TB strategy, including targets to reduce TB deaths by 95% between 2015 and 2035. Also firmly on the agenda was the global concern of antibiotic resistance and the fear of many diseases becoming untreatable. The issue has been addressed by many public health organizations in 2014 and Heymann believes TB is a prime example of the problem and should be declared a public health emergency of international concern by the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee. But such a declaration is yet to be made. The man in charge of the controlling the problem globally is Mario Raviglione, director of the Global Tuberculosis Program at the WHO. ""TB is competing with HIV/AIDS as the number one killer among the infectious diseases,"" explains Raviglione. ""There are about 450,000 new drug-resistant TB cases every year and this is the scariest part of tuberculosis as you are left with less options to treat people, many of which are toxic."" 'Extraordinary measures' Raviglione stresses that the epidemic may differ in different parts of the world but is very much an international issue. ""Russia, India, China and South Africa have about 60% of the world cases, so if they don't improve there is no way the world can progress,"" he says. Raviglione is especially concerned about the increased rates of drug-resistant TB seen in Southern Africa. ""This scares us most because in that part of the world there is a lot of HIV and so it can become explosive and really spread and move fast as HIV amplifies the effect of tuberculosis."" The ability of HIV to suppress human immune systems enables TB bacteria to take over the body. The WHO strategy therefore is to target high-burden countries and improve the diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB. Because patients must take drugs for at least two years, getting them to stick with the treatment is essential, and transmission must also be controlled. Not a simple feat. ""This threat has to be prevented and when it does occur, extraordinary measures must be put in place to diagnose and treat to stop it spreading to others,"" states Raviglione. ""It's a real threat and has to be taken extremely seriously.""

"(CNN) -- It's doubtful there's ever a perfect time or place to end a marriage, but for Dean McDermott, that time and place was in a Palm Springs, California, hotel room after playing a round of golf. Mary Jo Eustace said she's been able to take her 2006 divorce from Dean McDermott and turn it into a positive. The actor told his then-wife, Mary Jo Eustace, that he'd been having an affair with Tori Spelling and that he'd found his soul mate, Eustace recalled Tuesday on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show."" ""[He said], 'I'm leaving you -- she loves me unconditionally,' "" Eustace said. Eustace replied that ""you've known her [for] three weeks. I actually thought it was a joke. I thought I was being punked. But it was true,"" she told Behar. Eustace offers life lessons she learned from the 2006 split with McDermott in her book ""Divorce Sucks: What to Do When Irreconcilable Differences, Lawyers Fees, and Your Ex Husband's Hollywood Wife Makes You Miserable,"" which arrived in bookstores Monday.  Watch Eustace describe her shock » . Donald Trump's ex-wife Marla Maples; Dina Matos, ex-wife of former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey; and Lance Armstrong's ex, Kristen, also appeared on Behar's show to break down what happens during and after very public breakups. When Eustace found out her 13-year marriage was ending, she said she was ""in a really ugly bikini -- missing like padding on one side, holding my daughter in my arms,"" but at least the bomb wasn't dropped in front of news cameras. Matos was standing right next to her husband when he admitted at a press conference that he'd had an affair with another man. ""I was in shock because I had only learned three days before that he had been involved in a relationship,"" Matos recalled on Tuesday's show. ""I was there in the moment. I was there physically but mentally, you know; I was just trying to maintain my composure and not fall apart in front of the cameras."" When a marriage ends, ""you think this is the end of your life as you know it,"" Matos said. ""And in some ways it is. You feel powerless."" Especially once the media picks up on the crumbling matrimony. ""The first week that my divorce was announced ... I saw a picture of my ex-husband with his new wife's legs wrapped around his head,"" Eustace said. ""You're in complete survival mode."" Although Lance Armstrong's post-marriage flame, Sheryl Crow, wasn't the reason his five-year marriage to Kristen ended, she told Behar it was still difficult to watch. And yet the hardest part for Kristen Armstrong was disliking her former husband's new love. ""I really wanted to dislike her,"" Armstrong said. ""I really did. [But] she's beautiful. She's smart. She's funny. She was great with the kids. For as much as I wanted to dislike her and I tried, I couldn't."" Matos said it's different when your husband leaves for another man. ""When your husband leaves you for another woman, at some point you know there was love in the marriage, and you had something,"" she said on Tuesday's show. ""But when your husband is not the person that you think he is, you know, he's an impostor -- then you start questioning every aspect of your life together. What was real? Did he ever love me? Why did he marry me? Later I found out why,"" she said. After McGreevey announced his affair, Matos said she found papers that appeared to be the outline for a book that said McGreevey married her ""for political gain,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's quarter-century-long civil war is in its final phase, the government suggested Friday, as its troops pounded Tamil Tiger rebels in the country's north. This picture, released by the Sri Lankan defense ministry, is said to be of a dead Tamil Tiger body captured after fighting on May 14, 2009. The rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- have fought for an independent state in Sri Lanka since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began. President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the end of the current military push, which is often referred to as a civilian rescue mission, is less than 48 hours away. He spoke from Jordan on Friday, where he's attending an economic summit. ""The Tamil civilians held hostage by the LTTE in small area of land in the north would be rescued, and the Tamils would be saved from the threat of LTTE terrorism,"" Rajapaksa said. In a rapid military push, Sri Lankan forces have squeezed Tamil Tiger fighters into approximately 1.5 square miles (four square kilometers) of coastal land. The United Nations estimates that more than 50,000 civilians are trapped there.  CNN's Paula Newton reports on the plight of trapped civilians » . The chunk of land, known as the no-fire zone or civilian safety area, was under siege by government forces Friday, according to Tamilnet.com, a rebel Web site. ""The entire safety zone area is in smoke ... as shelling by the Sri Lanka army was destroying all the structures within a narrow strip of coastal land, which is densely populated with tens of thousands of people,"" Tamilnet said. Humanitarian aid groups have reported mass civilian casualties in the fighting. ""The government is moving forward in extremely difficult circumstances. After all, the ... Tamil Tigers are seeded amidst the middle of all these civilians. It's very difficult to weed out and identify who is a fighter and who is not,"" said Gordon Weiss, a U.N. spokesman. ""It makes it very very dangerous for civilians, and it explains the very large toll on civilian life that we've seen at this point."" Weiss called the fighting a ""bloodbath"" at the beginning of the week. The situation had worsened by Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. It suspended evacuation and medical rescue operations in the no-fire zone. Aid agencies had been stuck offshore, unable to deliver badly needed relief supplies and evacuate civilians. ""Our staff are witnessing an unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe,"" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, the Red Cross' director of operations. ""No humanitarian organization can help them in the current circumstances. People are left to their own devices."" The U.N. Security Council and U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday called for both sides to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid into the conflict zone.  Watch frustration build at the United Nations » . In a statement at the White House, Obama urged Sri Lankan government troops to halt the ""indiscriminate"" shelling of civilians trapped with the remnants of the country's Tamil Tigers. He also prodded the rebels to stop using civilians as human shields. Security Council members issued a statement demanding ""that all parties respect their obligations under international humanitarian law."" A Red Cross worker was killed Wednesday during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka -- the third aid worker killed in six weeks -- the Red Cross said.","Sri Lanka president says end of current military push less than 48 hours away .

"(CNN) -- He's a bespectacled, middle-aged South Korean guy with a corporate job. But he has already swept Twitter and the international media, which swarmed him at the airport as he departed. The uber fan who captured the heart of Kansas City is to arrive at Kauffman Stadium on Tuesday for Game 1 of the World Series. Lee SungWoo has become the unlikely talisman for the surprise contenders, the Kansas City Royals. His nearly 20 year-long obsession with the baseball team from afar has become the feel-good story. After becoming a fan in the 1990s, Lee followed the Royals, barely missing a game, despite the 14-hour difference between Kansas City and Seoul. He paid little heed that the Royals hadn't made the playoffs in the last 29 years. In a 2012 interview, he tried to explain to a local website about his love for the Royals. Writing in English, which isn't his native language, he wrote: ""What made me of being a Royals fan? Now I can't tell why... just like many of you, Royals fans, I was sort of... underdog lover? sympathy? ""It was much more thrilled Royals beat big market teams rather than big market teams win against weak teams."" He had no ties to the team or the place. When he was asked whether he would come to Kansas City if the team made it to the World Series, he responded, ""Whoa! Royals can make it to the World series ever??? ""But If, big If, Royals go to world series, I would try this that one?"" Through the dismal losses and last place finishes, Lee's exuberance for the team didn't wane. His loyalty struck other Royals fans and Kansas City residents as sincere and dedicated. San Francisco stations ban Lorde's 'Royals' After nearly two decades of watching from afar, he arrived in Kansas City for the first time in August. During his visit, the Royals went on a 9-1 streak, causing some fans to speculate that he was a good luck charm. The Royals swept the San Francisco Giants in three games during Lee's visit -- the very team that it now faces in the World Series. Lee became a local sensation with TV stations covering his appearances and it spread to national outlets. Long after Lee returned to South Korea, Royal fans remembered his dedication as the team trounced the opposing teams during the post season. One fan even unfurled the South Korean flag as an ode to Lee. Some even brought replica of Lee for televised interviews. With the World Series to start on Tuesday, the Royals fans began demanding that Lee return to Kansas City to watch. Hashtags like #FreeSungWoo, #SungWooToKC and #SungWooSeries sprang up on Twitter. The hashtag #BringBackSungWoo began to trend in the United States. Following some intense lobbying, Lee will be on hand to watch the game -- with documentary filmmakers and South Korea media following his moves. Even the Major League Baseball's Twitter account acknowledged, ""From backflips to @Koreanfan_KC, there's magic brewing in Kansas City all year long. The first game of the World Series starts 8:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday.","Unlikely story about a Korean fan of the Royals made waves this summer .

"(CNN) -- I'm tired of being surrounded by cancer. Over the past two years, I lost my sister, my mother and nearly lost my girlfriend to breast cancer and its complications. It's an epidemic, and it seems we all just accept that as fact. I think it's high time we said: enough. My lifelong friend Bill Couzens has been similarly affected by cancer. He has made it his life's mission to change the way we think about this dreaded disease. It's a different way of fighting a war on cancer: Instead of focusing on treatments, drugs and experimental surgeries, it looks at what is going on in our environment and what we are eating, and considers what role those factors might play in the cancer epidemic. It's not a popular place on the spectrum of debate about cancer. Frankly, the corporations that pollute our environment and process our food don't want to go anywhere near the message that comes from LessCancer.org. It is simply not good for business. So I am riding to help people think about what causes cancer. Sure, there is a genetic component to all of this. But that's just part of the story. The other part of the story for me, is a very personal journey. Four-and-a-half months ago, I had an accident that led to the amputation of my left arm. One of my goals for returning to normalcy was to get back on a bicycle -- something that was very important to me before I lost my arm. I probably wouldn't have decided to ride 300 miles over two days without the LessCancer.org event. As a matter fact, if I did, you might think I was a little bit crazy. As it is, a lot of people think it is ill-advised to set the bar so high so soon after my accident. And I've been thinking a lot about why I have been pushing so hard, so soon. Over the past few weeks I have been talking with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta about my recovery. During my time with Sanjay, he repeatedly expressed incredulity over the pace that I have been keeping since I returned to my life minus an arm. He, like so many others, wonders if I'm going too fast and not taking enough time to pause, reflect and grieve. When I stop to think about it, I too wonder if I am ultimately doing myself a disservice. Should I be spending more time taking care of myself? But then I think about how I would feel if I put myself on the sidelines at this point. I would be left wondering what I can do and what I may not be able to do. I simply need to know now. There might be a time bomb of grief ticking inside me that will explode later, but at least I'll know my abilities when that time comes. I also think about the challenges that I have set for myself. Three months after the accident, I was with my longtime friend and colleague Kate Tobin camping on a Denali glacier in Alaska for a story we are doing on climate change. We snowshoed for miles, and I was shooting a lot of video in some very arduous conditions -- including at the bottom of a 15-foot hole in the ice. I had definitely jumped into the deep end of my first big assignment after the accident. I was really nervous about how it might go, but after we had done the trip and we were sitting in the airport for our respective flights home, Kate turned to me and said, ""I didn't see a bit of difference in your performance on this trip."" I could not have asked for better medicine than that. So I guess setting big goals in short order isn't such a bad idea, assuming you reach them. This goal -- 300 miles on a bicycle in two days -- is a reach, to be sure. But I am going to do my best. I have a fallback plan or two, including a tricycle called ""Monomano"" that is ideally suited for a one-armed rider, and a cousin who has a tandem bicycle with a seat reserved for me. If all else fails, there's always the sag wagon for a segment or two. But here's what will keep me pedaling: I will be thinking about my sister, my mother, my ex-mother-in-law, both of my grandmothers, my girlfriend and everyone else I know whom I lost or nearly lost to cancer. Their courage and grace while fighting this disease is an inspiration to me and should be to all of us. Yes, I have a new challenge in my life, but frankly it pales by comparison when I consider what it's like to be caught up in the cancer epidemic. We must find a way to stop it. I am neither a doctor nor a scientist -- although I play the latter on TV! But in reality, what can we do? For me, the answer is to pedal hard and long to Mackinac.","Earlier this year, Miles O'Brien's left arm was amputated after an accident .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Hudson didn't win a People's Choice Award for a performance on Wednesday. But it was her emotional speech for a humanitarian award that highlighted the 2014 edition of the awards show. Hudson accepted the favorite humanitarian award with her sister Julia for the foundation the pair started in the name of Julia's son, Julian D. King, after his 2008 murder. The Hudson sisters' mother and brother were also killed in the crime. Jennifer Hudson said she was inspired by performers and educators she saw as a child. She wants to carry the message on to a new generation, she said, because that inspiration made a difference in her life. ""If they did it, then I can do it, too,"" she said of the work. Hudson's speech was one of the few notable moments at the 2014 People's Choice Awards, which mark the beginning of what the denizens of Tinseltown refer to as ""awards season."" It starts a flurry of kudofests, including Sunday's Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the Grammys and the Oscars. Relive the conversation on our People's Choice Awards blog . The show clocked in at two hours flat, with a number of categories other awards shows might consider biggies -- like favorite movie -- unrevealed during the broadcast. (That one went to ""Iron Man 3,"" by the way.) But nobody can complain about the range of categories. The People's Choice Awards are given for TV shows, movies and music, and there are almost 60 categories. The range was indicated by two people who accepted the Waterford crystal trophies -- one a newcomer to the honors, the other a repeat winner. The former, Britney Spears, may have won her share of MTV Video Music Awards, but she'd never been accepted by the People's Choice Awards until Wednesday. Spears -- who recently put out a new album, ""Britney Jean"" -- was named favorite pop artist. She walked up the stage steps carefully, almost tottering on her heels, and thanked her fans and her management team. If Spears was a newbie at this People's Choice thing, Ellen DeGeneres is an old hand. The talk-show host won her 14th People's Choice Award, named favorite daytime TV host. ""There's nothing better than knowing you make people happy,"" said DeGeneres in accepting the trophy. Bullock dominates . Perhaps the night's biggest favorite was Sandra Bullock, who won favorite movie actress, favorite comedic movie actress and favorite dramatic movie actress. And the winners are ... It must seem ""like I spend lonely Friday nights voting for myself,"" Bullock joked. Justin Timberlake also won, for favorite album (""The 20/20 Experience"") and favorite male artist. A gracious Julianna Margulies accepted one of the trophies for her show, ""The Good Wife,"" which won favorite network TV drama, and another for co-star Josh Charles (favorite dramatic TV actor). Charles, she revealed, had a good excuse for not being at the ceremony: He was on his honeymoon in Thailand. The awards actually started before the broadcast. The first trophy was handed out on the red carpet as stars' entrances streamed over the Internet. It went to Netflix's ""Orange Is the New Black"" in an appropriate category: favorite streaming series. Later on the carpet, favorite cable TV drama went to ""The Walking Dead"" and Ian Somerhalder (""The Vampire Diaries"") accepted an award for best sci-fi/fantasy TV actor. Broad jokes and absurdity . The show formally began in time-honored awards show fashion: with an overlong sketch. This one featured a number of nominees, as well as hosts Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs in character on the set of their show, ""2 Broke Girls."" The sketch was followed with the hosts on stage at Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre making a number of broad jokes. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who will host the Golden Globes on Sunday, should have nothing to worry about. Watch ""People's Choice"" hosts make Conan happy over accidental boob grab . But for all the absurdity, the People's Choice Awards do offer a snapshot of what's popular. The show was created in 1975 by producer Bob Stivers. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble took over production in the early 1980s and still sponsors the show. Some categories change from year to year; one year featured a Nice 'n Easy Fans Favorite Hair. After many years relying on Gallup Polls, the People's Choice Awards took a new tack in 2005. The nominations are now based on sales, industry ratings, box-office grosses, social media data and votes from peopleschoice.com. According to the hosts, 700 million votes were cast. As Stephen Colbert observed in a taped bit, the People's Choice Awards aren't given out by ""some elite academy of out-of-touch plutocrats."" Colbert, incidentally, won favorite late-night talk show host. ""(The) People's Choice is one of my favorites, because it's the people choosing their favorite shows and their favorite movies,"" said actress Malin Akerman. Nina Dobrev of ""The Vampire Diaries"" agreed. ""It kind of is the ultimate award,"" she said.

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama and his administration make their case for a military strike against Syria, officials from the president on down worry the regime's chemical weapons stockpiles could eventually endanger America's friends. ""If fighting spills beyond Syria's borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel,"" the president said in his speech to the nation Tuesday night. The administration and its allies are careful to make sure the case to launch military action against Syria is not seen as being solely motivated by the desire to protect America's closest friend in the region: Israel. Is the CIA arming Syrian rebels? As part of its effort to build support for its position, the administration has reached out to American-Jewish leaders and groups, several sources familiar with the effort confirmed to CNN. With the holiest days of the Jewish calendar being observed -- Yom Kippur begins at sundown on Friday -- the White House has had several conference calls with hundreds of rabbis just as they are readying the content of their sermons. Obama participated in a previously scheduled call two weeks ago in which Syria was a major topic, and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes took part in a special call Tuesday with 700 rabbis solely on Syria. Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly, helped organize Tuesday's session with Rhodes. She told CNN she solicited questions from the participating rabbis who mostly wanted to ask about the ""complex moral and ethical concerns"" of the Syria issue, such as the possible unintended consequences. ""That is what the rabbis were looking for -- more details about how they are addressing"" those questions since Syria is going to be a major theme of their holiday sermons. ""This is not an Israel issue,"" Schonfeld said. ""The Jewish community is always concerned about issues in the Middle East as we ought to be."" However, Israel and the impact of Syria are part of the unspoken equation. One argument made by the administration centers on Iran -- concerns about its nuclear capabilities and how strongly the United States is willing to push Iran are major points of interest for the Jewish community and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""A failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction and embolden Assad's ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path,"" the president said Tuesday evening. Putin slaps down Obama, challenges U.S. exceptionalism . The Iran question also motivated several groups to call for congressional action. About 250-300 activists from the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC descended on Washington on Tuesday, visiting 300 congressional offices, an AIPAC source told CNN. ""This critical decision comes at a time when Iran is racing toward obtaining nuclear capability. Failure to approve this resolution would weaken our country's credibility to prevent the use and proliferation of unconventional weapons and thereby greatly endanger our country's security and interests and those of our regional allies,"" AIPAC said in its statement last week. Now that the White House has asked for a delay in any congressional vote as it pursues a possible diplomatic resolution, there is not the same urgency to help the administration build support. AIPAC has put its lobbying effort on hold for now, an AIPAC source told CNN. Another major influential group, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, also weighed in. ""Failing to take action would damage the credibility of the U.S. and negatively impact the effort to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability,"" read a statement released from the conference last week. All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks . Sensitive to any criticism about why they are acting, community leaders insist Israel and its fate are not the reason. ""The decision we reached was not because of outside pressure,"" Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the conference, told CNN, adding American security concerns because of the violation of norms could be ""dangerous in the future."" It ""was not because of Israel....or pressure from Israel."" For its part, Israel has avoided publicly discussing the possible votes in Congress on a resolution to give the president authority to strike so as not to be seen as trying to influence the outcome. Also, Jewish activists tell CNN that the history of the holocaust, the idea of a country gassing its own citizens, is a powerful motivator to help push the administration's case. While many of the president's allies in Congress have been reluctant to support military action, he did get some support from one of his fiercest critics. Nevada billionaire and major Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, a major supporter of Israel, told National Journal, ""He is our commander in chief, whether we like what he says politically or not."" Adelson, who donated more than $100 million to Republican causes in last year's election, added, ""I would be willing to help out the administration, because I believe it's the right thing to do. He is our only-we don't have any other commander in chief.""","Israel's fear of chemical weapons attacks is fueling increased conversations .

"(CNN) -- Lauryn Hill told the judge who sentenced her to prison that she planned to pay her taxes; it was just a question of when. The judge reminded her that citizens don't get to choose when to pay the government just before ordering her to spend three months in a federal prison. The Grammy-winning singer must report to prison on July 8 to begin serving the sentence for failure to pay federal income taxes for three years, followed by three months of home confinement and a year of supervised probation, the judge said. Hill must also pay penalties and taxes still owed and a $60,000 fine. Hill pleaded guilty last year to three counts of failing to file tax returns on more than $1.8 million between 2005 and 2007. The artist appeared Monday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, for sentencing. Hill told the judge she lives ""very modestly"" considering how much money her music -- she has sold 16 million records -- earned for other people. ""Someone did the math, and it came to around $600 million,"" she said. ""And I sit here before you trying to figure out how to pay a tax debt? If that's not like enough to slavery, I don't know."" ""This wasn't a life of jet-setting glamour,"" she said. ""This was a life of sacrifice with very little time for myself and my children."" Hill releases new music . The income in question was mostly from music and film royalties paid to companies she owned between 2005 and 2008, according to the U.S. attorney's office. ""Although Hill pleaded guilty to charges specifically related to those tax years, her sentence also takes into account additional income and tax losses for 2008 and 2009 -- when she also failed to file federal returns -- along with her outstanding tax liability to the state of New Jersey, for a total income of approximately $2.3 million and total tax loss of approximately $1,006,517,"" the prosecutor said. Hill's lawyer, Nathan Hochman, told CNN that Hill has fully paid her taxes. ""I think the judge gave a fair and reasonable sentence,"" Hochman said. Her lack of a prior criminal record and the fact that she has six minor children helped, he said. ""I think the government has let a number of celebrities off and never criminally prosecuted them, Willie Nelson being at least one example,"" he said. ""I think that the court took that into account as well. Ms. Hill did not get a slap on the wrist and let off with just paying a certain amount of money but has had to go through this entire criminal prosecution."" Hill also used her sentencing to talk about her music. ""I didn't make music for celebrity status,"" she told the court. ""I made music for artistic and existential catharsis, which was not just necessary for myself but it was also necessary for the generations of oppressed people who hadn't had their voices expressed like I was able to do it. Music is not something I do from 9 to 5. It's a state of being, and like a doctor who delivers babies, I'm on call all the time because that's the kind of work this is."" Hill revealed in a message posted to her Tumblr account last month that she's been working on new music. ""It has been reported that I signed a new record deal, and that I did this to pay taxes. Yes, I have recently entered into an agreement with Sony Worldwide Entertainment, to launch a new label, on which my new music will be released,"" Hill wrote. ""And yes, I am working on new music."" Her fans have been waiting for new music from her since her 1998 solo album, ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.""

"(CNN) -- A day after world No. 1 Serena Williams suffered one of the worst losses of her career at the WTA Finals, second-ranked Maria Sharapova wasn't that much better. Sharapova's hopes of reaching the semifinals in Singapore -- not to mention overtaking Williams as the year-end No. 1 -- are hanging by a thread following a 6-3 6-2 defeat to Petra Kvitova on Thursday. But Williams rebounded in Thursday's last match by crushing an out of sorts Eugenie Bouchard 6-1 6-1. Kvitova famously beat Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2011 to open her grand slam account but the Czech had lost five in a row to the U.S.-based Russian. Sharapova hit six double faults and was broken five times as she fell to 0-2 in the White Group. Never one for excuses, she refused to blame the result on fatigue two days after Caroline Wozniacki outlasted her in a grueling three-hour contest. ""I don't feel tired,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be part of this event. ""It's easy to sit here and say, 'Yeah, I'm tired.' But that's not the way I feel or the way that I choose to speak."" Kvitova improved to 1-1 while the resurgent Wozniacki remained a perfect 2-0 after earlier topping Agnieszka Radwanska 7-5 6-3. Sharapova -- who won her lone year-end title 10 years ago -- must now beat the 1-1 Radwanska on Friday to have any chance of advancing. But even a win won't guarantee a spot in the semifinals. For Sharapova to become the year-end No. 1, she now has to win the tournament and hope Williams doesn't make the final. ""I still have a match ahead of me, and I will do my best to finish it on a good note,"" Sharapova said. ""That's the only thing I can ask of myself."" Simona Halep routed Williams 6-0 6-2 in the Red Group on Wednesday, prompting the 18-time grand slam winner to say she was ""embarrassed"" with her performance. She was far better versus a Bouchard who has done little since reaching the Wimbledon final. ""Yesterday was tough for me but I had to put it behind me,"" Williams was quoted as saying by the WTA. ""My coach really helped me out and to focus on today, telling me that I'm still in the tournament, even though I felt like I was out of it after such a tough loss."" Bouchard escaped a 0-40 hole on serve in the first game but then lost 11 consecutive games to trail 6-1 5-0. The Canadian finished with an 0-3 record and didn't claim a set. If Ana Ivanovic doesn't beat Halep -- who has already qualified for the semifinals -- in straight sets Friday, Williams and Halep progress to the last four.","Maria Sharapova loses to Petra Kvitova in straight sets at the WTA Finals .

"(CNN) -- China's Olympic adventure may be over, but new age chanteuse Sa Dingding is one global export that in many ways echoes the Beijing Olympic fantasy of ""One World. One Dream."" Sa Dingding's music should find a home on the iPods of millions of chill-out world music fans. Born to a Mongolian mother and Han Chinese father, she sings in Mandarin, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and the rare dialect of Lagu, while fusing chill-out beats and floaty instrumentation played on zither, horse head fiddle and bamboo flute. Already hugely popular in China, she has been finding similar success farther afield: Her first album sold 2 million copies in Southeast Asia, and she has appeared on MTV. Earlier this year she won a BBC Radio 3 World Music Award as well as performing at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Her linguistic skills and musicianship were honed from a young age. Born in Inner Mongolia in 1983, she spent three years until the age of 6 with her grandmother, living a nomadic life in northern China, where her imagination and creativity were allowed to roam free. ""We actually lived in a small city between grassland and the big city. In spring time, we move to the grassland. And in winter time, we moved back to the city,""she told CNN's Talk Asia. ""The whole memory of my childhood is in one word: Play. I just played everywhere on the grassland. And there a lot of interesting things happened which affected the ... life of mine."" Later she became a student of Buddhism and yoga as well as becoming a multi-instrumentalist, releasing her first album at the age of 18. Melding different musical cultures and ethnic influences, notably Tibetan, has also caused a certain amount of discussion, especially on her own position toward the status of Tibet within China. ""From a musician's point of view, Tibetan culture and its music cannot be seen as an isolated subject... lots and lots of other ethnicities have added their colors on the Tibetan culture. So I see the Tibetan culture nowadays as an integral part of the greater Chinese culture,"" she said. Aiming to avoid controversy, organizers of the Glastonbury festival dropped her from this year's lineup. ""I don't quite understand the reason behind [it]. To me, art and music really belong to the whole world and they shouldn't be limited by boundaries. So I really hope that I could join Glastonbury next year,"" she said. Until then further explorations in language and music beckon, and there have been recent collaborations with house music DJ Paul Oakenfold and French chill-out duo Deep Forest in Europe. ""It's very amazing because when I had to return to China, they drove me to the airport and told me: 'Life is full of miracles. When you first arrived here, these three songs didn't exist. But now you're leaving, and we have three wonderful new songs.'""","Half-Mongolian, half-Chinese musician mixes ethnic influences with chill-out beats .

"(CNN) -- On June 4 this year, it will have been 20 years since I have seen Beijing, the city in which I spent much of my youth and attended university. It will have been 20 years since I saw my parents. My parents are older. I hear their health is not what it was, but it is something they take pains not to trouble me with. I hear Beijing is much changed. I hear China is much changed. Wu'er Kaixi has been living in exile outside of China since 1989. One thing has not changed. Many of us are still in exile and cannot go home. This is an odd thing, if you really think about it. Last year, amid much pomp and ceremony, China held the 2008 Olympics. In the same year, China conducted its first space walk. In the same year, it overhauled its property laws, allowing far greater rights of ownership than China has seen since the communist revolution. This year, amid a financial crisis of the kind the world has not seen since the Great Depression of 1929, the world looks to China as the motor of possible economic revival. Yet China -- unlike other nations that aspire to international recognition and respect -- still imprisons and exiles those with dissenting views. The pity of this for me is that dissenting opinions have been behind every step of China's long journey to the place it now prides itself on occupying. Sacrifices were made to bring about the end of the Qing imperial dynasty and usher in a nationalist government in 1911. The student movement of May 4, 1919, against the Treaty of Versailles, which ceded German rights to Shandong province to Japan, initiated the nationalist, populist movement that arguably led to the rise of the Communist Party and the liberation of China from foreign control. Equally, it was internal pressure within China that compelled the ruling Chinese Communist Party to move from a position of insularity to what it is today - a voice that has authority in the international arena. China has seen enormous changes since May and June of 1989, when the students of Beijing stood up and called on the Beijing government to make changes. The movement emerged largely out of a sense of frustration with a system amid unique circumstances - the death of a politician who was seen as more sympathetic to reform than most and ahead of a historic visit by then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It was a movement that was born out of a yearning for an end to official corruption and a stifling system that provided no opportunities to the country's best educated. But it became a wider call for change, when workers' unions and common people joined it. Five months after the Tiananmen student movement was put down with live ammunition in Beijing on June 4, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed. Early the following year -- in 1992 -- Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping embarked on what is now known as the Southern Tour. In the relatively freewheeling Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen, he reiterated a dormant catchphrase of the 1980s, ""To get rich is glorious,"" and effectively initiated a new era for China. This new China is the only China that most foreigners who do business with the world's potentially biggest market know. But the only China I truly know is the one I was exiled from - and it was a China where you could not buy Nike or have a quiet drink in a bar, it was a China of empty department stores and streets thronging with people in drab Mao suits. To this day, I believe that the people who sacrificed their lives in Beijing in June 1989 had a huge role in transforming the China of my youth into the place it is today, the place that today the world recognizes as China - and hopes will help revive the global economy. I am proud of what China has achieved. I simply wish it had achieved more. It is a personal tragedy for me that, after 20 years, I cannot see my parents or my homeland. But I think it is a far greater tragedy for China that, after 20 years, it cannot openly discuss its recent history, and let its people decide for themselves how and why the world's most populous nation has come to occupy the place it rightfully deserves. To me this says that China may have appeared to have stood up, but in reality it is still sitting down.","Author was a student leader in China in 1989 .

"(CNN) -- Without his input, Bryan Rutberg's Facebook status update -- the way friends track each other -- suddenly changed on January 21 to this frightening alert: . Fears of impostors are increasing as Facebook's membership grows. ""Bryan NEEDS HELP URGENTLY!!!"" His online friends saw the message and came to his aid. Some posted concerned messages on his public profile -- ""What's happening????? What do you need?"" one wrote. Another friend, Beny Rubinstein, got a direct message saying Rutberg had been robbed at gunpoint in London and needed money to get back to the United States. So, trying to be a good friend, Rubinstein wired $1,143 to London in two installments, according to police in Bellevue, Washington. Meanwhile, Rutberg was safe at home in Seattle. Rubinstein told CNN he misses the money, but it's perhaps more upsetting to feel tricked by someone who impersonated his friend on Facebook, a social-networking site where millions of friends converse freely online. ""It's an invasion of your whole privacy, who your friends are,"" he said.  Watch Rutberg talk about his Facebook page being hacked » . While reports of extortion and false impersonation have been common in phony phone calls and fake e-mails, similar fraud hasn't been reported on Facebook until recently. Now a number of complaints are surfacing. In response to the trend, the Better Business Bureau in late January issued a warning on its Web site, intended for Facebook's 150 million users: know who your friends are and keep your sensitive information private. In the Seattle case, a hacker appeared to steal Rutberg's identity to get money from his friends by toying with their emotions. In Wisconsin, police accuse an 18-year-old man of posing as a woman on Facebook to get high school boys to send him naked photos of themselves.  Watch 18-year-old accused in Facebook case » . Anthony Stancl, of New Berlin, Wisconsin, allegedly used the naked photos he had solicited to force the young men into sex acts with him, according to a criminal complaint. Stancl was arrested on 12 felony complaints, including sexual assault of a child younger than 16 and possession of child pornography, the complaint says. CNN left multiple messages for Stancl's attorney but did not receive a response. Stancl is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail and has no previous criminal record, according to CNN affiliate WISN. There are primarily two ways to stay safe on Facebook, said Jim Lewis, director of the technology and policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. First, make sure your computer anti-virus programs are up to date; and tell online companies you want better privacy protection, he said. In a statement, Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN that impersonation schemes affect fewer than 1 percent of Facebook's 150 million users. He would not comment on whether the rate of such incidents is increasing, but said any increase in the total number of impersonations could be due to the fact that the site is growing by 600,000 users per day. ""In many cases, the scammer has added a new contact e-mail to attempt to maintain control of the account,"" Schnitt said in a prepared statement. ""To combat this, we're instituting changes that will better notify users when their account is modified and empowering them to reverse these changes."" Rutberg, the Seattle man who had his Facebook page hacked, said he worked with the site to shut down his profile within a day. It was back up in a week, he said. All Internet users should be aware their identities can be compromised, and ""every user of the Web should be better educated,"" Rutberg said. Like other types of Internet fraud, Facebook impersonation cases are difficult to solve and costly to pursue, said Officer Greg Grannis, spokesman for the Bellevue Police Department in Washington. ""We are not investigating this case,"" he said, noting that a report on the case had been filed with his office. ""It is pretty much at a dead end."" Because the money went to London, it would be nearly impossible to send officers out to investigate the case, he said. Facebook says it is taking measures to reduce impersonations. The popular site also offers these preventative tips for those who want to take the security of their online profile into their own hands: . • Be suspicious of anyone -- even friends -- who ask for money over the Internet. Verify their circumstances independently, either by calling them directly, or checking with mutual friends. • Choose a strong password and use unique credentials for each of your Web accounts. Facebook says hackers tap into one site and then try to reuse passwords on others. • Use an up-to-date browser that features an anti-phishing blacklist. • Use and run anti-virus software on your computer. • Reset your Facebook password if you suspect your account has been compromised. • Have more than one contact e-mail address. This will help if one of them is hacked.","Media reports of impersonation on Facebook are increasing .

"(CNN) -- In his strongest words to date, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, tried to quash talk that he would allow another government shutdown if he becomes Senate majority leader next year. ""Of course not. Remember me? I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns,"" McConnell told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. ""It's a failed policy,"" he said of shutdowns. Earlier this month, Politico reported that, if selected majority leader, McConnell plans to tell the president to accept bills reining in the administration's policies or veto them and risk a government shutdown. Last year's government shutdown was hardly a popular event, and McConnell's Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, pounced on the story. ""Senator Gridlock's shutdown promise will hurt Kentucky small businesses,"" screamed a Grimes campaign press release. McConnell opposed the last shutdown, fueled by a strategy from his fellow Republican Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to only fund the government by defunding Obamacare, which passed the GOP-led House but had no chance in the Senate. The shutdown backfired on Republicans, and after the government reopened, McConnell made clear he did not intend to go through it again, citing a Kentucky saying on the Senate floor: ""There's no education in the second kick of a mule."" Still, McConnell is vowing to try to roll back Obama regulations that Republicans loathe, especially EPA rules on coal that Kentuckians see as harmful to their coal-rich economy. He says he plans to do that, if the GOP takes control of the Senate in the midterm elections, by attaching those changes to spending bills as they move through Congress. ""One of the powers of Congress is to direct spending, and we've had an abuse of bureaucracy across the board. It's been particularly bad here in Kentucky with EPA and the coal industry, that needs to have some directions from Congress,"" McConnell told CNN. ""The reason Harry Reid won't allow votes on coal in the Senate is he is afraid it will pass, in other words it would actually pass with Democratic votes. We're going to have those kind of votes next year if I'm majority leader,"" said McConnell. He again underscored he has no intention of taking that strategy all the way to a government shutdown -- noting he is often the veteran legislator who comes in at the last minute negotiate a way out with Democrats. ""I'm the guy that's gotten us out of the shutdowns that some of our members have pushed us into in the past,"" said McConnell. But he also cautioned, ""That does not mean that you should send the president a total blank check with no restrictions at all on how the money is spent.""","Mitch McConnell says shutdowns are ""failed policy""

"(CNN) -- Judging solely by the headlines, one might conclude that China's economy is finally starting to hit a wall. After several decades of near double-digit annual growth, gross domestic product rose by a relatively cool 7.5% in this year's first half. Property prices are down. So is investment in factory capacity and real estate. But companies that interpret slower GDP growth to mean that business opportunities in China and other emerging markets will begin to fade are making a serious mistake. The consumer class is still growing rapidly in key emerging markets, and the competition from savvy, extremely capable domestic companies is intensifying. In China's case, the lower GDP growth rate actually reflects an important structural shift in the economy -- from growth that is driven by extraordinarily high fixed investment fueled by loans from government-owned banks to growth that is driven by private consumption. This transition has been a top goal of the Chinese leadership as it seeks more balanced and sustainable economic growth. China illustrates an important phenomenon found in many emerging markets. What many gloomy economic reports miss is that private consumption continues to rise. This is fueled by steady, rapid growth in the country's middle-class and affluent households, which in China we at The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) regard as having annual disposable incomes of at least $12,500. Since 2010, people living in middle-class and affluent households surged from 10% of China's population to 25%. In just another three years, this share is projected to leap to 35%, according to BCG analysis. Some of the sharpest consumption growth in China is occurring among the upper middle class, which we classify as households with annual disposable household incomes of $25,000 to $50,000. The population in this income segment has been has been rising 12% annually. Astonishingly, Chinese upper middle class are projected to account for 5% of global consumption by 2020. These consumers are the sweet spot for many international companies because they tend to sharply accelerate their consumption in such product categories as automobiles, premium personal-care products, fresh foods, financial services, and travel. While companies like the e-commerce giant Alibaba generate the most buzz, it is only one of many innovative companies prospering from the rapid growth of China's middle class. At BCG, we have been tracking a particularly impressive group of hard-charging competitors that we refer to as ""local dynamos"" -- emerging market-based companies that are staying home and conquering their domestic markets. The dynamos move at breathtaking speed, have formidable business models for catering to local consumers, are highly adaptable and are remarkably adept at taking advantage of digital technologies. They have averaged compound annual revenue growth of 28% annually over the past four years, compared with 5% annual growth among S&P 500 companies. Eleven of the 50 dynamos that we identified globally in a recent report are consumer goods companies -- more than from any other sector. This reflects the opportunities created by surging consumption in emerging markets. Ten of the 50 are based in China. They span sectors from banking and food retailing to consumer electronics. Home Inns & Hotels Management illustrates how Chinese dynamos can operate successfully while moving at warp speed. Home Inns saw a huge opportunity in the underserved and highly fragmented market for budget hotels. From 2008 to 2013, it increased its number of hotels from 500 to more than 2,000, in part through an aggressive strategy of franchising. It also boosted the number of cities served from fewer than 100 to 300. With revenues of $1 billion in 2013, Home Inns controls nearly 25% of China's branded economy-hotel segment. Xiaomi, another dynamo, demonstrates the digital prowess of China's new breed of consumer-product companies. Xiaomi relies entirely on e-commerce to sell its affordable smart phones, which are priced at between $100 and $300. To reach China's Internet-crazed youth, Xiaomi uses a variety of popular social media to extensively market its products and solicit customer feedback, which it incorporates when designing and improving its devices. After just three years in operation, Xiaomi reached $5 billion in revenue in 2013 and sold more smartphones in China -- nearly 19 million -- than Apple. Xiaomi passed Samsung in the second quarter of 2014 as China's top smartphone brand. Even if companies have little interest in the China market, the local dynamos should be on their radar because they are potential future global competitors. A number of companies on BCG's 2014 list of ""global challengers"" -- fast-growing companies based in emerging markets that are becoming global leaders or have the potential to do so -- have followed the path of leveraging their dominance in domestic markets to go global. Twenty-nine of the 100 challengers on the 2014 list are Chinese, including appliance maker Haeir Group, automaker Geely International, and medical device producer Mindray Medical International. Prominent examples from other emerging markets are Chilean wine maker Concho y Toro, Chinese appliance marker Haier Group, Mexican cellular phone giant America Movil, Philippines fast-food conglomerate Jolibee, and Indian vehicle companies Bajaj Auto and Mehindra & Mehindra. Whether one sees China and other emerging markets as the world's biggest growth opportunities -- or as the source of potential threat -- don't let slower GDP statistics distract you into pulling back.

"(CNN) -- Mad cow disease, SARS and now swine flu: Some diseases grab the headlines. But thousands of people worldwide suffer from very rare conditions, many of which few people have ever heard of. England's King George III may have suffered from porphyria, a disorder that affects the nervous system. From the Alice in Wonderland syndrome that might have inspired Lewis Carroll, to the disease that may have sent an English King mad, we take a look at some of these obscure illnesses. Morgellons . According to the Morgellons Research Foundation, crawling, biting and stinging sensations and the emergence of strange blue, black or red fibers from the skin characterize a disease that nearly 14,000 people suffer from, according to the Foundation. This is often accompanied by exhaustion, short-term memory loss, joint pain and changes in vision. The condition was named Morgellons in 2002 by a mother who believed her two-year-old son was suffering from the disease. The name comes from a 17th century skin condition found in France, in which children died after the emergence of 'dark hair.' However, there is much debate over whether the condition actually exists. In March 2008, the Journal of Dermatologic Therapy reported that most doctors believe it to be form of delusion, in which sufferers falsely believe they are infected with parasites. Consequently, the fibers in the skin are thought to be textile-based, picked up by oozing scabs resulting from more common conditions such as eczema or scabies. The U.S. based Center For Disease Control and Prevention recently announced it would investigate the disease after an increased number of inquiries from the public. See photos of people living with rare diseases » . Progeria . Progeria is congenital, meaning a defect or damage to a fetus. Sufferers of this fatal illness have a striking appearance resembling premature ageing, but die at an average age of 13. Profound growth delays begin at between nine and 24 months, leading to abnormal facial developments such as a disproportionately small face, bulging, prominent eyes and an underdeveloped jaw. By the age of two, hair from the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes is lost. The U.S. National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD)says sufferers eventually lose the layer of fat beneath the skin and, in time, elasticity is lost in artery walls, leading to fatality via heart attack or stroke in 90 percent of sufferers. Water allergy . Known to have ever affected only 30 people, water allergy or ""aquagenic urticaria"" is extremely rare, but its existence has been confirmed by the Medical Review Board. Sufferers appear to be allergic to water. It usually occurs late in life and often as a consequence of a hormonal imbalance brought about by giving birth. A case emerged in the UK in April this year, leaving a 21-year-old mother unable to drink water or get caught in the rain because her skin develops a painful burning rash. She can shower for a maximum of 10 seconds per week and can drink only Diet Coke. It is not strictly an allergy but a hypersensitivity to the ions found in non-distilled water. Foreign accent syndrome . Sufferers of foreign accent syndrome inexplicably find themselves talking in an unrecognizable dialect. Only 60 cases have ever been recorded. Doctors initially dismissed it as a psychiatric problem, but in 2002, scientists at Oxford University, England, observed that sufferers shared the same brain abnormalities, which led to changes in speech pitch, lengthening of vowel sounds and other irregularities. According to the Journal of Neurolinguistics, sufferers don't necessarily have to have been exposed to the accent they adopt: their new voice is not, strictly speaking, a foreign accent, but the changes in speech often bear a striking resemblance to other world accents. The first case concerned a Norwegian woman in 1941, who developed a strong German accent and was ostracized from her community. Laughing Death . Laughing Death, more commonly known as Kuru, was exclusive to the tribal Fore people of New Guinea. The disease, which was characterized by sudden bursts of maniacal laughter, hit the headlines in the 1950s and drew in doctors from around the world. U.S. and Australian physicians observed men and women with shaking limbs, which subsided with rest, but a month to three months later sufferers would begin to sway and stumble, lose the ability to stand, become cross-eyed and lose the power of coherent speech before eventually dying. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reported that tests on the deceased showed death had been caused by the emergence of holes in the brain, known as ""swiss-cheesing."" Eventually the U.S. physician Carleton Gajdusek worked out that the infection was being passed on through the village custom of eating family members after death. When cannibalism was eliminated, the epidemic came to an end. In 1976, Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) In 1938, when American Harry Eastlack was five-years-old, he broke his leg. The fracture didn't set properly, his hip and knee stiffened up and, bizarrely, bone growths developed on the muscles of his thigh. By his mid 20s, the vertebrae of his back had begun to fuse together. When he died aged 39 in 1973, he was able to move only his lips. He suffered from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare disease affecting some 1 in 2 million people, in which the body's tendons and ligaments undergo a strange metamorphosis, essentially a transformation into bone. The condition is congenital and characterized by a malformation of the big toe that is present at birth. Eastlack donated his skeleton to research of the disease, and it is on display at the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. The International FOP Association continues to research this extremely rare condition. Alice in Wonderland syndrome . According to the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, sufferers of Alice in Wonderland syndrome perceive objects as being far smaller than they are. The condition, also known as micropsia or Lillliput sight, can also affect the sense of hearing, touch and perceptions of one's own body image.  Learn more about rare disorders » . The syndrome is associated with migraine headaches and named after Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in which Alice goes through many bizarre experiences similar to those which might be experienced by a micropsia sufferer. The fact that Carroll suffered from migraines is well documented, and some speculate that his suffering may have prompted many passages in the work. Porphyria . Purple urine and feces make porphyria infamous, as does the fact that the ""mad"" 18th century English King George III may have suffered from it. Porphyria leads to complications in the production of 'heme,' a protein vital to red blood cells, and affects the skin and nervous system. Attacks lead to abdominal pain, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and constipation. NORD lists other symptoms including increasing sensitivity to the sun, itching and swelling. Increased hair growth on the forehead may also occur. Toxins resulting from the failed heme production can affect the coloring of other areas, especially after exposure to sunlight. Sometimes the teeth and fingernails can adopt a reddish appearance. It is these toxins that lead to the dark urine and feces. Mary Queen of Scots, Vincent Van Gogh, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon may have suffered from this disease. Pica . The magpie, Latin name pica, will eat anything, and so will sufferers of pica syndrome. Almost always pregnant women or children, sufferers develop an appetite for non-nutritive substances, such as paint, clay, plaster or dirt, or alternatively items that are more commonly considered to be food ingredients, such as raw rice, flour or salt. It can only be considered pica if the appetite persists for over a month and the sufferer is of an age where eating these objects is considered developmentally inappropriate. Medical researchers have tenuously linked pica with a mineral deficiency, but according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, experts have yet to nail down a real, firm cause or cure for this strange disorder. Moebius syndrome . Moebius is extremely rare, genetic and characterized by complete facial paralysis. Sufferers cannot close their eyes, look from side to side, or form facial expressions. Limb abnormalities such as clubbed feet and missing fingers are often also present. According to the Moebius Syndrome Foundation, most cases are isolated, with no notable family history, and sufferers go on to lead long and healthy lives. Family members often learn to recognize body language, posture and vocal tone as communicators of emotion, and sometimes claim they forget the person has facial paralysis altogether.","A look at some of the rarest diseases in the world .

"(CNN) -- In 1974 the Mediterranean island of Cyprus was divided in two. A coup backed by the Greek government was met with a Turkish military invasion, partitioning the country between the Turkish-Cypriot north and Greek-Cypriot south. One of the most enduring symbols of the divide remains the resort of Varosha, an abandoned district of the ancient city of Famagusta that has come to act as a no-man's-land between north and south. Controlled by the Turkish military, the area's glistening beaches and apartment blocks remain off-limits to non-military personnel. At its peak, Varosha had 25,000 residents and 12,000 hotel rooms, attracting guests from across Europe and the Middle East. Today, all lie empty and in a state of disrepair. ""It was one of the centers of tourism of the Mediterranean Sea,"" laments Oktay Kaylap, the Turkish Cypriot mayor of Famagusta. ""It used to be very palatial but now it's for neither Greek nor Turkish Cypriots."" A group of Famagusta residents and Varosha citizens in exile hope to change that. New York based film-maker, Vasia Markides, whose Greek-Cypriot mother was forced to leave Varosha, has founded the Famagusta eco-city project -- a grass roots movement led by citizens from both communities. Their goal is to rebuild the city and transform the resort-town into a cultural, economic and environmental hub that can generate its own energy from renewable sources and grow its own food. Although the idea is still in the embryonic stages, Markides has been encouraged by the early response from both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The city's Greek Cypriot mayor-in-exile, Alexis Galanos, and Turkish Cypriot mayor, Kaylap -- who recognize each other's positions -- have pledged to work together towards a future Famagusta metropolis and agreed to form a joint committee to that effect in December last year. Galanos told CNN that the project was ""one of many good ideas of mutual economic development."" Yet he warned that ""under the circumstances the rebuilding of Famagusta can proceed on more simple lines and must try to avoid anything that at the beginning at least appears utopian."" Markides ventures that the regeneration plans could help get the local economy moving again after the difficulties of recent years. ""Because of the economic crisis people were found in a very desperate, difficult situation and now I think more than ever they are willing to compromise and let go of the past in order to build the future together,"" Markides said. ""The eco-city would actually be a really good economic boost for the island because it will bring in a new kind of tourism, high value tourism (and) eco-tourism which didn't exist 40 years ago,"" she added. So far, a number of willing technical experts have been recruited to the Varosha revival cause. Professor Jan Wampler is a recognized specialist in sustainable architecture. He and graduate students from the University of South Florida have completed design ""phase one"" for the eco-city. ""I am very optimistic,"" Wampler said. ""Something has to be done. In this world you can't have so called ghost cities sitting there for 40 years just completely vacant."" ""In this case we have a golden opportunity. In fact I consider it to be the perfect prototype for what the world might follow in the future,"" Wampler added. Energy expert George Lordos, echoed this enthusiasm. ""Famagusta will be the first thing that happens on the ground if there is a comprehensive settlement (between Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities),"" Lordos said. ""The principles of peace, sustainability and permaculture, these are the main principles of the eco-city project,"" he added. For now, Varosha remains sectioned-off from the outside world by armed guards and miles of wire fences. But Lordos is confident a solution to the decade's long stand-off can be found -- an opinion shared by Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, who said Cyprus' new deep-sea energy resources could help unite the island when talking to CNN last month. ""If and when that happens we need to be able to take advantage of redeveloping Varosha as a sustainable destination for tourism,"" Lordos said. Famagusta and former residents of Varosha stand ready to act. Read more: Will Hollywood stars move downtown? Read more: Forest in the sky to transform Milan .

"(CNN) -- Early next month, Casey Rocheteau will pack up the belongings of her Brooklyn flat, say goodbye to friends and set-off for her new home in Detroit, Michigan. The ""Motor City"" was once regarded as the engine room of the U.S. economy but it has fallen upon hard times in recent decades -- or so the popular narrative goes. Now, a new venture which combines housing and the literary arts is hoping to paint the modern story of the Detroit in a more positive light. Rocheteau is the first person to receive a home completely for free as part of the Detroit Write A House program. The non-profit project is buying up and renovating foreclosed homes using crowd-sourced funds in the city's Banglatown district. It then gives them to promising literary prospects in the fields of fiction, non-fiction, screen writing, poetry and journalism among others. All Rocheteau has to do on her end of the deal is to pay fees for insurance and taxes, take part in local literary readings and promise to live in the house for at least two years. The-29-year-old originally from Cape Cod was selected by judges from a host of other applicants for the house on the strength of her poetry that ""breaks through"" and addresses ""some of the more frightening"" aspects of racism. While delighted, she says she is still pinching herself to make sure she's not dreaming and has actually won a new home. ""I saw this come up and I was a little bit skeptical as it seemed a bit too crazy that they were giving away free houses,"" Rocheteau told CNN. ""(But) I love the house and I'm very excited to actually get there and start living there. Laying the foundations . Write A House is the brainchild of Toby Barlow, a writer and creative director at advertising agency Team Detroit, and Sarah Cox, a writer and journalist originally from New York, who have been collaborating on the idea since 2012. The pair hope not only to improve Detroit's neighborhoods by filling out boarded up properties but to change outside perceptions of life in the city as well. ""As a freelance writer I've found it to be a great place as there is so much space to cover things. You're not living in a city like New York that has so many journalists in every area,"" Cox said. A problem that has arisen due to the comparative lack of storytellers in Detroit, Cox believes, is that negative stereotypes about life in the city have been allowed to flourish. Rocheteau concurs and points out that Detroit has become a metaphor for American industrial decline -- which she describes as wholly unfair. While Detroit has certainly suffered its fair share of hardship, including filing for bankruptcy in 2013, both Rocheteau and Cox say countering the simplistic narrative of a city in ruins is important in providing perspective. ""In Detroit there are so many stories that need to be told. It doesn't matter whether you end up telling them through poetry or fiction ... there's a lot of inspiring people here,"" Cox said. Moving on up . Tackling the many misconceptions surrounding Detroit and focusing on growing as a writer is for the months and years ahead, however. For now, Rocheteau is preparing to move in to her new home on November 1 and is excited to explore her new community. She said she was intrigued by the eclectic cultural mix of the neighborhood's Bangladeshi and Polish immigrant communities when she visited in September as well as the visual art installations that dot the landscape. The house itself is compact, with one bedroom and one bathroom, and was in a state of disrepair when bought at auction for just $1,000 earlier this year. It has since been renovated by local companies employing young apprentices from across Detroit thanks to a $30,000 donation from Team Detroit and $33,000 raised on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. Write A House's initial success and the positive coverage it has received has also helped attract more donations and sponsors to buy up other houses in the coming months. ""We're planning to do three houses next year,"" Cox said. ""We already own one and are talking about picking up two more."" She added that since the original crowdfunding campaign ""we have attracted grants ... and we've actually received $100,000 from the Knight Foundation (an organization that seeks to promote journalism and the arts)."" ""Crowdfunding was a great way to make it public and get attention by getting little donations. But the housing renovations are expensive and I believe we'll be getting a mix of different grants and funding in the future.""","Detroit project purchases and renovates foreclosed homes before giving them away to aspiring literary talents .

"(CNN) -- Just hours after fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman told police investigators the shooting followed a life-and-death struggle in which the teen told him, ""You're going to die tonight."" Read the written statement from Zimmerman to police about what happened (PDF) The audio of the February 26 interviews, made public late Wednesday, is part of discovery items released by Zimmerman's defense team. The recordings represent the first time Zimmerman is heard giving his account in his own words. Also released were audio and video showing the techniques used by the police department in the investigation: interviews conducted in the days after the shooting, a video of a voice stress test administered to Zimmerman by police and his videotaped re-enactment of the incident for authorities. Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in Martin's February 26 shooting death. Zimmerman has said he shot Martin in self-defense, but Martin's family and civil rights activists across the country said Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, racially profiled Martin and ignored a 911 dispatcher's advice not to follow him. In an interview just after the shooting, Zimmerman told police that the struggle began when Martin ""jumped out from the bushes"" and punched him in the face, knocking him down. ""I started screaming for help. I couldn't see. I couldn't breathe,"" he said. ""He grabbed my head and started hitting it into the sidewalk,"" he said. ""When he started doing that, I slid into the grass to try to get out from under him. ... I'm still yelling for help."" Sanford police chief fired in wake of Trayvon Martin case . Martin, he said, put his hand over Zimmerman's mouth and nose and told him, ""You're going to die tonight."" ""When I slid, my jacket and my shirt came up. ... I felt his hand go down my side, and I thought he was going for my firearm, so I grabbed it immediately, and as he banged my head again, I just pulled out my firearm and shot him."" When he did, he said, Martin, who had been on top of him, fell away and said, ""All right. You got it. You got it."" In another interview, he noted Martin might have said, ""You got me."" More evidence to be released in Trayvon Martin case, judge rules . Zimmerman said in the audio interviews that he was driving to the grocery store that evening when he saw Martin walking in his neighborhood. He said he pulled over and called a police nonemergency number ""to report a suspicious person."" He noted that there had been some burglaries in the area, prompting him to start a neighborhood watch program. He said he had never seen Martin before and thought it odd that although it was raining, ""he was just walking casually, not like he was trying to get out of the rain."" In another police interview on February 29, three days after the shooting, Zimmerman told Sanford, Florida, homicide investigator Chris Serino he also felt the youth was suspicious because he stopped in front of a home Zimmerman had previously called about, a home that was broken into after his reporting another suspicious person. ""Had this person been white, would you have felt the same way?"" Serino asked. ""Yes,"" Zimmerman replied. Prosecutors: Jail phone transcripts show Zimmerman, wife talking in code . As he spoke to the dispatcher, he told police Martin circled his vehicle, but he could not hear whether Martin said anything because his windows were up and he was on the phone. Afterward, he said, he ""lost visual of (Martin)."" At the same time, he said the dispatcher asked him his location. He said he wasn't sure of the name of the street he was on and got out of the vehicle to look for a street sign or an address on a home. The dispatcher asked him if he was following Martin, he said, and he replied that he was ""trying to find out where he went."" The dispatcher told him, ""We don't need you to do that,"" noting an officer was en route, he said. Zimmerman said he was heading back to the vehicle when Martin jumped out, asking him, ""What the f***'s your problem?"" He said he told Martin, ""I don't have a problem,"" but the youth replied, ""Now you have a problem,"" and attacked him. He said he fell backward after being punched in the nose, and ""he was whaling on my head."" Zimmerman told police he yelled for help repeatedly and heard one man say he was going to call 911. ""I screamed 'Help me' probably 50 times, as loud as I could,"" he said. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . In a written statement Zimmerman gave to police, also released late Wednesday, Zimmerman said Martin told him to ""shut the f*** up"" during the struggle. ""Each time I attempted to sit up, the suspect slammed my head into the sidewalk,"" he wrote. ""My head felt like it was going to explode."" He wrote he felt Martin ""reach for my now-exposed firearm"" as the teen threatened his life and cursed at him. A collection of public documents in Trayvon Martin shooting . During the videotaped voice stress test, he seemed to suggest that he wasn't sure he had hit Martin when he fired his gun, saying that he ""thought that he heard the shot and he was giving up"" and that he pushed Martin off of him. ""Either way, I ended up on top of him, straddling him,"" he said, but he claimed he ""felt like (Martin) was hitting me with something in his hands"" so he grabbed the youth's hands to restrain him. Martin was saying something like ""ah, ah,"" and cursing, Zimmerman said, and he told him, ""Stop. Don't move."" Before the voice stress test begins, Zimmerman discusses health insurance with a police officer and mentions he visited the doctor and the psychologist that day. ""I think the psychologist is when it hit me the hardest,"" he said. However, in a February 29 interview, Serino expresses some doubt about Zimmerman's account, noting that many questions remain about the incident. ""The court of public opinion is going to beat up on you a lot,"" Serino said. ""A lot of people don't think that your injuries are consistent with getting into a life-threatening type thing."" Martin, Serino said, ""has no criminal record whatsoever. Good kid. Mild-mannered kid."" In his possession, Serino said, ""we found a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles and about $40 in cash. Not a goon."" He tells Zimmerman he has received an anonymous phone call ""from somebody who gave a different version of events ... more along the lines that you tried to detain him,"" and recounting an argument prior to the shooting. ""You got any problems with black people?"" Serino asked Zimmerman, who replied, ""No, sir."" Serino told Zimmerman authorities can't figure out what would have made Martin ""snap."" Zimmerman said he didn't know what might have enraged the teen. And the investigator expresses doubt that Zimmerman, who had lived in the neighborhood for three years and described himself as head of the neighborhood watch, did not know the names of the three streets in the subdivision. ""To be honest with you, I have a bad memory anyway,"" Zimmerman said, adding that he has attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and takes medication for it.

"(CNN) -- Over the course of his 50-plus years in Hollywood, Jack Nicholson has become the archetype of the star who lives by his own rules. Along the way, the actor known for thwarting convention has revamped the very idea of what it means to be a leading man. Now, that life is on full display as the subject of a new (unauthorized) biography by Marc Eliot, whose ample resume includes works on Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Michael Douglas, Clint Eastwood and Steve McQueen. All the Jack stories are there: his ""overnight"" success in ""Easy Rider"" that was preceded by 19 movies; his unorthodox lifestyle; and his grand appetite -- particularly for food and sex. Here are 10 things you may not know about Nicholson, as gleaned from Eliot's book and CNN's interview with the author. 1. At age 76, the actor allegedly still doesn't know the identity of his real father. According to Eliot, John Nicholson is listed on Jack's birth certificate, but the author writes that the star's actual father was a man named Don Furcillo, ""a sometime musician who played with various pickup bands along the Jersey Shore."" To make family matters even more complicated, Nicholson apparently didn't discover until he was an adult that the woman he thought was his older sister was actually his mother, and the woman he thought was his mother was really his grandmother. All this bears an ironic resemblance to the storyline in ""Chinatown,"" where Faye Dunaway's character belatedly confesses about a mystery girl, ""She's my sister... my daughter. She's my sister and my daughter!"" 2. Nicholson improvised the famous dentist's chair scene in Roger Corman's ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (1960), a performance so memorable it would earn him his first role in a studio film (1960's ""Studs Lonigan""). The entire film was shot in two days on a micro-budget. To save money, Nicholson, Corman and the rest of the filmmaking team vaulted the fences at Charlie Chaplin's old studio in Hollywood, where they filmed without permission, Eliot recounts. Nicholson made over a dozen movies with Corman in the early part of his career. ""Roger Corman is the person most responsible for Jack Nicholson becoming an actor and then a star,"" Eliot told CNN. 3. Nicholson's big break of course came in the role of George Hanson in 1969's ""Easy Rider."" The part was initially to be filled by Rip Torn, until that actor quit after feuding with director and co-star Dennis Hopper. Nicholson's salary: $392 a week. To adopt a Texas twang for the part (and drop his native New Jersey accent), Nicholson listened to tapes of a former President. ""They made him listen to speeches of LBJ over and over again until Jack was able to pick up a few nuances of the accent,"" Eliot said. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1969, and ""Jack was really a complete unknown"" at that point, Eliot said. ""As he walked out of the theater (after the premiere), he knew and everybody in that audience knew that he was going to be a star."" 4. Among Nicholson's most famous roles is the rebellious Randall Patrick McMurphy in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (which won him his first Oscar in 1976). But Eliot writes Nicholson almost lost out on the part to a slew of other stars. Producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz's first choice to play McMurphy ""was Marlon Brando, who immediately said no, then Gene Hackman, who also turned them down,"" Eliot writes. ""So did Burt Reynolds and James Caan."" But Nicholson has turned down his share of roles too, including some that made cinema history -- with other actors portraying them. According to Eliot, these are among the roles Nicholson spurned: . • Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"" • The young priest in ""The Exorcist"" • The lead in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" • The Robert Redford role in ""The Sting"" • The Jack Lemmon role in ""The China Syndrome"" • The Tom Cruise role in ""Rain Man"" • The Martin Sheen role in ""Apocalypse Now"" • Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" • Jay Gatsby in 1974's ""The Great Gatsby"" The Manson connection . 5. Eliot writes that Nicholson was friends with Sharon Tate, who was among the multiple victims of the Manson Family. And when Charles Manson went on trial for the murders in 1970, Nicholson attended the proceedings virtually every day. ""He was fascinated by Manson's persona and the crazy way he looked"" during the trial, Eliot writes. ""Jack ... couldn't get enough of it."" His fascination with prominent trials was not limited to the Manson case, according to Eliot. The author writes that Nicholson also attended the 1977 trial of actress Claudine Longet (Andy Williams' ex-wife), who was accused of killing her lover, ""Spider"" Sabich. ""He always sat in the first row of spectators, usually next to (Andy) Williams, mystified by the lovely face of a woman driven to kill,"" Eliot writes. 6. To judge from Eliot's biography, Nicholson may have bedded more women than any other star (with the possible exception of Warren Beatty). Space does not permit a full listing of his conquests, but Eliot reports they include: . • Veronica Cartwright (his co-star in ""The Witches of Eastwick"") • Lara Flynn Boyle . • Julie Delpy . • Michelle Phillips (of the Mamas and the Papas) • Rebecca Broussard . • Anjelica Huston . • Susan Anspach . • Melanie Griffith . • Jill St. John . • Margaret Trudeau (then the estranged wife of the Canadian Prime Minister) • Christina Onassis (daughter of Aristotle) Eliot describes a particularly voracious period of carousing for Nicholson, when he and friend Michael Douglas were traveling the world to promote ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" ""They stripped and devoured (young women) like peeling shrimp,"" Eliot writes, ""as they romped through England, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Australia."" 7. Nicholson's other love, apart from women, is collecting art. According to Eliot, the actor's collection is worth $100 million, comprised of works by Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Magritte, Bouguereau, Botero and Rodin. How did Nicholson afford all that expensive art? By becoming one of the wealthiest actors in Hollywood. As one of the industry's most sought-after talents, he was able to strike a hard bargain for his services -- demanding and receiving profit participation in the great majority of his films. Jack the Joker . 8. The most lucrative role of Nicholson's career came as the Joker in Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989). The actor's take: somewhere between $60 million and $90 million, according to Eliot. Nicholson might have done the role for nothing, given how much he loved Batman lore. Eliot writes the actor grew up reading Batman comic books and was especially fond of that grinning villain. ""Playing the Joker was not a gag for him,"" Eliot told CNN. ""For Jack, (appearing in 'Batman') was a chance to connect to childhood."" According to Eliot, Nicholson was so taken with the role he shelled out $70,000 to buy his character's ""electrified purple clown outfit."" The famous golf club incident . 9. Many instances of Nicholson's generosity are detailed in the book, but so are his occasional outbursts. None is more famous than the day in February 1994 when he demonstrated his golf swing for the driver of a Mercedes. The mallet in question? A two-iron (graphite shaft). Nicholson pulled it from its bag and smashed the windshield and roof of the Mercedes after the driver allegedly cut him off in traffic. It was a costly encounter. Nicholson settled a civil suit filed by the driver; Eliot cites unnamed sources who peg the payout at $500,000. Has Nicholson retired? 10. The one question the book doesn't answer is whether Nicholson will make another film. He hasn't starred in anything since 2010's ""How Do You Know,"" and a recent unsubstantiated report claimed the actor had retired (CNN previously reached out to Nicholson's agent, Sandy Bresler, for comment on that but did not receive a reply). Eliot told CNN ""retirement"" is a dirty word in Hollywood, because actors, no matter what their age, are always hoping one more great role will come their way. The author told CNN he hopes we haven't seen the last Nicholson performance. ""Hopefully we'll have more of Jack, because you can never have enough.""","Marc Eliot has written an unauthorized biography of Jack Nicholson .

"(CNN) -- I am a medical sociologist, which means I study the health of whole societies. I've spent more than 20 years studying the best possible ways to address alcohol problems in societies -- what works and what doesn't to protect people from harm. I work as a professor in the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and at the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute. This allows me to connect with other scientists who come from very different backgrounds but who want to work together on big problems -- think of a Manhattan Project, only one focused on protecting health through the collaboration of scientists who study everything from tiny cells to entire societies. So three years ago, a pediatric endocrinologist named Rob Lustig walks into my office and asks for my help. Rob tells me that he's finding many connections between the metabolism of fructose (sugar) and ethanol (alcohol) in his work on metabolic functioning, liver damage and the obesity epidemic. Rob runs the obesity clinic at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, where he spends his days trying to help morbidly obese kids who feel hungry all the time. One of the saddest effects of sugar overconsumption is to dampen the natural hormones that tell kids' bodies when they've eaten enough, leading them to feel hungry even as they overeat. Rob says he's also seeing that too much sugar in these kids' diets causes severe liver damage -- they have even started doing liver transplants on some of the kids in his clinic. Fast-forward to today, and here's what we've learned: . -- More people on the planet Earth are dying from chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes than anything else. This is even true for developing countries that have turned a critical page on health: People in those countries are now more likely to die from the ""diseases of affluence"" than from the ""diseases of poverty"" like malaria and cholera. Major risk factors in chronic disease, of course, are alcohol, tobacco and junk food consumption. -- Many of the health hazards of drinking too much alcohol, such as high blood pressure and fatty liver, are the same as those for eating too much sugar. When you think about it, this actually makes a lot of sense. Alcohol, after all, is simply the distillation of sugar. Where does vodka come from? Sugar. -- We may be thinking about obesity and chronic disease in the wrong way. Most experts are worried about sugar because it's ""empty calories"" that make people fat. But what leads to chronic disease is actually something called metabolic syndrome, which can be caused by the toxic effects of sugar. -- Added sugar at the levels consumed by many Americans changes our metabolism -- it raises blood pressure, critically alters the signaling of hormones that turn hunger on and off, and can damage the pancreas and liver. Worldwide consumption of sugar has tripled over the past 50 years, and along with that has come an obesity pandemic. But obesity may just be a marker for the damage caused by the toxic effects of too much sugar. This would help explain why up to 40% of people with the metabolic syndrome -- what leads to diabetes, heart disease and cancer -- are not clinically obese. What should we do about all this? First, we think that the public needs to be better informed about the science of how sugar impacts our health. Second, we need to take what we know about protecting societies from the health harms of alcohol and apply it to sugar. What doesn't work is all-out prohibition -- that's very old-school and often creates more problems than it solves. What does work are gentle ""supply side"" controls, such as taxing products, setting age limits and promoting healthier versions of the product -- like making it cheaper for a person to drink light beer rather than schnapps. The reality is that unfettered corporate marketing actually limits our choices about the products we consume. If what's mostly available is junk food and soda, then we actually have to go out of our way to find an apple or a drinking fountain. What we want is to actually increase people's choices by making a wider range of healthy foods easier and cheaper to get. Turning around obesity and chronic disease will be an uphill political fight, but there's plenty that concerned people can do: . -- Contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Congress to encourage them to take sugar off the Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) list. This is what allows food producers to add as much sugar as they want to the products we eat. -- Support our local, state and federal officials in placing a substantial tax on products that are loaded with sugar. Ask them to use the proceeds to support a wider range of food options in supermarkets and farmer's markets. -- Help protect our kids by getting sports drinks and junk food out of our schools. Ask our school boards to replace those vending machines with good old-fashioned drinking fountains. Ask local officials to control the opening hours and marketing tactics of the junk food outlets surrounding our schools. That way, kids can walk to school without being barraged by advertising for sugary products that taste good but harm their health. We need to remember that many of our most basic public health protections once stood on the same battleground of American politics as sugar policy does today. Simple things like requiring a seat belt and having an airbag in your car to save you in a crash were once huge political battles. Now, we take these things for granted as simple ways to protect the health and well-being of our communities. It's time to turn our attention to sugar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Schmidt.","Researchers seeing similar effects from too much sugar and too much alcohol .
Alcohol is simply the distillation of sugar, she says, and sugar should be taxed and regulated .

"(CNN) -- Legend has it that when the surrealist painter Salvador Dali had to pay for an expensive restaurant meal he would twizzle his famous mustache and arch his eyebrows before beguiling his host into letting him dine for free. The crafty Catalan, it is said, would write out a check for the required amount and sign on the dotted line. Just before handing the payment over, however, he would pull the piece of paper back and pen an elaborate doodle on the opposite side. ""An original from the master Dali. I will never cash this check,"" would inevitably be the reply from the starstruck restaurant owner thrilled to be gifted an artwork that would doubtless be of greater value than the amount on the check itself. By perfecting the magic checkbook technique, Dali would rarely, if ever, have to pay for his dining habits. People might not hoard the recently revealed 100 Norwegian Krone ($15) banknote in the same manner -- but it too is a work of art in its own right. On one side, a giant viking boat makes progress upon a tranquil sea, sails blowing in full glory. On the other, an abstract interpretation of a pixelated ocean ebbs and flows like a game of watery Tetris. Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank, held a competition to design the front and back of the new note, which will come into circulation in 2017. The winning designs, announced earlier in October, were submitted by Norwegian graphic designers The Metric System -- Terje Tonnessen and Snohetto. According to Norges Bank, the winning designs display ""artistic flair"" that emphasize Norway's close relationship with the sea, but are also ""suited to the incorporation of necessary security elements."" These will include machine-readable elements and anti-counterfeiting measures. Such high-tech accoutrements are now a common feature of the most modern banknotes. But art, the aesthetic and items of cultural significance are also a major consideration when designing the latest money. According to the curator of the British Museum's Modern Money Collection, Thomas Hockenhull, the art by itself isn't a particularly reliable security feature given the ""advancement of scanning and printing technology."" ""Those are maintained primarily to preserve public confidence in the note,"" Hockenhull said. But, he added, when combined with complex measures like watermarks, moving color elements and the latest in polymer and paper technology, a detailed image can make forgery more difficult. The Bank of Canada has produced bills in recent years that illustrate this elaborate synergy. Holographic and transparent features accompany state-of-the-art calligraphy that officials claim is nearly impossible to duplicate. Instead of using paper, the newest Canadian notes are made from a polypropylene substrate and feature a large transparent window through which you can see a metallic portrait above a metallic building. Beneath the portrait the word ""Canada"" is also transparent and is slightly raised. Other security features include a smaller frosted window with a maple leaf design, which has a transparent outline and contains hidden numbers only visible when lit up with a small light. Similar plastic and transparent elements can be found on the latest colorful currency from the likes of Guatemala, Australia and Nicaragua, Chile and Malaysia. The United States and United Kingdom, meanwhile, are at the forefront of the most complex paper currencies out there, Hockenhull said. The new British £50 note includes raised ink, contains a metallic thread embedded in the paper, and has a number ""50"" that appears in red and green under ultraviolet light. Among other features, the newest U.S. $100 bill has a 3-D blue ribbon woven into the paper, next to Benjamin Franklin's face. When the note is tilted, images of bells and the number 100 move from side to side, and up and down. The bill also has raised print, a color-changing number 100 in its bottom right corner, and microprinted text on Franklin's collar -- all carefully incorporated to make forgery more difficult. But complex though these designs may be, to our knowledge, a method to counter Dali's magic checkbook has yet to be devised. Look through the gallery at the top of the page to view some of the best examples of banknotes that mix the aesthetic and the latest in anti-counterfeiting measures.","Latest Norwegian banknotes will incorporate complex artwork and designs .

"(CNN) -- Finery and high fashion have long been synonymous with the Royal Ascot race meeting, and this year patrons are being scrutinized to a level which is almost unparalleled in the world of sport. Ascot takes fashion so seriously there are even dress code administrators on hand to assess the thousands of people who descend upon the Berkshire venue, with a strict list of dos and don'ts issued to prevent standards slipping. The Royal Enclosure, where Queen Elizabeth II watches all five days of the meeting, is where the most stringent regulations are enforced -- including a ban on the ever-popular fascinator. No fairytale ending for Queen and Carlton House . To ensure fashion decorum, Royal Ascot's organizers have gone as far as to publish style guides for race goers who will be mingling with British high society at one of the social calendar's most prestigious events. With all eyes fixed on female visitors during Thursday's Ladies' Day, the women's checklist for the Royal Enclosure is detailed. All dresses must be of ""modest"" length -- defined as ""falling just above the knee or longer."" Shorts are a no-no, as are shoulderless dresses. Women are permitted to wear pants, providing the color and material of them matches what is on display above the waistline. The dress code administrators will also be on hand to offer pashminas to any woman who may have misunderstood the regulations. If you are belly dancer it is probably best to give Ascot a wide berth as midriffs must be covered at all times. And if you like to attend sporting events in fancy dress forget it -- pantomime horses are banned. For the gentlemen who enter Royal Ascot's inner sanctum, black or gray morning wear is de rigueur -- shoes, a waistcoat and tie and, of course, a top hat. In the more relaxed grandstand, a suit will ease you past the fashion police. However, if you thought dusting off your cravat for a day at the races was acceptable think again -- such neckwear is strictly verboten. Unbeaten Frankel cruises to Ascot success . ""Horse racing's roots as the 'sport of kings' obviously suggest a pleasure pastime for the elite,"" Willie Walters, the fashion course director at London's Central Saint Martins college of art and design, told CNN. ""In the past this would have been, depending on the monarch, an opportunity for either ostentatious displays or relatively tasteful, yet expensive, modesty. ""The code would denote respect for the monarchy, particularly when they were actually present."" The dress code also helps to define the class superiority of the crowd and keep out the great unwashed. ""Any prestigious occasion will have a code to reflect the status of the racegoers regardless of which country it is held,"" said Walters. ""All codes are aimed at excluding someone. Our dress is a key signifier of class or our clan, very much so in the UK."" Walters also argued Royal Ascot's 2012 dress code could be a not-so-subtle hint aimed at encouraging certain punters to cover up. ""I don't think that the wish here is to exclude them but to oblige them to cover up by setting strict parameters,"" he said. ""However the fun of strict rules is seeing how far you can bend them -- anyone who ever wore a school uniform can tell you that!""","Royal Ascot 2012 has a strict dress code which race goers must follow .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Hours after being mobbed by hundreds of cheering fans at the airport upon his arrival, former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba made his official debut with new team Shanghai Shenhua Saturday afternoon and insisted his move was motivated by challenges of helping Chinese football. ""I didn't come here with the idea of making a lot of money,"" said the 34-year-old Ivory Coast football superstar at a press conference, despite local news reports naming him the highest paid player in China who earns more than $300,000 a week. ""I came here because of the completely different challenges from what I've seen in Europe before,"" he said. ""I am here to win matches and be the champion -- I am not here to retire,"" he added. Shortly after scoring the penalty that crowned Chelsea champions of Europe, Drogba signed an undisclosed two-and-a-half-year contract with Shenhua last month. He joins former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka -- who made the switch in January with a similar reported annual salary of $15 million -- at a once-proud football club now struggling to keep its spot in the Chinese Super League. ""We have a difficult job to do, but we are going to work hard and try to make our fans happy,"" said Drogba, before reminding the audience of Chelsea's gradual ascent. ""Maybe it's going to take time but, believe me, we are going to do everything to achieve it."" His arrival highlights the spending spree by Chinese football clubs on foreign talent. Supporters argue that Chinese players need to learn from the best and international stars give the sport's weak following in China a much-needed boost. ""The most important thing is that I come here to help Chinese football,"" Drogba said. ""I think I have a little bit of experience -- I come here to share that experience and some knowledge."" Critics, however, describe the luring of top players to China as vanity projects by club owners more interested in benefiting their business empires than developing football at the grassroots level in the world's most populous nation. Shenhua's owner, Zhu Jun, is an online gaming tycoon whose deep pockets brought Drogba and Anelka to Shanghai. But his company's latest product -- ""Planetside 2"" -- was prominently featured on Drogba's uniform in a huge portrait that adorned the backdrop of the press conference, as fiery scenes from the game splashed on big screens. ""They play for Shanghai Shenhua, but they also serve as marketing vehicles for the parent company,"" said Jiang Yi, managing editor of the Chinese edition of Sports Illustrated. ""Football-wise, the money is obviously over the top -- but if you look at the bigger picture, the money is well spent."" On the outskirts of Beijing, coach He Hongguang feels even more concerned about the ""money as solution"" approach to improve Chinese football. Teaching a children's football summer camp one recent morning, the former professional player said sports officials and club owners are focusing on the wrong thing. ""I think Chinese football is a bit too eager to achieve quick success and get instant benefits,"" he said. ""Football is not so popular in China like in neighboring South Korea and Japan, because they put great emphasis on training and cultivating young players."" A tarnished reputation doesn't help, either, as Chinese football has been dogged by years of corruption and mismanagement. Since a nationwide crackdown began three years ago, dozens of senior football figures have been convicted of taking bribes and fixing matches, including two former national league chiefs who were both recently sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. ""There were some problems,"" said Drogba. ""The fact that they put it in the frontline -- it's because they want to stop it -- so it's good for football."" And his mere presence in Shanghai appears to have already brought good fortune to Shenhua. With Drogba watching from the sidelines, the team beat archrival Beijing Guo'an 3-1 in a home game on a rainy Saturday night -- exactly what the nicknamed ""Magical Beast"" promised fans earlier.","Former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is reported to be earning $300,000 a week in China .

"(CNN) -- Enough already about ""Angry Birds"" -- there were plenty of great console video games in 2011. Many longtime franchises put bows on storylines that had been going on for years. It was also the year of the shooter (and the number 3) as ""Battlefield 3,"" ""Gears of War 3"" and ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" brought players into combat zones with new and creative gameplay. Those titles got lots of hype and sold millions of units, but none made my list of the top games of the year. As with any top 10 list, many good games did not make the cut. I tried to include games that I never really wanted to put down until the very last scene. Of course, your list will vary. Here's my list, counted down in order, of my 10 favorite games of 2011 (feel free to disagree in the comments): . 10. ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"" A fitting finale for Nathan Drake and his adventures, ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"" wraps up the historical adventure franchise with possibly his greatest treasure yet. Not only does the story take a look back and reveal how Drake got started on his quests, but it also tied up many loose plot lines very well. The game feels like an Indiana Jones adventure, and Drake keeps a wry sense of humor throughout the most trying times. The designers did their research to showcase several incredible environments, historical references and lost treasures. Players will come away feeling like they've been on a grand adventure, which they have. (PlayStation 3) 9. ""LA Noire"" ""LA Noire"" puts the story to the forefront in a daring attempt to be different. Action is dictated by the narrative and the characters and not by a ploy to get the plot moving. It looks and feels like a 1940s-style detective thriller with some great voice acting and motion capture animation. It emphasizes storytelling without forcing dialogue or plot. Expect to see more games like this in the future. (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC) 8. ""Little Big Planet 2"" Sackboy returned and actually got better. ""Little Big Planet 2"" has a single-player story that has a good plot and supporting characters. There is actual dialogue instead of grunting or mumbles. The puzzle solving remains fun, but the creation of levels to share with the community raises the enjoyment level. And the inclusion of social-media connections increases the player's audience. (PlayStation 3) 7. ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" allows players to experiment with different augmentations to enhance their human character. Creatively building and upgrading, gamers will discover new ways to complete missions even during replays. The atmosphere of the not-so-far-away future is one of hope and despair. The story is well-crafted and keeps players involved with little downtime or boredom. (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC) 6. ""NBA 2K12"" ""NBA 2K12"" gave hoops fans a great outlet while the real NBA resolved its labor dispute. Improved animations make the action look more realistic than ever. The inclusion of more of the NBA's greatest players from the past lets you pit superstars from different eras against each other. And the ""My Player"" mode lets you get drafted, work your way up the depth chart and learn to face the harsh glow of the media during press conferences. (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation PSP, Windows PC, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii) 5. ""Saints Row the Third"" So many games use sex and violence as a hook to draw in players. ""Saints Row the Third"" uses them as the canvas of a hilariously funny and sexually charged romp that also offers excellent game mechanics. Missions are ultra-violent, outlandish and filled with tons of OMG moments. Drive around with a tiger in your car. Rescue hookers from a violent gang. Converse with Burt Reynolds and Hulk Hogan. It's all tongue-in-cheek, fast-paced fun that players will enjoy. (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC) 4. ""Bastion"" An independent title that shows what the ""little guy"" could do, ""Bastion"" is a surprisingly stunning game with original weaponry, an environment that players put together as the game progresses and narration that literally tells the story of what you are doing at that time. Dialogue isn't tied to a predetermined set of events. The narrator, known as the Stranger, reacts to what your character does and makes the game seem personalized. It's a game that's fun to play but never takes itself too seriously. (Xbox Live Arcade, Windows PC) 3. ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" Let me say first that my top three could be shuffled in any order and it would still be right. But this is how I'm shuffling them (for now). ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" is an open-world, role-playing game that literally has more than 100 quests to complete. Your character can be trained in any skill at any time, thus assuring that the game is personal to each player. Sure, there are some minor bugs in it, but they are more amusing than frustrating. And any game that lets me stand at the top of a mountain while more than a dozen dragons fill the sky is a big winner in my book. It is enthralling, addictive and satisfying. (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC) 2. ""Batman: Arkham City"" The Dark Knight returns to his beloved Gotham and discovers it to be just as violent and twisted as the dark halls of Arkham Asylum. His new adventures, ""Batman: Arkham City,"" expand the playing field dramatically and take the insanity into the open world. This allows for more freedom during combat and takes the missions away from a linear progression. The voice acting remains flawless, while the look of the game and its sense of foreboding throughout make it a pleasure to play. Love all the classic villains, too. This ""Batman"" game was difficult to put down, even after the main story line (which was highly dramatic) was finished. (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC) 1. ""Portal 2"" Outstanding characters? Check. Cryptic puzzle solving? Check. Great dialogue? Check. Everything you'd expect from a ""Portal"" title returns in ""Portal 2,"" with some great additions. While the first title was all about the puzzles, this one keeps the puzzle-solving portion alive but mixes in a wonderful story that is fast-paced, informative and extremely humorous. Origins are discovered, new alliances are formed and there is not a crumb of cake to be had. (That's a reference to the original ""Portal,"" in case you're confused.) If that isn't enough, a new co-op mode allows players to play as test robots that act like Abbott and Costello. It's a fantastic game from start to finish.

"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama left no doubt about his position on the hottest topic in the world of college football. Florida came out on top over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. ""We need a playoff,"" Obama told reporters after being asked about Florida's 24-14 victory over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. ""If I'm Utah, or if I'm USC or if I'm Texas, I might still have some quibbles."" Since its inception in 1998, the NCAA's Bowl Championship Series has weathered criticism from nearly all directions. The BCS is the system that chooses the contenders for college football's most prominent postseason games: the Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar bowls, as well the National Championship game, which this year put Oklahoma against Florida. The BCS relies on a compilation of polls and rankings instead of, to the consternation of many, actual competition. Florida, Oklahoma and Texas all finished the season with one loss. Texas actually handed Oklahoma its one defeat in October on a neutral field. When the BCS computer system put Florida and Oklahoma in this year's national championship game, the annual back-and-forth over whether to have a college football playoff system was reignited. Utah was the only college football team to finish the season undefeated, but its conference is considered less competitive and therefore was put at a statistical disadvantage in the BCS. Friday was not the first time Obama stated his preference for a playoff system. ""It would add three extra weeks to the season,"" Obama said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview just after his election. ""You could trim back on the regular season. I don't know any serious fan of college football who has disagreed with me on this. So, I'm going to throw my weight around a little bit. I think it's the right thing to do."" Each year, Republicans and Democrats alike are angered by what they see as inherent unfairness in the BCS arrangement. In 2008, legislators -- for one reason or another -- drafted legislation to invalidate the BCS on grounds that it misdirects commerce.  Watch how a playoff system could change college football » . In an April resolution, the House of Representatives formally, if not forcibly, condemned the BCS as ""an illegal restraint of trade that violates the Sherman Anti-Trust Act"" and also urged the Justice Department's Antitrust Division to investigate. Since this resolution, though, no serious action has been pursued. On Thursday, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, reintroduced the College Football Playoff Act of 2008. The bill, originally introduced December 10, would ""prohibit, as an unfair and deceptive act or practice, the promotion, marketing, and advertising of any post-season NCAA Division I football game as a national championship game unless such game is the culmination of a fair and equitable playoff system."" If passed, this bill would apply to any game that occurs after January 31, 2011. It would be enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission. Barton said Thursday that those watching the championship game are being ""bamboozled."" ""This year's BCS failure proves once again that it's time for college football to come up with a fair way to determine its champion,"" he said in a statement. ""It does pit two very worthy teams against each other, but can anyone say unequivocally that the winner will be the best team in the country?"" The BCS governing body -- made up of the commissioners from all NCAA Division I-A conferences; the athletics director from Notre Dame, which isn't affiliated with a conference; and representatives from each bowl organization -- announced in spring 2008 that the system would be used through at least the 2014 season. Later, ESPN outbid Fox for a four-year television rights deal with the BCS. To begin in 2011, this contract rests on the understanding that the current system will remain in place. Barton, the ranking Republican in the Energy and Commerce Committee, represents the 6th District of Texas. Two of his co-sponsors, Republican Reps. Michael McCaul and Lamar Smith, represent districts 10 and 21, respectively -- two of the four districts that collectively represent Austin, home of the University of Texas. Regardless of lawmakers' personal affiliation with home teams, the official motivation for college football reform is the same as for any similar economic reform: to help the little guy compete. The BCS is composed of eleven conferences. The six traditionally dominant conferences -- the Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pacific 10 and Southeastern -- are guaranteed at least one berth in one of the BCS bowls. Each year, they are awarded $18 million, plus $4.5 million for each additional team that appears in a bowl game. Meanwhile, only one team from the smaller conferences -- Conference USA, Mid-American, Mountain West, Sun Belt and Western Athletic -- is given this opportunity. For the 2006-07 postseason, an average of $25.5 million in revenue was awarded per large conference, while the small conferences averaged $5 million each. As the argument goes, the larger postseason earnings provide an advantage -- in athletic recruiting, as well as for each university as a whole -- to the ""power"" conferences. This is not the first time lawmakers have voiced their discontent. In 2005, Barton summoned a BCS official before an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, but legislation did not result. And in 2003, both the House and Senate Judiciary committees held oversight hearings to examine the BCS system, though the combined result yielded not much more than a sound bite from current Vice President-elect Joe Biden: . ""It looks un-American. ... It looks like a rigged deal.""","Florida beat Oklahoma, 24-14, in Thursday night's BCS championship game .

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie salvaged a point for Manchester United against English Premier League leader Chelsea with an injury-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford Sunday. United was staring defeat in the face after trailing to a Didier Drogba goal when Angel Di Maria won a free kick which led to the dismissal of Branislav Ivanovic for a second yellow card. Di Maria's delivery was met by the excellent Marouane Fellaini and after Thibaut Courtois pushed out his headed effort, van Persie smashed the ball home. Chelsea stays top of the EPL by four points from Southampton, with United back in eighth and 10 points adrift. Eyebrows were raised when Jose Mourinho re-signed the 36-year-old Drogba in the summer, but the Ivorian star rolled back the years with his second half effort. David De Gea had to make a superb save from Eden Hazard, who was clean through after a one-two with Drogba. But from the resulting Cesc Fabregas corner, Drogba rose to head home at the near post, his first EPL goal since March 2012. He took his place in the team after Chelsea's top scorer Diego Costa was ruled out through injury, but more than justified his inclusion. In other EPL action, Tottenham Hotspur suffered another disappointing home defeat -- beaten 2-1 by struggling Newcastle. Tottenham led 1-0 through an Emmanuel Adebayor goal but conceded an equalizer after just eight seconds of the second half, with Sammy Ameobi on target. Another substitute, Ayoze Perez, added a second just before the hour mark. Everton capped a fine week by beating second bottom Burnley 3-1 with Samuel Eto'o scoring twice. In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich was held goalless by Borussia Moenchengladbach in a top of the table clash. Bayern hit seven in a midweek Champions League thrashing of Roma, but a David Alaba effort which hit the post was the best it could muster Sunday. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was also kept busy as Bayern's run of six straight wins was ended but the Bavarians still head Moenchengladbach by four points. In Serie A, leaders and reigning champions Juventus took a three-point lead at the top with a 2-0 home win over Palermo. Goals in each half from Arturo Vidal and Fernando Llorente were enough to secure three points for Juve, whose nearest rival Roma was held to a goalless draw by Sampdoria Saturday night.","Man Utd holds Chelsea 1-1 at Old Trafford .

"Washington (CNN) -- Michelle Obama hasn't given any indication that she'll run for political office, but Sen. Mark Kirk is suggesting otherwise. The Illinois Republican sent a fund-raising letter to supporters referring to the ""press and rumor mills"" that Obama may run for Kirk's Senate seat in 2016. The letter was first reported by the Chicago-Sun Times and confirmed by Kirk's office. Kirk even compares Obama's potential run to speculation in 1999 over whether then-First Lady Hillary Clinton would run for the Senate. She eventually did. So is Kirk looking for supporters to connect the dots? Kirk also writes in the letter that he is ""not one to believe rumors or engage in political gossip,"" but he takes ""all potential threats seriously."" ""Help me fend off a challenge from a Democratic opponent who will be backed by the national Democrat party as well as the home state political operation of the President,"" Kirk writes. Capping off the letter, Kirk asks his supporters to open their wallets and drop $25 to $1,000 to help him stave off those types of ""threats."" The first lady's office declined to comment on the fund-raising appeal. While the ""rumor mill"" has been active for some time, Obama has explicitly said she has no plans for elected office. Asked by ABC's Robin Roberts whether her next move will be political, Obama said, ""No, it will not be political,"" and went on to say her next role will be ""mission-based"" and ""service-focused."" White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, a close friend of the Obamas, flat out rejected the suggestion that Obama would ever run for political office. ""No. I'm absolutely 100 percent positive that will never happen,"" Jarrett said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in June. That came less than a month after President Barack Obama himself said there was no chance.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled against California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Tuesday, arguing the ban unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination. In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the state's Proposition 8 ""works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians"" by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th Amendment. ""Very soon, Proposition 8 will be gone forever,"" said Kristin Perry, one of two women who challenged the ban in federal courts along with a male same-sex couple. ""Today marks the culmination of what has been a transformational year."" Toobin: What does ruling mean? Supporters of Proposition 8, which passed with 52% of the vote in 2008, said they were willing to take the issue all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. And a stay halting same-sex marriages remains in place as the appeals continue. Lea este artÃ­culo en espaÃ±ol/Read this article in Spanish . The Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative Christian legal foundation that backed Proposition 8, said it was not surprised that ""this Hollywood-orchestrated attack on marriage -- tried in San Francisco -- turned out this way."" But it said it was confident the Supreme Court would uphold ""the expressed will of the American people."" ""No court should undercut the democratic process by taking the power to preserve marriage out of the hands of the people,"" it said. Nevertheless, supporters of same-sex marriages cheered the decision when it was announced in San Francisco on Tuesday morning. ""For me, it's a beautiful day,"" same-sex marriage activist Billy Bradford said. ""But it's a great day for the Constitution."" Perry and her partner, Sandra Stier, are raising twin boys who will be ready to attend college next year. One of the boys, Spencer Perry, said he lived ""in a home with a lot of love,"" but added, ""Proposition 8 has done a really, really good job of trying to tear that love apart."" ""We can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" Spencer Perry added. Tuesday's ruling affirms a 2010 decision by a U.S. district judge in San Francisco. In the majority opinion, Circuit Judges Stephen Reinhardt and Michael Daly Hawkins noted that they were speaking only to Proposition 8, and that other states would have to decide the issue of marriage themselves. ""For now, it suffices to conclude that the people of California may not, consistent with the federal Constitution, add to their state constitution a provision that has no more practical effect than to strip gays and lesbians of the right to use the official designation that the state and society give to committed relationships, thereby adversely affecting the status and dignity of the members of a disfavored class,"" the opinion states. In a part-concurring, part-dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge N. Randy Smith said he wasn't sure Proposition 8 ""lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests"" in terms of raising children. Previous rulings show an argument for ""extreme judicial restraint"" in such cases, he wrote. California's Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriages were legal in California in 2008, before Proposition 8 went before voters. Its passage put an end to the practice. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which came under fire for its strong support of the referendum, said through a spokesman that it ""regrets"" the ruling. ""California voters have twice determined in a general election that marriage should be recognized as only between a man and a woman. We have always had that view,"" Scott Trotter, a spokesman for Utah-based Mormon church, said in a written statement. But Trotter added that the church wants ""people on all sides of this issue to act in a spirit of mutual respect and civility toward those with a different opinion."" Opponents of same-sex marriage point out that they have won votes in every state where the issue has been on the ballot. But a CNN/ORC International Poll n September found that public opinion has shifted nationwide since 2009, with 53% now saying same-sex marriages should be recognized as valid and 46% opposed. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Tuesday's decision appears to be tailored narrowly to California. That might be an advantage when the Supreme Court considers any appeal, since the justices might decide against taking a case that has no impact beyond the state. ""This might well be the last word on the case,"" Toobin said. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had allowed same-sex marriages when he was mayor of San Francisco in 2004, called it ""a historic milestone towards equality for all Americans."" ""This is the biggest step that the American judicial system has taken to end the grievous discrimination against men and women in same-sex relationships and should be highly praised,"" Newsom said in a written statement. Six states grant same-sex marriage licenses: New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire. The District of Columbia also does. Five additional states recognize civil unions, providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples. They are Hawaii, Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois and Rhode Island. Tuesday's decision also rejected arguments by supporters of the ban that now-retired federal judge Vaughn Walker should have stepped aside and let another judge hear the case. Walker found Proposition 8 unconstitutional in 2010, and disclosed after his retirement that he is gay and in a long-term relationship, leading Proposition 8 advocates to argue he should not have heard the case. CNN's Dan Simon, Bill Mears and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Very soon, Proposition 8 will be gone forever,"" one of the plaintiffs says .

"(CNN) -- If kings and queens are able to savor the best things in life, why shouldn't they get to retire, too? It's not traditional, and it kind of goes against one of the biggest perks of being a king or queen -- a secure job for life. But it happens, as the world saw Monday. King Juan Carlos I of Spain became the latest royal to say he's stepping down. It's ""time to hand over to a new generation,"" the 76-year-old announced in a televised address, declaring that he's leaving the job he's had for nearly four decades. His son, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, will take over. The Spanish King is one of several monarchs to step down in recent years. Queen B takes her leave . In January 2013, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands passed the crown to her son Prince Willem-Alexander. He was 46 at the time. Queen Beatrix had been ruling for more than three decades. Much beloved by the Dutch people, she tried to assure them that her retirement didn't mean she was taking off for Florida and forsaking their love. ""This doesn't mean that I'm taking leave from you,"" she told a throng of admirers in Dam Square outside the palace in Amsterdam. Her abdication was a move marked by tradition in the Netherlands -- knowing that it's best to go out while on top, historians say. Queen Beatrix was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother. ""Beatrix's abdication wasn't controversial,"" explained royal commentator and historian Richard Fitzwilliams. ""The people were happy with that and no one thought less of the monarchy."" A father to son handoff in Belgium . In July 2013, King Albert II of Belgium gave up his kingship, reportedly over concerns that he was too old to carry out his duties. Those duties include ""suggesting, advising, warning and encouraging"" lawmakers in the country, according to Belgium's government website. King Albert was 79 when he retired. He had ruled for 20 years. His son, a 53-year-old trained fighter pilot who became King Philippe, took over. The country had been in turmoil at the time, torn between the North and South where residents spoke different languages. A pope quits (and makes history) Europe must have been especially lovely in 2013, because even the Pope didn't want to keep working. An unprecedented ""I quit"" came in February when the Vatican announced that Pope Benedict XVI -- Germany's Joseph Ratzinger -- was leaving the papacy. His ""advanced age"" was the reason he wanted out, the Vatican said. The then-85-year-old had led the Catholic church since 2005. He became the first pope in nearly 600 years to leave the post. So what do monarchs -- and one pope -- do when they retire? Benedict's retirement hasn't been all that different from anyone else's. Archbishop Georg Ganswein told Reuters that Benedict has been doing a lot of reading, reflecting and praying. He's taking walks in the Vatican gardens, playing the piano and receiving guests at a monastery. He's mostly a homebody, making only a few public appearances, such as the canonization ceremonies for Popes John XXIII and John Paul II in April. A change of the guard in Qatar . Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, abdicated and transferred power to his son in 2013. Sheikh Hamad, who gained power in 1995 after overthrowing his father, sent out a public message to announce his plans. ""I declare that I will hand over the reins of power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,"" according to the Independent. Sheikh Hamad's decision to cede power willingly was a first in the modern history of the region. The norm is for Gulf leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspire to overthrow them, such as the Arab Spring uprisings that toppled leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. His son, Sheikh Tamim, became the youngest monarch in the region at the age of 33. Spanish selfies and change . In Spain on Monday after the King announced his departure, tourists took selfies in front of the royal palace in Madrid. Some gazed through the gates. ""Change is good, new blood could be good, why not?"" said Spaniard Natividad Andres. ""Everything is so unpredictable, you think about politicians that offer you one thing and give you another and things continue to work."" Lola Garcia told Reuters that she worried about what the abdication indicated. ""It's a shame. I'm really sorry,"" she said. ""I don't know what's going to become of Spain and I don't like what I see coming."" On Monday, the King noted in his speech that Spain had been suffering financially. ""The long, deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially, but it has also pointed toward a future of hope,"" he said. Royal watcher Fitzwilliams called King Juan Carlos' abdication a ""real tragedy."" ""He wanted to go down in history as the king who was a symbol of national unity for a very disparate Spain,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""Spaniards -- many of them older -- are great admirers of him."" There was still a ""tremendous amount of good will"" toward the King, he said, despite scandals that had lately rocked his rule. King Juan Carlos' popularity took a hit in 2012 when he fell and broke his hip while on a trip in Botswana, and Spanish news outlets began running a photo from the trip that showed him next to an elephant he had shot. The image appalled many Spaniards. Fitzwilliams recalled Monday, however, that the King had, in his long rule, managed to bring together fractious political groups in Spain and stop a right-wing military coup in 1981. ""He's done the country enormous service,"" Fitzwilliams said. Could a British royal be next? The news of King Juan Carlos' abdication didn't shock British author and historian Kate Williams. ""We've seen this in Belgium and the Netherlands,"" she said. ""I think it's often thought that rule should go to someone who is young and vibrant and fun. But you will never see it in the United Kingdom. Never."" Queen Elizabeth II has said that she believes the job of ruling Britain was given to her by God, and only God can take it away, Williams said. The queen staying in her job is critical to a cohesive sense of culture in Britain, she said. But it's happened before in the U.K. There's no way Queen Elizabeth doesn't consider the shock waves sent through British society when King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936. That ""haunts"" the palace still, Fitzwilliams said. King Edward caused a huge stir when he declared that he wanted to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, an act that broke the rules of the Church of England. He gave up the throne and became the Duke of Windsor. Together, the couple toured Germany. It was reported that the former king had Nazi sympathies. He lived out the rest of his life in France. The episode is considered, Fitzwilliams said, a shame on the legacy of the British monarchy.","Netherlands, Belgium and Qatar all had monarchs step down in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Southwest of Toronto, in a satellite city called Mississauga, Ma Yansong's vision of a flowing, organic architecture halts the tedium of a relentlessly box-shaped cityscape. His two residential towers are alike in their sinuous curvilinearity -- which enraptured locals nicknamed ""Marilyn Monroe"" -- but were designed separately. The first tower was so beloved by Missisaugans, a second was commissioned and completed last year. Since winning this first big international commission in 2006, Ma's eight-year-old Beijing firm MAD has made a name for itself as a leading exponent of urban design that's both futuristic and respectful of nature. Their projects include breathtaking museums and towers in the Chinese cities of Harbin, Ordos and Tianjin, but Canada's Absolute Towers are Ma's favorite. He was only 30 years old when his design was commissioned. ""I'd never built a building before, and that was a huge building. I had to figure out how to assemble my team, how to build a high rise. It was a surprise. I didn't know it was so complicated to make a building,"" he said. View a hi-res gallery of Ma Yansong's 'Great Buildings' Achieved with the help of Toronto architect Atilla Burka and structural engineer Sigmund Soudack, the first tower is 170 meters tall, with elliptical floor plates that twist at varying points depending on corresponding features in the landscape. Today, Ma says he's glad he didn't know how difficult it would be to execute his vision -- he might not have tried if he had. ""I was so confident about what I proposed, because I was thinking about the city."" The city appreciated it. ""Architecture lives in Mississauga at long last,"" wrote one critic, who compared the building's sashaying, ribbed shape to the pleated, body-draping garments of fashion designer Issey Miyake. Another critic deemed it ""sassy, sexy and irreverent toward the formal pieties of cereal-box skyscraper modernism"", and a comeback to ""Toronto developers who complain that they can't build and sell anything except the same boring stuff we've been seeing since the Second World War. ""I didn't try to make it sexy, just not a box,"" Ma says. ""I'm trying to express nature in big cities. I grew up in the old neighborhood of Beijing where you had a courtyard and trees. Actually, the whole of Beijing was a garden -- the Forbidden City -- and the lakes and gardens in the city center were all artificial,"" he said. Watch 'Great Buildings' on Connect the World . ""I think that's a good pattern for future cities. There must be a way to combine the high rise and high density environment with nature. Maybe we can have our gardens in the sky. We can link different buildings in the sky, and we can have a waterfall in a high rise. It would be beautiful."" The building Ma most wishes he had designed is the Salk Institute by Louis Kahn who, like Ma, studied at Yale. Located in La Jolla, California, the building was commissioned by the inventor of the polio vaccine, Dr Jonas Salk, who wanted to create a place where scientists could be inspired. Kahn designed two parallel buildings with protruding towers which afford space for study. The six-storey structures are separated by a light-filled, marble plaza with a central water channel leading out toward the Pacific Ocean. iReport: Your favorite buildings . The building's use of concrete is widely praised, but Ma says he particularly likes its relationship to its environment. ""When people are in the central plaza, they feel so connected to nature, to the sky and the ocean, emotionally. I always imagine in 100 or 200 years, when people go there, they will feel the same,"" he said. ""I went there two or three years ago for the first time. I arrived there at midnight so I had to climb into the place, and was guided out by security. ""It was in the dark, so it looked different from the pictures -- everyone knows these pictures; you have the building on both sides and the ocean and sky in front -- but in the evenings, it's like a black hole,"" he says. ""The end is a void and it's horizontal not vertical, so you don't feel you're small and helpless. When you're in that space you feel you're the center, and you can talk to your future.""","Chinese architect Ma Yansong's favorite design is the Absolute Towers in Mississauga, Ontario .

"(Health.com) -- Each year billions of dollars are spent in the search to find new cancer drugs. Very few of these would-be treatments end up being approved by the government and entering widespread use, which makes it all the more intriguing that one of the most promising new cancer drugs in years is, in fact, an old drug. Metformin, a diabetes drug, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1995, and since then tens of millions of Americans with diabetes have taken it daily to control their blood sugar. The first hint that metformin might also have anticancer properties came a decade later, when two research teams separately reported that diabetes patients were less likely to develop cancer, and less likely to die from the disease, if they were taking the drug. This news wasn't entirely surprising: Metformin treats diabetes in part by lowering insulin levels, and several types of cancer -- such as those of the breast, colon, and prostate -- have been linked to high levels of that hormone. But then, in 2006, researchers in Canada working with breast-cancer cells found that metformin increased the activity of an enzyme involved in tumor suppression, suggesting that the drug might fight cancer by working directly on cancer cells. Health.com: Know the warning signs of type 2 diabetes . These two developments ""set off a minor firestorm of interest,"" says Pamela Goodwin, M.D., a breast cancer researcher at the University of Toronto. ""Basically there's been a convergence of all this information, and even before it was available we could see there was a strong signal here."" Over the past several years, studies in cell cultures and animals have found that metformin appears to slow or stop the growth of a wide range of cancer cells, including those associated with breast, prostate, lung, and endometrial cancer. And the pace of research has picked up. This week, at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Chicago, researchers presented preliminary results from no fewer than 20 studies on metformin, including some in humans. ""I think certainly over the last two or three years that metformin has come to the fore, and people recognize that it has an important role to play,"" said Anthony Joshua, M.B.B.S., a staff medical oncologist at Princess Margaret Hospital, in Toronto, who presented new research at the meeting. Health.com: 25 breast cancer myths busted . The promising study findings aren't the only cause for enthusiasm among doctors. Metformin's decades-long history as a diabetes drug -- it entered the U.K. market back in 1958 -- suggests that it's generally safe. It's also extremely cheap. The U.S. patent on metformin expired in 2002, so the drug is now available in various generic versions that cost just pennies per pill. Extensive placebo-controlled clinical trials will be needed before metformin can be used as a standard cancer treatment. While it's too soon to say how that research will play out, metformin's apparent versatility and low cost seems to offer unusual potential, says Michael Pollak, M.D., director of cancer prevention at McGill University, in Montreal. ""This is not a cancer drug development story like any other,"" says Pollak, who led the 2006 study on metformin and enzymes. ""It contrasts so much with what you hear in cancer research: doctors developing new targeted therapy that costs $800 a month, and it works a little bit -- but only for certain kinds of patients with certain kinds of tumors. We don't very often see [that] the generic drug that's available at your drugstore anyways might have some use for cancer."" Health.com: Prescription drugs that lead double lives . There may be a reason for that. Pharmaceutical companies that spend billions to develop patented -- and expensive -- cancer drugs have little incentive to fund or conduct studies on generics like metformin. As a result, metformin researchers have struggled to scrape together the money needed for clinical trials, which can run into the millions. Many of the ongoing metformin studies around the world are ""being done on a shoestring budget, in a sort of informal way,"" Pollak says. ""I imagine that if [metformin] was a proprietary drug owned by a major pharmaceutical company, they would be developing it very aggressively, because all of the indicators point in the same direction, and that's unusual,"" Goodwin says. Governments and nonprofit organizations have begun to fill the money gap. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), for instance, is funding dozens of clinical trials that are currently under way or recruiting patients. One of these studies, led by Goodwin, is exploring the effect of metformin on breast-cancer recurrence in 3,582 women. The other major funders for the trial are the Canadian Cancer Society and Apotex, a generic drug maker that has agreed to provide free metformin and placebo pills. Health.com: Simple things that may cut your breast cancer risk . A recent shift in thinking at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which includes the NCI, seems to be working in metformin's favor. In 2011, NIH director Francis Collins, M.D., said that ""drug rescue and repurposing"" would be a major focus of the agency, with the goal of investigating new uses for already approved or abandoned drugs. A few days later, the agency's associate director for science policy, Amy Patterson, M.D., mentioned metformin as a prime example of this approach. Two-thirds of the NCI-funded clinical trials of metformin now under way were initiated in 2011 or later. The preliminary research in humans has been encouraging. At the AACR meeting, Joshua and his colleagues reported that cancer-cell growth seemed to slow in 22 men with prostate cancer who took metformin every day for three to four weeks before prostate cancer surgery. The study, however, did not include a placebo or control group. ""The drug has potential in early-stage prostate cancer,"" Joshua says. ""My job now is to work out the characteristics of the men who had the best response to the metformin so we can design appropriate studies."" In another study, researchers from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, found that metformin was associated with better outcomes in diabetes patients with pancreatic cancer, an especially aggressive form of cancer. The two-year survival rate was 30% among the 117 patients taking metformin and just 15% among 185 patients not on the drug. So far, most metformin research has focused on cancers related to obesity and diabetes, like pancreatic cancer, says Donghui Li, a researcher at the center and the lead author of the study. But because metformin may stem cancer through several different channels -- by lowering insulin, directly slowing tumor growth, or promoting suicide by cancer cells -- it could potentially prove useful in many types of cancer. Health.com: 12 myths about insulin and type 2 diabetes . That possibility is a long ways from being confirmed, however, and in the meantime researchers investigating metformin temper their optimism with caution. ""It's not as fantastic as it sounds at first,"" Pollak says. ""At first you see it and say, 'Half the cancers are gone -- let's put it in the drinking water.'"" But the findings so far haven't shown that metformin directly reduces cancer risk or mortality in humans, Pollak adds. In studies such as Li's that have looked at cancer outcomes in diabetes patients, for instance, doctors may be prescribing metformin -- rather than insulin or other diabetes drugs -- only to their healthier patients, who may be less likely to develop or die from cancer anyway. Moreover, even if some of metformin's anticancer effects are confirmed in humans, there's no guarantee the drug will become a useful treatment in real-world practice. ""When we're dealing with patients, we have to always be aware that [metformin] possibly could not have clinical relevance,"" Goodwin says. ""So we have to test it.""

"(CNN) -- Standard Chartered has agreed to pay a $340 million fine to New York banking regulators to settle charges it laundered money for Iranian clients -- but the UK bank is far from the only one to be implicated in illegal transactions with sanctioned nations. Since 2009, several major international financial institutions have been charged with conspiring to violate U.S. economic sanctions against doing business with Iran and other countries. These banks purportedly facilitated the movement of billions of dollars through the U.S. financial system by falsifying tens of thousands of outgoing U.S. dollar (USD) payment messages for Iran and other countries subject to economic sanctions such as Sudan, Libya, and Cuba. The violations involved the practice of ""stripping"" identifier information from wire transfer documentation to conceal that the transactions were on behalf of Iranian clients or those from other rogue countries. More: StanChart pays $340 million to settle charges . The violations of sanctions against Iran and other countries were not an accident. Instead, senior bank officials knowingly and willfully sought to circumvent U.S. anti-money laundering controls. Further, bank officials engaged in repeated violations of U.S. sanctions, stripping the identifier information from tens of thousands of Iranian transactions valued in the billions. The criminal schemes were allegedly perpetrated over an extended period of time, in some cases spanning 10 years or more. In each case bank employees permitted Iranian USD payments to be cleared through U.S. banks without regard to the ultimate destination of the funds and whether they were intended to finance Iran's nuclear missile program or support Hezbollah or other terrorist groups. Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) has agreed to pay the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) $340 million to settle charges that the British bank concealed over $250 billion in transactions with Iranian clients and deliberately lied to New York banking regulators. But SCB is not an isolated case. In 2009, Lloyds Bank and Credit Suisse were fined $350 million and $536 million, respectively, for allegedly removing or altering information to conceal prohibited transactions with Iranian clients and customers from other sanctioned countries. In 2010, ABN Amro and Barclays were docked $500 million and $298 million, respectively, for allegedly committing similar crimes. More: South Korea to investigate StanChart and HSBC . Then, this June, ING Bank paid the largest ever fine -- $619 million -- against a bank for allegedly moving billions illegally through the U.S. financial system on behalf of Iranian and Cuban clients. A U.S. Senate report in July also implicated HSBC in laundering money for Mexican drug cartels and violating sanctions with Iran. That case is still under investigation and no sanctions have been imposed against the bank. HSBC said in a statement at the time that the bank ""takes compliance with the law, wherever it operates, very seriously."" But rather than provide an answer, the financial fines levied against some of the world's biggest banks raise disturbing questions about whether the penalties are stiff enough. While five banks have entered into deferred prosecution agreements with the DOJ and agreed to pay fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars, no bank official has been criminally prosecuted and punished. More: StanChart seeks advice over countersuit . Why not? Clearly, bank officials devised and implemented the fraud schemes that resulted in the concealment of tens of thousands of transactions with an aggregate value in the hundreds of billions of dollars involving sanctioned countries, persons, and entities. Further, when bank officials masked the identities of Iranian clients and thwarted American efforts to detect money laundering and terrorist financing, they violated numerous federal laws, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, and RICO statutes. Yet the DOJ has failed to hold bank officials individually liable for their criminal activities. Why aren't bank officials being held criminally accountable? Perhaps cases such as these are too expensive, time-consuming and difficult to prove for prosecutors. Or maybe the reason we're not seeing mass indictments of senior bank officials has to do with a fear that such action could result in the target bank suffering devastating economic losses, which would be passed on to innocent shareholders. Does this mean that the potential economic consequences resulting from criminal action could make certain banks ""too big to prosecute""? Could criminal prosecution of senior bank officials result in the ultimate collapse of the bank? More: British MPs accuse U.S. of anti-City agenda . Regulators may not want to destroy banks through criminal allegations, but the implication that the worst a crime-committing bank will get is a stiff fine is equally ominous. Banks could simply decide to evade sanctions laws and anti-money laundering controls, and factor in the monetary sanction as the mere cost of doing business. In such cases, then, a criminal fine would have limited deterrent value in preventing unlawful conduct. The Department of Justice and federal regulators appear to have adopted the policy: ""impose a fine against the bank but don't prosecute suspected corrupt bank officials."" If this is the policy the DOJ plans to adopt, then banks will continue to give short shrift to regulations, including the ban on providing financial services to sanctioned countries. If SCB allegedly laundered $250 billion for Iranian clients, why did regulators only fine the bank a paltry $340 million? The allegations in the DFS order state that SCB generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for processing the Iranian transactions, meaning the SCB could still have profited from its unlawful conduct. The fine is also substantially less than the $619 million fine in June against ING Bank, which was charged with less serious crimes. There are a number of possible explanations. Regulators may believe that additional penalties against Standard Chartered are on the horizon from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Treasury, but that outcome is hardly guaranteed. More: StanChart tops cruel summer for banks . Perhaps New York regulators were under mounting criticism and pressure from federal authorities for taking unilateral action against SCB and DFS wanted to resolve the case as quickly as possible. Or maybe the DFS sincerely believes that the fine, by itself, constitutes a reasonable penalty against SCB. Ultimately, none of these explanations are satisfying. The DFS leveled extremely serious charges against SCB, referring to the bank as a ""rogue"" institution that ""left the U.S. financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes."" But the final settlement is inconsistent with and diminishes the gravity of the charges levied against the bank. What are the implications of the unilateral action taken by the DFS against Standard Chartered? At the very least, it is abundantly clear that the DFS is prepared to act alone when necessary against financial institutions believed to be breaking U.S. economic sanctions law, rather than follow the lead of federal authorities. It also appears the DFS is likely to take a more aggressive posture than their federal counterparts with respect to walking the regulatory line. But the end result remains a mystery. Is the ultimate penalty imposed against offending banks going to be more or less severe than sanctions imposed by the federal authorities? IS DFS's bark worse than its bite? The DFS action against SCB raises many unsettling questions for financial institutions moving forward. In the end, the justice system cannot tolerate a dual system of justice, exempting corrupt bank officials from prosecution for fear of negative economic repercussions. No one should be above the law -- even the CEOs and senior bank officials of some of the world's largest financial institutions. Bank officials who knowingly and wilfully violate the laws enacted to prevent banks from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and financial dealings with rogue regimes should be held accountable and punished to the full extent of the law. That should be the prosecution policy of the U.S. Department of Justice. To do otherwise contributes to an environment of impunity and threatens the integrity of the global financial system.","StanChart just one of several banks charged with laundering Iranian money .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A government report released Thursday paints an alarming picture of an unstable future for international relations defined by waning American influence, a fragmentation of political power and intensifying struggles for increasingly scarce natural resources. The report aims to better inform policymakers, starting with the administration of President-elect Barack Obama . The report, ""Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World,"" was drafted by the National Intelligence Council to better inform U.S. policymakers -- starting with the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama -- about the factors most likely to shape major international trends and conflicts through the year 2025. ""Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful actor, the United States' relative strength -- even in the military realm -- will decline and U.S. leverage will become more constrained,"" says the report, which is the fourth in a series from the Intelligence Council. The report argues that the ""international system -- as constructed following the second World War -- will be almost unrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers, a globalizing economy, an historic transfer of relative wealth and economic power from West to East, and the growing influence of nonstate actors."" It argues that the world is in the midst of an unprecedented ""transfer of global wealth and power"" -- from West to East -- that is being fueled by long-term ""increases in oil and commodity prices"" along with a gradual shift of manufacturing and certain service industries to Asia. And yet, while American power and influence are projected to decline, America's burdens are not. ""Despite the recent rise in anti-Americanism, the U.S. probably will continue to be seen as a much-needed regional balancer in the Middle East and Asia,"" the report notes. The American military will continue to be expected to play a leading role in the war against global terrorism, though the United States as a whole will be less able to ""call the shots without the support of strong partnerships."" America's biggest rival by 2025, the reports says, will be China. ""China is poised to have more impact on the world over the next 20 years than any other country,"" it notes. The report projects that China will have the world's second largest economy by 2025 and will be a leading military power. Equally problematic for U.S. policymakers is the fact that China is expected to become the world's biggest polluter and largest importer of natural resources. China will not be alone, however, in terms of its desire to provide a consumption-oriented American lifestyle to a rapidly growing population. Countries such as India and, to a lesser extent, Indonesia, Iran and Turkey, will also likely see their power -- and desire for natural resources -- increase. The report predicts that, the recent economic downturn aside, ""unprecedented global economic growth"" will mean that the demand for basic resources such as food, water and oil ""will outstrip easily available supplies"" over the next decade. As an estimated 1.2 billion people are added to the world population over the next 20 years, the demand for food will rise by 50 percent, the report projects. The lack of access to stable water supplies will also worsen due to rapid global urbanization, it says. Further complicating matters is the fact that while demand for energy is projected to rise, oil and gas production will continue to be ""concentrated in unstable areas,"" it says. The world in 2025 is therefore likely to find itself in the midst of a ""fundamental energy transition away from oil toward natural gas, coal and other alternatives."" Such a transformation, however, may not stave off armed conflict driven largely by the struggle for scarce resources, the report says. While conflicts are still most likely to ""revolve around trade, investments, and technological innovation and acquisition,"" the report states that ""we cannot rule out a 19th century-like scenario of arms races, territorial expansion, and military rivalries."" Terrorism is also expected to remain a major issue through 2025, though its appeal could be significantly reduced if economic and political liberalization accelerates in the Middle East. ""In the absence of employment opportunities and legal means for political expression, conditions will be ripe for disaffection, growing radicalism and possible recruitment of youths into terrorist groups,"" the report argues. Adding to complications in the always-volatile Middle East will be Iran's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons, which could trigger a regional nuclear arms race, the report says. Continuing tensions between India and Pakistan also add to concerns regarding nuclear proliferation, it says. The report highlights the need for new technological innovation to provide ""viable alternatives to fossil fuels"" and overcome future food and water constraints. At the moment, ""all current technologies are inadequate for replacing"" traditional energy sources ""on the scale needed,"" it says. The bottom line, the report says, is that ""the next 20 years of transition to a new system are fraught with risks."" ""This is a story,"" it says, ""with no clear outcome.""","Report says China will have growing impact, second largest economy by 2025 .

"(CNN) -- If they were handing out awards for courage in the face of personal trauma, 70-year-old Bob Yelton would scoop the lot at this week's World Amateur Handicap Championships. Yelton is one of just 13 golfers who have played in all 28 previous editions of the biggest tournament of its type in the world, which brings nearly 3,100 players from 25 countries and 49 states of the U.S. to the Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina. His streak was nearly broken last year, and in the circumstances nobody would have held it against him if he had taken time out. Just before the tournament, Martha, his wife of 22 years, was taken ill and passed away just a week later. There had been no hint of a problem -- Martha taught at a community school in Shelby in North Carolina and played a bit of golf herself. ""She mostly just walked the course with me,"" recalled Bob. Her death hit him hard and he was left with the prospect of raising his then 15-year-old son Porter alone. In the circumstances, his annual pilgrimage to Myrtle was low priority. ""I had no interest in playing golf."" But with encouragement from his brother Don, who has also played in every World Am, and crucially an intervention from his son, Bob did indeed pitch up. ""Dad, Mum would have wanted you to play,"" said Porter and he did, thinking about Martha just about every step of the way. In retrospect, the stress of dealing with his wife's premature death and continuing to practice as a business lawyer may well have taken a bigger toll on Bob than he was to realize. Back in April, he was playing Arrowhead, a course in North Carolina, when he collapsed with a heart attack. ""I was on the second hole, felt real dizzy, next thing I know I woke up in the ambulance."" Thankfully medical attention had arrived quickly. ""They used CPR and got me back, and thankfully there was no permanent damage to my heart,"" said Bob in a matter of fact way that belies its seriousness. Brother Don had suffered a similar problem a few years ago and his advice has helped Bob to make a full recovery, but doctors have advised him against playing when the temperature gauge goes into the mid-90s. ""The first time I went back on the course it was kind of scary,"" he admitted. In a hot summer in the Carolinas, this has restricted his practice opportunities, but nothing was going to stop Bob from competing in his 29th World Am. The tournament format sees golfers placed in ""flights"" of around 50, playing on 60 courses in the Myrtle Beach area (including TPC Myrtle Beach and the Dye Course at Barefoot Resort) over four days of competition. The top player in each group, after adjustments are made for handicap -- ""They are very quick to weed out the cheaters,"" said Bob -- qualified for Friday's final 18-hole shootout from which the top prizes are decided. Remarkably, given the close nature of the competition, Bobby Perkinson, a 3.5 handicap player from Tennessee, has claimed the title for the past two years. Yelton's best result is eighth in a flight, but like many others he is there for the enjoyment of golf and the camaraderie, meeting other old friends who come back year after year. They might also get the chance to rub shoulders with celebrities, such as baseball star Roger Clemens who has returned for a second year, while eight golfers have qualified from a regional competition in China. The success of the World Am has led to a series of tournaments held under a similar format as the golfing industry looks to boost participation at all levels. Bob is a fully-fledged ""Baby Boomer"" and like so many others in the 1960s was inspired to take up golf by the exploits of Arnold Palmer -- a fellow former student of Wake Forest University. While not reaching professional standard, in his 20s Bob played to a challenging 5 or 6 handicap but is now an 18-handicapper. He has met his hero a couple of times at golf functions and like so many others was impressed by Palmer's friendliness and easy going manner. ""He talks to you as if you were a next-door neighbor."" Bob knew that his recent illness and lack of practice was going to limit his chances of progressing, and a net 96 round on the first day sunk his chances. His brother played better but could not qualify from his super senior division. Clemens did rather better. The former Yankees pitcher shot a final round 77 for a net 69 to win his flight and qualify for a shot at the top prizes. But given his dice with death, Bob was happy to just be teeing it up and meeting old friends, doubtless already planning his 30th straight appearance in a unique event.","World Amateur Handicap Championship brings together over 3,000 golfers .

"Editor's note: Fashion Season: Paris takes you behind the scenes of the Paris catwalks and beyond, exploring the French capital's most stylish hidden corners. The show airs Monday 24 to Friday 28 February on CNN International, with daily reports in 'News Stream' at 1300 GMT and 'Connect the World' at 2000 GMT. (Wired) -- There's something about floating translucent bubbles that's always seemed futuristic, from the '60s right up to the present day. Photographer Melvin Sokolsky was on the, er, ball, then, when he shot his now iconic ""Bubble"" series for the Harper's Bazaar 1963 Spring Collection. The series is widely credited for launching the trend of bold, artistic visions within fashion photography. The bubble first takes off in color from beyond the New York City skyline, then lands on the Seine River in Paris, where it begins a surreal black-and-white tour of Parisian streets, alleys, and cafes. Designer clothes are on display in each shot, something that's easily overlooked as model Simone d'Aillencourt cavorts in the plexiglass sphere, drawing a lot of attention (and even a few fireballs) from standers by. Some of the clothes, particularly shoes, were damaged not by fire but by accidental dunks in the water when the bubble dipped a little too low. The top-flight '60s couture, an aesthetic whose appeal also has carried into the modern day, keeps the pictures otherworldly and stylish in equal measure. The sphere is held together by a ring of aluminum and suspended by a 1/8th inch steel cable attached to a crane. That cable often is squarely in the shot but is occasionally positioned or illuminated so it remains unseen. In some cases, it was removed from the frame by hand, creating the illusion of a levitating sphere. Sokolsky insists a negligible amount of retouching was involved, and it obviously was not digitally manipulated. He points out that at 15 to 20 feet, such a thin cable becomes essentially invisible to the camera. Read more: This new cycling gear has us dreaming of warm days and open roads . The concept for the Bubble series came from a recurring dream in which the photographer saw himself floating in a sphere above unfamiliar landscapes. The vision was inspired by The Garden of Earthly Delights by early Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch. The fully opened triptych includes depictions of people in transparent spheres suspended among a (mostly) heavenly world. When closed, it shows the earth encased in a vast glass globe. Read more: The merciless world of mining, made beautiful in abstract photos . Bubble kicked off what would be something of a theme of flying and weightlessness in Sokolsky's work. They weren't the last forward-looking images he produced either; Lips Streaks from 1967 looks like it came straight out of 1987. Sokolsky has a knack for playing with perceptions, which is clear in other work he's renowned for, such as Big Chair and Table, Bazaar. It shows what appear to be tiny models climbing giant chairs. Sokolsky points to an image's composition, palette, overall concept, and the chemistry between photographer and model as the most important aspects of his craft. While he started his career as a fashion photographer, he had by the end of the '60s transitioned into making commercials and films alongside his photo work. He was also responsible for a number of innovations including a computerized zoom lens in 1972 that got nominated for an Academy Award. A great interview with Sokolsky further illuminates the methods of this self-taught photographer perpetually interested in making bold statements and expressing nuanced concepts. Sokolsky's work can be seen at the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles. More from WIRED: . A robotic arm paints dazzling sculptures of light . The secret cities hidden between NYC skyscrapers .

"(CNN) -- Ever imagined what it would be like to be someone else for a day? How about for the rest of your life? That's the reality for the thousands who have entered the federal witness protection program since it started in 1971. Officially called the Witness Security Program, it provides protection for government witnesses who are at risk due to testimony they've given about terrorists or criminals. ""No one knows what we do to protect witnesses, and it's good for us,"" said David Harlow, associate director for operations with the U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the vast program. ""It's about taking people and changing their way of life,"" Harlow added. ""These people truly are in danger."" More than 18,400 men, women and children have participated in it, and not one of the 8,500 witnesses or the 9,900 family members has been harmed, according to the U.S Marshals Service. ""It's a big feather in our cap,"" Harlow said. The program has made some limited information available to the public on its website: It provides 24-hour protection to all witnesses while they are in a high-threat environment; witnesses receive financial assistance for housing and subsistence for basic living expenses and medical care; the program also provides for job training and employment assistance. In an interview with CNN, Gerald Shur, who created the program, offered insight into the inner workings of this secretive government service. Shur was an attorney in what was then the Justice Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section in the 1960s when he developed the idea to protect witnesses. ""It occurred to me that we have to have a way that if a guy is in danger because of his testimony, we have to get him out of there, and in a second,"" said Shur, 79, who is now retired. But the transition to a new life doesn't always come easily, he said. ""It takes time for them to adjust, "" Shur said. ""(A witness) not only has to deal with leaving his entire family, but he has caused his wife to leave her family; he's caused his children to leave their grandparents. They can't communicate. They can't see each other. But the driving force is 'If I go back, I'll be murdered.' "" Most witnesses who enter the program are not law-abiding citizens, according to Shur. ""Ninety-five percent of them are what we call criminals,"" he said. ""Not everybody is a killer or a member of the Hell's Angels or the mob, but there are people who are doing business with criminals. ""They might say they were legitimate businessmen, but they would bribe people,"" Shur said, recalling the case of an engineer who bought off a mayor. ""He said it wasn't bad because that's how you do business in the city. In his mind, he wasn't doing anything criminal,"" Shur said. While most witnesses are familiar with the criminal justice system, their loved ones are not and often must accept being completely cut off from everyone they know. ""You're talking about wives, children, grandchildren -- they are the really innocent people,"" Shur said, ""They are in it for life, as far as I was concerned."" The program is also completely voluntary. While witnesses and their family members are free to return to their former identities, they do so at their own peril, Shur said. ""I've had witnesses ask me if it's safe to go home. I never said yes. I always felt there was a risk still there,"" Shur said, ""and that if a defendant against whom they testified is dead, there may be a family member out to get revenge or somebody within his organization who wants to be a hero of some sort and kill him."" Shur recalled two instances when witnesses refused protection. ""(One witness) went back to his home and turned the doorknob and it blew up. And there was another witness -- we tried to talk her into it. She refused and she was murdered."" Henry Hill, the gangster who was the inspiration for the 1990 film ""Goodfellas,"" opted out of the witness protection program, as did mob turncoat Sammy ""the Bull"" Gravano. But those witnesses' decisions to leave the program make them the exception to the rule, Shur said.li . After a witness agrees to testify for the prosecution, he or she may be eligible to start receiving protection. Shur described an effective way of choosing where to relocate a witness. ""I would say to them, 'Tell me what's your favorite place in the U.S.?' "" Shur said, ""and they'd say, 'I always wanted to go to Hawaii,' or that they had family in Texas or Florida. And in my mind that's three places that they are not going. Because when you tell me you want to go to Hawaii, I know you have told all your friends that."" Deputy marshals take the witness and the witness' family and move them to another area, Shur said. Sometimes, they start in a hotel. Sometimes, they are near other witnesses -- although they'd never know it, he added. ""In the beginning when the witnesses were moved off to another city, we'd run into the problems you would expect -- what to do about a driver's license, Social Security cards, how do you get him a job, money, what happens if you need Medicare care, what about the house he owns, the furniture, and so on."" Witnesses get help finding a job, but they aren't always compensated. ""The program has nothing to do with reward money, nothing. They get money for a period of time, and then it stops,"" Shur said. ""We used a formula. If you are a family of four in New York, you would get more money than a family of four from Corpus Christi. It's based on cost of living, and it wasn't based on the value of the testimony."" Shur said his work protecting witnesses put his family's life in danger. ""There was a threat against my wife. I was told that there was an individual who had my name and my wife's name in his address book and that he had a contract from the Medellin Cartel to kidnap my wife and learn where a particular witness was living. And I immediately asked for protection for my wife."" Today's witness protection program faces the added burdens of the digital age. Facebook, Google, texting and the instant access to information via the Internet and smartphones provide new challenges to keep the identities of witnesses a secret. ""The modern world of technology, because there is more information out there, it's that much more important for our people to be vigilant and for us to be vigilant,"" said Harlow of the U.S. Marshals Service. Vigilance plays a role, but Shur suggested another factor may also play an important role. ""Luck, you have to throw in some luck,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer rightly vetoed the state bill that would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay people on religious grounds. I had a bet with a friend that she wouldn't sign it -- and wonder why it took her so long. She won't take a hit to the pocketbook -- she's too savvy for that. In the days leading up to this, I put a sign in the window of my pizzeria that said: ""We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona legislators."" The reaction was vastly and overwhelmingly positive, with only a few people telling me they wouldn't ever eat at my restaurant again. Mainly, we have received many, many messages of support; phone calls, e-mails and texts, from people who live in Tucson, across the state and even from outside the United States. The sign is part of a tradition we have. When I moved into the supposedly cursed restaurant space on Broadway in Tucson, Arizona, 15 years ago, I found a box of letters -- the kind you put on a marquee sign out front. By the end of the day, I had a message on the sign. We've been changing it every day since. I am often told people plan their routes to see what we have to say each day -- even if just for a chuckle. Sometimes we put up song lyrics, or a snarky comment about someone in the news, such as Anthony Weiner. One day we put up ""Free Pussy Riot."" Some people get their knickers in a twist about our messages, but we do it for ourselves as much as anything. Then I learned that the state Senate once again passed an appalling bill that attempted to save me from my fellow Arizonans. I thought, ""Oh no, not again."" If anything seemed ripe for parody, this was it. It was irresistible. I instantly typed a comment on my Facebook page, saying that the busybodies in the capital of Phoenix were not allowed to come in and sit at my table. Minutes later, one of my followers supplied the sign that so eloquently expressed my viewpoint. I laminated it, and by that afternoon it was on my doors. Since then, a lot of similar signs showed up in the windows of Tucson businesses saying ""We reserve the right to serve anybody."" Tucson is a little more liberal than Maricopa County and Phoenix: We're a university town. People here just don't care about things like that. At restaurants, we just serve you and smile. Arizona businesses have already been hurt by reactionary positions, such as our anti-immigration laws. The state has been boycotted before -- and it hurts because we depend a lot on tourism. Freedom or oppression? That's the question for Arizona's SB1062 . As well as hurting small businesses, plenty of large companies have reconsidered locating here, saying, ""We'll take our dollars elsewhere."" One business owner, reacting to this legislation, even told me: ""Arizona is the American Uganda"" -- where they put gay people in jail. We have so much poverty, terrible roads, some unbelievably bad schools -- and this bill is what our legislators wasted their time on. Many Americans think they know what living on the border is like. But Tucson was long a part of Mexico until the Gadsden Purchase in 1853. Many of our old Indian, Mexican, Chinese and Anglo families here have histories that go back long before Arizona was even a territory of the United States. And as in much of the West, a live-and-let-live philosophy pervades our lives here in a real and tangible way. This century will be one of expanding civil rights for individuals. But Prohibition, Jim Crow, Indian schools -- where they tried to make Native American children abandon their identities -- and anti-Chinese immigration laws are not so far in the past that we can safely ignore them. They were wrong, just like discrimination against gay people is wrong. This legislation was ostensibly trying to protect religious freedom. A lot of Christian groups feel like they're being persecuted by our culture, and that is really what underlies this bill. But if they feel like they're being persecuted, they should try being gay for a little while. I cannot condone discrimination against one group of people. Regardless of the kind intentions of the lawmakers to the north of Tucson that were trying to make sure I have freedom of religion, I already have it. This bill was gratuitous as well as ridiculous. I can already refuse service to anyone -- and that includes any one of those several dozen Arizonans who aren't representing my views in Phoenix. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Rocco DiGrazia.","Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed bill that would give businesses right to refuse to serve gays .

"(CNN) -- Before he was Pope Benedict XVI, before he earned the nickname ""Cardinal No"" as the enforcer of church doctrine, he was Joseph Ratzinger -- the son of Maria and police officer Joseph Ratzinger, learning about life and God in Germany between two world wars. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, Benedict is not only the church's leader but God's representative on earth and infallible. He is also a man -- one who savors his meat and potatoes, an accomplished pianist who loves Mozart, and a teacher who for years commanded university classes. His humanity became apparent Monday, when the Vatican announced he'd resign at month's end ""because of advanced age,"" becoming the first pope in nearly 600 years to do so. After his birth on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, in southeastern Germany near the Austrian border, Ratzinger's early years were defined by his country and the turbulent times, as well as his faith. Adolf Hitler rose to power during Ratzinger's adolescent years in Traunstein, in the heavily Catholic region of Bavaria. When he was 14, school officials followed Nazi officials' orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the Hitler Youth movement -- against his will, Ratzinger wrote in his memoir. He left the organization shortly thereafter, because he was studying for the priesthood. But in 1943, Ratzinger was brought back into the Nazi fold upon being drafted into the German army. For the next two years, Ratzinger served his country as part of an anti-aircraft unit. But in the waning days of World War II, he deserted -- and was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army. According to CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen, Ratzinger's family was strongly, if quietly, anti-Nazi and his father took a series of less significant jobs to steer clear from what was happening under Hitler. In June 1945, Ratzinger was released from a POW camp. Hitching a ride on a milk truck, he headed home. And life began anew. Opinion: Why pope will be remembered for generations . The soldier became a scholar, studying philosophy and theology at the University of Munich and another school in Freising between 1946 and 1951. Two years later, he earned a doctorate in theology, after submitting a thesis titled, ""The People and House of God in St. Augustine's Doctrine of the Church."" Eventually, he became a professor -- teaching dogma and fundamental theology at four German universities. In 1969, for instance, he was appointed vice president and professor of theology at the University of Regensburg in Germany. ""Books are his best friends,"" Allen said. All the while, he grew more ingrained in the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. In 1962, 11 years after his ordination as a priest, the then-35-year-old was a consultant during Vatican II to Cardinal Josef Frings, a reformer who was archbishop of Cologne, Germany. As a young priest, Ratzinger was on the progressive side of theological debates. But he began to shift right after student revolutions of 1968, according to Allen, also a correspondent with the National Catholic Reporter. In fact, it was Ratzinger's conservative defense of strict doctrines that defined him in many people's eyes -- until he became pope. A defender of church doctrine and a 'simple, humble worker' In the late 1970s and 1980s, Ratzinger shot up the church's ranks. In spring 1977, he was named archbishop of Munich and Freising. A few months later, Pope Paul VI appointed him cardinal. One of his most significant steps up came in 1981 when he took over as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, the Vatican office that oversees ""the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world,"" according to the Vatican. Ratzinger became known as ""Cardinal No"" stemming from his efforts to crack down on the liberation theology movement, religious pluralism, challenges to traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality, and calls to ordain women as priests. Liberation theology combined Christian theology with political activism on issues like human rights and social justice. While partially compatible with Catholic social teachings, it was rejected by the Vatican, which objected to the mixing of church theology with Marxist ideas such as class struggle. ""It (was) his job to police the doctrinal boundaries of the Roman Catholic Church, and inevitably when you do that, there are going to be hurt feelings by people who find themselves on the wrong side of those lines,"" said Allen, the author of ""Cardinal Ratzinger: The Vatican's Enforcer of the Faith."" Over subsequent years, he made news when, for instance, he labeled homosexuality ""an intrinsic moral evil"" and called the Soviet Union and its communist satellite nations ""a shame of our time."" In the 1990s, Ratzinger openly challenged a fellow German cardinal who had encouraged divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to return to the sacraments. Ratzinger also argued Muslim Turkey did not belong in Christian Europe and issued a document saying that Catholicism was the only true religion -- questioning the validity of other religions, even Christian ones, even as his Pope John Paul II was trying to reach out to other faiths. Although objections came from some of his fellow cardinals, the pope did not restrain Ratzinger, in part because their friendship went back four decades, to the time when the two were young priests at the Vatican II meetings in Rome. The Pope's resignation explained . That bond persevered until John Paul's death in 2005, by which time Ratzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals -- the high-level group that advises the pope and, when called upon, picks a new pontiff. In April 2005, they picked him, then 78 years old. Now called Benedict, his reputation was seen as more subdued than his predecessor. He traveled extensively, if not at John Paul's pace. His words carried special weight, as in 2006, when he quoted from 14th-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus saying the Muslim Prophet Mohammed had only brought into the world ""things only evil and inhuman."" The remarks set off protests by Muslims worldwide, and Benedict apologized for any offense taken by Muslims. For some, the defining element of his papacy was the sex abuse scandal, with the church being accused of not doing enough to deal with reports of abuse by priests over decades, and on multiple continents. Two years after acknowledging ""shame"" over the ""evils"" of abuse, Benedict issued a statement in 2010 saying the church had not been vigilant or fast enough in responding to the problem -- one of the most forthright admissions to date, though it still did not placate some who criticized then-Cardinal Ratzinger for not cracking down sufficiently. Such missives demonstrated his power, in the church and on the world stage. But for all the headlines he generated, Benedict -- as he did in his first blessing after being elected pope -- insisted he was merely ""a simple, humble worker in God's vineyard."" ""I am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools,"" he said then, ""and I especially trust in your prayers.""","The son of a police officer, Joseph Ratzinger was born in southeastern Germany in 1927 .

"(CNN) -- Booed and jeered upon his entrance, cheered upon his exit -- perhaps even the most bitter of rivals are finally ready to submit to the mercurial talents of Cristiano Ronaldo. Few former Manchester United players have been given the ovation which Ronaldo received from an Anfield crowd, but then again, this is not just any player. Ronaldo had never scored at Anfield during his time with United -- it was a statistic which took just 23 minutes to become history. A 3-0 victory over Liverpool, inspired by Ronaldo, ensured Real Madrid made it nine points out of nine in Group B. A 70th Champions League strike means he is just one behind the all-time leading scorer, Raul, the man so revered by all at Real. The record will soon fall, Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, who has 69, will set records which few would have ever imagined possible. For Real, a club record seventh consecutive European victory was assured courtesy of Ronaldo's breathtaking strike and Karim Benzema's double. For all the pre-match hype of another 'special European night' at Anfield, it was all pretty routine. Liverpool, the five-time winner, was blown away by the pace and power of Real as Ronaldo took center stage. ""It was special, my first goal at Anfield and I am very happy -- amazing,"" Ronaldo told Sky Sports . ""We knew that Anfield is a difficult place, but we were fantastic in the first 45 minutes and we deserved to win. ""I'm not worried about the Champions League goalscoring record. I know I will beat it. Me and Lionel Messi are very close. ""The best thing is that the team has nine points. ""Can we retain the cup? Why not? We are taking it step-by-step but we are going to try. ""We know it will be tough but we are positive and it is possible."" No team has ever managed to retain the Champions League title since it was revamped into its current format in 1992, but Real will certainly go close in it attempt to record an unprecedented 11th triumph. A day after Bayern Munich had ransacked Rome by scoring seven, Real arrived at another of European football's most famous fortresses and blew it to smithereens. This was a result that most would have anticipated given Liverpool's stuttering start to the season but the way in which Real scythed through its opponents was nothing short of exquisite. Deprived of Gareth Bale, who remained in the Spanish capital nursing an injury, Real was able to call on its hosts of stars as it taught Liverpool a lesson in the art of attacking football. In James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco, Real boasted a midfield which most teams could only dream of. While Liverpool, so inconsistent following the success of last season and the departure of Luis Suarez, has struggled in recent weeks, Real has been on cruise control. Seven consecutive victories which have yielded 32 goals meant Real arrived as favorites at a stadium where it had never managed to win before. And yet, any doubts over its ability to break its three-game losing streak against Liverpool were soon extinguished. The breakthrough came after 23 minutes -- and it was worth waiting for. Ronaldo, who appeared to induce panic each and every time he as much as breathed, laid the ball off to James Rodriguez, who in turn produced a quite sumptuous pass over the top of the Liverpool defense. With those in red caught watching the flight of the ball, Ronaldo ran in behind and produced a finish which belied belief, flicking the ball into the far corner with unerring accuracy. That strike, the forward's 20th in 13 games this season, seemed to leave Liverpool winded -- a blow from which it never recovered. Seven minutes later, the contest was all but over as Benzema pulled away at the far post to send a looping header into the opposite corner following rather questionable Liverpool defending. In the three previous meetings between the two sides, Real had never managed a goal, let alone a victory. Defeated 4-0 on its last visit to Anfield five years ago, Real appeared determined to exorcize its demons. A third goal followed just before the interval, Benzema once again the grateful recipient of some more woeful home defending. To its credit, Liverpool refused to give up after falling three goals behind and only the post denied Philippe Coutinho from dragging his side back into the contest. The second half was a rather tame affair as Liverpool briefly attempted to launch a response, though without the disappointing Mario Balotelli, who was withdrawn at the interval. With the first Clasico of the season on Saturday, Real took its foot off the gas, though more goals should have been forthcoming. Ronaldo should have added a fourth midway through the second half after the visiting side had cut through the Liverpool defense with embarrassing ease, but for once, the Portuguese forward was unable to find a way past goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. In the end, Ronaldo had to settle for a solitary strike and an early exit as he was replaced with 15 minutes remaining as Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid coach, began to look towards Saturday's clash with Barcelona. ""It was the best we have played all season,"" said Ancelotti. ""We were fantastic in the first half and then controlled the game. I had to say nothing to the players, they played really well. ""I am lucky to manage this group of players."" Liverpool will face Real once more in a fortnight's time in the return game but it's chances of qualification remain in the balance. ""The first 22 minutes of the game we were excellent but from the first goal to halftime, Real Madrid showed their real quality,"" Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, told Sky Sports. ""They were terrific. Second half we played for pride and we were outstanding, the players kept going, they didn't stop. We defended poorly but I can't ask any more. ""You can see Real's quality. Speed, technique; you can see why they are champions. ""The second and third goals are from set-pieces again, it's an issue for us and we have to be better than that."" The defeat leaves Liverpool on three points, level with Bulgarian side Ludogorets and Swiss club Basel. Ludogorets claimed its first ever Champions League victory with a 1-0 win over Basel. Juventus beaten . Elsewhere, Juventus suffered a shock 1-0 defeat away at Olympiakos. The Italian side, top of Serie A, was beaten by a Pajtim Kasami strike as the Greeks made it two home wins out of two. Atletico Madrid, which was beaten on its visit to Greece, eased to a 5-0 victory over Swedish club Malmo. Atletico, beaten in last season's final, scored all five goals in the second half. In Group D, Borussia Dortmund made it three wins out of three with an emphatic 4-0 thrashing of Galatasaray. Arsenal sits second after scoring twice in the final two minutes to steal a 2-1 win at Anderlecht. In Group C, Bayer Leverkusen overcame Zenit St Petersburg 2-0, while Monaco and Benfica finished goalless.","Real Madrid thrashes Liverpool 3-0 in Champions League .

"(CNN) -- If you're looking for a harbinger of the zombie apocalypse, look no further than all those people on the street pecking at their tiny, handheld windows into a private world. So say a good portion of the commenters reacting to a semi-satirical article by comedian-columnist Dean Obeidallah, who noted the difficulty he had spending a day without a cell phone. It had become something bordering an addiction, he said, or at least a strong habit. Some readers were taken aback. ""The boy needs to get a life,"" said commenter realworldaddict, who also wrote, ""Hint to him and all the rest of the people walking around like zombies watching for messages on their cellphones: Wake up and pay attention to the world around you. Nobody is trying to contact you 24/7, and did you really want to know that one of your 568 'friends' on Facebook just got a new goldfish?"" Perhaps we're all shambling through daily life. When ObewanSnow mentioned a desire to keep a cell phone because it serves as a ""safety crutch,"" the discussion turned to self-sufficiency and even dystopian scenarios. ""When the apocalypse hits in December, you will be one of the first ones to go,"" replied a commenter. ""You have become too reliant on technology. You are afraid of breaking down and not having AAA to save you. You better toughen up and learn to work on your own car, or you will perish very quickly."" Maybe they're taking a page from Stephen King's novel, ""Cell,"" in which the protagonist, Clayton Riddell, doesn't turn into a zombie because he doesn't own a cell phone. The story is about an event called ""The Pulse"" that turns cell phone users into vicious, mindless beings. The ill effects of omnipresent communication are a common motif in science fiction. Despite the anxiety, mobile devices are big business. Apple has recently sold millions of its iPhone 5 devices, and there are many people who believe that smartphones and tablets can almost give us superhuman abilities. But their omnipresence in daily life has not been without controversy, raising concerns that our lives will be forever changed by this technology -- and not in a good way. Commenter Mug Costanza called getting rid of his cell phone after the contract expired ""one of the most liberating experiences I've ever had,"" and said he's beginning to notice the walking dead all around him. ""Now it seems really weird to me when I am in a doctor's office or subway and I see 95% of the people around me glued to their phones, clicking away like zombies,"" he said. ""My favorite is when you go out with a group of friends and everybody at the table is just playing with their phones instead enjoying themselves with real live people."" Indeed, dozens of commenters asserted that they don't own a mobile phone, or have stopped using them. Some say the tight economy has given them extra incentive. That's the case with commenter wordswords, who says that in real life, he is the patriarch of the Words family of Cape Coral, Florida. He and his wife have six children, and that means a lot of phone bills if each family member has their own phone. ""I gave up my cell phone about two years ago,"" Words commented. ""I made a commitment to saving money and our family went back to a single land line. Since then I estimate we've saved around $4,000. And we haven't lost or damaged a phone since!"" After the economy went downhill, the family had lost income and needed to cut down their bills. Words said getting rid of eight cell phones ""cold turkey,"" a phrase often used in connection with addiction, has been a worthwhile decision. ""The kids all hate me, but they enjoy the roof over their heads and the food on their table,"" Words said. ""My two eldest have jobs and did get their own, but hey, as long as they're paying for it themselves, I'm all for it."" Since they are a large family, the Words upgraded to two phone lines to ease the strain. The family still keeps their disconnected smartphones to use with Wi-Fi connections while traveling on vacations, which Words said is a luxury they now can afford. There are other benefits, too. ""The constant 'ding' of texting is gone, so we communicate with words and in person like a family should, instead of with words on a phone,"" he said. ""We love it. Others don't understand us, but that's all right."" Expense was a great motivator for aspiring musician and aspiring writer Ben Joynes, 31, of San Francisco, California, who decided that he had to focus on what was really important in life. ""Do the math. I simply cannot afford a cell phone contract, and it does not give me functionality that I absolutely need in my life in order to stay reasonably connected with people or be functional,"" Joynes said. ""My little brother who lives out of state has one, and I've tooled around with it extensively. I think they are amazing pieces of technology, and I can see how they enhance people's lives. They are 'Star Trek' technology -- literally -- today and in the palm of your hand. I just can't afford one, and prefer to do my computing on a PC."" Going without a cell phone can even be a game or a goal. Commenter Bill Murray said he is trying to see how long he can go without having a cell phone. He has never had one, and compares the challenge of stopping the use of such devices to ""an addict going through heroin withdrawal."" He loves technology, but doesn't want a cell phone. Instead he uses Vonage, a service that allows people to make phone calls over a data connection. ""As I fast approach my 50th birthday, I am starting to feel like I am one of the lucky ones for not having 'plugged' into the network,"" he wrote. ""Like a smoker shortly after they quit, I can actually smell and taste the things that others cannot enjoy. Don't get me wrong. I'm a technology lover and it has been a genuine struggle not to give in to the temptation that these amazing devices create. However, just like when I did quit smoking, I think I'll just focus on going one more day 'without' to see if I can curb the craving."" Still, he doesn't think this will last forever. ""Eventually, however, I realize that society will evolve to a point where I likely won't have a choice but to adapt to the technology. But, until then, I'll see just how long I can survive without this little mechanical addiction."" Another reader, Dawn Lynn Harvard, said she hates being tethered to a phone all day, and only keeps a phone for emergency cases. ""I haven't bought a phone in 30 years,"" she said. ""I got a new hand-held 15 years ago free from Verizon. I recharge it once a year, whether it needs it or not. I pay $13 per month."" Talking to ""real living people"" and enjoying the scenery of life is the real benefit to her. She doesn't understand what is so important that it requires being on the phone while doing other things. Sometimes, it's hard to tell if people are mentally present or not. ""When I was young, if you saw someone walking down the street talking to themselves you crossed over assuming they were crazy,"" she said. ""Sometimes I think they still are."" What do you think?

"(CNN) -- The man immortalized by Martin Scorsese's film ""Goodfellas"" has died. Henry Hill, a former member of the Lucchese family of mobsters, died Tuesday in a Los Angeles hospital, according to a statement on his website. Hill passed away one day after his 69th birthday. The cause of Hill's death has not yet been released. The self-proclaimed mobster first came onto the media scene in the nonfiction book ""Wiseguy,"" by journalist Nicholas Pileggi, detailing the ""never-before-revealed day-to-day life of a working mobster -- his violence, his wild spending sprees, his wife, his mistresses, his code of honor,"" according to the book's back cover. The 1990 film, ""Goodfellas,"" depicted the rock-n-roll lifestyle of New York City mobsters -- everything from wealth and women to drugs and death. AMC has 'Goodfellas' series in development . ""You never rat on your friends and you always keep your mouth shut,"" Hill's character, played by Ray Liotta, was told in the movie. However, when Hill became worried his mob associates were out to kill him he became a police informant and ""ratted out"" scores of other gangsters. As the New York Times reported, the largest crime in which Hill participated was a theft at New York's Kennedy International Airport, when the clan stole $5 million in cash and another $1 million in jewels from a Lufthansa cargo terminal. Hill testified against his compatriots and was not prosecuted for the crime. He lived in relative obscurity until the film's success drew him out of hiding. Later in life, Hill became somewhat of a media magnet, appearing frequently in mafia documentaries and as a guest on ""The Howard Stern Show."" The mobster was quite prolific on his website, goodfellahenry.com, dedicating an entire section entitled the ""How to Be a Mobster Guide"" to dispensing tricks of the trade. In the guide, which he wrote was meant to be purely humor, Hill described how to ""pistol whip"", how to look good while on the run and the best ways to hide a corpse. Hill's longtime companion, Lisa Caserta told CBS News that he died surrounded by family members and that years of smoking and a recent heart attack were cause for his poor health. 2011: Original 'Goodfella' Henry Hill talks mafia busts .","Then man who inspired mobster film, ""Goodfellas,"" passed away at the age of 69 Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Fran Crippen, a star open-water swimmer, was at a competition in the United Arab Emirates when he made a promise to his longtime prep-school coach back in the states. He would call by 5 a.m. Saturday with the outcome and details of the 10-kilometer Marathon Swimming World Cup. Richard Shoulberg, who began coaching Crippen when he was 7 years old, knew something was wrong when the athlete had not called by 5:45 a.m. ET, he told CNN. Indeed, in the UAE, divers were searching for Crippen after he did not finish the race. They found his body two hours later. The loss of Crippen, 26, hit hard in suburban Philadelphia, where he grew up in a family of swimmers who trained and began competing there. Crippen was on target to achieve his goal of being an Olympian -- a dream cut short. ""We're all grieving. We're all in shock,"" Shoulberg said. Doctors determined that severe fatigue was behind Crippen's sudden death, UAE Swimming Federation Secretary Saeed Al Hamour told CNN Sunday. Earlier, however, the head of the water sports club in Fujairah, Ahmed Ibrahim, said that preliminary tests showed that he suffered a heart attack. The official report released by the UAE Swimming Federation made no mention of a heart attack. ""We do not know,"" Shoulberg said about the cause of death, adding that Crippen was ""fit as a fiddle."" Crippen died Saturday during the last leg of the Marathon Swimming World Cup in Fujairah, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) said in a news release. The cause of death is under investigation, FINA said. In a conversation with Shoulberg 12 hours before the race, Crippen said that the outside temperature was 100 degrees and that the water was 87 degrees. The high temperatures have led to some speculation that it may have contributed to the death. However, Al Hamour denied any reports that Crippen's death may have been caused by water temperature or cleanliness. ""The competition was monitored and supervised by the International Swimming Federation. All security measures were taken care of as needed,"" Al Hamour said. ""We've organized so far 14 competitions and championships and never had any death."" Swimming World magazine reported that Crippen fell unconscious during the event and was found by deep-sea divers two hours later near the race's final buoy. The U.S. Olympic Committee issued a statement Saturday saying it was ""extremely saddened"" to learn of Crippen's death. ""We send our condolences and deepest sympathies to the Crippen family as well as to our entire swimming community,"" the USOC statement said. ""While details of this tragedy are still forthcoming, we shall keep this outstanding young athlete and his family in our thoughts and prayers."" Crippen won bronze in the 10-kilometer event at the 2009 FINA World Championships and was the gold medalist in the same event at the 2007 Pan American games, according to USA Swimming. Crippen, of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, was inspired to take up swimming at age 6 after watching older sister Maddy Crippen compete in the water. Maddy Crippen was a member of the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, according to USA Swimming. Crippen graduated in 2006 from the University of Virginia where he was twice named Atlantic Coast Conference Swimmer of the Year. He was to be inducted into the athletic hall of fame of his former prep school, the Germantown Academy next month. Instead, he is being remembered as a dedicated swimmer who gave his time to teaching young children how to swim, and introducing high school swimmers to open-water swimming. ""He was an unselfish human being,"" Shoulberg said. Crippen's body will be handed over to U.S. Swimming Federation authorities on Monday. Shoulberg said he hoped his body would be brought home within 48 to 72 hours. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","NEW: Coach says swimmer was in great shape .

"(CNN) -- Suede slip-ons, elegant high-heels or lace-up brogues -- whatever shoes you wear in an important business meeting you want to look your shiny best. Some people apply polish with a brush and others choose a cloth, while those coming from afar often leave the task to the capable hands of craftsmen who can make travel-worn footwear look like brand new. If someone has shined your shoes in a South African airport, it's probably thanks to Lere Mgayiya. ""We're the biggest shoe-shine company in Africa,"" he explains without sounding arrogant. ""In Johannesburg we shine about 350 pairs of shoes a day, and about 120 pairs in Cape Town and another 120 in Durban."" In total, Lere's Shoe Shine business has 45 employees across the three major airports, and the boss is now eyeing partnerships in America and UK, as well as expansion across Africa. On this particularly day, Mgayiya, 40, is wearing Clarks -- black slip-ons. With annual revenue nearing 2.5 million rand ($227,000), his demeanor resembles his feet -- comfortable. But things weren't always on such a sure footing for Mgayiya. The resourceful South African had to go through a string of failures to get to where he is today -- a spectacular entrepreneurial journey of risk, belief and reward. Airborne beginnings . Long before becoming South Africa's shoe shining king, Mgayiya started his professional career distributing boarding cards for South African Airways. But after five years with the airline and a promotion to supervisor, Mgayiya was made redundant. ""I wasn't ready to leave,"" he recalls. ""If the truth be told, I was afraid -- it gave me a push."" Mgayiya stopped handling paper and joined the family livestock transportation business. ""I enjoyed being out and about,"" he says, while explaining his role negotiating with farmers. ""I enjoyed setting my own goals and achieving them."" But life in a family business wasn't all plain-sailing. When Mgayiya suggested taking a loan and securing exclusive contracts, his uncle asked him to move on. After a year, he was jobless again. Failed attempts . His mother's brother took away his job, but Mgayiya kept in contact with his farmer clients and soon embarked on his next project: selling the farmers' eggs to the kitchen of the South African parliament. Making just $6 profit per egg box, this however was not a lucrative operation. ""I fell behind with payments to farmers,"" he remembers. ""I didn't have money to start my car. You need big pockets to run a supply business."" When his chips were down, Mgayiya stayed optimistic and entered the Sandlam Money Game -- a TV competition for entrepreneurs. Marketing execs at Red Bull liked his advertising idea, and Mgayiya won the game. ""I got 35,000 Rand ($3,100) in two days,"" he says. ""It was great."" He took that money and invested it all in a tree-planting company which he then started working for. But six months later things went sour, and Mgayiya was penniless again and back at square one. Mgayiya had already experienced hard times, but the year to come was to test his resolve. ""I needed a steady income, so I decided on a shoe-shining business at Cape Town airport. A hungry man can't think, and I was starving."" He got in touch with his contacts from his airline days and applied for the business space in November 2002. The authorities took until September 2003 to give him the go ahead. ""In that year I sold my car...I worked as a receptionist for three months. I begged and borrowed just to make ends meet."" Business beginnings . Before he could start shining shoes, Mgayiya pawned his fridge to buy business equipment. But on his first day Mgayiya and his sole employee arrived to bad news. ""The supplier I had paid to provide pedestals failed to deliver,"" Mgayiya remembers. ""I polished shoes in my lap."" In the beginning, both staff members worked flat out 5am to 9pm every day of the week except Sunday. ""I left the house before my family woke up, and only got home after my young daughter had gone to sleep,"" he recalls. ""It was tough."" But customer numbers soon got a boost after a client suggested that the business name should highlight the personal, chatty aspect of the business. ""Airport Shoeshine"" became ""Lere's Shoe Shine,"" and people liked it -- after just four months. the team had grown to five and business was booming. Big plans . Success in Cape Town didn't cool Mgayiya's ambition, and after a year he got a chance to pitch to the person in charge of all South African airports. She liked his idea, and expansion started soon after. At its height, the company had 60 employees in five airports across the country. Today, Mgayiya has scaled back to the three major ones: Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg. ""I have my own house and send my daughter to private school,"" he beams. ""And I could afford to get married -- a proper marriage."" He no longer works from 5am to 9pm either. ""I just do the one shift from 12,"" he says, laughing. ""The family loved that one."" ""When starting a business in South Africa, you need self-belief,"" is his top advice for young entrepreneurs. ""All the conditions will never all be favorable at the same time. If you don't start, you won't go anywhere -- you have to start."" While he's under way now, Mgayiya shows no signs of stopping. He has his eyes on Angola, Kenya and Nigeria for expansion, as well as partnerships in U.K. and America. His shine for business may have emerged from a number of failures, but this entrepreneur shows how smudges and setbacks shouldn't get in the way of success.

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- An effort to halt advancing militant Islamist forces has resulted in ""many deaths"" in northern Mali, a military spokesman said -- with the fatalities including Malian soldiers, insurgents and a French pilot killed in a helicopter raid. Mali is being joined by France -- its former colonial ruler, which recently sent troops there -- as it tries to beat back advances by forces linked to al Qaeda. Much action recently has focused in and around the key northern city of Konna, which insurgents took on Thursday only to retreat the following day after a combined air and ground assault. ""There were many deaths on both sides, both rebels and government soldiers,"" Malian defense ministry spokesman Lt. Col. Diara Kone said Saturday of the fighting in the northern part of the country. The government, in a statement read on state TV, said 11 of its soldiers died and about 60 were wounded in the battle for Konna. The French pilot died while taking part Friday afternoon in an aerial operation targeting a terrorist group moving on the town of Mopti, near Konna, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. The aerial offensive -- which includes strikes by French fighter jets -- continued through Friday night and into Saturday, the minister added. ""Every means was used in fighting the Islamists, including two attack helicopters. They sent the Islamists fleeing,"" Kone told CNN. ""This shows that the Malian army is capable to fight."" French President Francois Hollande also cheered after ""a blow was delivered and heavy losses were inflicted,"" which he credited in part to the efforts of his nation's troops. ""But our mission is not over,"" he said Saturday. The Islamist forces' movement in recent days from their strongholds in the deserts of northern Mali prompted France to help address what Le Drian called a ""serious"" and deteriorating situation, even as France has resisted efforts to get involved in curbing other rebellions in such former colonies as the Central African Republic. Mali's interim President Dioncounda Traore declared a state of emergency nationwide Friday and called for ""a general mobilization"" to defend against the radical Islamists' advance. State of emergency declared in Mali . ""Terrorist groups want to destabilize the country,"" the French minister said. ""We are determined to prevent them doing so, within the strict framework of international law."" Radical Islamists make push southward . After decades of military rule, Mali held its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the country's largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who themselves wound up in control of a large area as the Tuaregs retreated. The United Nations says amputations, floggings and public executions -- like the stoning of a couple in July, who'd reportedly had an affair -- became common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law by banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines. Read more: Northern Mali a 'magnet for international jihadis' Already, the armed groups' activity -- along with a pervasive drought -- has led hundreds of thousands of Malians to be displaced. And the Islamists' movement southward has raised concerns among leaders in West Africa and elsewhere, some of them calling for swift and decisive military intervention to aid Mali's government, based in Bamako. The Economic Community of West African States plans to hold an emergency meeting in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to prepare to send troops to Mali to help government forces, a spokesman for the organization said. The spokesman, Sunny Ugoh, said West African troops are expected to number 3,500 and will operate in the framework of the United Nations resolutions. The meeting will also discuss any ""additional measures need to be taken,"" he added. Read more: International leaders push for military intervention in Mali . Several hundred French troops have been deployed to Mali, where about 6,000 French citizens live, according to Le Drian. ""Our determination to combat terrorism is total,"" the French defense minister said. ""France will do all it can to combat the jihadist groups who have launched this offensive in recent days."" 'The terrorists' breakthrough must be stopped' Hollande said the influx of troops from his nation and others is to ""allow Mali to recover its territorial integrity in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions."" ""France, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,"" the French president said Saturday. ""That is why its action is supported by the international community and saluted by all African countries."" Though its troops are posted in locations around Africa, French leaders earlier said they wouldn't send combat troops to Mali and that they'd scale back France's military interventions on the continent. So its decision to get involved in Mali, an operation Hollande said ""will last as long as necessary,"" underlies the seriousness of France's concern about the situation there. French hostages have been taken in neighboring Niger by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Paris appears intent on containing any further militant expansion in the heart of Africa. Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali? ""The terrorists' breakthrough must be stopped,"" said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, justifying France's efforts ""to train and reshape the Malian army."" ""If not, (all of) Mali falls into their hands, with a threat to the whole of Africa and Europe."" The U.N. Security Council last month authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in the country. ECOWAS members pledged thousands of troops, and the Security Council has urged other nations to contribute forces as well. Hollande spoke Saturday evening with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who consented for the United Kingdom to ""provide logistical military assistance to help transport foreign troops and equipment quickly to Mali"" -- but no ""British personnel in a combat role"" -- a Downing Street spokesman said. France has been in contact with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta about the situation, as well as its African and European allies, according to Le Drian. The U.S. military is weighing its options -- which could include logistical support and intelligence sharing with France -- said a U.S. defense official, who declined to be named because no decisions have been made. ""This is a serious issue, and ... the United States is committed to going after terrorists wherever they may be in order to protect American interests, but also those of our partners and allies around the world,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said this week. Journalist Katarina Hoije reported from Bamako, while CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Greg Botelho reported and wrote the story from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- A bill that would keep sealed some photos and documents from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting investigation passed overwhelmingly in the Connecticut legislature early Wednesday. The new legislation blocks public disclosure of any visual images depicting those who died in the shooting on grounds that release of the images would ""constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the victim or the victim's surviving family members,"" according to the bill. The bill passed in the state Senate just after 1:30 a.m., with 33 senators voting in favor of the bill and two voting against. It passed in the state House at 2 a.m. on a vote of 130 in favor, and two against. Lawmakers were working late hours to clear legislation before scheduled adjournment this week. The bill would prevent any graphic visual evidence of slain individuals from being released even through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) filings. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy supports the measure and is expected to sign it later this week, said deputy press secretary David Bednarz. Newtown school district to get $1.3 million from Education Department . All 911 recordings will still be publicly available, as well as audio recordings of first-responders, fire fighters and police. However, any audio recordings with graphic descriptions of a victims' bodies will be redacted. A task force will also be established to ""consider and make recommendations regarding the balance between victim privacy under the Freedom of Information Act and the public's right to know,"" the bill says. An earlier draft of the bill limited the new legislation specifically to the Newtown case. However, the final draft passed Wednesday was expanded to include all homicide victims in Connecticut. ""My goal with this legislation was to provide some measure of protection for the families affected by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. But the fact is, all families have a right to grieve in private. Those who lose loved ones to violence have a right to protect themselves against further anguish,"" Malloy said in a statement. State Senate Minority Leader John McKinney represents the Newtown area and was a chief proponent of the bill. He commended the families of Newtown victims for speaking out in support of the measure. ""The families have shown tremendous courage in coming to the Capitol and publicly asking the legislature to protect their privacy rights with respect to the graphic evidence and crime scene photographs of their murdered children and loved ones,"" said McKinney, a Republican. The new law drew concern from others who feared the bill would limit freedom of information and hamper future investigations. State Sen. Ed Meyer, one of two senators who voted against the bill, noted that the Newtown crimes were committed on public property and the photos and recordings were taken by public officers. ""The suppression of horrific crimes committed on public property and recorded by public officials is not consistent with a free and open society,"" Meyer, a Democrat, wrote in a statement. Sandy Hook task force recommends demolition and rebuilding . Meyer, a father of six and grandfather of 13, said he identifies greatly with the sadness that Newtown families feel, but believes that withholding certain pieces of evidence from the public will have long-term negative effects. ""The more we understand about our ugliness, the better chance we have to overcome that ugliness. Suppression of horrific conduct, as this bill dictates, invites history to repeat itself,"" Meyer said. McKinney noted that while he has been a strong advocate of freedom-of-information laws, he was ""unapologetic"" about supporting the efforts of Newtown families to keep gruesome photos and details from public view. The final bill required extensive compromise from both, requiring all members of Connecticut's General Assembly ""to balance deeply held beliefs and important public policy values,"" the governor said. Malloy commended the legislators ""on coming to an agreement that respects the privacy of grieving families."" All future FOIA requests will go through the Freedom of Information Commission in Connecticut. Commission members will now have to weigh whether to publicly disclose images based on this new law, said Brett R. Cody, spokesman for McKinney. Requests for evidence will continue to be considered carefully, but ""when privacy rights of victims and their families outweigh freedom of information, those privacy rights will be protected,"" said Cody. The passage of the bill comes just under seven months after a lone gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. After fatally shooting his mother at home, Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six educators before taking his own life.

"(CNN) -- Zero to sixty miles in 2.5 seconds. 887 horse power. And a price tag of $1 million. There is only one thing that doesn't fit the usual supercar narrative when it comes to the Porsche 918 Spyder -- a hybrid engine under its sleek and seductive silhouette. Manufactured by hand in a workshop at Porsche's Stuttgart headquarters, the car was masterminded with the latest technology, which includes a high-performance hybrid battery developed specially for the Spyder. In addition to the combustion engine, the car has two electric motors and can be charged in under two hours. ""With the extra boost we get from the electric motors, we really increased tremendously the drivability with the four wheel drive and also the push of the car,"" says Frank-Steffen Walliser, who is leading the 918 project. Alongside its green credentials, the Spyder aims for exclusivity, with only 918 of these road racers planned for manufacture. A regular Porsche engine takes between three and four hours to build, but for Spyder 918 the figure is closer to 20: ""The concept they use here at Porsche is one man, one motor,"" says Walliser, ""that means a single worker is responsible for building an entire engine. That takes a lot of time."" Green revolution . With pledges by EU leaders to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the auto industry has increasingly been under pressure to come up with more environmentally-friendly vehicles, with even high-end brands starting to build electric and hybrid cars. BMW is leading the way with fully electric i3 model, as well as the i8 hybrid sports cars, and Mercedes will soon introduce the B Class electric drive with a range of up to 200 kilometers, or 125 miles. ""CO2 reduction in general is the most important debate in the whole automotive industry, transport industry,"" says Frank-Steffen Walliser. ""Hybrid will be one of the solutions, but I believe that there will be no major solution. It's hybrid, it's diesel technology, it's pure electric, but it depends much more on where you use the cars -- is it a city car, a sports car, a van an SUV, or whatever."" Key industry . Germany's car production is third-highest in the world, and the country's economy relies heavily on its automobile industry which employs around 900,000 people, according to the German Association of Automotive Industry. ""The German auto industry for Germany is the key industry, the key innovator,"" says Ulrich Eichhorn, the organization's managing director for technology and environment. ""Alternative drive systems are very important for us because they dictate how well the cars function, how their sustainability and environmental acceptability are and of course how well they sell,"" he adds. It seems that with luxury brands entering the market, hybrids are about to spice up their practical, worthy image to something much more glamorous.

"Washington (CNN) -- For an issue such as health care reform -- and the potential to affect nearly American in a fundamental way -- no one provision, no one medical crisis, no one family can fully represent the complexity and sweep of the Affordable Care Act. But the polar views of small-business owners John Nicholson and Miles Fawcett provide a glimpse of the personal stakes and deep divide that will be felt across the social, political and legal tapestry. That signature law promoted by President Barack Obama is now being challenged at the Supreme Court. Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' ""Government isn't the answer, government can point to directions. Government can help solidify public involvement in what objectives should we pursue, but the advantage to the private system is you can have changes and modifications,"" said Nicholson, co-owner with his wife of Company Flowers, a Washington-area florist and gift shop. ""Over a period of time it works better than the government saying: this is it."" He slaps his hand to illustrate what he sees as burdensome, bureaucratic mandates. But Fawcett sees things another way. He founded a home security firm, Urban Alarm, nine years ago and uses the medical crisis of his youngest daughter to support the idea of universal health care. ""This law or protections for children getting insurance is critical and potentially a life or death decision,"" he said about ensuring that even those with pre-existing medical conditions be assured coverage. ""So having access to that health insurance is a life or death issue. It's critical for her now, it's critical to her and kids like her for the rest of their lives."" For Fawcett, a newborn in the throes of crisis . At nine weeks, Miles Fawcett's newborn daughter was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare birth defect targeting the bile ducts. The only solution was a liver transplant, and the search was on for a suitable donor. Doctors at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington found a match in Fawcett himself. ""They planned the transplant date. The preparation for the transplant was to make sure that she was as healthy as possible so that the outcome was going to be as successful as possible,"" he told CNN. ""They removed 13% of my liver and replaced her entire liver with that graft of my liver. The medication that she requires is a lifelong requirement. And so she'll be on life-sustaining medicines presumably for the rest of her life."" Now 5, the rambunctious kindergartner plays happily in her yard on a recent warm late winter day. She has little outward sign of her medical condition, but her parents say the girl does like to show off her belly scar to classmates. ""So she's really lucky, we're lucky that the underlying issue is gone,"" said the 42-year-old Fawcett, talking in the kitchen with his wife. ""It's fantastic, and it's magical, and every day we feel how lucky we are to have been in a time and a place when this was even an option."" For Nicholson, a dreaded deluge of paperwork . John Nicholson is justifiably proud of the flower shop he and his wife started two decades ago, after an earlier career as head of a trade association. He now mostly handles the paperwork, while Marnie mans the counter, the creative force behind the company's unusual floral arrangements. ""You buy our artistic creativity. It's a very major difference,"" he told CNN. They employ about 15 people, many part-time, and Nicholson says the economic downturn has been tough on their bottom line. ""We used some of our retirement money to keep the doors open, keep our employees. We cut back a little bit, but not a lot,"" he explained. ""And we're very glad that we did because now we're slowly but surely getting back to where we might actually make some money this year."" Reform opponent: 'Congress made a bad situation worse' Reform supporter: 'This really is going to help the public' The Nicholsons -- both are older than 65 -- have always offered health care to their staff. They participate in a private pool with other small businesses that offers reduced costs and more portability. He worries the new health law will not provide better quality of care or better choices, just more bureaucracy. ""Obamacare really affects only the method by which you obtain health care. That's the sadness of that bill, it does nothing to reduce costs. What it does do is change the procedures,"" he said. ""And I'm the only one in the shop that knows about all the procedures and it means basically that all of a sudden, I'm going to have to answer to government, filling out forms. And my experience is when I do that it's a lot longer, it covers a lot of stuff that is extraneous, and thank you just the same -- I'm more than happy to stay with the private side and let the government forms go somewhere else."" The law, known as the Affordable Care Act, does have several provisions to help make health care affordable for small businesses. Nicholson and many independent business owners like some aspects, but think there will be devastating tradeoffs. They also worry the law, if upheld, will only be the start of more government intervention in their free enterprise commerce. 'A simple question ... a very complicated answer' Miles Fawcett's family crisis four years ago came when he was leaving his employer to start Urban Alarm with his wife, Mira Saxena. They, too, employ about about 15 people. ""As a small-business owner, I'm always concerned about controlling costs but that has to come second to just what fundamentally is right for kids and for people,"" he said. ""I'm concerned about it being more expensive, but that's always a concern. I'm worried about gas prices going up, I'm concerned about how my premiums are going to be affected, but that's a secondary consideration. And the primary concern has to be how do we provide the resources that our employees need and that our families need."" Frequently asked questions about the high court and this case . The couple believes the law's wide scope and its particular emphasis on helping small businesses like theirs will ensure they can continue to thrive economically. They especially like the provision guaranteeing anyone with a pre-existing condition like their daughter's will not be denied health care coverage as she grows into an adult, something they equate as a basic human right. ""Are we going to deny children, much less anybody, but are we going to deny children a right to health services that are life-sustaining?"" said Miles. ""I think that's the question and it's a simple question, and I know it's a very complicated answer."" Will flower shop fade under government's shadow? Like Fawcett, Nicholson supports the idea of universal health care to make sure every American can get access to needed medical care at any point in their lives. The question that has divided the country for decades is how to achieve it and how to pay for it. For the local florist, flexibility is the key. ""I don't have much strength to be able to make changes, if the changes come down the pipe, that are contrary to what really makes sense for us,"" he explained. ""And that's the real problem: How do I get enough clout from a common sense standpoint, so that we can really say: 'OK, good idea, but not this way, let's do it that way.' And the government doesn't work that way."" The grandfather with grown children worries how health care costs -- with or without the Affordable Care Act -- will affect future generations. But he says the immediate focus is on his financial future and that of his beloved flower shop. ""The law is making it hard to be a small business,"" he said. ""Basically we're jogging along, and it's particularly difficult when we have more and more government layered on top of us."" CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan contributed to this report .","Small-business owners John Nicholson and Miles Fawcett do not see eye-to-eye .
Fawcett likes the plan -- he says it puts children like his ill daughter first .
Nicholson doesn't like it -- he fears his small business will choke on the regulations .
Both agree there are no easy answers to make sure everyone has health care ."
"(CNN) -- Thomas Menino, who retired this year as the longest-serving mayor in Boston history, died Thursday morning after a battle with cancer, according to his spokeswoman, Dorothy Joyce. He was 71. Menino, who presided over the city's highly lauded urban renewal during his more than 20 years as mayor, announced in March 2013 that he wouldn't run for a sixth term -- a decision that followed weeks of hospitalization for a respiratory infection and other health problems. Two months after stepping down following the end of his final term in January, he announced that he was diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer that had spread to his liver and lymph nodes. 'Embodiment of the city he loved and led' ""Bold, big-hearted, and Boston strong, Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""As Boston's longest-serving mayor, Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant, welcoming, world-class place it is today. His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize, every school he helped turn around, and every community he helped make a safer, better place to live,"" Obama said. Menino became Boston's 53rd mayor in 1993 and served as a city council member before that. ""Somebody has to be in charge of the city,"" Menino told CNN earlier this month. ""If you want to turn it over to all the bureaucrats, nothing would get done. Who should make the ultimate decision? The mayor of Boston had to do that. That's who I was for 20 years. I made sure that things got done."" 'A great loss' to Boston . Boston Cardinal-Archbishop Sean O'Malley called Menino a man ""who placed family, faith and public service above all else."" ""His passing is a great loss to the City of Boston, the Commonwealth, our country, and to his family, who were the center of his life,"" O'Malley said. The archbishop said generations of Boston residents benefited from his ""care and concern."" ""Under Mayor Menino's leadership, the City of Boston achieved world class status while he always remained keenly focused on the needs and concerns of the city's neighborhoods and its people,"" O'Malley said in a statement. 'Terrific mayor' In a statement, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Menino was ""a terrific mayor and a close partner."" In 2006, Bloomberg said he and Menino formed Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that began as a meeting of 15 mayors and eventually grew to include more than 1,000 mayors from around the country. ""Whether it was tackling illegal guns or reviving neighborhoods, Tom was never afraid to take on tough issues,"" Bloomberg said. ""He cared deeply about the people of Boston, and he was tireless in making his city a better place to live and work."" After the April 15, 2013, terror bombings at the Boston Marathon, which killed three people and wounded more than 260, Menino was ""steady as always, showing the same determined leadership that made his career in public service one of Boston's most important and most influential,"" Bloomberg said. ""Nothing can defeat the heart of the city,"" Menino said in the days after the bombings. ""Nothing. Nothing will take us down, because we take care of one another. Even with the smell of smoke in the air and blood on the streets, tears in our eyes, we triumphed over that hateful act."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who grew up in Boston, called the former mayor a legend. ""It's a striking fact that he was in office a very long period of time, maintained not only his popularity but his sense of connection to people at the neighborhood level, and did a lot to help that city become stronger,"" de Blasio told reporters. ""There's a lot that he did that helped make Boston a better place."" New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, a Boston native, headed the Boston Police Department when Menino was on the city council. ""The Boston I knew in 1970 versus the Boston of today -- its transformation was miraculous, and Tom Menino, for 20-some-odd years, led that city,"" he said. ""Tough guy, a really tough guy, and we butted heads on more than one occasion, but I was very saddened ... to hear of his passing."" Former presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney wrote on Facebook, ""Our hearts are heavy today with the loss of Tom Menino. Boston's giant passes on, but leaves behind a city grateful for his leadership and vision."" Cancer battle 'most profound challenge of his life' In March, Menino disclosed his illness to the Boston Globe. At the time, the former mayor began a chemotherapy regimen at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He told the Globe that doctors ruled out surgery because he fell in the 3% or 4 % of cancer patients whose cancer can't be traced to an origin point within the body. His battle with the disease, he said, was ""the most profound challenge of his life."" ""My attitude really is, we'll get through it,"" Menino told the paper. ""We got through the (illnesses in 2012), we'll get through this. I have great doctors and supportive friends."" ""What else can you do,"" he said. ""What I don't want is people feeling sorry for me. I don't want sympathy. There are people worse off than me. It's my biggest concern -- I don't want to be treated any differently."" The diagnosis took him completely by surprise, Menino said, but he was no stranger to medical hardship. During his tenure, he was hospitalized numerous times: for kidney stones in 1995 and 1997, for surgery to remove a tumor on his back in 2003, and when he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2004. In late 2012, the mayor spent eight weeks in Boston hospitals after he fell ill on a European vacation. During his hospitalization, he was diagnosed with a respiratory infection, a blood clot, a cracked vertebra and Type 2 diabetes. Menino's record fifth term ended early this year. ""The only reason I left it is because I had a schedule of about 18 hours a day,"" he told CNN. ""I had the will. I didn't have the energy.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant has conveyed leaders' dissatisfaction with al Qaeda's operations in Iraq, according to the U.S. military, which says it has uncovered letters authored by the terror outfit's No. 2 man. Ayman al-Zawahiri relayed complaints and advice from al Qaeda leaders, U.S. military officials say. Ayman al-Zawahiri allegedly wrote the March letters -- which the military released Wednesday and which were translated by CNN -- to Iraqi militant groups with ties to al Qaeda. ""It is in their own words. It is reflective of what they are saying about themselves,"" said Brig. Gen. David Perkins, a spokesman for the Multi-National Forces in Iraq. Al-Zawahiri conveys advice from al Qaeda's chief, bin Laden, on how to improve the group's performance and passed along dissatisfaction among al Qaeda members and leaders over a range of issues. Complaints revolve around the group's recruiting efforts, poor communication between al Qaeda central and al Qaeda in Iraq, ineffective and dishonest propaganda techniques, and the growing difficulty in moving ""assets"" from other countries into Iraq.  Watch how the letters suggest an internal dispute » . ""It has become very evident that it has become extremely difficult for al Qaeda to bring assets in from outside of Iraq,"" Perkins said. ""Therefore, we know more and more they have to generate their own operatives inside Iraq and they have to generate their own financial capabilities."" The first letter is to Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. The letter conveys accusations that al-Masri is too isolated to keep tabs on his operatives and questions his ability to lead al Qaeda's branch in Iraq. It also questions the manner in which al Qaeda in Iraq's umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, was established. Al-Zawahiri asks al-Masri to respond to the allegations from other al Qaeda leaders. ""[Al-Zawahiri] was concerned he wasn't getting any regular updates on Iraq. He wasn't getting any regular communication from al-Masri,"" Perkins said. ""He was very dissatisfied with the quality of recruits they were getting to conduct operations in Iraq."" The letter also criticizes the group's propaganda efforts, saying that the Islamic State of Iraq has distributed videos of past operations and claimed them to be new. The letter also states that the group has taken credit for operations carried out by other terror outfits, such as Islamic Jihad. ""The media policy for the Islamic State is using exaggeration, to the extent of lying,"" the letter says. The U.S. military says the propaganda failures are a result of aggressive U.S. operations in Iraq. The second letter is addressed to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq. It includes suggestions and advice that the letter says come from bin Laden. It also asks al-Baghdadi what his group needs to be victorious. The U.S. military has said it believes al-Baghdadi is a fictional character, portrayed by an actor in previous video statements and used as a front for al Qaeda leaders outside Iraq. It is unclear how the U.S. military obtained the letter to al-Baghdadi. The letter to al-Masri, however, was obtained in April during an operation that killed al Qaeda in Iraq Information Minister Abu Nizar. ""On April 24th in Baghdad, Coalition Forces identified Nizar, followed his vehicle and stopped it. As they approached the vehicle, Nizar got out and drew a pistol. Coalition Forces responded to the hostile threat by engaging and killing Nizar. He was positively identified through photo comparison and by one of his close associates,"" a military statement said. Nizar headed al Qaeda in Iraq's propaganda network and was a conduit between al-Masri and senior al Qaeda leaders. The letter to al-Masri was found on Nizar after he was killed. The Bush administration has touted its strides in the battle against al Qaeda in Iraq, the Sunni militant offshoot that emerged after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The military estimates that al Qaeda is operating with only a third of the fighters it had two years ago. Al Qaeda in Iraq, officials say, has been battered by military offensives in Baghdad, the largely Sunni Anbar province and other Sunni areas. It also has been weakened by growing support among Sunnis for the U.S. and Iraqi authorities. The Sunni support is reflected in the Awakening movement -- a collection of predominantly Sunni security councils of former insurgents or sympathizers who have turned against al Qaeda. Political reconciliation efforts directed toward Sunni Arabs also have helped harness their support. In contrast, al Qaeda has alienated Sunnis in Iraq with heavy-handed, divisive tactics, according to experts with the International Crisis Group. However, experts warn that al Qaeda is resilient, and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says there is always a danger of al Qaeda's re-emergence. Gates, who testified Wednesday before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, lauded security achievements in Iraq but noted ""the very real threat that al Qaeda continues to pose.""

"(CNN) -- Pakistani officials have for years secretly endorsed the U.S. drone program, even picking out at least one target for such an attack, according to a Washington Post report. Neither the White House, the U.S. State Department nor the Pakistani Foreign Ministry would comment on the story, which said top secret CIA documents and Pakistani memos obtained by the Post described at least 65 such strikes between late 2007 and late 2011. The story comes as Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif visited President Obama in Washington. Sharif told reporters he brought up the issue of drone strikes with Obama, ""emphasizing the need for an end to such strikes."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked Thursday about the report. ""I can't speak to specific operational issues,"" he said. ""What I can tell you is that on matters of bilateral cooperation and counterterrorism, we have regular conversations with Pakistan."" For years Pakistani officials have denounced any drone attacks, but the Post story says not only did they know about the strikes but they also actively participated in selecting some targets. One document from 2010 contains an entry about striking a site ""at the request of your government,"" the Post said. CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto said his sources have told him there has long been good cooperation between intelligence agencies in the two nations. The Post report echoes what former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said in April. But he said Pakistan's government signed off on strikes ""only on a few occasions, when a target was absolutely isolated and no chance of collateral damage."" Still, it was the first time a top past or present Pakistani official had admitted publicly to such a deal. Unmanned U.S. drones began launching attacks in Pakistan in 2004, by which time Musharraf had led the country for five years after taking power in a bloodless coup. He said Pakistani leaders would OK U.S. drone strikes after discussions involving military and intelligence units and only if ""there was no time for our own ... military to act."" Musharraf left office in 2008. In a statement Thursday, Musharraf's office stressed that ""during nine years of his rule, there were less than 10 drone strikes, all of which targeted militants, and a few of them were joint operations between [the] United States and Pakistan in locations that were not accessible to the ground forces of Pakistan."" The statement also noted that the former military ruler said in 2009 that ""these drone strikes had become indiscriminate and were losing their impact due to claims of collateral damage to the civilian population."" It said that Musharraf ""consistently demanded [that the] United States transfer drone technology to the Pakistan military, so Pakistan could take ownership in effectively targeting terrorists and also remedy the violation of Pakistan's sovereignty by [the] United States."" The Post report said the Pakistan government routinely received classified briefings, including before and after photographs, on the strikes. Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry, a spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, said Thursday that Islamabad doesn't ""comment on specific media reports citing unnamed sources."" Chaudhry reiterated Pakistan's public position on strikes in a written statement. ""Whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past, the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue. We regard such strikes as violations of our sovereignty as well as international law,"" it said. The number of drone attacks has been decreasing sharply in the past three years because of tighter rules imposed by the Obama administration and the success of the program in killing its targets. In August, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on a visit to Islamabad told a Pakistani television station that the United States hoped to end drone strikes there ""very, very soon."" President Obama has a ""very real timeline"" for ending the strikes, he said. This week, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released highly critical reports on U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. The groups said some of the attacks may have violated international law, a charge the White House denied. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Washington Post: Pakistan approved drone program, helped pick at least one target .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Marine shot and killed two of his fellow service members at a Virginia base Thursday night and then apparently killed himself, base officials said. The incident took place at Marine Corps Base Quantico. The shooter gunned down a man and a woman, the spokesmen said. All are Marines -- permanent personnel assigned to the officer candidate school. Authorities did not disclose a motive and were investigating the incident. The identities of the victims were not immediately disclosed as authorities worked to notify next of kin. ""It's been a long night,"" Col David Maxwell, the base commander, said Friday. The incident shocked the military community. It comes as the Corps grieves over another tragedy: the deaths of seven U.S. Marines in a training exercise in Nevada on Monday. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel ""was saddened to learn of the shootings at Marine Corps Base Quantico,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said Friday. ""This tragedy, as well as the tragedy in Nevada earlier this week, took the lives of Marines who volunteered to serve their nation. His heart and his prayers are with them and their families. He believes that the legendary strength of the United States Marine Corps will ensure that they are forever remembered,"" Little said. Base lockdown . Early Marine accounts said the notification of the shooting came late Thursday when authorities found one dead victim. Using a public address system, police announced a lockdown at the base and surrounded the building where the suspect was believed to be barricaded. They ordered everyone to stay in their homes, doors locked, they said. Authorities from the base and Prince William County, Virginia, surrounded the shooter, who was in a barracks not far from where the first shooting occurred. Law enforcement officials entered the barracks two hours later and discovered the shooter dead, apparently of a self-inflicted wound. The female victim was in the room with him, fatally shot. The lockdown ended early Friday, a few hours after it started. As dawn rose over the base, Maxwell told reporters that there were no barricades or a standoff but did not elaborate. The incident was confined to a single barracks at the candidate school. He said ""quick"" police reaction helped resolve the situation, first reported at 10:30 p.m. via an emergency call. Soon, security was heightened and a mass notification was issued throughout the base. Base restrictions were lifted a few hours later. Others in the officer candidate school were ""accounted for and safe."" ""As we take care of our Marines and their families that are dealing with this tragedy, I'd also ask for the support of our neighbors, the community, and their thoughts and prayers as well for our Marines who have lost their comrades-in-arms,"" Maxwell said. Quantico, a historic hothouse of Marine ideas and training . Visitors to the base will see a grand statue: the Iwo Jima Monument. It gives all who enter pause about the important role the base has played training generations of Marines in forging military doctrine and fighting America's wars. The statue depicts the historic flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, during the famous World War II battle there. The Quantico base, started during World War I, has been integral in training, education and forging military doctrine for America's battles. Early on, amphibious warfare was, the corps said, ""conceived and perfected"" there. The Marines there came up with the idea ""of carrying troops from ship to shore by helicopter."" Now, it's home to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, which conducts experiments in modern warfare. ""This is perhaps the only command whose mission touches the farthest reaches of the Corps; decisions made here impact Marines aboard ship, fighting in the Global War on Terrorism, on guard duty at embassies across the globe and reserve duty throughout the United States,"" the Marines said. Federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, share training facilities there. The base also has a reputation across popular culture as a key national security training location. Jack Ryan, writer Tom Clancy's well-known character in novels and films, for example, took officer training there. CNN's Jason Hanna and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","The shooter gunned down a man and a woman, base officials said .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Salvadoran national recently added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list for allegedly committing a 2011 murder in Colorado is under arrest, the FBI announced Wednesday. Edwin Ernesto Rivera Gracias was in El Salvador and after voluntarily agreeing to return to the United States to face charges he was flown to Denver on Wednesday, according to the FBI. He surrendered to Salvadoran authorities and FBI agents on Tuesday, said FBI spokesman Dave Joly. Rivera Gracias is accused of killing Richard Limon, 69, in August 2011. Law enforcement officials alleged that Rivera Gracias choked, beat and stabbed the man and then dumped his body in the mountains outside of Denver. According to the FBI, Limon was a long-tme family acquaintance of Rivera Gracias' teenage girlfriend. Rivera Gracias was in the United States allegedly illegally at the time of the Limon murder. The FBI described the suspect as between the age of 29 and 33 and said he was a member of the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang. He is said to have a number of tattoos including one of ""MS-13"" across his back. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles 20 years ago among Salvadoran immigrants fleeing the country's civil war. The government says it has now grown to about 10,000 members in the United States. In October, the Obama administration named the organization a transnational criminal enterprise, with the goal of freezing millions of dollars in profits from drug and sex trafficking operations. Rivera Gracias was added to the FBI's Top 10 list on March 14 and at that time law enforcement officials said they believed he had fled to his native country. The FBI announced a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his arrest. It's unclear if anyone will be receiving that reward money for tips provided in the case. In Wednesday's announcement the FBI said ""further reward information will not be made public."" The FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list was launched in 1950. The program seeks to publicize terrible crimes and get tips that lead to arrests. Rivera Gracias was the 498th person to make the roster. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was on the list until he was killed in Pakistan during a May 2011 raid by U.S. forces. Alleged Boston mob figure James ""Whitey"" Bulger spent more than a decade on the list and ultimately was captured in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California.","The FBI says the man is a member of the MS-13 gang .

"(CNN) -- What's a blogger to do when his blog is in turmoil? Well, blog about it, of course. Or, in the case of TechCrunch's MG Siegler, maybe ""rant"" is the more operative verb. On Tuesday morning, the powerful, frothy-mouthed tech blog's No. 2 man went off the digital rails, bemoaning a website that's ""on the precipice"" and ""may be over"" as we, the People of the Internet, know it. ""As soon as tomorrow, Mike may be thrown out of the company he founded,"" he wrote, referring to Michael Arrington, who founded TechCrunch. ""Or he may not. No one knows. And if he is, he will be replaced by -- well, again, no one knows. No one knows much of anything. Certainly no one at TechCrunch. This site is about to change forever and we're in the total f---ing dark."" The controversy stems from Arrington's recent decision to start a venture capital firm that would fund some of the companies his blog writes about. All of this happened out in the open, and AOL, which bought TechCrunch last September, seemed fine with it at first, according to media accounts. It even invested in Arrington's new $20 million venture, called CrunchBase. But journalists and other media outlets started lobbing criticism at TechCrunch and AOL, saying it's unethical for a guy who runs a blog as big as TechCrunch to also control a massive pot of money that could help make or break the subjects of its articles. Then AOL said Arrington had stepped down from his post and could write for the site, but only as an unpaid blogger. Siegler has plenty to say about all of this (note: If you're in AOL's human resources department, I think you'll definitely want to keep reading): . ""AOL seems to think that by cutting off the biggest conflicts -- ones so big that they'd obviously have to be disclosed -- that they'll be a bastion of integrity in the editorial landscape,"" he wrote. ""What a bunch of horse s---. The conflicts we need to worry about are the ones not disclosed."" David Carr, a media critic at The New York Times, doesn't buy this argument, in part because millions of dollars are at stake. ""TechCrunch is capable of tearing the limbs off a baby company, but it's been a generally nurturing place for start-ups when Mr. Arrington has skin in the game,"" he wrote in a much-circulated column. Carr writes: ""At this point, it seems that AOL executives would open up a lemonade stand in front of their headquarters if they thought it would help their bottom line. But the idea of a news site that covers every aspect of nascent tech companies sharing a brand name and founder with a venture capital firm financing these same companies seems almost comically over the line."" Other journalists have defended TechCrunch and Arrington. ""Arrington, remember, started TechCrunch not as a journalistic venture but instead to gather and share information about startups and to promote himself as an investor. He is returning to his roots,"" writes Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York. Arrington isn't trying to be an impartial journalist, Jarvis writes on his blog, BuzzMachine. ""He's trying to get information,"" he says. ""He does it well. He has covered startups better than any big paper."" The Atlantic Wire says the whole thing is ""playing out like a Shakespearean tragedy."" For his part, Siegler thinks his blog can survive all this turmoil -- even without Arrington. But TechCrunch won't be the same, he writes, since Arrington's savvy and personality percolate through all of the website's content. ""Could TechCrunch survive without Mike Arrington? Probably. We're doing so many pageviews now, and the machine is so profitable, that you can plug in other parts and it will run. But without him, it will not be the same. You might not think you'll miss what he brings, but you will. Quite often, you never even see what he brings. But it permeates the entire site.""","TechCrunch is a popular tech blog owned by AOL .

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- Rescuers planned to search for survivors under a mountain of concrete and twisted metal Friday night after a high-rise building collapsed in Tanzania. At least four people were dead and 60 were missing after the 16-story building under construction collapsed in Tanzania's largest city, government and emergency officials said. Five children are believed to be among the missing, rescue official Walji Ali said. The building collapsed Friday with a ""huge whoosh and then thump,"" said eyewitness Ali Jawad Bhimani, a hotel owner who lives near the building in Dar es Salaam's normally bustling Kariakoo central business district. ""The fallen building is next to our mosque. There is a small field there where the young boys play football. The building fell right on top,"" he said. ""But 10 to 15 of the boys playing got away safely and are unharmed."" A statement from the nearby mosque said that four of the boys believed to have been playing there were still missing. Police and search dogs quickly flooded the scene, Bhimani said. By Friday evening, the dogs were gone, replaced by heavy equipment being used to remove debris, he said. The Tanzanian Red Cross said rescue efforts would continue through the night. But the group also expressed relief that the casualty figures could have been far higher but the streets were relatively empty of vendors and shoppers due to a holiday. ""So far we have managed to rescue live at least 13 people and four dead bodies, two were seriously injured,"" Stella Marealle from the Red Cross said. In addition to the deaths, at least 17 people were injured, said Suleiman Kova, a regional police commander. Construction workers were among those injured, Ali said.

"(CNN) -- China's President Xi Jinping's choice of Moscow as his first foreign capital visit is being seen by analysts as a symbolic move that demonstrates the increasing interdependence of the one-time Cold War foes. From energy deals, trade and geo-politics, China and Russia have been in lock-step over a range of thorny international issues such as Syria, Iran and North Korea. A key element of the talks will be how to steer the future of the increasingly intertwined economies. Trade between Moscow and Beijing grew 11.6% to a record $88.1 billion in 2012, according to figures from the China Institute of International Relations. ""They want to move that to $100 billion in years to come - there's also a sense that they will want to push the domestic agenda and the foreign policy agenda as well,"" said CNN's David McKenzie. While China and Russia already form a powerful bloc on the U.N. Security Council, the warmer ties are also evidence of their perceived need to countervail a U.S.-led dominance in global affairs. ""In Putin, the Chinese see someone who is a counterbalance to America in some areas,"" said Professor Kerry Brown, executive director of the University of Sydney's China Studies Center. ""Russia is nowhere near as big as it was before but at least they see someone who can provide at least a bit of triangulation between China and the U.S."" Long-stalled talks on a Russia-China gas pipeline gas deal will likely top the agenda during Xi's summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vice-Foreign Minister Cheng Guoping and Russian ambassador to China Sergei Razov had recently struck a hopeful note in briefing in Beijing, saying that ""significant progress"" had been made and that both nations were looking forward to a breakthrough on the deal. Senior executives from state oil giants Petro China and Sinopec are accompanying Xi to Moscow where it is hoped the new Chinese president will give fresh impetus to pipeline talks. Nevertheless, the Russians have been cautious on the deal. ""On the Russian side, state media and others, are less confident that that deal will come through,"" McKenzie said. ""Certainly the Russians worry that this relationship will become more unequal over time. ""Russia's own economy has stagnated somewhat not having the robust growth we've seen in China."" Cheng told a briefing that Russia and China would co-ordinate reactions to U.S. plans to boost its missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region to counter the possibility of a potential North Korean attack. While Chinese and Russian officials have hailed the 48-hour visit as a demonstration of ties which they say are at an historic high, Professor Brown said that relations between the formerly fractious neighbors was often driven more by expedience than any real convergence of interests. ""It's hard to think of a more paranoid relationship in some ways: 1950s, very close; 1960s, biggest enemies. There's never really been a heart-to-heart moment in many ways. ""There's a quite deep distrust on one hand but on the other hand a pragmatic acceptance that this is a big relationship."" Xi and Putin will also likely compare notes ahead of the regional summit in South Africa next week of the BRICS group of developing economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Even here, analysts say, China's perception is that this bloc is heavily influenced by the U.S. ""The conviction in Beijing is that America is everywhere and they've got to find other ways of exercising their interests without America being right up beside them,"" Professor Brown said.","Xi Jinping to make first foreign visit to Moscow on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Prince Harry and a trekking team made up of servicemen and women reached the South Pole on Friday, organizers for the Walking With The Wounded charity said. Three teams of seven participants each, representing the United Kingdom, United States and the Commonwealth, which consists of several countries long affiliated with the British Empire, took part in the charity event. Originally, it was a race among the three teams to reach the South Pole, but organizers called off the competitive aspect because it was putting undue strain on the participants. Harry -- himself a member of Britain's armed forces, having served in Afghanistan and elsewhere -- has had a long association with this charity. In several ways, he's been preparing for this latest mission for a long time. That includes taking part in a Walking With The Wounded expedition to the North Pole -- even plunging into the Arctic Ocean's freezing waters -- in 2011 before withdrawing to attend his brother William's wedding. More recently, he traveled to Iceland for training and even spent 24 hours in an industrial freezer in preparation for the South Pole trek. The teams had to trek more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) across the sparse continent, in temperatures as low as -35 degrees Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit).

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- ""This one is for you,"" says Yana Romanova, the photo manager at the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center. She hands over a blue, numbered armband-come-sleeve which signifies to all at the Sochi Olympics venue that its wearer is a working photographer. ""Let me take your name as well, we might need it if I have to take away your accreditation,"" she adds with a smile, before revealing the fate of a photographer who recently made the mistake of crossing into a no-go zone. ""He ran onto the landing area of the ski jump to help an athlete who had fallen ... It was dangerous and against the rules, so last I heard he'd been barred from the rest of the Games."" The message has the desired effect on a writer adopting the role of photographer for one night only. Consequently, careful attention is paid to the briefing that Romanova leads 10 minutes later. Safety is the key, and it's made clear where we should not trespass if we want to stay on her good side. She refers to a map of the giant jump center where photographer positions are labeled and then fields questions from the 20-or-so snappers present who will be recording tonight's event for countless newspapers, websites and magazines around the world. Henry Stuart nods and takes in the information, assessing the potential of the various options being discussed for his specific task. As a specialist for photo agency Getty Images who creates 360-degree images, he needs to consider different aspects for successful delivery. ""At the ski jump, there's quite a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff which isn't very pretty. We need to chose a position that will optimize the panorama,"" Stuart tells CNN. ""So often what makes a brilliant photo in normal circumstances is wasted in a 360 because half of the picture is just snow, or mountains or mud, and it's not that interesting. We're trying to get a picture that will be interesting from every angle."" And with that we pick up our kit, swallow the final mouthfuls of Russian stew from the press-room kitchen and head outside to the bottom of the usually out-of-bounds chairlift that takes athletes and a select number of the media to the top of the looming slopes. The Jumping Center is one of the most spectacular venues at the Sochi Games, where two giant steel structures bolted to the northern slope of Aibga Ridge create the artificial angle and curves needed to propel brave athletes on a skywards trajectory. The chairlift scoops up photographers two at a time and heads up the mountain side pulled by its cable, leaving legs swinging in the cool air. Once at the top the work begins to assess the three positions available for the photographers to use for the ski jumping qualification that is due to start on the ""Large Hill"" in half an hour. The location at the top of the smaller slope will not be close enough to the action, despite the proximity to its dramatic plunge, so we walk down the wooden steps that bisect the two runways to a spot more suitable. ""So here, on the southeast side of the jump, just by the kickoff lip, has a good view of the valley -- which means the other 180 degrees I can fill with multiple frames of the skier at different points all the way down the hill,"" explains Stuart, as he puts down his bag to survey the surroundings. ""You also need to be careful of the TV cameras, so you don't get in any of their shots,"" he adds pointing to the bank of cameras who have their focus trained across our heads towards the launch area. ""It's always an issue for me because I have a three-meter-long pole with a camera fixed to the end. It gives you a really good perspective but you need to be wary about getting in the way of other people."" Stuart extends the carbon-fiber monopod to about two and a half meters. On the end of the pole his camera is fitted with a collared, very wide fish-eye lens that is controlled by a remote in his hand. As the skiers begin to whoosh past to spring into the night sky he rotates the camera around a ""nodal point"" firing the aperture into action. He takes four wide shots before concentrating on specific details needed for the final composite. ""I want to try to get in the picture the sense of the steepness and the speed of the skier, so that's the challenge for today,"" Stuart says. ""I can trigger (the camera) to get multiple frames of the skier taking the jump, so we'll have the whole story from top to bottom which I'll then overlay on the panorama. I'll take around 40 pictures per jump but will probably only use around 20 in the final composite image. ""With the crowd shots I used a different exposure to capture more of the detail -- the skier is a darker exposure with a faster shutter speed, which has to be adjusted for too. ""Especially because the floodlights here actually flicker, the human eye can't pick it up because it's too quick, but the camera does, and it makes a difference to the light on the shot. The final composite will be an amalgam of all the shots."" With the pictures captured, we begin the long journey down the vertiginous steps that run alongside the jump slope back down to the press center. Once there the laptop is unfolded and a program fired up that, with the help of algorithms and blending tools, stitches together the many images into one panorama. ""The tools are fantastic for taking distortion out of the lens, lining the images up and detecting where they match -- they'll detect points that are exactly the same in two images ... and will line up from these control points -- it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you but it also makes lots of mistakes which I then fix by hand,"" says Stuart as he manipulates the final product before filing down to Getty offices in time for the deadline. It seems athletes aren't the only individuals working on an aesthetic performance in the mountains of Sochi.","Henry Stuart specializes in producing 360-degree pictures for Getty Images in Sochi .

"Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary, hosts a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show; and wrote a guide to success for immigrants (""¡Adelante!"" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas. Rudy Ruiz says immigration reform can't wait for next year. SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- One of the greatest challenges for minorities in any democracy is that their priorities often differ with those of the majority. Consequently, even if a minority group does not experience outright tyranny, it can suffer tragic neglect. That's the lingering problem with immigration reform. Latino leaders have long called for comprehensive immigration reform. During the presidential campaign, it finally seemed destined for reality as candidates sought the crucial Latino vote. But today, where's immigration reform on the list of priorities? Apparently, it's plummeting faster than bank stocks were during the market's freefall. Maybe the president hoped we wouldn't notice. He mentioned it in passing while we were engrossed in the health care drama. And instead of telling us directly, in a meeting with the Latino leaders that supported his candidacy, he announced it while chatting with foreign heads of state. What did he say? No immigration reform until 2010. But since he's expending massive political capital on health care, and 2010 is a midterm election year renowned for inaction on controversial matters, the postponement is as menacing as the promise is dubious. ""Experience and history have told us if it's postponed to the following year, then you're talking about 2011,"" Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, told the San Antonio Express-News. But with health care and financial reforms, budget deficits, and tax hikes looming, what hurdles will we face by 2011? What realistic hopes remain for immigration reform? Rep. Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, said if a comprehensive bill isn't passed, ""We'll try to do it piecemeal."" ""Piecemeal"" is a favorite course for a Congress that finds bipartisan compromise unpalatable. But given the issue's persistent magnitude, such a response is tantamount to a negligent -- perhaps tyrannical -- master tossing a crumb from the table to a pack of ravenous, emaciated dogs. Instead, why don't we step up as a nation and face the challenge with a level of honor and attention that is consistent with the best of our ideals? After all, the Statue of Liberty raised its torch to welcome immigrants, not to light the way for the insurance executives and Wall Street bankers prioritized by policymakers today. I grew up on the border and I can honestly say, it pains me to watch us squander billions on a border fence when we've yet to see a man-made structure that can stop the forces of nature. What we call ""immigration"" -- in the case of Latinos -- is actually a pattern of migration, a natural movement of homo sapiens dying of thirst and hunger, seeking water and nourishment in more fertile grounds. Comprehensive immigration reform should thus be viewed as an essential measure to protect human rights on our soil and continent. This is a time to think big, not small. This is about more than laws and lines drawn on a map. It is about the origins of our humanity, not our nationality. Real people are suffering as raids continue, border deaths and hate crimes escalate, and families are destroyed. ""Without a solution, the problems will only worsen,"" I was told by Salvador Sanabria, executive director of El Rescate, a non-profit serving immigrants in Los Angeles, California, for 27 years. ""Comprehensive reform will save lives, keep families together and give immigrants the opportunity to contribute fully to America's economy and security. It's a humanitarian issue, but it'll also benefit America to do it right."" On an issue prioritized by the nation's largest, fastest-growing minority group, why not do it right? Why wait any longer? Even Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, in rare agreement with his Democratic counterparts, said he was disappointed by the delay. He said he is ""ready to work"" with the president on the issue. With our nation divided on many fronts, why can't we capitalize on bipartisan support for immigration reform now? Rather than blame competing priorities for procrastinating, why can't Washington wow us with a display of multitasking brilliance? At least immigration reform doesn't come with a price tag of a trillion dollars and a host of new taxes as health care reform does. That should make it popular by comparison. ""Reform is a priority in the Latino community,"" LULAC President Rosa Rosales told the San Antonio Express-News. ""I would strongly urge that Latino organizations push the issue that we need comprehensive immigration reform now."" Latino leaders should settle for nothing less. Latino voters should exhort all elected officials to act with the same urgency they would exhibit were it their own kin dying on the vine. Thomas Jefferson once said: ""All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent."" In that spirit, we should unite to make this not only a Latino priority, but an American priority. And all people of good conscience should speak up for what's right -- or risk creeping towards tyranny by neglect.

"Castel Gandolfo (CNN) -- Pope Francis had lunch Saturday with his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, in what the Vatican said was the first such encounter in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. Francis, who was inaugurated as the new head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics on Tuesday, has made some changes since taking the helm -- most notably by adopting a simpler, personal style and calling for the church to focus on serving the poor and needy. The new pontiff was flown to Castel Gandolfo by helicopter for the lunch date. He was greeted at the helipad by Benedict XVI, and the pair exchanged an embrace, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said. They then rode in a car together to the Castel Gandolfo residence. Both men wore simple white cassocks, but only Francis wore the white papal mantle and sash over his robe. The two then prayed together side-by-side in a chapel before meeting in a library at the residence for 45 minutes of talks ahead of lunch. Video footage released by the Vatican after Francis had returned to Vatican City showed the two men warmly clasping hands as they greeted each other. Benedict, who walked with the aid of a stick, looked frail and moved slowly as they entered the chapel to kneel together. Relations between Francis and his predecessor were warm and cordial, said Lombardi. Francis presented Benedict with the gift of a painting he said reminded him of the former pontiff's gifts to the church. Their meeting was ""a moment of profound and elevated communion,"" Lombardi told Vatican Radio. He suggested that Benedict would almost certainly have repeated the promise of obedience to the new pope that he gave in his final meeting with the cardinals before stepping down. The presence of both a pope and a living former pontiff has raised concerns over the potential for split loyalties within the church. Behind closed doors, pope supported civil unions in Argentina, activist says . Seen, but not heard . Lombardi declined to tell reporters what the pair discussed in the library, saying only that they were private talks. Vatican observers believe that one item on the agenda was the contents of a 300-page dossier presented by three cardinals to Benedict in the wake of the Vatileaks scandal. Benedict passed on the report -- ordered after leaks last year revealed claims of corruption within the Vatican hierarchy -- to his successor. Italian media reports suggested the cardinals had uncovered a series of scandals involving sex, money and power, but the Vatican press office sought to tamp down what it called a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories."" The pair may also have talked about possible appointments by Francis. The people he chooses to hold key roles may give an indication of his priorities for the church at a time when some are calling for reform and modernization of its hierarchy. They have spoken several times by telephone since Francis was elected 10 days ago, but this was their first face-to-face meeting, the Vatican said. 5 things to know about the new pope . Crowds who had gathered in the small town's central square waved and clapped as the white papal helicopter twice passed overhead before landing. Some chanted ""Francesco, Francesco"" -- the pope's name in Italian. According to police at Castel Gandolfo, the crowds numbered between 1,500 and 2,000. Many had gathered in the hope of seeing Francis appear at a balcony to wave, but they were disappointed. Life of seclusion . Francis was elected on March 13 after Benedict became the first pope in nearly 600 years to resign, citing age and frailty. A new pope usually takes the reins only following the death of his predecessor. The hilltop castle overlooking a lake is the summer papal residence and has been home to Benedict since he left Vatican City on February 28. Benedict's last public appearance was at a window of the castle, when he blessed the crowds below before retiring into seclusion. The pope emeritus is expected to move back to Vatican City at the end of April, once restoration work on a small monastery within its grounds is complete. There, he will devote himself to prayer and study. Benedict ""has attentively followed the events of recent days,"" including Francis' inauguration Mass before crowds of well wishers and dignitaries, the Vatican said. When the last pope to resign, Gregory XII, stepped down in 1415 it was to help resolve the worst institutional crisis in the church's history -- a schism that had led to three rival claimants to the papacy. And when former hermit Pope Celestine V resigned in 1294 after less than six months in office, he was imprisoned soon afterward by his successor, Pope Boniface VIII. Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . Busy week ahead . Pope Francis, meanwhile, is starting to get to grips with his new role now that the pomp and ceremony of his inauguration is out of the way. On Friday, he met with the Vatican diplomatic corps and thanked them for the work they do to ""build peace and construct bridges of friendship and fraternity"" with some 180 states around the world. ""Through you I encounter your peoples, and thus in a sense I can reach out to every one of your fellow citizens, with their joys, their troubles, their expectations, their desires,"" he said. The coming week, which leads up to Easter Sunday, will be a busy one for the new pontiff, starting with Palm Sunday Mass. On Thursday, Francis will break with tradition by celebrating the Mass of the Lord's Supper -- which is centered on the gesture of the washing of feet -- at the Casal del Marmo youth detention center, the Vatican said. The service has in past years been held at the grand Basilica of St. John Lateran, the official seat of the bishop of Rome. ""In his ministry as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Bergoglio used to celebrate the Mass in a prison or hospital or hospice for the poor and marginalized,"" the Vatican said in a statement. ""With this celebration at Casal del Marmo, Pope Francis will continue his custom, which is characterized by its humble context."" It will not be the first time Francis visits the prison. He was there in March 2007 to celebrate Mass. Peek inside the pope's closet .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Portage, Wisconsin, worked Sunday to evacuate residents as a levee along the Wisconsin River approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week. ""It could collapse at any time,"" said Greg Matthews, a spokesman for Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources. An alert sent out by Columbia County Emergency Management on Sunday urged residents near Blackhawk Park to evacuate immediately ahead of the flooding, which is expected to wash out a main road leading to about 150 residences. ""Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents,"" the statement said. By 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), it was unclear how many residents remained in their homes, said Kathy Johnson, the deputy director of the county's emergency management department. ""Anyone in there right now won't be able to come out,"" she told CNN. A Red Cross shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents. The Wisconsin River crested Sunday at 20.4 feet -- nearly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the 120-year-old Caledonia-Lewiston levee system. Officials with the Department of Natural Resources have been monitoring the levee all week and working to repair any problem areas, but Matthews said Sunday that ""this is one problem we have not been able to contain and it's getting worse."" The levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- ""without any engineering design or adherence to any standards,"" DNR said in a statement Friday. ""This is a 120-year-old relic,"" Matthews said. ""It's made of sand. ... A modern levee that our engineers would be familiar with would be constructed of steel and concrete. So if it does fail we really quite frankly don't know the extent and scope of what might happen."" The river is expected to begin gradually falling Sunday evening before dropping below flood stage by Wednesday, the weather service said. The levee's anticipated failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota. Floodgates along the Menominee River in Niagara, Wisconsin, were opened earlier this week to ease pressure on dams. Video showed a torrent of water gushing from the overflowing dam. ""I have never seen the water rage down like it is,"" CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said. In Northfield, Minnesota, authorities called late last week for large scale sandbagging in an effort to protect homes and businesses from the rising Cannon River Canal, according to iReporter Peter Holland. And in Biron, Wisconsin, just north of Wisconsin Rapids in the central portion of the state, iReporter Tim Krause said Saturday that the flooding is ""starting to get a bit scary. We have houses that are flooding in our neighborhood."" CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding. ""Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they're still in flood, so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days,"" Jeras said. ""Many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the Mississippi River which then in turn will rise up and we'll see some flooding there, maybe in La Crosse and the Winona areas later in the week."" CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this report.","The aging levee system is under pressure after heavy rainfall last week .

"(CNN) -- The top proponent of the new Arizona law targeting the state's ethnic studies programs defends the controversial measure, which bans ethnic studies classes that ""promote resentment"" of other racial groups. State Schools Superintendent Tom Horne told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Thursday that the legislation is ""designed to get schools to teach kids to treat each other as individuals and not on the basis of what race they were born into."" Horne said he believes that the ""fundamental American value is that we are individuals"" and ""not exemplars of the race we happen to be born into. What's important is what we know, what we can do, what is our character."" The superintendent has been targeting an ethnic studies curriculum in Tucson that he says ""divided the kids into different races"" -- African studies for African-Americans, ""Raza"" studies for Latino youths and Asian studies for Asians. ""In the Raza studies, they were teaching kids that the United States is oppressive, they were making them angry. They used a Marxist book, the 'Pedagogy of the Oppressed,' "" he said. Signed into law on Tuesday, the new legislation forbids classes ""designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group"" that advocate ""the overthrow of the United States government"" or ""resentment toward a race or class of people."" It also forbids classes that ""advocate ethnic solidarity"" instead of treating pupils as individuals. The measure has drawn criticism from educators and citizens who say the classes don't promote resentment. U.N. human rights experts criticized the legislation, saying ""everyone has the right to seek and develop cultural knowledge and to know and understand his or her own culture and that of others through education and information."" Kyrsten Sinema, a Democratic state legislator who appeared on ""American Morning"" with Horne, disagreed with the superintendent's contention that students were divided according to race or ethnicity. ""The fact is very clear that these courses are open to all students. Any student of any race and ethnicity can take an African-American class. Similarly, they can take an Asian-American studies class and learn about the history of Japanese internment camps. That's an important part of the American education system,"" she said. Sinema said the courses aren't designed for one race, and they help foster an understanding of different cultures. ""I think it is important for students to learn about their own cultural heritage and to have the opportunity to learn about our cultures and ethnicities that make up the diverse and wonderful state of Arizona,"" she said. Horne said the state's social studies standards ""require all kids to learn about all different cultures."" He said they ""shouldn't be ghettoized into certain cultures where they learn only about the culture of the race they have been born into. That's contrary to American values."" The ethnic studies legislation comes on the heels of a new state immigration law that has led to calls to boycott Arizona businesses and the state itself. The law requires immigrants in Arizona to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling, while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants.","Law aims ""to get schools to teach kids to treat each other as individuals,"" he says .

"(CNN) -- Six Americans imprisoned in Honduras for more than a month on weapons smuggling charges are back home after sailing their ship from the Central American country to their home port in Florida. The crew of the Aqua Quest arrived in Tarpon Springs, Florida, on Wednesday after a voyage on stormy seas that delayed their return home by a day. As their boat sailed into the marina, they were met by family, friends and U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida. ""They're thrilled to be back in the states, surrounded by family and friends,"" said Stephen Mayne, owner of Aqua Quest International, a salvage and treasure hunting company. ""They are looking forward to taking some time off, then regrouping to work on new projects."" The captain of the ship, Robert Mayne -- Stephen's brother -- called it ""an overwhelming day."" ""It's like waking up from a really bad nightmare,"" he said. The Americans sailed to Honduras in May at the invitation of officials in the country's eastern municipality of Ahuas. They were tasked with removing valuable mahogany logs from a nearby riverbed, remnants of decades of logging. Profits from the sale of the recovered logs would be split between Aqua Quest and the municipality for use for social projects there. But the project was halted before it could really begin with their arrest on May 5 after Honduran authorities boarded their ship and discovered two handguns, two shotguns and a semiautomatic rifle. A judge and prosecutor in Ahuas accused the crew of attempting to smuggle weapons into the country for resale. The crew, however, were adamant that their weapons were for personal use and not for resale on the black market. Honduras is mired in drug and gang activity that has resulted in a sharp spike in gun-related deaths in recent years. Illegal arms regularly flow through the country, as drug traffickers transit cocaine from Colombia through the Central American country. Robert Mayne told CNN last month by cell phone from the prison that the weapons were for protection against piracy while at sea. He said that he and his crew always bring them when traveling in international waters. The captain said he even once had to brandish a handgun to ward out would-be pirates off the coast of Mexico. ""Everyone tells us this would never happen in any other port in Honduras,"" he said earlier this month, expressing his frustration with the judge's and state prosecutor's interpretation of the law. ""We have the right to do it (carry arms) for protection on the high seas."" The charges were dropped against the men last week after they spent more than a month in a rural prison camp. They faced potential sentences of up to 16 years if convicted on the weapons smuggling charges. Hoping to rid themselves of the bad fortune their weapons brought them on their latest adventure, the crew voted to ""bury them as sea,"" according to Stephen Mayne, once they entered U.S. waters, tossing the firearms overboard. ""They said goodbye to their little friends,"" said Mayne laughing. ""We decided to just turn them over to King Neptune."" Despite the run-in with authorities, Mayne said his company would continue to work with Honduras on the log retrieval project, though they would likely not return by sea. ""We are going to go forward with this project,"" said Mayne. ""We made a commitment to he community of Ahuas. ""We won't let this incident stop us.""

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN) -- Heavily armed poachers recently killed nearly 40 endangered forest elephants for their ivory in two national parks, officials in Cameroon said Tuesday, the latest in a string of slaughters of the animals in Central Africa. ""The carcasses are still fresh, indicating the killings took place probably only this month,"" ecologist Theophile Mbarga told CNN on Tuesday. Very young -- even newborn -- elephants were among the carcasses found in Nki and Lobeke national parks. The toll could reach 50 after a thorough search is made, Mbarga added. The dead elephants were found closely clustered -- less than 35 feet apart -- indicating the poachers used powerful, modern weapons, conservation group WWF project manager Zacharie Nzooh told journalists Tuesday. Evidence indicates that a horseback-riding band of about 300 poachers from Sudan was behind the slaughter, officials said. The same poachers were believed to be responsible for hundreds of elephant deaths over the past year. Forest elephants are distinguished from the more familiar savanna elephants by their smaller size and straighter tusks. A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of their ivory sells for hundreds of dollars on the underground market in places such as China and Thailand. Political analysts say the proceeds fund rebel groups in Sudan and the Central African Republic. A recent peer-reviewed study published at PLOS One documented a ""catastrophic"" 62 percent decline in Central Africa's forest elephant population over nine years. Officials estimated that 1,700 forest elephants remain in the two Cameroonian parks. It is feared they will be completely wiped out within seven years. Savanna elephant populations in the Central African Republic are believed to have plummeted from around 80,000 just 30 years ago to a few hundred today, according to WWF, formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund. The governments of three Central African nations -- Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad -- announced Saturday they would muster as many as 1,000 soldiers for joint military operations to protect the region's last remaining savanna elephants, as the Sudanese poachers are still active in the region. ""We recommend the mobilization of all defense and security forces in the affected countries"" to stop the poachers, members of the Economic Community of Central African States said in a joint statement. The communique was issued at the end of a three-day emergency anti-poaching ministerial conference held in Cameroon's capital, YaoundÃ©. The operation is estimated to cost about $2.3 million. The announcement called on other nations to contribute additional funds to sustain the effort. On the night of March 14 to 15, poachers slaughtered killed at least 89 elephants in southern Chad, WWF said. They are also believed to be behind the killing of at least 30 elephants in the Central African Republic since January 1. The poachers on horseback are also suspected of killing 300 elephants in Cameroon's Bouba N'Djida National Park in early 2012. The carnage prompted Cameroon to mobilize 600 elite troops to try to keep the poachers from crossing the border again, WWF reported. In the statement, the ECCAS states congratulated Thailand for its March 3 decision to ban its legal domestic ivory trade and urged its vigorous enforcement. Ivory consumers ""need to be sensitized to the consequences"" of the ivory trade, the statement said, adding that ""destination countries (should) adopt measures to reduce ivory demand."" Robert Jackson, the U.S. ambassador to Cameroon, said he was pleased with the meeting. ""The plan is a good one. But execution is now critical."" he said. ""I am, however, concerned that there is no mention of corruption in the statement, because it contributes directly to the poaching and trafficking problem,"" he said. CNN's Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","Nearly 40 endangered forest elephants were killed in 2 parks .

"(CNN) -- Joe Woyjeck last talked to his son Kevin, the outdoors enthusiast who took up his father's firefighting profession, on the phone just hours before Kevin died. ""He said, 'Dad, we got a fire in Yarnell, Arizona. ... I'll give you a call later,'"" the elder Woyjeck told ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday. Joe Woyjeck is having a hard time accepting that he won't get that return call. Kevin Woyjeck, 21, was one of 19 members of an elite Arizona firefighting unit who died Sunday while battling the Yarnell Hill wildfire, which has consumed more than 8,400 acres northwest of Phoenix. The deaths are under investigation, but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters, blankets meant to protect against flames and heat, as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them. Kevin Woyjeck, following in the footsteps of his father, a Los Angeles County Fire Department fire captain, joined the Prescott Fire Department's Granite Mountain Hotshots just three months ago, Joe Woyjeck said. For Hotshot firefighters, no such thing as a routine wildfire . He appeared suited for a hotshot crew, a group of top-shelf wildfire battlers who are called to get close to the blaze, dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it. ""Always wanted to be a fireman. He loved the outdoors. Sleeping in the dirt was not a big deal to him; he actually enjoyed it, I think,"" Joe Woyjeck said, remembering a son who always had a fishing rod in his car. ""Just a great kid, not a mean bone in his body ... always looking forward to becoming a firefighter like his dad. ""Words can't describe the loss that our family is feeling right now."" Kevin Woyjeck wasn't the only firefighter's son in the Granite Mountain crew. Christopher MacKenzie, 30, was the son of Mike MacKenzie, a retired captain for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a largely youthful group:14 were in their 20s. The eldest, unit superintendent Eric Marsh, was 43. The 19 firefighters who were killed Sunday . Also killed Sunday were: Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin Deford, 24; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin, 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; and Garret Zuppiger, 27. ""It's a younger man's game,"" Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo told reporters Monday. ""These people keep themselves in exceptional condition. They have considerable weight to carry, and they walk (miles) to get to strategic locations."" The physical challenge appealed to Ashcraft, a father and husband who wanted to be a firefighter since middle school. Ashcraft ""wanted to do hotshot work until he physically no longer could do it"" and trained feverishly, said his mother, Deborah Pfingston. Deployed for the summer, the group missed their families but enjoyed the camaraderie, Pfingston told CNN on Monday. ""They loved each other. It was almost a band of brothers. These guys ate together, they slept on the ground together when they were fighting fires, these were his comrades,"" she said. The group's website speaks to their fitness: ""Environmental extremes, long hours, bad food, and steep, rugged terrain, demand that we train early and often by running and hiking, doing core exercises, yoga, and weight training."" Joe Woyjeck said his son ""wanted to be in the weeds, because I started out as a wildland firefighter."" ""He worked out as a cross country runner, (but) he didn't even excel in running until he graduated from high school, because he knew the hotshot thing, you had to be the best,"" he said. Now, the elder Woyjeck says he and his wife feel stuck in a sleepless nightmare, coming to terms with their loss. ""My wife and I and our daughter and my other son have kind of sheltered ourselves from the exact incident,"" he said. ""When the time is right, we'll dig in and figure out exactly what happened.""

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams will get the chance to avenge her worst defeat in 16 years on Sunday when she goes head to head with Simona Halep in the WTA Finals finale in Singapore. The world No. 1 was humbled by the Romanian 6-0 6-2 in the group stages of the tournament earlier in the week, but following Williams' semifinal victory over Caroline Wozniacki and Halep's over Agnieszka Radwanska, the pair are set to do battle once more. Few would bet against Williams clinching a third successive title and her fifth overall at the season-ending finals, but Halep will be the fresher of the two women after dispatching her Polish opponent 6-2 6-2. Williams had to come from a set down to beat Wozniacki in what proved to be a thrilling semifinal on Saturday. An enthralling match saw the Dane take the first set with ease, 6-2, before Williams rallied to take the second 6-3 to force the match into a decider. Wozniacki had only beaten Williams once in their 10 previous meetings, but looked as though she might double her winning tally as the third set headed towards its climax. A break of serve for Wozniacki in the ninth game gave her the opportunity to serve out the match, but Williams, ever the fighter, broke back immediately to level at 5-5. Two games later it was Wozniacki who was staring down the barrel as Williams earned a match point on the Dane's serve, but the world No. 8 bravely resisted to take the match into a tiebreak. With a match point saved, Wozniacki then raced to a 4-1 lead in the tiebreak before Williams bounced back with five unanswered points. Wozniacki saved a further two match points, before Williams finally clinched the tiebreak 8-6 in a marathon deciding set lasting 76 minutes. ""I have to say Caroline played a great match,"" Williams said afterwards. ""It was really difficult today. I felt really bad because she's so amazing and so nice, and she was the only player who hadn't lost in this tournament yet, so she really deserved to win. I love you - thank you for playing so well."" The 33-year-old's 2-6 6-3 7-6 (8/6) win was in stark contrast to Halep's -- this year's French Open finalist needed just over an hour to breeze past Radwanska in straight sets. Victory sees Halep reach the final in her first appearance at the WTA Finals, but the world No. 4 played the percentages when asked if she thought she was favorite to beat Williams again. ""She's older than me and she knows how to manage this final tomorrow,"" Halep said. ""For me it's first time. But still, I believe that I have a chance."" Murray reaches Valencia Open final . Andy Murray sealed a 17th win in 19 matches to book a place in the final of the Valencia Open. The Scot, who is chasing down a spot in the season-ending ATP Tour Finals, beat home favorite David Ferrer in Saturday's semi 6-4 7-5. Murray will face Tommy Robredo on Sunday after the Spaniard completed a narrow 7-6 (9/7) 7-6 (7/2) victory over France's Jeremy Chardy. Meanwhile in Switzerland, Roger Federer reached his 11th Swiss Indoors Basel final with a three-set -- 7-6 (10/8) 3-6 6-3 -- win over Croatia's Ivo Karlovic. The 17-time grand slam champion will face David Goffin in the final after the Belgian beat another Croat Borna Coric 6-4 3-6 6-3 in the other semifinal. Seventeen-year-old Coric had knocked out Rafael Nadal on Friday. The defeat turned out to be the last action of the year for the Spaniard who announced he will undergo appendix surgery at the beginning of next month. ""As you know, I won't be playing in Paris or London. I'm having an operation for appendicitis on November 3rd. Thanks for you support,"" he tweeted. Nadal, who was playing for the first time since being diagnosed with appendicitis at the Shanghai Masters earlier this month, was clearly still out of sorts and will miss the Paris Masters and the lucrative season-ending finale in London for the second time in three seasons. The 28-year-old's withdrawal from the event, which starts on November 9, means there are four places still up for grabs -- Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Stanislas Wawrinka and Marin Cilic have already qualified for the eight-man tournament.

"(CNN) -- Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, ""decision points,"" I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good. Hurricane Katrina's devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory. Bush's ""heckuva job"" remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust. The shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point left deep wounds that are still healing. That was what it was. But rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush's determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people's futures. I know what I'm talking about. Bush 43: 'History will ultimately judge' Kathleen Blanco, Louisiana's governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state's commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. I've kept a close watch over the last eight years. Hurricane Katrina wasn't one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: ""Water is the perfect instrument of destruction,"" he said. He is so right: Katrina's waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives. Every member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister. But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas. How will history remember George W. Bush? My older sister, Sheila -- people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike -- was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college. When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious. CNN's Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived. Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building's rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn't leave until she saw someone she knew. Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge. My 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack. All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina. I was upset -- mad as hell -- and disappointed But, I made a decision not to act out -- act against Bush -- but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""how can I help you?"" ""Civility,"" he said. Opinion: Jury is still out on Bush . Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley's ghost. We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down. President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get Congress to move beyond pride and party. So far, not even disasters or tragedies that have united the American people -- Hurricane Sandy, Sandy Hook, and Boston -- have moved the politicians. Not enough, anyway. Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. He flew to New Orleans and addressed the nation: ""Tonight I also offer this pledge to the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives."" Glimpse at a White House before everything changed . George W. Bush was good as his word. He visited the Gulf states 17 times; went 13 times to New Orleans. Laura Bush made 24 trips. Bush saw that $126 billion in aid was sent to the Gulf's residents, as some members of his own party in Congress balked. Bush put a special emphasis on rebuilding schools and universities. He didn't forget African-Americans: Bush provided $400 million to the historically black colleges, now integrated, that remain a pride, and magnet for African-American students. Laura Bush, a librarian, saw to it that thousands of books ruined by the floods were replaced. To this day, there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts. It was a team effort. I'm glad to report the commission I served on went out-of-business in 2010. I'm also grateful and proud to report that President Bush was one of the leaders, and a very important member, of that team. Our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of President Bush and other Americans, who united and worked together to help rebuild the Gulf and the place of my birth, New Orleans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile's siblings, father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives lost everything in Katrina .

"(CNET) -- Smartphones aren't just smart, they're personal computers. Unlike a desktop or even a laptop PC, those devices and other mobile phones can easily slip out of a pocket or purse, be left in a taxi, or get snatched off a table. They let you store photos, access e-mails, receive text messages, and put you one browser click away from potentially malicious Web sites. In effect, gadgets like the Apple iPhone and those running Google's Android software can be as risky to use as PCs, except that the wide variety of mobile platforms has deprived malicious hackers of one dominant software element to target, such as they have with Microsoft's Windows operating system on desktops and laptops. Here is a look at the different types of threats that affect smartphone users and what people can do to protect themselves. What's the biggest security threat to my mobile phone? Losing it. ""You are way more likely to leave it in the back of a taxi than to have someone break into it,"" Charlie Miller, a principal analyst at consultancy Independent Security Evaluators, said in a recent interview. The best way to protect data in the event of losing a device is to not store sensitive information on it, he said. If you must store sensitive information on it, use a password on the phone and encrypt the data. Devices can be configured so that they ask for a password every time e-mail or a VPN is accessed. Use a strong enough password that a stranger can't guess it. And back up your data frequently. There are also ways to lock the phone remotely or wipe the data if it is stolen. AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said users who lose their phone should call the company immediately and ""with just a keystroke, we can prevent anyone else from using the phone--and from running up charges."" A number of companies offer software and services to protect mobile phones. One of them is a start-up called Lookout that offers a Web-based service that backs up the data, remotely wipes the data if stolen, can help locate the device, and includes antivirus and firewall protection. Mobile device users should also be careful about leaving the phone unattended, or loaning it to people. Spyware can be installed without you knowing it if someone has physical access to the device and knows your password -- if you have one set. For instance, the PhoneSnoop program can be used with BlackBerry devices to remotely turn the microphone on to eavesdrop on nearby conversations. However, a spokesperson for BlackBerry maker RIM points out that if the application is installed, the user would be able to see it running and could then remove it. Can mobile phones get viruses? Yes. Mobile viruses, worms and Trojans have been around for years. They typically arrive via e-mail but can also spread via SMS and other means. Mobile phone users should be diligent in installing security software and other updates for their devices. All the major desktop security vendors have mobile antivirus and related offerings. In November, several worms hit the iPhone, but only devices that had been jailbroken so they can run apps other than those approved by Apple. One worm changes the wallpaper on affected devices to a photo of 80s pop singer Rick Astley of ""Rickrolling"" fame. The second, more dangerous worm attempts to remotely control affected iPhones and steal data such as bank login IDs. Jailbroken iPhones have also been directly hacked via SMS, including by one Dutch hacker who was demanding $7 from victims for information on how to secure their iPhones. Miller says: ""Don't jailbreak your phone. It breaks all the security, basically."" If you simply must jailbreak it, you should change the default root password and not install SSH (Secure Shell network protocol). What are other types of attacks? Just like with computer users, smartphone users are vulnerable to e-mail and Web-based attacks like phishing and other social-engineering efforts. All attackers have to do is create a malicious Web page and lure someone to visit the site where malware can then be downloaded onto the mobile device. People should avoid clicking on links in e-mails and text messages on their mobile device. Read FAQ: Recognizing phishing e-mails . SMS offers another avenue for attack. Last year, researchers demonstrated several ways of attacking phone using SMS messages. In one, they exploited a vulnerability in the way the iPhone handles SMS messages. Researchers also showed how an attacker could spoof an SMS to make it look like it comes from the carrier to get the target to either download malware or visit a site hosting it. In another proof-of-concept attack, a text message was used to launch a Web browser on a mobile device and direct it to a site that could host malware. When the attack is used to phish for personal information it is referred to as ""SMiShing."" Is it safe to use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth? Yes and no. If you are doing something sensitive on your phone, like checking a bank account or making a payment, don't use the free Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or other access point. Use your password-protected Wi-Fi at home or the cellular network to avoid what is called as a man-in-the-middle attack in which traffic is intercepted. Pairing a mobile phone with another Bluetooth-enabled device, like a headset, means any device that can ""discover"" another Bluetooth device can send unsolicited messages or do things that could lead to extra fees, data being compromised or corrupted, data stolen in an attack called ""bluesnarfing,"" or the device being infected with a virus. In general, disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth unless you absolutely need to use them. Which is safer: the iPhone or Android? Apple vets all the apps that are used on the iPhone, and that tight regulation of the Apps store has kept users safe from malicious apps so far. Nothing is foolproof, however. Once apps are approved they can do any number of things. For instance, Apple removed free games in November developed by Storm8 that were found to be collecting users' phone numbers. From an architecture standpoint, Android offers more granular access control. But the open-source nature of the Android platform means apps aren't as controlled as they are on the iPhone and holes can be introduced by any number of parties. For instance, Miller found a vulnerability in the Android mobile platform last year that could have allowed an attacker to remotely take control of the browser, access credentials, and install a keystroke logger if the user visited a malicious Web page. The hole was not in code written by Google, but was contributed by a third party to the open-source Android Project. However, any risk was mitigated by an application sandboxing technique Google uses that is designed to protect the device from unauthorized or malicious software that gets onto the phone, Google said. Miller recommends that Android users only download software from trustworthy vendors and reputable sites. Are standard mobile phones safe? Obviously regular mobile phones don't pose the Web-based threats that smartphones do. But they are still used to store sensitive information that can be accessed by gaining access to the device. For instance, the inbox and outbox for text messages can contain information that can be used for identity fraud, said Mark Beccue, a senior analyst for consumer mobility at ABI Research. ""Regardless of what type of cell phone, the most dangerous current threat is through a cellphone's in/out message boxes,"" he said. ""Clear (them) out regularly. Do not transmit full account numbers, PIN or passwords within a text message unless you immediately delete the out box message."" Standard phones that support Java can be susceptible to certain threats that smartphones are. For instance, scammers in Russia and Indonesia are hiding a Trojan in pirated software that surreptitiously sends SMS messages to premium rate numbers - costing as much as $5 each, thus racking up huge bills, said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior antivirus researcher at Kaspersky Lab.

"(CNN) -- Two Syrian jets fired three rockets that hit empty buildings near the Lebanese town of Arsal near the Syrian border Monday, a local source said. There were no injuries, according to the source. Also, Lebanese state-run news agency NNA reported that Syrian warplanes attacked sites in northern Lebanon. The government's use of fighter jets to fire rockets into Lebanon is a ""significant escalation,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday. The French Foreign Ministry in Lebanon issued a statement condemning the attacks. ""The aerial bombing carried out today by the armed forces of the Syrian regime on Lebanese territory, in the region of Ersal, is a new and serious violation of Lebanon's sovereignty,"" the statement said. ""France strongly condemns this escalation and reiterates its commitment to Lebanon's sovereignty and the inviolability of its borders."" This latest violence comes as the Syrian conflict enters its third year. The unrest started in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad's government launched a fierce crackdown on protesters. The discontent evolved into a full-blown civil war that has left more than 70,000 dead and more than 1 million refugees. Syria's first lady makes rare appearance . One result of the warfare is the spillover of fighting and refugee displacement into neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. As for Lebanon, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency also reported border flareups. Syrian armed forces and border guards have thwarted ""armed terrorist"" infiltrators attempting to get into the Homs countryside from Lebanon, SANA said, citing a development first reported last week. The news outlet also reported gunshots fired at Syrian border checkpoints from Lebanon. Syria's Foreign and Expatriates Ministry accused the alleged terrorists of receiving ""clear logistic support from inside the Lebanese lands"" and ferrying their wounded and dead in ambulances across the Lebanese border. SANA quotes a source saying that security forces have killed and wounded fighters and forced them to retreat to Lebanon. Last Thursday, the U.N. Security Council voiced ""grave concern over repeated incidents of cross-border fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abductions and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border, as well as other border violations."" The declaration followed a briefing by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. Other violence raged in Syria on Monday, with the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria recording at least 53 deaths. Arming the opposition . The United States and Western allies have staunchly opposed the Assad government, but it has balked at arming Syria's rebels, who have been getting weapons from some Arab nations and seizing or buying them from Syrian soldiers. As the carnage continues, however, the West is taking a different tone. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that the United States would not hamper the arming of Syrian rebels by allies. ""President Obama has made it clear that the United States does not stand in the way of other countries that have made a decision to provide arms,"" he said. His comments, made at the State Department, come as Britain and France urge the European Union to lift the weapons embargo in order to arm moderate Syrian rebels. Kerry acknowledged the need to change the military ""imbalance"" on the ground in order to change al-Assad's ""calculus."" ""Right now, President Assad is receiving help from the Iranians, he's receiving help from al Qaeda-related, some elements, he's receiving help from Hezbollah, and obviously some help is coming in through the Russians. If he believes he can shoot it out, Syrians and the region have a problem and the world has a problem,"" he said. Last week, Syrian rebels told CNN that the United States is helping organize training for Syrian rebels in Jordan in the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. Opposition selects leader . A Syrian opposition umbrella group, meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, has chosen a U.S.-educated Kurdish businessman to head its provisional government, an opposition activist who attended the vote said Monday. Ghassan Hitto, an information technology executive who went to college in Indiana and lived for many years in Dallas was elected Monday to lead a government whose specific role may be spelled out at a planned news conference Tuesday. Hitto was born in Damascus and is a member of the board of the Syrian American Council, the council said in a news release after the vote. The group said the decision should assuage the Obama administration's concerns about who would lead Syria should President Bashar al-Assad be deposed. ""This question has now been answered,"" the council's statement said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Joe Sterling, Elise Labott, Jason Hanna, Raja Razek, Yousuf Basil and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","NEW: Rebels elect U.S.-educated Kurd to lead provisional government .

"(CNN) -- ""Today I will fight again. This disease will not own me or define me."" These are the words I like to begin each day with, stating my intent out loud. Somehow it seems if I actually hear it, it's easier to live it and believe it. I have Crohn's disease, for which there is no cure -- a disease that requires a daily personal battle with things most of us prefer not to discuss with others. And for those who must deal with it, one thing is certain. It's horrible, it's overwhelming, and it's humiliating. The humiliation factor is a major reason so many suffer in silence -- the evidence of the disease and the treatments are things you just don't tell others about. So you find yourself facing the challenges alone -- the pain that literally doubles you over without warning: nausea, life-threatening bowel obstructions, incontinence, dehydration, intravenous feeding, fatigue and depression. There is also the ever-present threat of surgery, ostomies and permanent damage to my body. There are long days without any food or water, followed by multiple days of clear liquids only. Doctors: A new era in Crohn's disease . Each person suffering from the disease will have their own private hell made up of variations of these components, but all will share the guarantee of loss of normal life, and the knowledge that there is no cure. During my worst times it's been so tough that, exhausted from battling the pain, frustration and fear, I've cried myself to sleep on the bathroom floor. There are many, many drugs and some forms of chemotherapy treatments that may bring about remission in Crohn's cases but no guarantees. And even with remission, the fear and questions linger -- will it come back? Every healthy day is a blessing that carries a black cloud on the horizon. There is relief as you realize you have a reprieve from the disease but a lingering sense of anxiety as you contemplate the ""what if"" that hangs just above your head, depriving you of real peace. It's a daily struggle to keep the fear and uncertainty at bay and enjoy the moments that feel ""normal."" So I will focus just on today. Teen diagnoses her Crohn's disease in science class . I rise early so I can exercise -- exercise helps battle the fatigue that, because of an inability to absorb nutrition from food, is the out-of-control demon affecting each day. I dress for work, pack my small meals and snacks from the very short list of things that I can easily digest. Others will see the confinements of my diet as depressing, but for me they are delicacies that are far preferable to the too-often-required clear liquid diet. The freedom to consume real food, and to do so by mouth instead of through a tube, is a gift I treasure at each meal, and that I never take for granted. Saying blessings before my meals has taken on a new meaning as I give thanks and pray that some nourishment will be retained as my food speeds through my system. This is important to prevent dehydration and/or artificial feeding. Next, I fill my pill divider with the 13 doses of six medications I will take that day, almost hourly. Four times a month, I'll give myself a scheduled injection of vitamin B12. Monthly injections from a caregiver are part of the drill twice a month, but if today is not one of those days, I'm good to go. There will be no spontaneity to my day. A sudden, last-minute invitation to lunch will be met with ""I'd love to, but I already have plans,"" a small white lie that keeps me from having to explain. An invite to dinner, drinks, a movie or shopping will be met with a similar excuse. Trying not to appear anti-social while repeatedly declining all invitations has resulted in a neat little list of interchangeable excuses. Even a meeting will require advance notice and preparation if it takes place around a meal. Menus must be reviewed in advance, and medication dosages slightly altered. And more often than not, even with all this preparation it will just turn out to be ""a bad day"" and a last-minute cancellation will be unavoidable. Occasionally this happens around events that are really important to me, such as a wedding or a family member's funeral. Missing these events brings frustration, anger and eventually leaves me in tears. But acceptance will finally come as I make peace with what I know can't be changed. So most days, it's easier to just give in and have no plans. I can replace the anxiety of ""what happens if"" with the comfort and security of home, where my safe foods, medicine, supplies and a comfortable resting place all reside. I need the downtime and the extra rest, because tomorrow I'll do it all again. My battle closely resembles the battle fought by those with colon cancer. Suffering from Crohn's disease can mean debilitating pain, fistula surgery and diarrhea that can be so severe it can bring on dehydration. Like colon cancer, remission is possible, but recurrence is probable. Like colon cancer, a variety of medications and treatments can help with the effects, but they are strong medications that bring their own set of problems and risks. While Crohn's disease itself is not terminal, the complications often result in death. Keeping it under control requires a real commitment to fight and a resolve to sustain that commitment every day. The motivation to fight is the strong desire to not suffer, and deviation often results in serious illness. Each surgery or flare-up leaves me with a little bigger battle to face, so I keep fighting. And yet I do feel lucky -- lucky to be alive and grateful to be in the midst of a season of fewer struggles. I am blessed, and I truly understand that in the big scheme of things this struggle is but a moment. And in this season of reprieve. I carry the cold knowledge that there are more than 1 million other people suffering like me. So few people understand this disease, yet it's part of the lives of so many people all around them. I hope to help change that. I tell my story only to help bring a little attention to what life is like for those who battle Crohn's -- because sharing equals attention, and attention equals awareness. And awareness builds hope that something can be done -- maybe not in my lifetime, but perhaps in my children's. That's important because the probability of my children being diagnosed increased the day I was diagnosed. So today, I share. And today I will fight again, with every intention of winning. Crohn's diagnosis means lifelong battle .","Crohn's disease is ""horrible, it's overwheming and it's humiliating,"" Debbi Wynn says .
Many with Crohn's suffer in silence, Wynn says .
Even in remission, fear and anxiety linger, she says .

"(CNN) -- Merle and Pat Butler, lifetime residents of Red Bud, Illinois, hold the third winning ticket worth $218 million in last month's Mega Millions lottery, officials announced Wednesday. The retired couple came forward in their hometown's City Hall on Wednesday after spending the past two weeks hiring ""real good financial advisers"" and a lawyer to help them manage their new fortune: $158 million after taxes. ""Instead of thinking of things we could spend it on, we've been thinking of ways to invest it,"" Merle Butler, 65, said Wednesday. Pat Butler, 62, said that keeping their secret was easier because they've been out of town most of the time since they won. ""We were meeting with a lot of people, just not here in town,"" she said . The Butlers are retired computer analysts. ""I was retired, and it looks like I've got another full-time job,"" Merle Butler said. He realized they won as he watched the 10 o'clock news March 30, soon after the drawing. ""The first thing I spotted was I had a mega ball number,"" he said. At least he won something, he thought. ""The further I went, the more they matched,"" he said. But it took time for reality to sink in. ""So, after I looked at it for a couple of minutes, I turned to my wife, who was right there with me, and I says, 'We won,' "" he said. ""And she kind of looked at me funny, and I says, 'No, we won,' and then she started giggling, and she giggled for about four hours, I think."" The Butlers decided to keep it a secret. ""I figured the quieter I keep it, the better we are to get it set up and get it going before we did the claim,"" Merle Butler said. It may have helped that it was April Fools weekend when he was confronted at the local bank, where he went there to put the ticket in their lock box. ""Oh, I guess you come over to put your ticket away?"" someone at the bank asked them. ""I says, 'Yeah, I won this thing and got to get this thing out away.' I just laughed it off, and she doesn't know until right now that I really had that ticket in there,"" he said. Guessing who held the ticket was the community obsession for the past 18 days in Red Bud, according to Denise Metzger, manager of the Moto Mart convenience store where the winning ticket was sold. Metzger and her staff members used the process of elimination to guess. ""We're watching to figure out who hasn't been coming in,"" she said Tuesday. ""If they got the ticket and are making themselves scarce, that's what we've been paying attention to."" Mayor Tim Lowry suspected the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern Illinois town was evidence it was a Red Bud resident. ""Not knowing who it is, it seems like they want to make a splash in Red Bud,"" Lowry said. Some locals joked on Facebook and the sidewalk that they had the winning ticket. But when Merle Butler spoke, they did not realize he was not joking. ""I answered most of the time truthfully, 'Yes, I did,' but they didn't catch it,"" Merle Butler said. Michigan winner charged with welfare fraud . Red Bud locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners but never the Butlers. ""Names are just going around, we just need to wait and see when they come forward. Congrats to whoever it was!"" one poster wrote. ""I really don't care who won. I really don't want to know, It wasn't me so I could care less!!!"" said another. ""I just hope it is someone that needs the money,"" another commenter said. Moto Mart, which saw a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales, also was gossip central for lottery rumors. One rumor floating there is that someone ordered 12 new Camaros from the local Chevrolet dealership, Metzger said. ""That's a big rumor. I had a big laugh about that one."" The sales manager at Weir Chevrolet Buick GMC shot down that gossip. ""They were Corvettes,"" said Brandon Liefer. ""I'm just messing with you,"" Liefer added, clarifying that he has no clue who the new millionaire might be and they've not ordered new cars. The mayor said the ""windfall of money"" could be a boost for his farming community's economy, but a person ""can only buy so many groceries."" The Butlers said they would remain in Red Bud, which Merle Butler called ""a nice comfortable, family-oriented community."" Two other winning tickets were sold for the March 30 drawing that had a record $656 million pre-tax payout. Maryland and Kansas allowed their winners to remain unnamed, but Illinois requires them to come forward. The man and two women who shared ownership of the winning ticket in Maryland are public school employees who are known only as the ""Three Amigos."" The elementary school teacher, a special education teacher and an administrative worker said they plan to keep their fortune a secret -- and keep working. Metzger and her nine employees at Moto Mart collected their own payoff for selling the winning ticket. Their company gave them $50,000 to share from the $500,000 bonus paid to the store by the Illinois Lottery.","NEW: A retired couple from Red Bud, Illinois, holds the third Mega Millions ticket .

"(CNN)  -- With many workers stuck at their desks during the late-morning swearing-in of President Obama on Tuesday, more people than ever went online to watch live video of the historic inauguration. A group crowds around a laptop to watch the inaugural events in Washington. News sites, including CNN.com, shattered records for viewers watching live streaming video online. And, sometimes for the first time, news sites carried video feeds on their front pages. About 7.7 million people watched the inauguration on Tuesday online at the same time, according to Akamai Technologies Inc. That likely makes the inauguration the single most-watched event in the history of live Web video, according to the company, which handles Web traffic for more than 150 news sites worldwide, including nytimes.com, Ustream, Viacom, WSJ.com and others. Across the day, nearly 27 million people watched streaming video on CNN.com Live on Tuesday, according to CNN spokeswoman Jennifer Martin. That's more than five times the site's previous record, set on Election Day, when 5.3 million people watched streaming video of the day's events. CNN.com Live estimates that it streamed 1.3 million simultaneous video feeds just before Obama's inaugural address Tuesday. That may be a record for live video on the Internet. YouTube set a record with 700,000 viewers on a variety show on Election Day in November, the Los Angeles Times reported. The record has not been confirmed by third-party sources. The New York Times declined to release its Tuesday numbers, but spokeswoman Stacy Green said nytimes.com saw more streaming Web users than ever. CBSNews.com also reported a record day for online video, said Sarah Cain, a spokeswoman for the network. Sites tried to attract viewers in new ways, linking their news coverage with social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. Obama himself got in on the action, posting this message to his Twitter account after the November 4 election: ""We just made history. All of this happened because you gave your time, talent and passion. All of this happened because of you."" For some viewers, the inauguration was a first-time experiment with streaming video online, and the high traffic on most sites didn't always make that transition easy. Some news sites' coverage froze during the inauguration, according to Keynote Systems Inc., which tracks Internet performance. Keynote Systems spokesman Dan Berkowitz said the Web's top 40 sites slowed by as much as 60 percent by the time the ceremony started at 11 a.m. On CNN.com, some streaming-video watchers who were pushed into a temporary ""waiting room"" were shown this tongue-in-cheek message: ""You made it! However, so did everyone else."" Chris Ariens, editor of the blog WebNewser, said he watched live online video coverage from CNN, MSNBC, ABC and CBS. All froze, leading Ariens to revert back to a television in his office. ""I think the bottom line was, while it was great to be able to, from the ease of your desktop, watch some of the coverage, when push came to shove, you had to go back to television,"" he said. A blogger for CBSNews.com acknowledged trouble with its online video. ""Just as massive crowds filled the National Mall in Washington, millions of users flocked to online video feeds,"" James M. Klatell wrote in a CBSNews.com blog entry Tuesday. ""Maybe we're not as far into the Internet Age as we thought."" The hiccups in Web video should not be discouraging for viewers or news companies, said Al Tompkins, who teaches broadcasting and online news at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists in Florida. If anything, he said, the trouble with streaming video should show companies there's great consumer demand for video online. ""They need to know that if they build it they will come, and [Tuesday] was a great example that there is a demand for video,"" Tompkins said. Some viewers turned to radio and other forms of media to fill in the gaps in online video technology. Others gathered around office computers to watch the ceremony online. Tompkins said viewership of Web video was high Tuesday partly because it was available on so many sites -- and because many workers were trapped at their desks during the inauguration. Clint Cantwell, who works in public relations in New York, left his office near Times Square briefly to take in the excitement outside. Then he returned to his desk to watch streaming coverage. The video stalled at times, but the audio worked, and Cantwell said he genuinely enjoyed watching an inauguration for the first time online. ""In the past, you pretty much had to be at home or in an office with television to be able to experience what's in Washington,"" said Cantwell, who also sent photos to CNN's iReport, a public submission site that saw an unprecedented 12,000 entries on Tuesday. Although the inauguration set records for Web video, it's unclear exactly how the ceremony ranked against other news events in terms of total hits online. Globally, Akamai reported, 5.4 million visitors were visiting Web pages per minute at noon Tuesday, with most of the crowd in North America. Four other news events have garnered more Web attention than Tuesday's inauguration, according to Akamai's Web site. The top-ranking news event in terms of views per minute was Obama's election in November, with 8.6 million views per minute. A World Cup match and two basketball games also ranked higher than the inauguration. CNN.com partnered with Facebook, the social networking site, to let online friends share commentary while watching the inauguration live. Facebook reported unprecedented traffic during the event, with the site averaging 4,000 status updates per hour Tuesday morning. The online comments reportedly peaked at 8,500 updates per minute during Obama's inaugural speech. News consumers have been turning to the Internet in increasing numbers for years. Last year, for the first time, the Pew Research Center reported that more Americans said they got most of their national and international news online than in print. Tompkins, the journalism teacher, said it's up to news companies to keep advancing the way they cover big events.","More people than ever go online to watch live video of inauguration .

"New York (CNN) -- A famously macabre painting by Andy Warhol sold for $105.4 million Wednesday, a record for the famed pop artist and the second-most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to Sotheby's auction house. ""Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)"" shows a twisted body in the wreckage of a car crash, part of Warhol's vaunted ""Death and Disaster"" series, painted in 1963. Arts magazine ARTNews published an interview with Warhol in November 1963, in which the artist said of the series, ""I guess it was the big plane crash picture, the front page of a newspaper: 129 DIE. I was also painting the Marilyns. I realized that everything I was doing must have been Death."" The large painting, which measures 8 feet by 13 feet, is one of only four works of that size in the series and the only one remaining in a private collection, according to Sotheby's. It had been in a private collection since 1989 and has rarely been viewed in public. Sotheby's declined to identify the buyer. ""'Silver Car Crash' is the most important work of contemporary art we have ever had the privilege to offer, and its exceptional result is a testament to that fact,"" said Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of contemporary art at Sotheby's and the evening's auctioneer. Another well-known painting from the 1960s also sold for over $100 million this week. On Tuesday, Francis Bacon's ""Three Studies of Lucian Freud"" sold for $142.4 million after six minutes of bidding in the room and on the phone at Christie's in New York, the most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to auction house spokeswoman Elizabeth Van Bergen. Another iconic Warhol image, ""Coca-Cola (3),"" sold for $57.2 million Tuesday at Christie's. ""Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)"" was one of several Warhol pieces in the Sotheby's auction Wednesday. ""Liz #1 (Early Colored Liz)"" drew $20.3 million and ""Flowers (Five Foot Flowers)"" sold for $11.3 million, according to the auction house. Andy Warhol pops up in China... again .

"(CNN) -- If any American has the power of persuasion over North Korea's defiant young ruler, it might be eccentric ex-basketball star Dennis Rodman. So when Rodman digitally called for Kim Jong Un to release U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae, he may have a shot at a response. ""I'm calling on the Supreme Leader of North Korea or as I call him ""Kim"", to do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose,"" Rodman tweeted. Dennis Rodman is North Korean leader's 'friend for life' Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor last month after he was convicted of unspecified ""hostile acts"" against North Korea. The country's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the Korean-American was arrested November 3 after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a northeastern port near the Chinese border. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week that her brother is not a spy. ""He has never had any evil intentions against North Korea, or any other country for that matter,"" Chung said. She said her brother owns a tour company and was in North Korea for work. ""He didn't have any problems going there last time, last year five times, so he didn't have any reason to suspect that there would be any trouble this time around,"" she said. U.S. officials have struggled to establish how exactly Bae fell afoul of North Korean authorities. The North Korean statement on his conviction provided no details of the allegations against him. ""This was somebody who was a tour operator, who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North,"" a senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. But NK News, a U.S.-based website that focuses on North Korea, suggests Bae has served as a missionary trying to convert North Koreans. ""I knew that Jesus wanted me to be a 'channel' to the North,"" Bae told a Korean congregation at a St. Louis church in 2011, NK News reported. ""This year, I'm working at taking several short term missionary teams into North Korea."" Bae's sentencing came after weeks of intense rhetoric from North Korea, which conducted its third nuclear test in February and launched a satellite into orbit atop a long-range rocket in December. Washington responded by deploying additional missile interceptors on the West Coast, dispatching a missile defense system to the Pacific territory of Guam and bolstering annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises with overflights by nuclear-capable B-2 and B-52 bombers. Rodman, the heavily pierced NBA Hall of Famer, made headlines when he befriended North Korea's supreme leader during a visit in February. ""You have a friend for life,"" Rodman told Kim after the two men sat next to each other watching an unusual basketball exhibition in Pyongyang. But Rodman said he is not an official diplomat between the United States and North Korea. ""I'm not a politician,"" he tweeted. ""Kim Jung Un & North Korean people are basketball fans. I love everyone. Period. End of story.""","Dennis Rodman: ""Do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose""

"(CNN) -- The father of a teenage girl who remarkably survived a plane crash off the Comoros islands has described how his daughter was ejected from the plane into the Indian Ocean. ""She didn't feel a thing. She found herself in water,"" Paris-based Kassim Bakari told French radio RTL after speaking to his 13-year-old daughter Bahia who was recovering Wednesday in hospital in Moroni. ""She could hear people talking, but in the middle of the night she couldn't see a thing. She managed to hold on to a piece of something,"" said Bakari, whose wife was also on board the doomed flight and is presumed to be among the 152 victims. ""She said she was ejected from the plane,"" Bakari said. Bahia, who lives in Marseille, escaped with just cuts to her face and a fractured collar-bone as the Yemenia Airways Airbus A310 tried to land at Moroni airport at the end of a four-stage flight from France.  Watch more about Bahia's escape » . A local surgeon said Bahia was doing well in hospital. ""Her health is not in danger. She is very calm given the shock she suffered,"" Ben Imani told Reuters.com at Moroni's El Marouf hospital. The girl is expected to be flown home to France on a ministerial plane, Agence France-Presse reports. Earlier Kassim Bakari told France Info, a French radio network, that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives. ""When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water ... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'"" Bakari said. French junior foreign minister Alain Joyandet met the girl in hospital on Wednesday and heard how she was pulled from the sea. The head of the rescue team in the Comoros also told RTL the teenager survived astonishing odds. ""It is truly, truly, miraculous,"" said Ibrahim Abdoulazeb. ""The young girl can barely swim."" Another rescuer told France's Europe 1 radio the girl was spotted in the rough sea among bodies and plane debris in darkness about two hours after the crash. ""We tried to throw a life buoy. She could not grab it. I had to jump in the water to get her,"" the rescuer said, according to AFP.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue » . ""She was shaking, shaking. We put four covers on her. We gave her hot, sugary water. We simply asked her name, village."" Bakari said he did not believe he would see his wife or daughter again after learning of the crash. ""She is a very, very shy girl. I would never have thought she would have survived like this. I can't say that it's a miracle, I can say that it is God's will,"" he said. Kassim Bakari said his daughter had been told her mother survived the crash. ""When I spoke to her she was asking for her mother. They told her she was in a room next door, so as not to traumatize her. But it's not true. I don't know who is going to tell her."" Former pilot and aviation analyst John Cox said the girl's discovery reminded him of the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255 in Detroit, Michigan, in which only a 4-year-old girl survived, while 156 others died.

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House has declined to comment on a ""Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card"" petition, saying the ""We the People"" Whitehouse.gov petition system allows the Executive Office to dodge comments ""to avoid the appearance of improper influence."" Although the official response posted on Friday did not address the petition's position directly, the White House did drop a few Bieber references, while making its case for the President's immigration plan. ""Not only is it (immigration reform) the right thing to do morally, it's the right thing for our country,"" the response says. ""Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next 20 years.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The tragic case of the 23-year old woman who was brutally attacked, raped and left for dead by six men in New Delhi on December 16 has highlighted the unacceptable reality millions of women in India are facing. Violence against women is endemic -- more than 220,000 cases of violent crimes against women were reported in 2011 according to official statistics from the Indian government, with the actual number likely to be much higher. If there has been a silver lining to this horrendous case, it has been the enormous outcry from Indian society. What started as student-led protests in New Delhi has grown to encompass Indians from all walks of life and from the whole political spectrum. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets with the clear message that something has to change, and that women should no longer have to live in fear. Read more: End culture of rape in 2013 . But amid the many reasonable and constructive calls on the authorities to address the situation, there is unfortunately a growing chorus of voices calling for the six alleged perpetrators to be executed, or even for mandatory death sentence in cases of sexual violence. Five of the six suspects were formally charged in New Delhi on Thursday, with the authorities investigating whether the sixth suspect is under 18 and a juvenile. The five are expected to be charged with several offences including murder, which is punishable by death under Indian law. Read more: New Delhi gang-rape suspects charged with murder, rape, kidnapping . The anger felt towards the suspects is completely understandable, as is the desire to impose stricter laws around sexual violence to ensure that what happened in Delhi in December never happens again. But imposing the death penalty would just perpetuate the cycle of violence. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, regardless of the circumstances or the nature of the crime. It is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment, and a violation of a fundamental human right -- the right to life. There is no evidence to suggest that the threat of execution works as a special deterrent. This is reflected in a clear global trend moving towards the abolition of the death penalty. Today, 140 countries in the world have abolished executions in law or practice. Read more: Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . Up until November 21, 2012, when the lone surviving gunman from the 2008 November Mumbai attacks, Ajmal Kasab was hanged, India had not carried out a single execution for almost eight years. Kasab's killing meant India took a significant step backwards and joined the minority of countries in the world that are still executing. With hundreds of prisoners still on death row in India, this is a key moment for the country and its use of the death penalty. The Indian authorities must not let the Kasab, execution and the outrage around the Delhi rape trigger a resumption of executions on a larger scale. What India needs now is not revenge, but to address the many underlying issues that are perpetuating endemic violence against women. The laws and the justice system must be reformed, and the definition of rape, which is currently far from adequate, should be amended. Read more: Misogyny in India: We are all guilty . The woefully low conviction rate for these crimes must also be addressed, which today only perpetuates a culture of impunity. Imposing the death penalty for sexual assault cases would likely only worsen this situation, as judges would hesitate to give such an extreme sentence, and the legal process would become even lengthier and more complicated. The Indian police force has to be better trained to deal with survivors of sexual violence, and there is a need to develop support systems for survivors. Many women are reluctant to report crimes, fearing humiliation and degrading treatment by the police, or the social stigma that comes from society at large. There are also still serious systematic failures in the Indian justice system that raise questions about its efficiency. To even begin to talk about a method of punishment until these issues have been addressed is to seriously jump the gun. This sentiment has been echoed by many, including U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay, who has called for legal reform while cautioning against the use of the death penalty. After a year in which both Afghanistan and Pakistan resumed executions after relatively long moratoriums, India now has an opportunity to show real leadership on a key human rights issue in the region. There is no question that the country's women deserve much better legal protection, but the death penalty is not the answer. Read more: New Delhi rape exposes the perils of being a woman in India .

"(CNN) -- It was a night for underdogs at the Golden Globes -- and a particularly rich one for the biggest underdog of them all, ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Dev Patel and Freida Pinto star in ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" which was named best drama at the Golden Globes. The modestly budgeted movie -- about a poverty-raised orphan in Mumbai who goes on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" -- won awards for best drama, best director (Danny Boyle), best screenplay (Simon Beaufoy) and best original score (A.R. Rahman). The victories were all the more astonishing given the film's unlikely production history, which included cobbling together a $15 million budget, shooting on the streets of Mumbai and then struggling for distribution. The film's principals, including Boyle and Beaufoy, were thankful for the support of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Globes. ""Your mad, pulsating affection for our film is much appreciated,"" said Boyle.  Watch stars on the red carpet » . ""We really weren't expecting to be here in America at all at one time, so it's just amazing to be here,"" said Beaufoy. With the film's victories at the Critics' Choice Awards last week, it must be considered the front-runner in the Academy Awards' best picture race. The Academy Award nominations will be announced Thursday, January 22. iReport.com: Sound off on awards season . Another underdog, actor Mickey Rourke, won best actor in a drama for his performance in ""The Wrestler."" Rourke, who described himself as ""almost out of the business"" not so long ago, gave credit to his agent for backing him and ""Wrestler"" director Darren Aronofsky for sticking with him when the film had trouble finding funding. ""The Wrestler"" also won a Globe for its theme song, written and sung by Bruce Springsteen.  Watch Golden Globe highlights » . Kate Winslet wasn't considered quite as much an underdog, but she still outdid the odds by winning both categories for which she was nominated: best actress in a drama (for ""Revolutionary Road"") and best supporting actress (for ""The Reader"").  Gallery: Winners at the Globes » . Perhaps she surprised herself most of all. After winning best supporting actress -- the first award of the evening -- she asked the audience, ""You have to forgive me, because I have a habit of not winning things."" After the best actress win, she took the stage in a mild state of shock. ""I'm so sorry! Anne, Meryl, Kristin -- oh, God, who's the other one? -- Angelina,"" she said, referring to fellow nominees Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Kristin Scott Thomas and Angelina Jolie. Not long after, being told to wrap it up, she said, ""You have no idea how much I'm not wrapping up,"" before emotionally thanking a variety of people, including co-star Leonardo DiCaprio and husband Sam Mendes, ""Road's"" director. See the list of Globe winners, nominees . Another win was expected, if tinged with tragedy. The late Heath Ledger won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor for his performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" ""All of us who worked with Heath on 'The Dark Knight' accept with an awful mixture of sadness but incredible pride,"" said director Christopher Nolan. ""For any of us lucky enough to work with him, he will be eternally missed, but he will never be forgotten."" Ledger died almost a year ago of an accidental prescription drug overdose. Ledger's performance was widely praised and he is considered the front-runner for an Academy Award for supporting actor. He was 28 when he died on January 22, 2008. Oscar nominations will be announced on the first anniversary of his death. Before the show, ""Knight"" co-star Aaron Eckhart told CNN, ""I'm considering it his night tonight."" The Globes also honor TV programs, and in the television categories there were few surprises. HBO's miniseries ""John Adams,"" which dominated the Emmy Awards in September with 13 trophies, won four Globes: best actor (Paul Giamatti), best actress (Laura Linney), best supporting actor (Tom Wilkinson) and best TV movie or miniseries. ""Mad Men"" won best TV drama, as it did at the Emmys, and ""30 Rock,"" another Emmy winner, won best comedy TV series. Though star Tina Fey was announced as the person to accept that award, she let co-star Tracy Morgan have the microphone. ""Tina Fey and I had an agreement that if Barack Obama won, I'd be accepting the awards from now on,"" he said. Fey later won for best TV comedy actress, joining her co-star Alec Baldwin (best TV comedy actor) as Globe winners. The Israeli film ""Waltz With Bashir"" won best foreign-language film. In his speech, director Ari Folman expressed hope for peace in the Middle East. Noting the ""eight beautiful production babies"" born during the show's four-year creation, he said he hopes the children can see the film when they get older, and ""I hope it looks like an ancient video game that has nothing to do with their lives whatsoever."" Other Globe winners included Sally Hawkins, who won best actress in a musical or comedy for her performance in ""Happy-Go-Lucky""; Colin Farrell, who took home best actor in a comedy or musical for ""In Bruges""; ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen's latest, which won best comedy or musical; and ""WALL-E,"" which won best animated film. For those casting metaphorical grass blades into the breeze to see which way the Oscar winds are blowing, the ""Globes"" may have created front-runners in some races, confusion in others. Anne Hathaway had won a few honors for ""Rachel Getting Married,"" but Winslet's win over her at the Globes creates a tighter contest for best actress. Rourke's victory is a feel-good story for an actor many had written off, but he may have to face Frank Langella (Richard Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon""), Sean Penn (a highly praised Harvey Milk in ""Milk"") and Leonardo DiCaprio (Winslet's ""Revolutionary Road"" husband) for best actor. ""Milk,"" in particular, received short shrift from the HFPA; the Motion Picture Academy is expected to be kinder. The Globes' loose atmosphere -- a trademark of the event, which features an open bar and celebrities sitting at large tables -- was evident from the beginning. Jennifer Lopez, noticing a distinct rumble of chatter as she attempted to begin the show, demanded quiet with ""Hello! Hello! Mama talkin'!"" Later, Tom Wilkinson, having won a supporting actor honor for his performance in the miniseries ""John Adams,"" forgot the last name of a person he wanted to thank. There were even a couple of TV no-nos on the live broadcast: ""Wrestler"" director Aronofsky humorously flashed Rourke a middle finger as Rourke talked about how hard Aronofsky worked the cast, and one of the ""Slumdog"" producers uttered the F-word upon seeing he was being rushed through his speech. It was the kind of party people have come to expect from the Globes, a show in which Jack Nicholson once bared his backside and Christine Lahti once was engaged in the ladies' room upon being named a winner. And, if throwing a glamorous party in these nervous, market-plunging times seems a little unusual, it's also something Tinseltown does well -- and that people are expecting, participants said before the broadcast. ""I think these things are entertainment,"" Mendes told CNN. ""This is people's escapism. ... I think in that respect they should be embraced.""","""Slumdog Millionaire"" wins best drama; nets four total wins .

"(CNN) -- Soon you won't have to worry about your phone falling in the toilet, tumbling into a puddle or someone inadvertently dribbling coffee into the headphone socket (we've all done it). British-based firm P2i has developed a ""liquid repellent nano-coating"" technology -- branded Aridion™ -- that can be sprayed onto a solid surface and, they claim, repel nearly all forms of liquid. The polymer coating in question is a patented chemical that lowers an object's surface energy, causing liquid to form beads upon contact and roll off without being absorbed. The chemical itself is a little less than 50 nanometers wide -- that's 1,000 times thinner than a human hair and, suffice to say, completely invisible to the naked eye. That means once a mobile phone -- or any electronic device -- has been coated, it's still physically indistinguishable from the original. ""You look at it and you can't see any change,"" explains Stephen Coulson, the chemical engineer who developed the technology. ""But when you drop water on it, it will just bead up and drop off. More importantly, the internals will also be protected to prevent corrosion damage."" Like the Internet, GPS and digital photography before it, Aridion™ began life as a military-sponsored innovation -- with a military purpose in mind. In this case, the British Ministry of Defense were seeking to provide maximum protection to its soldiers' uniforms so they could resist all types of liquid assailants, ""not just rainwater, but also chemical nasties like nerve agent,"" says Coulson. ""We did about a year's research and then found the technology -- which was the eureka moment where we put certain drops of liquid onto fabrics and, rather than being absorbed into it, they rolled off,"" he added. Indeed, the research was so successful that the scale by which liquid repulsion is measured immediately required updating, claims Coulson. ""Before we started this research the top end was what was called 'Oil 8' ... We've now had to push that up to 'Oil 10' in order to fully measure all of the treatments we've made ... we're seeing resistance that people have never seen before"" It's a gratifying result for a man who has invested every minute of his professional life perfecting the technology. The first shoots of what would later become known as Aridion™ sprouted in Coulson's research as a PhD student in the 1990s. The patents were established at the turn of the millennium, but it wasn't until the beginning of 2011 that the technology finally made its way into the kit of Britain's Special Forces. Now having demonstrated that Aridion can repel almost any type of liquid from almost any type of solid surface and also act, incidentally, as an anti-microbial and flame retardant, you'd assume a host of industry reps would be knocking down the door's to P2i head office in Oxfordshire. But Coulson says it's not been quite so straightforward. ""I think any new technology is a hard sell to start with. You can show the benefits and it's very visual, so that gets you a seat at the table to discuss it, but when you're talking about implementing new manufacturing solutions and technology into mass-manufacturing then you have to convince a lot of people,"" says Coulson. ""You've got to not only engage with the technical people, the marketing but also the operational and implementation people,"" he adds. Having said that, the numbers are starting to tell a different story. P2i has worked closely with Motorola, who have now implemented the technology in 10 million of their latest phones and the polymer is also coating about 60% of the world's hearing aids. Meanwhile, the company has installed over 100 nano-coating machines within major manufacturing centers around the world and turnover has been doubling every year -- last year hitting $20 million. ""We're also working with all of the top ten mobile phone manufacturers. We've just recently signed TCL Alcatel and we have a number of announcements moving forward,"" says Coulson. But mobiles and other electronic goods most obviously vulnerable to liquid corrosion are just the tip of the iceberg as far as Coulson is concerned. Following the success of its clothes range with the British Army, civilian varieties from your favorite brands will soon be in store. P2i already has deals with shoe-makers K-Swiss, Nike and Adidas. Coulson argues that there's a fundamental difference between existing waterproof clothes and garments coated with ion-mask™ (effectively the same as Aridion™ but specially tailored for the fabrics market). ""A waterproof jacket in the rain without our technology will provide protection against water coming through it directly -- however the outside material will get wet and start to increase in weight, he explains. ""It may also get dirty; you may get staining on there. With the ion-mask™ technology on the outside of that jacket ... it remains the same weight."" Indeed, anything that suffers reduced performance from the effects of liquid intrusion seems to be in Coulson's sights: P2i have even experimented with things like tennis balls, surfboards and the nose cones of Formula One racing cars. ""We see the future as everything being treated with P2i's technology,"" he says. Only time will tell if it's as watertight a proposition as it sounds.","Liquid repellent nano-coating technology prevents water from being absorbed onto surfaces .
Most popular application so far is within mobile phones and hearing aids .
The chemical's British-based inventor Stephen Coulson says it could be applied to almost everything ."
"(CNN) -- Long a veteran of the highways of rural California, Google's self-driving car is working on becoming safer in the city. Over the past year or so, Google has been fine-tuning how the software running its fleet of automated vehicles handles the complexities of stop-and-go driving in heavily populated areas. ""A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area,"" Chris Urmson, the head of Google's self-driving-car project, said Monday in a blog post. Urmson said engineers have improved the cars' software to recognize situations like pedestrian traffic, buses, stop signs held by crossing guards and hand signals made by cyclists. And, he says, self-driving cars have the potential to handle all of that even better than we do. ""A self-driving vehicle can pay attention to all of these things in a way that a human physically can't -- and it never gets tired or distracted,"" Urmson wrote. ""As it turns out, what looks chaotic and random on a city street to the human eye is actually fairly predictable to a computer."" The CNN 10: Meet the future of driving . Since 2011, when self-driving vehicles became street-legal in Nevada, Google has logged nearly 700,000 miles with the cars, mostly on highways. The only reported accidents have happened when one of the cars was being driven by a person, or they were the fault of another driver. Autonomous cars are also now legal in California, Florida and Michigan, although all states still require a human driver behind the wheel. Google has been testing the cars around its Silicon Valley headquarters in suburban Mountain View, California. There's more to learn before testing them in another city, Urmson wrote, ""but thousands of situations on city streets that would have stumped us two years ago can now be navigated autonomously."" The cars' technology includes a laser radar system and a laser-based range finder that lets software create detailed 3-D maps of the surroundings. In a YouTube video also posted Monday, one of the cars is shown recognizing and changing lanes in a construction zone, negotiating a railroad crossing and making a right turn at an intersection crowded with cars, cyclists and pedestrians. ""With every passing mile we're growing more optimistic that we're heading toward an achievable goal -- a vehicle that operates fully without human intervention,"" Urmson wrote.","Google says its self-driving cars are getting better on city streets .

"(CNN) -- The media circus that is Jodi Arias' murder trial is in its final stretch, as the jury began deliberations Friday following closing arguments. The jury, which has been in court since January, will resume deliberations Monday. It's been an R-rated story, to say the least, with an abundance of testimony about grisly violence and, from Arias, details about a kinky sex life she says she shared with Alexander. The case has captured massive if not total interest among Americans. While one part of the country watches CNN's sister network HLN for every twist in the trial, or drives hours to get one of the courtroom's limited lottery seats (yes, they're doled out via lottery), another segment of the nation asks, ""Jodi who?"" For those of you in the latter category, here are some things you should know as the trial comes to a close: . Travis Alexander . Lost in the salacious details of the ""Jodi Arias trial"" is the victim, Travis Alexander, 30, who was brutally killed in his Mesa, Arizona, home in June 2008. Faith was an integral part of Alexander's life. The professed son of methamphetamine addicts, Alexander was raised in Riverside, California, with three brothers and four sisters. His grandmother introduced him to Mormonism as a child. After he graduated from high school he went on a two-year mission in Denver. He later moved to Mesa because of the strong Mormon community and became a motivational speaker and businessman. He also authored a book titled, ""Raising You."" Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex. Arias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women. There were claims that Arias would stalk him, peering in his windows at times. Still, he and Arias continued to hang out on several occasions until -- disenchanted Arias says -- she moved back to Northern California. They continued to communicate. The prosecution's case . Alexander's naked body was found crammed in a stand-up shower after he missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. He had been stabbed 27 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit from ear to ear. Arias initially told an investigator, ""I heard a lot of rumors, and that there was a lot of blood."" She later claimed she killed him, albeit in self-defense. Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan Martinez has accused Arias of playing the victim when, in fact, he alleges she staged the crime scene to make it look like self-defense and has actively sought to profit from the media attention. Prior to Alexander's killing, Martinez said, Arias stole her grandparents' .25-caliber pistol, rented a car in Redding, California, turned off her cell phone and brought along cans of gas so there would be no record that she was in Arizona. ""The only reason to keep this whole thing a secret, which is what she tried to do, is because she was going to kill him, and she's making preparations,"" the prosecutor said. Finally, according to Martinez's closing argument, after she killed Alexander, she hooked up with an out-of-state romantic interest so she would have an alibi. ""She continues on to Utah into his waiting arms. Gosh, you can almost hear the violins making their sound as she goes up to him, gives him that first kiss. Isn't that romantic?"" Martinez said. Arias' defense . Defense attorney Jennifer Willmott has said Arias was the victim of a controlling, psychologically abusive relationship and that Alexander considered Arias ""his dirty little secret."" Before Arias killed her ex in self-defense, Willmott claimed, she was subjected to rough vaginal sex. After she dropped Alexander's new camera, he became violent, the defense said, and had Arias not defended herself, investigators would've found Arias, not Alexander, dead in the bathroom. Arguing the prosecution's position that Arias was obsessed with Alexander and stalking him, another defense attorney, Kirk Nurmi, has said it didn't add up because Arias was active on a Mormon dating site. ""Jodi ... wasn't so locked in on Travis that she wasn't looking for other men,"" Nurmi said. As for the allegation that Arias attempted to surreptitiously slip in and out of Arizona without a trace, Nurmi pointed out that Arias went to the Redding, California, airport to rent her car for the trip. ""An airport with security cameras and security all around,"" the defense attorney said, ""not some rental car agency on the outskirts of town -- an airport. That doesn't make any sense if you're on a covert mission."" Nurmi also questioned the merit of the prosecution's gas can argument, saying Arias could have avoided a paper trail simply by paying with cash. She didn't need cans, he said. Did Arias change her story? Sure, Nurmi said, but that's not what she's standing trial for. ""If Jodi Arias were accused of the crime of lying, I could not stand before you and say she's not guilty of that crime, but nowhere in your jury instructions are you asked to convict Jodi Arias of lying,"" Nurmi said. Fascination . If you didn't realize before, you probably see now why the case has drawn a cult following of sorts. It's rife with sex, lies and digital images, many of them naughty, and the dueling attorneys are lively -- nay, bombastic -- in their arguments. Arias herself has been tweeting from jail -- through a proxy, of course -- criticizing HLN and Martinez, and directing followers to a website that sells art on her behalf. For some media outlets, the case is gold. HLN has created a show, ""After Dark: The Jodi Arias Trial,"" which invites an in-studio and at-home audience to grade the day's arguments. Its website is flush with every facet of the case, including a photo gallery containing 180 evidence photos. The Huffington Post has similar coverage, and CNN affiliates KPHO and KNXV in Phoenix have special trial pages on their websites. Before you lob cries of a sensationalist media profiting off a gruesome death, realize that people are clamoring for the coverage. HLN has enjoyed a ratings boost since the trial began, and people drive hours to see the trial for themselves. Spectators began lining up Friday at 1 a.m. -- more than six hours before the courthouse opened -- to get a seat, according to KPHO. Until April 25, the public was given access on a first-come-first-served basis, but the judge changed it to a lottery system for closing arguments, the station reported. Everardo McFarlane of Phoenix was none too happy with the change, as he was first in line Friday but didn't make the cut. ""I just hope justice is served and that at least we get our $1.6 million worth with a conviction,"" McFarlane told KPHO, referring to the ever-increasing taxpayer expense on the trial. R.D. Williams of Amarillo, Texas, didn't have the luxury of a short drive across town. ""It's 10 hours nonstop, two times to fuel up. I didn't bring no extra gas cans,"" Williams said, making a joke about a key argument in the case. Potential outcomes . What could happen to Arias is anyone's guess. If the jury's hung, she could face a retrial. The prosecution, naturally, would like to see a first-degree murder conviction, as its case has revolved around Arias premeditating the killing. If convicted on this charge, Arias will face a mini-trial of sorts to determine if she killed Alexander cruelly and knew he would suffer. A first-degree murder conviction could mean execution unless a jury grants her leniency, in which case she would get life in prison and may not be eligible for parole for at least 25 years. If the prosecution can't prove premeditation, Arias could still be convicted of second-degree murder, commanding 10 to 22 years in prison. The jury can also decide that Arias killed Alexander recklessly or that he attacked her. She'd then be convicted of manslaughter. Lastly, the jury could find her not guilty or determine that she acted in self-defense and that her actions were reasonable. Either way, she'd then be free to pursue her dream of becoming a professional photographer, and the media circus could move to another town.","Jodi Arias' murder trial began in January .

"(CNN) -- The game just changed. And Beyonce just changed it. The music industry has a track record knowing how to market the extremely prolific, gifted, inspiring, highly-credited icons. They've done it for years. There's a formula: Put out a single on the radio first, then blanket the market with promotion, then schedule a big release party. Sure, there are the legends who have created their own vine, their sonic signature sound,their own untraceable music landscapes -- The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and the ""King of Pop,"" Michael Jackson. For those icons, the rules -- and techniques -- are a bit different. But none of them tried what Mrs. Carter just pulled off. When Beyonce surprised the entire music industry this month by releasing her latest album, ""Beyonce,"" only on iTunes first -- with no warning, no other promotion, no launch parties, no advance radio play, none of the traditional pre-sale retail hype -- she showed how only a true star can break this industry glass ceiling. When it comes to business savvy, she just joined the lists of the greats. Related: Beyonce's secret album set to debut at No. 1 . The album quickly became the No.1 seller on iTunes, moving more than 1 million copies worldwide in just its first week. And, at the same time, she also released 17 full-fledged music videos. This was no stunt. It was a smart and honest way to let the fans decide for themselves if they wanted the LP without major promotion and publicity. And, by announcing it first on Instagram to her millions of followers, it was a masterful nod to her true, loyal fans -- and they have responded in kind. No one in the music industry could have pulled this off except Beyonce. Her global fans follow her 24/7 online, on the air and on social media. And, like Michael Jackson, her stardom keeps fans anticipating her next song, her next dance move, her next fashion statement and her next signature on the dotted line. And she reset the retail music business, too. It didn't matter if retailers like Target -- who just announced their plans -- decided not to sell the LP that hit retail outlets Friday because it was released on iTunes first. Other outlets, such as Walmart (where Beyonce made a surprise appearance), have stepped up and will sell out before they can order their next shipment. Target's loss, Walmart's gain. Related: Beyonce's surprise album: What's the verdict? Beyonce is unique. She has shown that she is not afraid to try new things to reach greater heights, to change the game.

"London (CNN) -- Last night Britain's fashion elite gathered at the London Coliseum for the 2013 British Fashion Awards. Nominees for the prestigious industry awards included models Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell, and designers Anya Hindmarch and Sarah Burton. Trends may come and go, but even among this fashion-conscious crowd there was one certainty: all eyes would be on Kate Moss. The British Fashion Council honored the 39-year-old model with a Special Recognition Award for her 25 years in the industry. During her glittering career she has appeared on 34 covers of British Vogue. She's fronted campaigns for Burberry and Chanel. And she's remained one of the world's best-paid models, even as twenty-somethings like Hilary Rhoda, Lara Stone and Joan Smalls have stomped onto the catwalk. Despite all of those achievements, Moss seemed starstruck as she accepted her trophy from Marc Jacobs. ""Oh my god. It's so weird, very very surreal,"" she said on stage. ""Thank you everyone who has worked with and kept booking me. I am really very grateful."" Born to a barmaid and a travel agent in Croydon, south London, modeling was not an obvious career move. But in 1988 Sarah Doukas, the founder of Storm Model Management, spotted Moss at New York's JFK Airport, where Moss was catching a connecting flight home after a family holiday to the Bahamas. Watch: Where have all the black models gone? Standing just 5'7, her waifish look contrasted sharply with the likes of Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford, two of the leggy Glamazons who dominated the runways at the time. David Ross, a London based portrait artist, shot the first professional pictures of Moss later that year. He remembers that she offered something fresh and approachable, underlined by a quiet strength. ""She just had a certain edge in her natural expression and there was a look in her eye in her very first pictures that we are still familiar with today,"" he says. Modeling came easy to her, and Ross was able to capture a surprisingly large range of expressions for a model so young. She seemed unaware, or at least unmoved, by her prowess, and she lacked the diva qualities so common in aspiring models. ""She wasn't like other girls doing the big 'I AM',"" Ross says. ""She was young, but she had the perfect balance of being cool and collected and warm towards everyone at the same time, which made her very attractive to work with."" Two years later British photographer Corinne Day shot black-and-white images of Moss for Face magazine. The fashion press went wild and Moss became the poster child of the grunge aesthetic. After years of casting glamor girls on the runway, designers gravitated to Moss' 'anti-model' look. In subsequent years Moss walked the line between haute and mainstream, appearing in campaigns for a diverse roster of brands including Bulgari, Dolce&Gabbana, Longchamp, and Versace, but also Virgin Mobile and Nikon cameras. In 2003, she even portrayed a pole dancer in the White Stripes' music video ""I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself."" For reasons photographers, fashionistas and editors do not fully understand, Moss's look translates across all demographics, from the luxury consumer to the high-street shopper. Legendary photographer David Bailey has taken some of the most iconic shots of Moss. As he tells CNN: ""Kate has a unique beauty that is totally democratic and has a universal appeal."" That makes her highly bankable. Brands eventually encouraged Moss to leverage her fashion credentials in new areas, and she moved from catwalk to the design chair. When she designed a collection for Topshop in 2007, the entire range sold out on the first day. She went on to design 14 more collections for the store. Last July, Moss's range of ""fashion tech"" accessories for mobile phones became the fastest-ever selling accessory at Carphone Warehouse, a British high street retailer. Moss's journey from Croydon to the runways of Paris and Milan has not always been easy. High-profile romancesâ€”to Johnny Depp, Jefferson Hack and Pete Dohertyâ€”fizzled. In 2005, she lost lucrative contracts with Burberry, Chanel and H&M after British tabloids reported allegations of drug abuse. That fall she voluntarily entered a rehabilitation clinic in Arizona. Her travails were high-profile, but so was her recovery. Within a year Moss had clawed her way back to the top of the industry, securing a raft of lucrative campaigns. Her difficulties seemed to endear her to the public even more. After rehab she went on to climb the Forbes magazine list of the world's highest paid models. In an industry defined by physical perfection, vulnerability has its appeal. Alexandra Shulman, the editor of British Vogue, views Moss's success in more straightforward terms. ""Kate has had such a long and successful career as a model because she is sensationally good at it,"" she says. ""She understands what it means to model and I think she enjoys the skill she has in this role. I know all my fashion editors and photographers love working with her because of this and also because it's nearly impossible to take a bad picture of her."" In September, Christie's auctioned a series of art works inspired by Kate Moss for more than $2.6 million. A three-foot-high glass figurine of Moss sold for $214,000. Some might say she is being consigned to history. A more generous interpretation is that collectors understand that her value will continue to soar. Just ask Topshop. In April Moss will launch her 15th line with the retailer. Don't call it a comeback. As fans of fashion's most enduring face already know, Moss hasn't gone anywhere.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Shield"" actor Michael Jace, appearing in a Los Angeles court Wednesday, entered a not guilty plea in the slaying of his wife. His attorney did not object when the judge set bond at $2 million and ordered Jace, 51, to have no contact with his two children. A preliminary hearing, in which investigators are expected to testify about why they arrested Jace in the May 19 shooting death, is set for August 1. April Jace, 40, died from ""multiple gunshot wounds,"" according to preliminary autopsy results. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled the death a homicide, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. Jace, who played a Los Angeles cop in TV's ""The Shield,"" wore a yellow jail jumpsuit and was kept handcuffed while in a glass holding area for Wednesday's hearing. 'Shield' actor Michael Jace charged with wife's murder . Police found April Jace shot to death in her south Los Angeles home the evening of May 19, Detective Lyman Doster said. Michael Jace called 911 to report that his wife had been shot, Detective Dean Vinluan said, adding that he ""was on the phone with the operator."" Neighbors who heard gunshots also called 911, he said. Jace's father-in-law also called 911 as he drove to his daughter's home after receiving a message from Jace about the shooting. ""My son-in-law called me and texted me and said come get the kids because he shot April, our daughter,"" he said in a recording released by the Los Angeles Fire Department. ""At this moment, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence,"" a police statement a day after the killing said. Two children were in the Hyde Park-area home when their mother was shot, Vinluan said. Investigators have found no reports of domestic violence between the husband and wife at their residence, another Los Angeles Police Department detective said. A woman described as a close friend of Jace's first wife said in a sworn statement that she witnessed Jace physically abusing his wife in 1997. The declaration was in court records from Jace's 2005 custody case concerning his son with Jennifer Bitterman. Jace ""choked and hit"" his wife and ""slammed her against the wall while (their infant son) screamed in his crib next to her,"" Maria De Le Vegas said in the sworn declaration obtained by CNN. Jace ""was raging and out of control, and seeing the extent of his anger was one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen,"" she said. Jace appeared to suffer severe financial strain in recent years, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The actor filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2011, citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000 from residuals from his TV and film work, the documents said. Jace had defaulted on the $411,000 mortgage on the south Los Angeles home where his wife died, according to the documents. He married April Jace in June 2003, a year after divorcing his first wife, with whom he shared a son who is now a teen. The FX police drama ""The Shield"" provided the biggest and longest-running role in Jace's 22-year acting career. He appeared in 89 episodes as Julien Lowe, who started as a rookie officer in an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct in 2002 and rose through the ranks to become a detective before the series ended in 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database. He acted on several episodes of ""Southland,"" another TV drama about Los Angeles police, between 2009 and 2012. Jace often played a law enforcement or military officer on television shows. He is credited with roles in ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" ""Private Practice,"" ""The Mentalist,"" ""Burn Notice"" and ""NYPD Blue."" He had the title role of Michael Jordan in the 1999 TV movie about the NBA star, ""Michael Jordan: An American Hero."" Jace played Officer Brown in Russell Crowe's 2009 film ""State of Play,"" and he portrayed a Black Panther member in the 1994 blockbuster movie ""Forrest Gump."" April Jace had worked for the past year as a financial aid counselor at Biola University, a private school in La Mirada, California, according to the school. ""We are obviously shocked and saddened by this terrible news, to lose a wonderful colleague, mother and friend,"" Biola President Barry Corey said in a written statement. ""April's radiant personality brought great energy to the financial aid office,"" financial aid director Geoff Marsh said. ""Her love for helping students and families and her great work ethic earned the respect and love of her coworkers. Her smiling face and helpful spirit will be missed by all.""","A preliminary hearing for Michael Jace is set for August 1 .

"Northern Tanzania (CNN) -- One could classify the Hadza people as a throwback. Numbering a mere 1,300, they represent one of the last communities of hunter-gatherers in the world. Their language -- which includes click consonants -- is unrelated to any other on Earth, and is possibly one of the oldest spoken languages in existence. Their DNA, too, suggests an ancient heritage, easily 100,000 years old (and possibly a primary root for mankind's family tree). Their home, near Northern Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge, has been dubbed the ""Cradle of Mankind,"" partly because it has unearthed some of the oldest known human remains. An ancient way of life . Many of the Hadza live in a remote stretch of Tanzania, where much of their day is given over to foraging and hunting. The techniques they use for finding sustenance are passed down generation to generation. The men favor handmade bows and arrows, while the women dig up roots and gather berries. The Hadza don't store food, plant trees or build houses. Rather, they make temporary huts from dried grass and intertwined branches, and move in accordance with the local animals. ""We are rich in tradition,"" explains Shani Msafin-Sigwaze, the first Hadza to attend university, and an informal spokesperson for his community. ""Culture is very important, because when people forget their culture, they forget where they are from,"" he adds. Mounting challenges . Unfortunately, the Hadza way of life is under threat. In the last 50 years, they have lost 90% of their land to farmers and cattle herders, according to Survival International, an NGO in defense of tribal people around the world. ""Without the land, the Hadza will disappear,"" warns Msafin-Sigwaze. Furthermore, a lot of the big game animals and local plants that traditionally have made up the bulk of the Hadza diet are disappearing. ""There is a big problem with cows,"" admits Msafin-Sigwaze. ""The animals are scared of them and they run away. That's why the hunters have to [travel] far to even find little birds."" Meanwhile, much of the local forest and bush has been burned to make way for crops, or has been razed to produce water holes for irrigation. ""The Hadza are suffering much because the natural food is disappearing,"" explains Msafin-Sigwaze. Positive signs? Though the threat the Hadza face is real -- and extinction is far from a remote possibility -- there have been some successful efforts to restore some of what they've lost. In 2011, for instance, the Tanzanian government issued land titles to a community of Hadza living in Yaeda Chini. Now Msafin-Sigwaze, who belongs to a separate tribe of Hadza, is hoping he can achieve the same for his community. ""I belong to the Hadza. I study in the name of the Hadza. The name of the Hadza has made me go to university,"" he says. ""Now, I'm going to fight until I see the Hadza get their land.""","The Hadza are one of the last communities of hunter-gatherers in the world .

"(CNN) -- A teenage girl was raped at the same Keith Urban show where 20 people got so drunk they were hospitalized, police said. The attack happened in front of a large crowd of other concertgoers on the lawn of the Xfinity Center, an outdoor amphitheater in Mansfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday night, a police statement said. The rape ended when a woman in the crowd pushed the alleged attacker off the victim and he fled, police said. Sean Murphy, 18, was arrested ""a short time later"" and charged with rape, police said. ""Officers conducting the investigation were assisted by patrons that had been concerned and took photos and video of the assault on their cellular phones,"" the Mansfield Police statement said. ""Those phones are being processed to recover the digital evidence of the assault."" Murphy entered a not guilty plea in court and was released on $10,000 bond. ""Put simply, this was a consensual act, not a sexual assault,"" his lawyer said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday. ""There are no allegations of force or violence against him. This was a private act that regrettably occurred in a public place. Mr. Murphy deeply regrets this incident and I am sure the young woman does as well. The young woman was neither intoxicated nor overcome by drugs at the time. Mr. Murphy has no criminal history whatsoever."" ""You are going to need to go through local authorities on this one,"" Urban's representative told CNN when asked for a comment Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- A woman whom police describe as a high-end prostitute is under arrest after they say she injected a Silicon Valley tech executive with heroin and then casually left as he lay dying. Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51, had an ""ongoing prostitution relationship"" with Alix Catherine Tichleman, 26, when he was found dead November 23 aboard his 50-foot yacht in the Santa Cruz harbor, according to a police statement. Detectives say security footage from the yacht shows Tichleman, who boasted of over 200 client relationships via a website called ""Seeking Arrangements,"" injecting Hayes with heroin. How heroin kills you . ""Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichleman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles,"" the police statement reads. Tichleman stepped over Hayes' body several times while gathering her belongings, at one point stepping over him to finish a glass of wine, police say. They say the video finally shows her leaving the boat and then reaching back to lower a blind and conceal the victim's body from outside view. Tichleman appeared in court in Santa Cruz on Wednesday. She is being charged with manslaughter, administering heroin to another person, administering bodily harm, moving heroin across county lines, possession of heroin and prostitution charges. A public defender asked that her arraignment be postponed until July 16. Police say they came across Tichleman in the course of investigating the death of Hayes, a Google executive who reports say worked on the Google Glass project, among others. They say they became concerned that she planned to leave the state, so detectives posing as a potential client lured her to an ""upscale location"" after arranging a July 4 session for more than $1,000. She was arrested when she arrived. Google did not return messages seeking comment. Apple, where reports say Hayes previously worked, declined comment. ""I was really devastated when I heard about it,"" Todd Zion, who worked at Google for a short time under Hayes, told The San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday. ""He was a great boss. I never had a chance to thank him."" Tichleman describes herself as a model, makeup artist and writer on what appears to be her Facebook page, on which her name is spelled Tichelman and which says she formerly worked at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. It says she studied journalism at Georgia State University in Atlanta. ""It's really nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in cold blood...and they love it too,"" a June 28 post on the page reads. ""No judgement. Yay! F**k all of that positivity bullsh**. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die."" The profile includes numerous modeling shots of Tichleman, some of them in provocative poses. By midafternoon Wednesday, the page appeared to have been deleted. The police statement says detectives are looking into a similar death in another state to see whether Tichleman may have been involved.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 55 people were killed and scores more wounded when bombs exploded across Iraq on Tuesday, a stark reminder of the violence and instability that grips the country 10 years after the start of the U.S.-led war. The attacks -- 17 car bombs, seven roadside bombs, and two shootings -- ripped mostly through Shiite neighborhoods of Baghdad, but also struck Sunni communities in other towns. At least 187 people were wounded. Interactive: Iraq 10 years on . The level of carnage has dropped considerably since the height of the sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007 that nearly tore Iraq apart. But the continuing violence serves as a near daily reminder of the violence poses to the fragile political and economic gains in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. It's the second time in less than a week that the Iraqi capital has endured major simultaneous attacks. Ten years on, the war left more than 134,000 Iraqis and more than 4,800 U.S. and other coalition service members dead. The war cost hundreds of billions of dollars. ""It remains entrenched and pervasive, with a clear beginning but no foreseeable end, and very much a part of the present in Iraq,"" said Iraq Body Count, a UK-based group that tracks war deaths. ""In major regions of the country armed violence continues to exact a remorseless toll on human life, young and old, male and female, across society."" In Tuesday's violence, car bombs rocked Baghdad neighborhoods long engulfed in conflict, like Shulaa and Kadhimiya. They struck Mustansiriya University in eastern Baghdad and the fortified International Zone, also known as the Green Zone, where the city's international presence is concentrated. They hit cities north and south of the capital as well. Authorities defused four car bombs in the southern city of Basra. Attackers set off roadside bombs, another potent weapon for Iraqi insurgents and a defining symbol of the war. One of those bombs rattled Baghdad's teeming Shiite slum of Sadr City. The U.S. mission in Iraq condemned the attacks in Baghdad and in other provinces -- such as Anbar, Kirkuk, Babel, Nineva, and Diyala. It was not immediately clear whether the attacks were related. No group immediately claimed responsibility for them. Ten years later, Iraq is on pins and needles . Change can be seen in the once war-torn nation. A robust form of democracy has taken hold. Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds and others often work together. There is more political, economic and social stability. Coalition forces that ousted Hussein's government have departed. However, recent attacks in Shiite areas have spread fear among Iraqis that sectarian warfare between Sunnis and Shiites may ravage the country again. Attacks targeting the Justice Ministry last week left 30 dead and 50 wounded in strikes authorities suspect were carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq. Sunnis had more political clout during Hussein's reign. The Shiites and the Kurds, the other two main groups, were second-class citizens. Since Hussein was toppled, the tables have turned. Shiites -- the largest religious group in the country -- predominate in government. The Kurdish semiautonomous region in the north, and the Kurds themselves, have more clout. Today, Sunnis feel they've been politically marginalized. They demand that the Shiite-led government stop what they call negative treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected. The deteriorating security situation prompted authorities to postpone provincial council elections scheduled for April in the predominantly Sunni provinces of Anbar and Nineveh. Expert: The Syrian conflict is hitting home in Iraq . Ramzy Mardini, an expert on Iraq, said the attacks were probably ""prescheduled for the anniversary."" He also said the latest violence reflects the Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions raging next door in Syria. He believes such attacks illustrate the revival of the ""capability and confidence"" of al Qaeda in Iraq, buoyed by a Syrian uprising ""spearheaded by Sunni militancy."" It stands to reason that the attackers are targeting the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The Shiite-dominated government is helping neighboring Iran, the largest Shiite nation in the world and a supporter of the Alawite-dominated Syrian government. ""Al Qaeda in Iraq is becoming less exclusive to Iraq. They are trying to channel energy and piggyback off the Syrian revolution by aiming to merge Iraq and Syria into one theater of sectarian war,"" said Mardini, adjunct fellow at the Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies in Beirut, Lebanon. ""Given that Maliki is helping Iran prop up the Syrian regime, AQI is advertising their cause and looking to attract the support and resources of militant groups in Syria."" Mardini said Sunni militants are baiting al-Maliki and Shiites to retaliate. ""They're working overtime to plunge Iraq back to sectarian war. But more important than the attacks will be how the Shiites respond. Restraint will be key, but harder to achieve should attacks against Shiites continue. Iraq has already entered the electoral season, where everyone on the political scene fuels the fear factor towards their respective sectarian corners."" It is likely that these attacks aren't going to taper off soon, he said. ""What's going on is a campaign, nothing isolated. The Syrian revolution is a strategic force of instability and will continue to provide both rationale and support to Sunnis trying to fight Shiites anywhere in the region,"" he said. ""Growing Sunni discontent directed towards Maliki's government could be providing more cover for al Qaeda fighters to operate than before."" The Obama administration marks the milestone . U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Chuck Hagel marked the 10th anniversary of the war's beginning with statements praising the service members who fought in Iraq. Obama honored the more than 1.5 million service members and civilians who served there and the memory of the nearly 4,500 Americans who died there. ""The last of our troops left Iraq with their heads held high in 2011, and the United States continues to work with our Iraqi partners to advance our shared interest in security and peace."" Obama said a strong Post-9/11 GI Bill would help veterans pursue jobs and education. ""We must ensure that the more than 30,000 Americans wounded in Iraq receive the care and benefits they deserve and that we continue to improve treatment for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder."" Hagel and Obama also praised the sacrifices of service members' families. ""Our reflections include the Iraqi people -- the Iraqi soldiers and police officers who died alongside our own, the men and women who were caught in the crossfire, and those who still struggle today to secure and govern their nation,"" Hagel said. ""The Iraqi people will determine the future of Iraq and the United States will continue to support their efforts for a peaceful, secure, free, and prosperous nation.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Horrifying glimpses of the brutality underpinning the rule of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi emerged Sunday with news of a warehouse full of charred corpses and a nanny to Gadhafi's grandchildren tortured. Meanwhile, rebel forces who have driven Gadhafi and his family into hiding advanced toward his hometown. And CNN has found Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of blowing up a Pan Am jet in 1988, comatose on what his family says is his deathbed. On the eastern side of Tripoli, troops commanded by Gadhafi's son Khamis killed an estimated 150 captive civilians, as they retreated last week, hurling grenades and spraying bullets into the building full of men they had promised to release, a survivor said. The massacre took place Monday, the survivor, Muneer Masoud Own, told CNN. Rebels advancing on Tripoli discovered the bodies charred beyond recognition in a warehouse next to the military base. In addition, a nearby resident told CNN that at least 22 bodies were found in a ditch near the base, but it was not clear whether those remains were connected to the killings at the warehouse. The base is on the main road from Tripoli to the city's airport, which the rebels secured Friday. Own, 33, said he and his 30-year-old brother were held there for 18 days after being arrested by Gadhafi's forces. He said there were about 70 prisoners held in the warehouse, some of them for up to six months. They ranged in age from a 70-year-old man to a 17-year-old boy. Monday, with rebel forces pushing into the capital, their guards told them they would be released by sunset, Own said. Instead, he said, just before sunset, the guards opened fire on the men inside, some of whom managed to escape. He has not found his brother. Gadhafi, who ruled Libya for four decades, and his family are now fugitives, hunted by the rebel forces that toppled his government after a six-month revolt backed by Western airpower. Rebel fighters picked through his family's seaside villas on Sunday, finding high-end stereo equipment, hot tubs and wines valued at hundreds of dollars a bottle, despite an official ban on alcohol. And they found the horribly scarred Shwygar Mullah, the Ethiopian maid who cared for the children of Gadhafi son Hannibal. Mullah told CNN that Hannibal Gadhafi's wife Aline twice expressed her displeasure with her work by scalding her with boiling water -- then refused to get her medical attention, leaving her scalp and face covered in a mosaic of scars and raw wounds. Read more about the nanny's experience . Her offense: Failing to beat a daughter who refused to stop crying. ""She took me to a bathroom. She tied my hands behind my back and tied my feet,"" said Mullah, who worked for the Gadhafis for about a year. ""She taped my mouth, and she started pouring the boiling water on my head like this,"" she said. Another of the Gadhafi household staff, a man from Bangladesh who did not want to be identified, corroborated Mullah's story and said he also was regularly beaten and slashed with knives. And in an upscale neighborhood of the capital, convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi lay in a coma, CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson discovered. His family says al-Megrahi is in his last days of a battle with cancer, dimming hopes that he would shed more light on the 1988 attack that killed 270 people. Read more about al-Megrahi's condition . Robertson found al-Megrahi under the care of his family in his palatial Tripoli villa Sunday, surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip. His son, Khaled al-Megrahi, said they took him from a hospital as the rebels advanced on the capital and have been treating him at home. ""There is no doctor. There is nobody to ask. We don't have any phone line to call anybody,"" Khaled al-Megrahi said. Al-Megrahi was freed from a prison in Scotland in 2009 after serving eight years of a life sentence for blowing up the Pan Am jet, killing all 259 on board and 11 in the town of Lockerbie below. Doctors who had been treating him for prostate cancer gave him just three months to live, and he was released on compassionate grounds. He received a hero's welcome in Tripoli, enraging many in the United States and Britain. And with the recent overthrow of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have called for al-Megrahi to be sent back to prison. But the National Transitional Council, the rebel movement that toppled Gadhafi, announced Sunday that it won't allow the dying al-Megrahi to be extradited. ""We will not give any Libyan citizen to the West,"" NTC Justice Minister Mohammed al-Alagi said. The rebels extended their control over the country on Sunday. Spokesman Shamsuddin Ben Ali said NTC forces have taken over the western Libyan city of Ben Jawad, about 100 miles east of Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte. And a senior rebel military official said about 14,000 rebel fighters were ready to ""liberate"" Sirte but have given Gadhafi forces there until Monday to disarm and let the rebels enter the city peacefully. ""All the Libyan people are aware of the fact that the people in Sirte are Libyan,"" NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani said. Separately, CNN saw rebels in control of key towns along the road from Tripoli west to Tunisia, giving their commanders hope they can start bringing in supplies to ease a growing crisis in the capital. Alamin Belhaj, a member of the NTC leadership, told CNN that its priorities are now the liberation of Tripoli, security, water and fuel services. One of Gadhafi's sons, businessman Saadi Gadhafi, made another offer to negotiate with the rebels on Sunday and sounded prepared to cut loose his father and another son once assumed to be his heir. ""If (the rebels) agree to cooperate to save the country together (without my father and Saif), then it will be easy and fast. I promise!"" Saadi Gadhafi wrote to Robertson, referring to Moammar and Saif al-Islam Gadhafi. Saadi Gadhafi said the NTC cannot ""build a new country without having us in the table."" He predicted the rebels would break into two camps, ""Islamists and others,"" allowing the Gadhafi regime ""to choose who we will support so we will come back any way.""

"Malibu, California (CNN) -- Smashing! That pretty much sums up the waves coming to Southern California this week. And depending on whom you ask -- weather forecasters or surfers -- that word means either life-threatening peril or enlivening fun. Far offshore, Hurricane Marie is driving some of the tallest breakers in years to crest at Los Angeles-area beaches. The National Weather Service has issued beach hazard and high surf warnings from more than 100 miles north of L.A. down to the border of Mexico. The swells should last until Friday. They have surfers reveling, according to Surfline, because after a pretty tame season, finally: Surf's up! And how. One surfer was sucked out in the current, but fortunately, famed big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton was nearby. He and another surfer helped the man out. ""We pushed the guy in,"" Hamilton said. ""I mean, he was OK, because he was still strong enough to swim well, (but) it was one of those ones where it could have easily gone bad."" He said many of the surfers off Malibu Surfrider Beach were not used to waves as big as the ones this week. ""The ocean loves those guys. It squeezes and holds them down for a little while,"" Hamilton said. But it's not a game, he said. ""You gotta have your respect for the ocean,"" Hamilton said. One person died in the water Tuesday night, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Scott Miller said, but it was unclear whether the death was directly related to the tumultuous surf. The surfer may have had a medical issue. Lifeguards performed 115 rescues on Tuesday, Miller said. The dangers . ""There is the potential for damaging and life threatening surf,"" says the National Weather Service, which predicts waves breaking at heights of 10 to 15 feet. They could erode away a lot of beach, and wrack buildings and infrastructure close to the shore. The pounding waves are paired with other dangers. ""Very strong rip currents and long shore currents will likely create extremely dangerous and life threatening conditions for anyone,"" the Weather Service says. Rip currents are hard-to-spot flows that can drag unsuspecting swimmers out to sea. Long shore currents can shove them sideways down the shoreline. There are other dangers, thanks to the number of surfers. ""But the real threat is the surfboards,"" said Bo Bridges, a surfer who cut short a vacation in Colorado to catch these ""epic"" waves. ""It's really dangerous when you're paddling out there and a big set wave comes out, and four or five guys are all dropping at the same time,"" he said. Having an effect from afar . Hurricane Marie won't come anywhere near making landfall, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. ""It's way offshore."" The closest it will come to the state is 800 miles away on Thursday, he said. Parched Southern California won't even see any rain, which it is craving during an extended exceptional drought. But even at that distance, Marie's counterclockwise swirl is still washing waves up the California coastline. Beaches facing the south and southeast will get hit with the heaviest surf. Surfers' joy . It's great for surfers. It's where they want their waves. And how they like them. And this is the second time in short order that they've gotten them. Tropical Storm Lowell, which is petering out, served them up nicely, too. Surfers will be looking for ""select focal points,"" as Surfline, a website for surfing enthusiasts, calls them, where its forecasters predict some waves cresting at well over 18 feet. It's more than high enough to make for tall ""pipes"": the hollow air tubes that top-heavy waves form when they roll over on themselves. Surfers love navigating them, and Surfline will be following the action via a slew of webcams. Surf forecasters have broken down the height of the surf by time of day and particular beach. ""The Wedge,"" a point just off of Corona Del Mar, looks like the place to be.","NEW: Surfer says the number of people in the water is another issue to be mindful of .

"(CNN) -- Hurtling across the Milky Way like an eternal explorer -- the Voyager 1 spacecraft continues to nonchalantly reveal the mysteries of the solar system to a captivated Earthbound audience. Active volcanoes, methane rain, icy geysers and intricate details about Saturn's rings -- the list of revelations attributed to the mission reads like fantastical sci-fi novel but it has revolutionized planetary astronomy. Thirty-seven years after it launched, Voyager 1 is still out in the vast expanse of space, periodically relaying new data back home. But in 2013, NASA made the groundbreaking announcement that Voyager 1 had left the heliosphere -- a magnetic boundary ""bubble,"" if you will, which scientists use to explain the separation of our solar system from the rest of the galaxy. ""That means Voyager has traveled outside the bubble of our sun,"" explains Voyager project manager Suzy Dodd. ""The data Voyager 1 sends us now is data from other stars and from super nova eruptions and the remnant of stars that have exploded over the course of history."" It's an incredible achievement for a probe built for an initial five-year mission. But now, not for the first time since the extraordinary statement, doubts have been cast on whether the craft has actually made the historic crossing. While measurements allowed NASA to feel confident enough to confirm Voyager 1 had entered interstellar space, two University of Michigan scientists who have worked on the Voyager missions remain skeptical. ""This controversy will continue until it is resolved by measurements,"" said George Gloeckler, a University of Michigan professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences, and lead author of a new study, in an American Geophysical Union press release. SEE: Moon maps through the ages . To that end, Gloeckler and fellow University of Michigan professor and study co-author Len Fisk, predict that when Voyager does cross the threshold into interstellar space, the probe will identify a reversal in the magnetic field, which will be relayed back to scientists on Earth, conclusively determining the spacecraft's location. They expect this magnetic field shift to occur in the next two years, and if it doesn't, this would confirm that Voyager 1 has already left the heliosphere. But while we may not know the exact location of Voyager 1, we do know that it's one of the most successful spacecraft of all time. 'The little spacecraft that could' Launched individually in the summer of 1977, Voyager was a twin-spacecraft primary mission developed by NASA to explore Jupiter and Saturn and their larger moons. Following successful completion of the Voyager mission's primary objectives, a rare planetary alignment offered up remarkable opportunities for the two craft to continue space exploration. ""Voyager took advantage of alignment of the outer planets, which are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, to be able to go by all four of those planets in a 12-year period. That alignment of planets only happens every 176 years,"" says Dodd -- who has described Voyager 1 as ""the little spacecraft that could."" So in 1980 the Voyager mission was officially extended and renamed the Interstellar mission. The probes were now participating in an exploratory odyssey to the farthest reaches of the heliosphere ... and beyond. Through remote-control reprogramming -- a technological advancement unavailable at launch -- using Saturn's gravitational field, the Voyager 1 probe was fired like a slingshot on a trajectory that would take it onwards into interstellar space. Meanwhile Voyager 2 was redirected onto a new flight path, taking in the sights of Neptune and Uranus, before it will eventually follow its counterpart out of the heliosphere. To this day, it remains the only man-made object to have visited Neptune and Uranus. Not bad for vintage technology that has just 70 kilobytes of memory on board; a 16 gigabyte iPhone 5 has more than 240,000 times that amount. Voyager 1 is now so far from Earth that commands take more than 17 hours to reach it. But it will be a little while before the spacecraft will encounter any more planets. ""It is going to take us 40,000 years to come within three light years of the next nearest sun or the next nearest star,"" says Dodd. ""And that is a long, long time.""

"(CNN) -- It had all the elements of a soap opera. A broken marriage. Alleged influence peddling. Courtroom drama. Now the trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife has gone to the jury after more than a month of sometimes soul-baring testimony on whether they improperly accepted gifts from a businessman while in office in exchange for promoting his company. McDonnell, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party with potential presidential ambitions, and his wife, Maureen, arrived and left the courthouse separately throughout the trial in a display at the heart of their defense. The pair pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of fraud, making false statements, and obstruction. They were indicted in January after McDonnell left office following the lone term allowed under Virginia law. Prosecutors alleged the McDonnells accepted gifts with a combined value of at least $140,000 from Jonnie Williams, a nutritional supplement executive, in exchange for promoting his company using the power and the trappings of the governor's office. The gifts included designer clothes, a Rolex watch, golf clubs, iPhones and a painting, according to the indictment and evidence presented at the trial. Their defense? The 38-year marriage was so broken that the McDonnells barely spoke to each other, let alone conspired to peddle influence in the way alleged by the government. McDonnell said he didn't commit any crime, though he acknowledged questionable judgment in accepting what he called the ""personal generosity and friendship"" of Williams. Defense lawyers argued that Maureen McDonnell, seeking emotional attachment because of her loveless marriage, developed what they described as a kind of schoolgirl crush on Williams and relished the attention and gifts from him. The question was whether she or her husband reciprocated by promoting Williams' business in government circles. Witnesses included some of the family's five grown children, former staff members of the governor and others close to the family. The McDonnells tried to get their cases separated, but lost that bid. CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Former Gov. McDonnell and his wife face charges of influence-peddling .

"(CNN) -- Holders Iraq sealed their place in the last eight of the Asian Cup in Doha after a narrow 1-0 victory over North Korea. A goal midway through the first half from Kerrar Jasim proved enough to gain Iraq second place in Group D and secure a showdown with Group C winners Australia, with a semifinal place for the winners. Jasim slid in to score from close range after North Korea goalkeeper Ri Myong-Guk could only parry Mustafa Kareem's swerving shot. Bend it like Bhutia: Meet India's David Beckham . Meanwhile, police in the Sunni town of Falluja, 60km west of Baghdad, told CNN they imposed a curfew during the match to prevent people from shooting in the air in case of an Iraqi victory. Similar Incidents that followed Saturday's win over United Arab Emirates saw three people killed and seven others wounded, accoring to local health officials. It is an Iraqi tradition to celebrate by firing pistols or machineguns into the air, but Baghdad Military Operation Command issued warnings that some insurgency groups might take advantage of these shootings and conduct terrorist attacks against Iraqi security forces or civilians. Elsewhere in the Asian Cup, Iran comfortably topped the group with a maximum nine points -- the only nation to achieve that target -- after cruising to a 3-0 victory over United Arab Emirates despite fielding a weakened side. Having already qualified, Iran made nine changes to their side, but they still proved far too classy for their opponents, who finished the group bottom and without a win or goal to their name.

"(CNN) -- Sitting incongruously among the hangars and laboratories of NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley is the squat facade of an old McDonald's. You won't get a burger there, though -- its cash registers and soft-serve machines have given way to old tape drives and modern computers run by a rogue team of hacker engineers who've rechristened the place McMoon's. These self-described techno-archaeologists have been on a mission to recover and digitize forgotten photos taken in the '60s by a quintet of scuttled lunar satellites. The Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP) has since 2007 brought some 2,000 pictures back from 1,500 analog data tapes. They contain the first high-resolution photographs ever taken from behind the lunar horizon, including the first photo of an earthrise (first slide above). Thanks to the technical savvy and DIY engineering of the team at LOIRP, it's being seen at a higher resolution than was ever previously possible. ""We're reaching back to a capability that existed but couldn't be touched back when it was created,"" says Keith Cowing, co-lead and founding member at LOIRP. ""It's like having a DVD in 1966, you can't play it. We had resolution of the Earth of about a kilometer [per pixel]. This is an image taken a quarter of a f***king million miles away in 1966. The Beatles were warming up to play Shea Stadium at the moment it was being taken."" Between 1966 and '67, five Lunar Orbiters snapped pictures onto 70mm film from about 30 miles above the moon. The satellites were sent mainly to scout potential landing sites for manned moon missions. Each satellite would point its dual lens Kodak camera at a target, snap a picture, then develop the photograph. High- and low-resolution photos were then scanned into strips called framelets using something akin to an old fax machine reader. The images were beamed in modulated signals to one of three receiving stations in Australia, Spain, or California, where the pictures--and collateral chatter from the NASA operators--were recorded straight to tape. After finishing their missions, the satellites were unceremoniously dashed against the moon rocks, clearing the way for Apollo. The brilliant and ballsy engineering was typical of NASA during its golden age, a time when it was also more closely linked to other government agencies with an interest in taking pictures from space. ""These guys were operating right at the edge,"" Cowing says with a reverence for these NASA engineers that's shared by his team. ""There's a certain spy program heritage to all this, but these guys went above that, because those spy satellites would send their images back. These didn't. They couldn't. They were in lunar orbit."" Fascinating Ways People Try to Leave Their Mark on the World . The photos were stored with remarkably high fidelity on the tapes, but at the time had to be copied from projection screens onto paper, sometimes at sizes so large that warehouses and even old churches were rented out to hang them up. The results were pretty grainy, but clear enough to identify landing sites and potential hazards. After the low-fi printing, the tapes were shoved into boxes and forgotten. They changed hands several times over the years, almost getting tossed out before landing in storage in Moorpark, California. Several abortive attempts were made to recover data from the tapes, which were well kept, but it wasn't until 2005 that NASA engineer Keith Cowing and space entrepreneur Dennis Wingo were able to bring the materials and the technical know how together. When they learned through a Usenet group that former NASA employee Nancy Evans might have both the tapes and the super-rare Ampex FR-900 drives needed to read them, they jumped into action. They drove to Los Angeles, where the refrigerator-sized drives were being stored in a backyard shed surrounded by chickens. At the same time, they retrieved the tapes from a storage unit in nearby Moorpark, and things gradually began to take shape. Funding the project out of pocket at first, they were consumed with figuring out how to release the images trapped in the tapes. ""We're both Apollo babies, so the moon to us was something that's unfinished business,"" says Cowing. ""These tapes were sealed for history by somebody who cared, and it was astonishing the condition they were in. So we started buying used parts on eBay, Radioshack -- I was sitting at a black-tie reception at one point buying something on my iPhone. We just buy and reassemble these things bit by bit."" The drives had to be rebuilt and in some cases completely re-engineered using instruction manuals or the advice of people who used to service them. The data they recovered then had to be demodulated and digitized, which added more layers of technical difficulties. The resulting framelets had to be individually reassembled in Photoshop. After kluging through countless engineering problems (try finding a chemical substitute for whale oil to lubricate tape heads), the LOIRP team was able to single out and reproduce the famous earthrise image. This proof of concept brought the first NASA funding in 2008, and the team recently completed processing the entire tape collection. ""We're the first people out of a generation or more to see this,"" says Cowing. ""No human eye had ever seen this. All they saw was something that had already been through one generation of copying. We're seeing something one order of magnitude more precise right on the screen."" Since the '60s, a series of Earth and moon imaging satellites have launched, including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009. Despite the advances in computing power and optics, Cowing says the terabytes of images recovered at LOIRP are often even more detailed than those taken by LRO, capable of being blown up to billboard size without losing resolution. ""A lot of the images they're taking today, our imagery from 1966 and '67 has sometimes greater resolution and greater dynamic range because of the way the pictures were taken. So sometimes you look into a shadow in a picture that LRO's taken, and you don't see any detail -- with ours, you do."" Officially named Building 596, McMoon's flies a flag bearing the distinct Skunkworks skull and crossbones, signaling the team's hacker ethic. The seven or so people tinkering away inside maintain an open-source mentality about their work, making all images and their technological discoveries free to the public. They also have plans for a decommissioned Titan ICBM that's sitting outside (for students, of course). McMoon's has grown into a highly specialized operation, stuffed with a melange of old and new technology now put to use in decoding various NASA and Library of Congress tapes that no one knows what to do with. With a built-in ability to handle hazardous chemicals, the old McDonald's made practical sense, but it also gave them a layer of distance to carry out their weird work. ""I had a choice between the barbershop and this building -- we didn't really care what sort of building they gave us, we just didn't want to pay for it,"" Cowing says. ""The surplus folks at NASA Ames where all the old computers and stuff go, they love us because we come over and make all the old stuff work. The safety guys come by and we usually either make them our friends or bark at them and they don't come back."" The images gathered at LOIRP have been coerced into providing even more information than they were intended to. Their data have been used to correct figures from the time about Earth's arctic ice levels, and have helped identify an El Nino-type event in the '60s. All the images and the information gathered from them are being fed into the Planetary Data System, an official repository where mission data from LRO, Mars Observer, Climate Orbiter, and many others are documented. Started by the same Nancy Evans that provided the tape drives, the Planetary Data System didn't exist when the Lunar Orbiter pictures were initially taken. The images and information that LOIRP has recovered will be submitted as the official record of the original sattelite mission. It's a testament to the lasting work of the engineers who designed the orbiter missions, and the tenacity of the modern techno archaeologists who are bringing that work to full fruition. ""Back then things were designed, even if they failed, to still do something. Today, most jet fighters would fall out of the sky if they didn't have computers adjusting their surfaces and their pattern thousands of times a second. Back then they just had to engineer stuff elegantly so that it worked,"" he says. ""We feel that we're completing the Lunar Orbiter 1 through 5 missions. They never formally submitted their stuff for the archives so we're doing it."" Read more from WIRED: . What Exactly Is in McDonald's Famous French Fries?

"(CNN) -- Whether or not Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Tower will be the world's tallest building upon completion is subject to debate (last week, it was announced China just might thwart the Kingdom's ambitions). Even if it only ties for the honor, there's no doubt that the 3,280-feet (1,000 meters) tall structure will be a luxury experience. As it turns out, even the elevators will be VIP. Not only will the elevators reach a record height of 2,165 feet (660 meters), but the elevators responsible for shuttling visitors directly to the tower's observation deck will be the world's fastest double-decker lifts -- traveling at speeds of 30 feet (10 meters) per second. According to Johannes de Jong, head of technology for major projects at Kone Corporation -- the company contracted to build the structure's elevators -- high-rolling residents will also be able to communicate directly with the lifts through their phones. ""You can call the elevator as you step out of your car so you have it practically there when you arrive,"" he says. Kone, who are leaders in elevator technology, will also be doing away with what for decades has been one of the most defining elevator features: buttons. ""Instead, we will have keypads outside the elevators, where people can type in their destination,"" says de Jong. The advantage, he says, is that people traveling to the same destination can be grouped together in one elevator. It's a system that not only speeds up the journey by enabling each elevator to make fewer stops, but is more energy efficient as well. Even crafting an elevator that can reach heights above 1,600 feet (500 meters) is a technological marvel. The reason is that steel cables, which have long been the traditional means of pulling up an elevator, are heavy. The taller the building, the more cables are needed to lift it. In order to travel the distance to the observation deck, a single elevator in the Kingdom Tower would require nearly 20 tons of steel rope. Getting that much weight to where it needs to be for installation is near impossible. New technology, in the form of the KONE UltraRope, has made it newly possible for an elevator to reach great heights. Made from carbon fiber, the new rope is both lighter and stronger than its steel predecessors. By comparison, a single lift would only require around three tons of the new cable to operate. The savings in weight, says de Jong, equals a further reduction in energy consumption. ""Because of the rope, these elevators will reduce typical energy consumption by as much as 21%,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- A 65-year-old man flying from California to Hawaii was forced to ditch his plane in the Pacific Ocean on Friday night 13 miles off the coast of Hilo after running out of gas, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The man was flying for delivery a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft from Monterey, California, to Hilo when he radioed federal aviation authorities that he was 500 miles out and low on fuel, said Petty Officer 3rd Class Angela Henderson, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard. He estimated he would run out of fuel 100 miles short of the island, according to a Coast Guard statement. The Coast Guard deployed rescue crews aboard a C-130 Hercules and an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter to intercept the pilot and escort his plane with the hope of coaching him to a safe landing, said Coast Guard Lt. Gene Maestas. A Coast Guard ship was also at the scene. The plane didn't make it, running out of fuel as the pilot had predicted. ""The pilot ditched his airplane at approximately 5:23 p.m. and climbed out of the cockpit onto the wing,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. Video released Saturday by the Coast Guard shows the small aircraft skimming along the water before coming to a stop. It eventually settles and floats in the water, seemingly intact and with its nose pointed in the opposite direction from which it came. A man is then shown being pulled from the water toward the helicopter. After being rescued, the pilot was transported to Hilo Medical Center for evaluation, Henderson said. ""He was reported to be coherent with no significant injuries,"" the statement said. American King Air Services, an airplane ferry service, said on its website Saturday that the pilot had ""successfully ditched."" It said that he is ""in good condition,"" and that the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. The plane was registered to the Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, company. Neither American King Air nor the Coast Guard immediately released the pilot's identity. ""We are waiting right now to hear from the Coast Guard about the aircraft,"" Pablo Bassabe, a company vice president, told CNN. Hilo is about 2,300 miles west of Monterey, where the pilot's flight began. According to the aviation site Airliners.net, Cessna 310 aircraft have a range between 760 to 1955 miles, depending on various factors including cruising altitude, weight, amount of reserve fuel and the specific model.","American King, an aircraft ferry service, says the pilot was rescued in ""good condition""

"(CNN) -- Yes, it's New Year's Eve again, time to bust out the champagne and make resolutions you probably won't keep. But this year's different. Cities around the world were hosting some of the most amazing celebrations ever. Edible confetti raining over London? Check. How about 400,000 pyrotechnics exploding over Dubai? That happened, too. And let's not forget that the new year also means bizarre new laws. Here's what people experienced across the globe: . 1. Taste the rainbow . Why have a fireworks show that only looks good? Revelers in London stuck out their tongues during Tuesday's extravaganza and enjoyed banana-flavored confetti that was choreographed to the fireworks. They also saw floating oranges drifting through the night sky and popped them to enjoy a citrusy scent! Food artists Harry Parr and Sam Bompas worked working on the show for an entire year. They even made sure their edible treats were kosher, vegan and hypoallergenic. ""We developed a special confetti that's actually biodegradable, and in the rain it will magically dissolve,"" Parr said. ""Even better, it tastes amazing."" 2. Dubai goes big -- really big . In Dubai -- a city obsessed with superlatives -- organizers pulled off a world record for the biggest fireworks display near the world's tallest building. The spectacular show featured 400,000 pyrotechnics over 400 parts of the Dubai shoreline. That's 100 kilometers (62 miles) of waterfront lighting up. The Guinness World Records staff later labeled it the largest ever. The show blew Kuwait's world record out of the water when last year it set off 77,000 fireworks over 64 minutes. If you were there, send your photos or video to iReport! 3. Have a ball -- an 'odd' ball . Sure, New York has a massive sparkly ball they've been dropping for the past century or so. But what other objects can you relinquish to gravity to mark the new year? In some U.S. cities, it's a fruit. In Honolulu, it's a colossal glowing pineapple. In Atlanta, it's a giant peach. The North Carolina mountain town of Brasstown prefers a possum -- slowly lowered and then set free. But Key West, Florida, takes the cake with its drag queen drop. For years, female impersonator Gary ""Sushi"" Marion has been lowered from the Bourbon St. Pub in Key West while riding in a massive high-heel shoe. ""It was inspired by 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' when it first came out, with the whole high heel on top of the bus,"" said Joey Schroeder, owner of Bourbon St. Pub. ""I wanted to take that idea and do something fun on New Year's Eve."" 4. 25 hours of celebrations . Samoa and American Samoa are virtually neighbors, with just 101 miles between them. But they're also 25 hours apart. So one was among the first to ring in the new year; the other will be among the last. How can this happen? Let's just say the international date line isn't even close to a straight line. And because the date line isn't fixed by any international law or agreement, it can zig and zag to accommodate government and business interests. It's as close to a time machine as we'll probably get. 5. Yes to placentas, no to shark fins . More than 40,000 new laws will take effect in the U.S. on New Year's Day. While Colorado's legalization of marijuana has racked up plenty of headlines, here are some of the more peculiar ones: . In Oregon, mothers will be allowed to take their placentas home from the hospital. Some say placenta capsules can help with postpartum depression, CNN affiliate KGW reported, though there's not a lot of medical research backing that up. Delaware will join a growing number of states where you can't own, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine. And thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines. Because if you're going to a vending machine, clearly you care the most about calories, right? Depends on what day of the resolution you're on.

"(CNN) -- An early morning earthquake rattled northern Illinois on Wednesday, shaking an area about 50 miles west-northwest of downtown Chicago, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake was originally reported as having a magnitude of 4.3, but the USGS later downgraded it to magnitude 3.8. It hit just before 4 a.m. CT (5 a.m. ET), with an epicenter about 3 miles underground. The USGS pinpointed the quake between the towns of Virgil and Sycamore, Illinois. Millions of people felt the temblor, with reports coming in to the USGS from Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin, as well as Illinois. Members of the public sent more than 10,000 reports of the earthquake to the USGS within the first few hours after it struck. See local coverage of the Illinois earthquake . Several callers to CNN said the quake shook their homes severely, but there were no immediate reports of major damage. Doug Dupont of Belvidere, Illinois, about 70 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, said the quake shook him out of bed and caused a 1-foot-long crack in the wall of his kitchen. ""It was really scary. It felt like a train was going by our house,"" Dupont said. ""This is not California. This is northern Illinois. We are not supposed to get earthquakes."" Did you feel it? Tell the world about it . Rex Covington, who lives about five miles west of Elgin, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WGN that the tremor lasted five or six seconds -- and also shook him out of bed. ""I was sleeping and the whole bed was shaking, it was that violent,"" Covington said. ""The whole house shook,"" Walter Mockus of St. Charles, Illinois, told WGN. ""The chimes that hang were all ringing. It was so loud, I thought a plane had gone down."" The shaking also woke up Sarah Evans, of Elgin, Illinois. She immediately turned to the microblogging site Twitter, where she has 38,000 ""followers,"" to see if anyone else had felt the quake. Evans instantly found others in her area who had experienced the shaking, and says she found them comforting because ""I'd never felt an earthquake before."" Read about how Evans confirmed the earthquake and connected with others on Twitter . The Illinois earthquake was mild compared to the one that leveled parts of Haiti last month, according to the USGS. The Haiti quake was about 33,000 times as powerful. Some of the strongest earthquakes ever known to hit the United States took place in the Mississippi River valley in 1811, 1812, and 1895, but Wednesday's Illinois event was 250 miles or more to the north of those temblors, said Randy Baldwin, a geophysicist with the USGS. ""This is a different area geologically,"" he said, calling Wednesday's earthquake unrelated to the New Madrid quakes of the 19th century. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: USGS revises magnitude down to 3.8 .

"(CNN) -- There is nothing new under the sun, the saying goes, and it could not be more true than with the recycled literature of the popular ""mommy porn"" trilogy ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Just this week, Universal Pictures acquired the movie rights to the bodice ripper for reportedly more than $5 million as traditional publisher Knopf/Vintage promises to turn the book, which has been sold mainly as an e-book, into a paperback version with a 750,000 copy print release next month. However hot the property appears, the plot and devices are centuries old, leading us to wonder whether the commercial success signals a breakthrough in women's sexual freedom or a new low in women's debasement. The novel tells the story of Anastasia Steele, who finishes college by losing her virginity to billionaire Christian Grey, becoming his ""submissive"" in a sadomasochistic relationship. The e-book version of the trilogy has gone viral with mature women readers, even as critics have denounced the book's reactionary gender politics. Neither extreme explains the novel's compelling relevance. Though no literary masterpiece, ""Fifty Shades"" is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent ""Twilight"" vampire series. Its abundant references to classic literature unlock a subtler commentary on enduring obstacles to women's individual freedom and rights. Whenever power relations are unequal, the novel implies, sexual consent is never black and white: It is always fifty shades of gray. Paying attention to its literary signposts shows what has changed for women in that regard and what has not. When ""Fifty Shades"" begins, the heroine's favorite pastime is to curl up with a good book, not a whip. After the hero asks her to sign a contract defining her role as his submissive, she tells the reader, ""[Austen's] Elizabeth Bennet would be outraged, [Bronte's] Jane Eyre too frightened and [Hardy's] Tess would succumb, just as I have."" Insistent references like this remind us that ""Fifty Shades"" is recycling the classic novel plot about a vulnerable young woman and a brooding older man. The hero has the lion's share of socioeconomic power; the heroine has only her magnetic strength and intelligence. News: Erotic book surges up best seller list . The classic plot promises that by steeling her virginity and holding out for marriage, women can achieve intellectual equality and love. Those who fail come to bad ends, but the victorious novel heroine learns the hero's secrets and gains ownership of his heart and true self. This last is exactly the fantasy that ""Fifty Shades"" sells. There is nothing new either about this plot's association with pornographic whips and chains. Alongside the genre of the novel, the 18th century saw the emergence of modern pornography, from John Cleland's ""Fanny Hill,"" to works by the Marquis de Sade, whom Christian Grey imitates as a confessed ""sadist."" Gothic horror novels, which specialized in sadomasochistic innuendo and supernatural phenomena, were also sensationally popular. The whip and the vampire emerged in tandem with the marriage plot and chick lit. Christian gives Anastasia an app for all the 18th- and 19th-century novels in the British Library, but he also presents her a $14,000 first edition of Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles."" The still-disputed question Tess poses concerns whether the heroine is raped or seduced. Though Anastasia Steele is never raped, her individual agency is equally ambiguous. She refuses to sign Christian's contract, but she lets him spank, whip, chain and blindfold her for the remainder of the trilogy. When the debasement gets too extreme, she walks away (like Jane Eyre upon discovering Rochester's bigamy). Yet she returns, echoing Tess: ""The physical pain you inflicted was not as bad as the pain of losing you."" Throughout, her self-punishing ""subconscious"" drives her away from Christian, while her libidinous ""inner goddess"" makes her dread losing him. If she doesn't submit, she will have only her books. In exchange for her masochistic submission, Anastasia receives an infinite array of explosive orgasms and Christian's love and protection. Sadistic Christian always uses a condom, never uses porn and always puts her pleasure first. He loves, cherishes, provides and above all uses his power to protect Anastasia -- all while gradually opening up to her, making himself psychologically vulnerable. SPOILER ALERT: It turns out that he is a sadist because he was once victimized by older women. Lest you think women are unequal, the novel emphasizes the hero's ultimate powerlessness. No wonder female readers are falling for this story. When the story was first popularized in the 18th century, women had virtually no individual rights. They could not vote, could rarely own property and were themselves seen as property -- so much so that if a wife had an extramarital affair, a husband could sue her lover for damages. Though many things have changed, women remain economically disadvantaged, are far more likely to be violated than titillated by the porn industry and are publicly called ""sluts"" for demanding insurance coverage for birth control. The enduring appeal of a plot like that of ""Fifty Shades"" suggests that even in 2012, most women cannot imagine how such inequality might disappear. Instead they clamor for the delusion that submission to men's greater power means being taken care of by them. Of course, pornography can be seductive, and ""Fifty Shades"" is hot. Less enjoyable is the undercurrent about women's lack of rights. Christian tells Anastasia, ""You need to free your mind and listen to your body."" But to what extent can women enjoy free play in a country where those going by the name of ""Christian"" mount legislation forcing them to bear children conceived in rape? When poor young women like Christian's ""crack whore"" mother are denied access to birth control? By enjoying a porn of their own, women can at least indulge the fantasy that their pleasure comes first even as politicians are devising new forms of punishment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of April Alliston and Susan Celia Greenfield.","April Alliston and Susan Greenfield say ""mommy porn"" novel a big hit .

"(CNN) -- Those who oppose the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling and the explosion of outside money in politics might be breathing a sigh of relief that more than $1 billion in outside spending in federal elections, which heavily favored Republicans, did not seem to buy the results that the big spenders wanted. After all, most of the candidates backed by Karl Rove's Crossroads groups and the Chamber of Commerce, beginning with Mitt Romney, lost their races. But those concerned about the role of money in politics shouldn't be relieved. Not at all. Here are three reasons to keep worrying: . 1. The biggest problem with money in politics is not that it buys election results but that it skews legislative priorities. Senators and members of Congress already spend ridiculous amounts of time raising money for their next election campaigns and to help fellow party members get elected and stay in office. Big outside money is going to make this money chase worse. It is not enough to worry about what your opponent can raise; now a billionaire across the country can put a million or more dollars up against you at the drop of a hat any time you take a position that the billionaire doesn't like. The fund-raising frenzy will never cease. This potential for massive outside spending -- which may reflect the preferences of just one or a handful of people -- will change how Congress considers and passes legislation. Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, dropped $60 million or more in this election without making a dent in his net worth. How many members of Congress do you think would be interested in supporting gaming legislation, which Adelson opposes? And if they want to oppose Adelson, members would have to raise even more outside money to try to level the playing field. Most worrisome when it comes to legislative skewing is what we as the public don't see: what gets left out of legislation, small favors buried in the fine print, things that get killed in committee. Sometimes a lot of money is riding on these invisible legislative choices. 2. Money still matters in campaigns. No serious student of American politics believes that the candidate with the most money always wins. After all, look at Linda McMahon, who spent more than $100 million of her own money in two bids to become senator for Connecticut. But money gets candidates second, third and fourth looks even when those candidates are lousy and don't deserve it. Consider Newt Gingrich in the Republican presidential primary. He survived as long as he did only because of the money from Adelson. In close races, money can make a difference. Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Lungren of California lost a close contest in his race thanks in part to large amounts of outside spending against him. Not coincidentally, Lungren had been one of the first Republicans in recent years to call for campaign finance reform to curb the influence of outside money. A Sunlight Foundation analysis found at least four House races where outside money may have tipped the outcome. At the presidential level, the unprecedented amount of outside money made the Obama-Romney race competitive, where it otherwise would not have been. While Obama succeeded in almost keeping up with the Republican fund-raising machine (and Obama also seemed to spend his campaign dollars more wisely), it is not clear that future Democratic candidates will be able to replicate the Obama fund-raising strategy, raising massive amounts of money from tens of millions of small donors. If big outside money in presidential elections leans toward corporate interests, it will give the candidates those interests back an edge in close elections. 3. Secret money is growing and dangerous. Thanks to holes in our disclosure laws, which Republicans in Congress so far have not seemed interested in fixing, much of this outside spending is going through groups who do not disclose their donors. The lack of disclosure is troubling for two reasons. First, voters use information about donors to evaluate campaign messages. Voters should know when Chevron or a big union is behind a ""social welfare"" group with a nice sounding name like ""Americans for a Strong America."" Even more importantly, disclosure provides the press and public with tools to smoke out some legislative sweetheart deals that members of Congress might be offering big spenders. If we are going to be in a world without effective limits on campaign spending -- and the Supreme Court seems quite unlikely to reverse course on this point anytime soon -- disclosure is a second-best solution to try to limit the legislative leanings caused by large amounts of outside money. Sunlight can help expose the worst abuses of the political system wrought by unregulated money. Rather than breathing easily, opponents of big, undisclosed outside money in politics need to continue to press the case for reform, beginning with a desperate need to fix our laws requiring disclosure by all who spend big bucks in our elections. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Hasen.","Rick Hasen: Big money didn't buy the election, but it's still hugely influential .
Ineffective spending limits let big donors influence lawmakers, skew priorities, he says .
He says outside spending can't always buy elections, but it has good chance in close races .

"(CNN) -- Hunter Moore, once dubbed the ""most hated man on the Internet"" and the ""Revenge Porn King,"" is free on bond after being indicted on felony charges including identity theft and conspiracy. Moore, 27, the founder of a now-defunct ""revenge porn"" website is accused of hacking into people's e-mail accounts to steal nude photos to post online, federal authorities said this week. On Friday, a judge released him on bond set at $100,000 and took his passport as collateral, according to a court document. Moore is to appear in court again on February 7. He was released into the custody of his parents, who signed the bond, CNN affiliate KCRA reported. His release came with some conditions. Moore is not to use a computer or get anyone else to do it for him. He must take down his social media accounts and get tested for drug use, KCRA reported. Moore, who the FBI says operated isanyoneup.com, was arrested in Woodland, California, Thursday. Also arrested was Charles Evens, a 25-year-old man in Southern California believed to be connected to the scheme. 'You took the picture' In 2012, way before this arrest, Moore talked to HLN's Dr. Drew about the website. ""The site was just born, actually,"" Moore said. ""It was just a couple of friends and, you know, we had our hearts broken by a couple of girls, and we thought we would make a site. And it became Is Anyone Up. That's how it started. Of course. But when I did start the site, I was hurt, and so was my friends."" But later in the show Moore was confronted by a woman who called in and said she regretted taking topless photos for a boyfriend and was devastated when the pictures appeared online. ""I don't know how you can point your finger at me,"" Moore responded."" You took the picture. I mean, I've been justifying this in my head for over a year and a half of the site. But at the end of the day, it started with you. You took these pictures."" Site got out of hand . The FBI says Moore and Evens conspired to peddle ""hundreds"" of nude pictures, without getting permission in 2011 and 2012. But, according to an indictment Moore allegedly pushed Evens to hack into computers to get more sexually explicit photos. Moore then would pay Evens for the photos and then post them on the site, according to the FBI. Both suspects are named in a 15-count indictment with charges that include aggravated identity theft and conspiracy. If convicted, they face up to five years in federal prison for each conspiracy and hacking-related charge. Moore actually shutdown the website in 2012 and sold it to an anti-bullying group. ""Taking down the site has been something I`ve wanted to do for months,"" Moore said. ""It was just something I created that got out of hand. It was supposed to be for friends."" CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Moore was released on bail Friday after being arrested a day earlier .

"(CNN) -- Ruthless pirates try to hijack an unarmed American ship. They seize the captain and, after negotiations fail, Navy SEALs stage a daring rescue. It reads like the plot of a Hollywood movie. And now it is one. The real-life events that surrounded the 2009 attempted seizure of the Maersk Alabama inspired the film ""Captain Phillips,"" which will be released on Friday. When asked about taking on the leading role in the film, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks said his main focus was accurately portraying Capt. Richard Phillips' story. ""I don't want to ruin his life by, you know, turning his motivations into something they weren't,"" Hanks said earlier this month. That can be difficult, Hanks said, because of ""the fakery that goes on"" in creating a cohesive screenplay based on real-life events. ""When we met, I told Rich, I said, 'Hey, look, I'm going to say things you never said and I'm going to be places you never were, but what I'm going for is ... authenticity.' "" Phillips' crew members say he is not the hero the film will likely present him as. (""If you want to shoot someone, shoot me!"" Tom Hanks bravely yells at one of the armed Somali pirates, in the movie's trailer.) In reality, Phillips ignored numerous warnings to stay farther off the coast of Somalia, the site of dozens of hijackings, which hit their peak in 2008 and gained international attention. Many of the Alabama's crew members are suing the shipping company, the Danish shipping line Maersk, in part because they say Phillips deliberately sailed the ship into harm's way to shorten the trip to Mombasa, Kenya, and save money. On April 8, 2009, four armed Somali pirates boarded the Maersk Alabama about 380 miles off the Somali coast. After failing to take control of the ship, the pirates seized Phillips and held the captain on a small lifeboat for five days until Navy SEALs shot and killed three of the kidnappers and captured the fourth. Somalia pirate retires . Before the incident, a private maritime security agency called Securewest International had sent e-mail warnings about piracy in the region to all ships in the area; one was sent specifically to Phillips. Each e-mail was based on information from British and U.S. naval authorities and one urged the Alabama to stay clear of the shipping lanes where Phillips was heading. ""Vessels should consider maintaining a distance of more than 600 nautical miles from the Somali coastline,"" one of the Securewest messages advised. Phillips said to CNN's Drew Griffin in 2010 and in a court deposition last year that he ignored the numerous warnings that urged him to go farther out to sea. Accused high-ranking Somali pirate gets life sentences . Phillips is a witness in the lawsuit between some of the crew and the shipping company, scheduled to go to trial in December. When asked last year why he decided not to take the boat farther offshore, Phillips testified, ""I don't believe 600 miles would make you safe. I didn't believe 1,200 miles would make you safe. As I told the crew, it would be a matter of when, not if ... We were always in this area."" After his rescue by U.S. Navy SEAL commandos, Phillips was lauded as a hero and wrote a book about his ordeal, ""A Captain's Duty."" The publisher promoted him as a sea captain who risked his life by offering himself as a hostage ""in exchange for the safety of the crew,"" something Phillips later acknowledged was a falsity spread by erroneous media reports. ""I didn't give myself up,"" he told Griffin during his book tour in 2010. ""I was already a hostage by then."" He later said, ""The media made everything out to be me. But that's the media. When I came home, I really didn't go and put myself in front of the media. A lot of my crew did. I didn't."" He said the real heroes are the Navy SEALs and his crew, who he said stayed calm, followed orders and instincts, and prevented a tragedy. ""They did a wonderful job,"" he said. ""It's in the book. Everywhere I speak, I say what a great job they did."" CNN's Drew Griffin and David Fitzpatrick contributed to this report. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- ""Release the models!"" The stage manager's voice fills the backstage area, busy with hairstylists and makeup artists wielding the tools of their trade over a row of girls in front of brightly lit mirrors. ""It's time for a quick run-through."" It takes an extra moment for Petra Vujevic to break free from her chair, where she is surrounded by three stylists trying to tame her long blonde hair into a ""punky ballerina"" bun. The head stylist is teasing sections of her natural hair while another tends to neon pink extensions woven into her ponytail. A third handles clips and brushes. Vujevic winces. It hasn't been a good hair day for the 20-year-old Croatian model. It's the second time today that her head has been pulled in a million directions, loaded down with gooey products and hairspray. But she refrains from pouting because it's part of the job. Anyway, modeling isn't her life -- not yet, at least. It's just something she decided to try by taking a year off from university in Croatia, where she's studying computer science. She started exactly one year ago, making the rounds in Milan, Paris, London and Spain before arriving in New York three weeks ago for Fashion Week. A ""Man Repeller's"" influence on display at New York Fashion Week . ""When you're tall and thin, everyone says you should be a model, so I thought: try it for a year,"" Vujevic said in accented English, which she learned in school and from television. ""It's been good. I decided to model because it was completely different. How would I know if I didn't try?"" She hit the ground running in New York, averaging 15 castings a day and scoring not only a few shows during New York Fashion Week but jobs for catalogs and ads campaigns while in town. She plans on returning to her parents' home outside the Croatian capital of Zagreb to resume school in October. Vujevic may not be the typical small-town girl trying to make it in the big city, but her story underscores the bigger picture in the post-supermodel era, when girls are cycled in and out with each season and only a rare few stick around to become bold-face names. But her agency has high hopes for her. Lots of girls are tall, thin and beautiful, but Vujevic has an ""X presence,"" said Louise Roberts of APM Models, which represents Vujevic in the United States. ""Our clients look for that classically beautiful girl that has a different edge to her, something that no one can define,"" Roberts said. ""We loved the spirit in Petra's photographs, the connection she had with the camera. In her eyes, you just saw there was a sparkle there. When you look at her, you have a sense that this girl can be successful."" But Vujevic is simply living in the moment. And right now, it's time for a quick practice walk on the runway. The stage manager yells again for the girls, and Vujevic joins the line of models near the backstage runway entrance. With their hair and makeup in various states of readiness, they look like a disheveled flock of flamingos stepping to the beat of singer/designer Avril Lavigne, who is nowhere in sight even though the show bears the Canadian rocker's name and her brand's imprint, Abbey Dawn. The collection, a swirling motif of skulls, rainbows, pleather and studs, isn't exactly Vujevic's speed, but she's still excited to take part in this kind of production. It's completely different from Rachel Antonoff's garden party-themed presentation Sunday, in which Vujevic's prop was a badminton racket, or the Christine Alcalay presentation earlier that day, which was staged in a 1,000-square-foot studio in an office building. For that job, she wakes at 7 a.m. Monday, showers and puts on just a bit of mascara and concealer. She takes a cab to the Garment District, arriving at the 11th floor whitewashed studio about two hours before showtime. It's not a runway show but a ""presentation,"" in which the models will be dressed and positioned on the showroom like living mannequins. For now, the corner studio with lots of natural light pouring through the windows is a backstage area for hair and makeup. Eventually, it will transition into a showroom with music from a live violinist, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of an art gallery. Vujevic takes a seat, and a makeup artist gets to work on her face while a nail technician applies heated ""nail shields"" that behave like stickers. As she moves on to hair, the benches and makeup tables are removed, and risers are brought in to begin setting up the showroom. Twenty minutes later, her hair is done, and the tables are pushed back to a wall. A curtain goes up, creating an impromptu changing area for the designer to dress the girls. She emerges in a set of light blue shorts, blazer and shell. ""It's not really my style, very businesswoman,"" she says. ""Maybe in 10 years."" Once the models are clothed, a set designer arranges them on the floor while stylists dart around with spray cans and makeup brushes, putting on the final touches. Then, it's time for the girls to stand in place for an hour as fashion editors and store buyers survey the collection. When a camera focuses on Vujevic, she narrows her eyes ever so slightly. About a half-hour in, she leaves the floor for the curtained changing area and returns in a tan calf-length skirt and lace cut-out halter top. She stands some more, occasionally shifting her weight to keep the circulation flowing. As the clock hits noon, some of the girls relax their rigid poses and wait for the cue to leave. Vujevic thought she would have a stretch of time for lunch -- modeling makes her hungry, she says -- but as she's leaving the studio, her agency sends an e-mail letting her know that she has a fitting for Gerlan Jeans, so she heads downtown. On the ride over, she talks about this being her first time in the United States. She has noticed that fast food is really cheap, healthy food is expensive and everything seems to be labeled ""organic."" She wishes she had more time to eat in restaurants and try new things but since she arrived in New York, she's only had two days off to explore. In the studio on Bowery, she tries on two looks for the designer's ""Gerl Power"" presentation, which is part Minnie Mouse, part activist, designer Gerlan Marcel says. Vujevic's childlike features and height make her ideal for the show's cartoon-y look, Gerlan says. As she tries on two of the designer's neoprene looks, a bright yellow dress and a blue coat, Gerlan squeals in delight. ""When I was a little girl my favorite doll was named Petra and I carried her around with me everywhere,"" the designer explains as Vujevic struts down the narrow path in between racks of clothing and accessories littering the floor. ""Petra has come to life!"" Gerlan and her team agree that the yellow dress is too short for the 5'11 model and settle on the blue coat. Vujevic bids them farewell and runs downstairs to head over to the Metropolitan Pavilion for Lavigne's show. The contrast from the morning's gig couldn't be more severe. The intimate austerity of the open studio has been replaced with a massive showroom of folding chairs surrounded by booths for Monster Energy drink and thinkThin energy bars, with a bright white runway in the middle. Getting her hair to cooperate and putting on her face leaves about 10 minutes to breathe before the show. On the way to the bathroom, she picks up a salted caramel chocolate from the Stoli Vodka booth. Lavigne eventually shows up about 30 minutes before showtime to thank the girls and pose for pictures. As they line up, she walks around adjusting their bows and belts and other small details. The show is over in 10 minutes, and Vujevic is already 30 minutes late for her next job in SoHo. She fills a plastic cup with vegetables before hustling outside to grab a cab to the Soho Grand Hotel for a presentation by menswear designer and self-described ""urban emperor"" Dominic Louis. Again, the setting couldn't be more different. She walks up a flight of stairs to the hotel bar, which has been transformed into backstage hair and makeup area. The constant loop of ""Sk8er Boi"" and ""Girlfriend"" has been replaced by Siouxsie and the Banshees and Coldplay playing softly in the background. A woman is ironing pants where the waiter station would normally be; models rest their hands on the marble-topped bar to get their nails done. She takes a seat on a plush stool of dark wood while two stylists set to work blowing out her hair to remove product. She picks at a plate of cheese in her lap while they pull her hair into a tight ponytail at the crown of her head and fashion it into a bun. The tip of her hair is pulled into an avant garde cowlick. A makeup artist hands her a cloth to remove her makeup while she waits for a seat at the bar. Eventually, her face is transformed into a pale, white-lined canvas best summed up as extraterrestrial. There's no private changing area here, so she quickly strips and changes into a black top and pants with its calves cut out. She's paraded out with the rest of the models to a corridor and placed on a riser against a column. She stands there for an hour while an art house film plays and attendees in leather black shorts and vests take her picture. Eventually, she moves to the stage in front of the film screen with other models who are growing impatient. Finally, one of the models starts clapping, and the audience follows. The models seize the opportunity to step down and leave the corridor. It's 11 p.m. now, and Vujevic is tired. Modeling is exciting but exhausting, she says. Will she return to modeling after she finishes school? ""It's possible,"" she says. ""But maybe not for New York Fashion Week.""","Petra Vujevic took a year off from pursing her computer science degree to try modeling .

"(CNN) -- The northern California Bay Area's biggest earthquake in 25 years has people asking: Is the world seeing more tremors than usual? And is the long-dreaded ""Big One"" that could devastate California coming soon? Actually, experts say the world might not be seeing more than usual. And as for the Big One, there's no sign that it's imminent. The infamous San Andreas Fault is due for its epic every-150-years rumble. But the quake that struck Sunday, centered about 6 miles southwest of Napa, wasn't on that line. ""I don't think we can make any connection on that,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""This is on a different fault -- still part of the same system, still the plates are still shifting from California, the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate."" More quakes in 2014? Peru, California, Chile and Iceland have all been hit by notable earthquakes in 2014, which has some wondering whether there have been an unusually large amount of strong earthquakes this year. The rate of major earthquakes -- those with a magnitude higher than 7.0 -- more than doubled in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the average since 1979, according to a paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in June by Tom Parsons and Eric L. Geist of the U.S. Geological Survey. But a time period of fewer than 50 years isn't a large enough sample size to definitively say whether this year has had an abnormal number of quakes. It could be a statistical anomaly, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. ""It's such a small sample and short time frame; let's not get alarmed,"" Myers said. The Geological Survey notes that many earthquakes go undetected ""because they hit remote areas or have very small magnitudes."" There has been a greater amount of smaller temblors in the central United States, especially in Oklahoma, which experts say could be a result of fracking in the area. In June, Oklahoma surpassed California in the number of earthquakes this year. ""When they first started happening, they were a big deal,"" said Althea Peterson, a reporter with the Tulsa World. ""It's nothing I ever expected in Oklahoma."" When will the 'Big One' strike? Catastrophic earthquakes seem to strike along the southern San Andreas Fault about once every 150 years, the U.S. Geological Survey said, citing studies examining the past 1,400 years. The last time an enormous temblor on the fault struck Southern California was in 1857. ""There's a real likelihood of a major, major earthquake in the next 10, 15, 20 years,"" California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said. Newsom is former mayor of San Francisco, a city that sits near the Hayward Fault and the San Andreas Fault, ""the one that fear is most instilled in us."" But the San Francisco Bay Area is less likely to see a massive earthquake soon, as only about a century has passed since the great 1906 earthquake. Yet ""moderate-sized, potentially damaging earthquakes could occur in this area at any time,"" the Geological Survey warmed. In 1989, a 6.9-magnitude quake struck the Bay Area during baseball's World Series. The Loma Prieta earthquake caused 63 deaths, 3,757 injuries and an estimated $6 billion in property damage, according to the Geological Survey. What about the 1994 Northridge quake? That mammoth tremor wasn't on the San Andreas Fault; it actually occurred on a fault that no one knew about. That 6.7-magnitude Southern California quake killed 57 people and caused $42 billion in total damage. But even the Northridge quake could pale in comparison to the devastation that the ""Big One"" on the San Andreas could bring. ""It would be like having a Northridge here and Northridge here and Northridge here,"" Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton said this year, indicating swaths of a California map. ""It covers such a wide area that it would be ... a major disaster for the nation."" Six things we've learned since 1994 Northridge earthquake . Why is the San Andreas Fault so notorious? The San Andreas is considered ""the 'master' fault of an intricate fault network,"" the Geological Survey said. It's the fault responsible for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which killed about 700 people. The 800-mile-long fault is the boundary between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate. And because the Pacific Plate shifts about 2 inches a year, the Geological Survey said, Los Angeles and San Francisco will become next-door neighbors (though not for about 15 million years). So while it's impossible for the San Andreas to sweep California out into the ocean, the Geological Survey said, southwestern California is slowly -- very slowly -- sliding past the rest of the state toward Alaska. CNN's Michael Martinez, Kyung Lah and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","The 6.0-magnitude quake Sunday was not on the San Andreas Fault .

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old California girl snatched from the street in front of her house in 1991 had two children with the man accused of taking her and was forced along with the children to live in backyard sheds, police said Thursday. Jaycee Lee Dugard as she looked in 1991 and an age-progression image of what she might look like as an adult. ""From what they have both said, he fathered both of those children with Jaycee [Dugard],"" El Dorado County Undersheriff Fred Kollar told reporters. The girls, now 11 and 15, had been living with their mother, now 29, in a series of sheds behind Phillip Garrido's house in Antioch, California, until they were discovered on Wednesday, Kollar said. ""None of the children had ever gone to school, they had never been to a doctor, they were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house,"" he said. ""They were born there."" In a rambling telephone interview from jail, Garrido told CNN affiliate KCRA of Sacramento he was relieved at being caught. ""I feel much better now,"" he said. ""This is a process that needed to take place."" Kollar said Garrido's wife, Nancy, was with her husband when Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe. Garrido was already a registered sex offender at the time.  Watch police talk about why they arrested Garrido » . ""There was nothing then nor is there anything now to indicate that this was anything other than a stranger abduction of an 11-year-old,"" Kollar said. The investigation went years without apparent progress until Tuesday, when Garrido showed up on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley with his two daughters and attempted to get permission to hand out literature and speak, Kollar said. He did not know the subject of either the literature or the planned talk. Police officers ""thought the interaction between the older male and the two young females was rather suspicious,"" so she confronted them and performed a background check on him, Kollar said. That check revealed that Garrido was on federal parole for a 1971 conviction for rape and kidnapping, for which he had served time in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. A school spokesman identified the officers as Allison Jacobs and Lisa Campbell, and said the two became suspicious of ""subtle behavior"" Garrido exhibited. They passed on the information to Garrido's parole officer, who requested that the 58-year-old man appear Wednesday at the parole office. Garrido did just that, accompanied by his wife, Nancy, ""and a female named Allissa,"" Kollar said. The presence of ""Allissa"" and the two children surprised the parole officer, who had never seen them during visits to Garrido's house, Kollar said. ""Ultimately, Allissa was identified as Dugard,"" Kollar said. DNA confirmation is being sought to confirm her identity, but Dugard revealed information during an interview that only she could have known, Kollar said. ""The two minor children turned out to be children of Jaycee and the male suspect, Garrido,"" he said. Scott Kernan, undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told reporters that Garrido admitted to having abducted Dugard. El Dorado County Sheriff's Office online records showed that Phillip and Nancy Garrido were in the county jail, held on suspicion of offenses including conspiracy to commit a crime and kidnapping with the intent to commit robbery and rape. Dugard had been living behind Garrido's home since she was kidnapped, Kollar said. But her presence there apparently went unnoticed by others in the residential neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000, said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years. ""My dad said he never saw a young woman,"" said Russo, who added that her father, 94-year-old Dante Confetti, considered Garrido to be a ""kind of strange, reclusive, kind of an angry kind of guy."" She said the one-story house's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence. Her family's last contact with Garrido was last fall, she said. ""He was burning something in the backyard and my home health aide called the fire department,"" Russo said. ""He was really pissed off,"" she said. ""Came over to the house and started yelling."" Garrido told KCRA that he left documents three days ago with the FBI in San Francisco, California, that would shed light on the case. ""They're going to be a part of the trial,"" he said. A call from CNN to the FBI's San Francisco bureau was not immediately returned. Garrido said he could not go into detail about why he chose to abduct Dugard. ""I haven't talked to a lawyer yet, so I can't do that,"" he said. But Garrido said he had ""completely turned my life around"" in the past several years. ""You're going to find the most powerful story coming from the witness, from the victim,"" he said. ""If you take this a step at a time, you're going to fall over backward and in the end you're going to find the most powerful, heartwarming story."" He added, ""Wait 'til you hear the story of what took place at this house. You're going to be absolutely impressed. It's a disgusting thing that took place with me in the beginning, but I turned my life completely around."" Describing the two daughters, he said, ""Those two girls slept in my arms every single night from birth; I never kissed them."" But in a later comment, he said that, from the time the youngest was born, ""everything turned around."" Asked about the fact that they had not seen doctors, he said, ""We just didn't have the finances and so forth."" Kollar said a search of Garrido's property ""revealed a hidden backyard within a backyard,"" he said. It included several sheds no higher than 6 feet tall, two tents and several outbuildings ""where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives."" The ""secondary"" backyard was inside the first and was ""screened from view."" One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. ""The way the backyard is set up you could walk through the backyard, walk through the house and never know that there was another set of living circumstances in that backyard."" At the end of the backyard is a 6-foot fence lined with shrubs, tall trees, garbage bags and a tarp, all of which obscured views of what was there, he said. Extension cords provided electricity to the sheds and tents, and an outhouse and rudimentary shower ""as if you were camping"" were there, too, he said. Dugard ""was in good health, but living in a backyard for the past 18 years does take its toll,"" Kollar said. He described her as ""relatively cooperative, relatively forthcoming"" in discussions with detectives. He said Dugard was ""in relatively good condition,"" neither obviously abused nor malnourished. He added, ""There are no known attempts by her to outreach to anybody."" The mother and her two daughters were staying at a motel in the area, he said. ""Family reunification has begun and will be a long and ongoing process,"" he said, presumably referring to Dugard's parents. Earlier Thursday, Carl Probyn, Dugard's stepfather, told CNN that an FBI agent had called his wife, Terry, on Wednesday afternoon to tell her that Dugard had been found. ""Jaycee remembers everything,"" he said. ""They talked back and forth and she had the right answers to all my wife's questions."" He said, ""I'm feeling great! ... It's like winning the Lotto."" He witnessed the abduction of the blond, blue-eyed girl, who was wearing a pink windbreaker and pink stretch pants as she walked to her bus stop on June 10, 1991.

At the time, ""It was reported that a vehicle occupied by two individuals drove up to Jaycee Dugard and abducted her in view of her stepfather,"" the El Dorado County Sheriff's office said Thursday.

""One of the things that we preach to searching families all the time ... is that even in these long-term cases there's hope,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- There's no bathroom on the right, and Jimi Hendrix never asked to be excused so he could kiss a dude. And, no, no matter how blinded by the light you may have been, you weren't wrapped up like ... a feminine hygiene product. But all those are among the world's most frequently misquoted song lyrics -- at least according to Spotify. The popular music-streaming service conducted an unscientific poll to find the most commonly botched lines from popular songs. (Of course, nobody had to fess up to getting the words wrong themselves. The poll, of 1,042 people, asked for the songs they most commonly hear other people singing incorrectly.) The winner? By a long shot, Manfred Mann's Earth Band confused the most folks with ""Blinded By the Light,"" the 1976 hit written and first recorded by Bruce Springsteen.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has said he doesn't believe North Korea can fit a nuclear warhead on a missile, casting strong doubt on an alarming assessment disclosed last week by the Pentagon's intelligence arm. And he warned the young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that weeks of threats against the United States and South Korea had only served to isolate the regime further. CNN's full coverage on North Korea . Asked in an NBC News interview whether North Korea could put a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile, Obama said, ""Based on our current intelligence assessments, we do not think that they have that capacity."" According to a snippet of a document read out by a congressman at a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency believes ""with moderate confidence"" that the North has developed nuclear weapons it could deliver on a ballistic missile, although with low reliability. U.S. defense and intelligence officials sought to qualify the DIA's words soon after they were made public, saying North Korea hadn't ""fully"" demonstrated the capabilities mentioned. But Obama's comments in the NBC interview, which was recorded Monday and broadcast Tuesday, appear to be the strongest dismissal of the assessment yet. Obama cautioned, though, that amid North Korea's recent dramatic threats, the United States has to ""make sure that we are dealing with every contingency out there."" ""That's why I've repositioned missile defense systems to guard against any miscalculation on their part,"" he said, an apparent reference to the recent decision to move missile defenses to Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases that the North has cited as possible targets for attack. Recent threats . Pyongyang intensified its threatening language last month when the U.N. Security voted to approve tougher sanctions on the North Korean regime following its latest underground nuclear test. Joint military exercises under way in South Korea by U.S. and South Korean troops, which take place each year, have also fed the North's angry rhetoric. As well as its torrent of fiery words, which have included the threat of a nuclear attack on the United States and South Korea, the North has made a number of moves that have added to tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It has suspended activity at a manufacturing zone it jointly operates with the South, vowed to immediately restart a nuclear reactor it shuttered five years ago and moved mobile ballistic missiles to its east coast for what U.S. and South Korean officials say could be a possible test launch. Obama said that North Korea's recent behavior under Kim Jong Un was both familiar and counterproductive. ""This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in and his grandfather before that,"" he said, referring to the two previous North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung. ""Since I came into office, the one thing I was clear about was, we're not going to reward this kind of provocative behavior. You don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way."" 'I'm not a psychiatrist' Asked if he thought Kim Jong Un was unstable, Obama said, ""I'm not a psychiatrist, and, I don't know the leader of North Korea."" But he said that ""the actions they've taken, the rhetoric they've engaged in has been provocative."" He warned that the situation may not calm down in the short term. ""I think all of us would anticipate that North Korea will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks,"" Obama said. ""But our hope is that we can contain it and that we can move into a different phase, in which they try to work through diplomatically some of these issues, so that they can get back on a path where they're actually feeding their people."" The U.S.-South Korean military exercises are due to carry on until the end of April. On the diplomatic front, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited three of North Korea's neighbors in the past week -- South Korea, China and Japan -- and set out the conditions Pyongyang would have to meet in order to hold talks with the United States. ""The North has to move toward denuclearization, indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats, stop the testing and indicate it's actually prepared to negotiate,"" Kerry said in an interview with CNN on Monday. But North Korea has repeatedly insisted that its nuclear program is a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the United States and its allies. 'A crafty ploy' A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman on Tuesday dismissed the U.S. suggestion of talks as ""nothing but a crafty ploy"" to deflect blame for the rising tensions. The United States urging dialogue is like a robber ""calling for a negotiated solution while brandishing his gun,"" the spokesman said in a statement published by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. The statement appeared to leave open the possibility of some kind of talks. ""Genuine dialogue is possible only at the phase where the DPRK has acquired nuclear deterrent enough to defuse the U.S. threat of nuclear war unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail against the former,"" it said, using the shortened version of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst covering Northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group , said that the terms North Korea had set out were nonstarters. Pyongyang is saying it is willing to talk only if the rest of the world acquiesces to the status quo of a nuclear-armed North Korea, a situation unacceptable to the United States and the United Nations, he said. Meanwhile, the North Korean government continued Wednesday to prevent South Koreans from entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the shared manufacturing zone that sits on the North's side of the border but houses operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. The North has also pulled out its workers from the complex, who number more than 50,000. There had been hopes in South Korea that the North might return the situation to normal this week following the major public holiday Monday that marked the 101st anniversary of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea. But so far, Pyongyang hasn't budged. At the weekend, it dismissed Seoul's proposal of talks over the complex, saying that what happens next depended on the South Korean government's ""attitude.""

"WHITE PLAINS, New York (CNN) -- Olympic track star Marion Jones was sentenced in a federal court Friday to six months in prison, two years of probation and community service for lying to federal prosecutors investigating the use of performance-enhancing substances. Marion Jones was smiling when she arrived Friday at the courthouse, but her smile soon disappeared. She said through her attorney that she would like to start serving her sentence as soon as possible, and Judge Kenneth Karas set March 11 as the ""surrender date"" unless a designated jail is able to accept her sooner. Jones had pleaded guilty in October to charges of lying to a federal agent in 2003 about her use of steroids, and was sentenced on two counts -- getting six months in prison on the first count and two months on the second, to be served concurrently. Before the sentencing, Jones broke down as she asked Karas not to send her to prison. ""I plead with you to alleviate the situation by not separating me from my boys, even for a short period of time,"" she said. But Karas noted that ""athletes in society ... serve as role models to children around the world. When there is a widespread level of cheating, it sends all the wrong messages."" ""People live with their choices,"" he added, ""and the choice not to play by the rules has been compounded by the choice to break the law."" In a memorandum filed December 31 with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Jones' attorneys had argued that jail time was unnecessary because ""any deterrent message to the public has already been sent."" But in court Friday, Karas said, ""There are times when a sentence can have a deterrent factor."" In a presentencing hearing, Jones' lawyers -- citing her history of being a law-abiding citizen -- had argued that the track star, who was stripped of her Olympic medals after pleading guilty to charges of lying to a federal agent about her use of steroids and engaging in check fraud, should be given probation only. Jones entered her guilty pleas in October and admitted she lied to a federal agent in November 2003 about her use of steroids.  Watch Jones' earlier tearful apology » . ""The guilty plea in this matter and the circumstances surrounding it have been a very painful and life-changing experience for Marion Jones-Thompson,"" said the memorandum. ""She has been cast from American hero to national disgrace. This part of her story will forever be one of personal tragedy. To be clear, the public scorn, from a nation that once adored her, and her fall from grace have been severe punishments. She has suffered enormous personal shame, anguish and embarrassment. She has been stripped of her gold medals, her accomplishments, her wealth and her public standing.""  See photos from Jones' athletic career » . In addition, her attorneys noted that Jones has lost her livelihood, as ""professional track and field is the only career Marion has ever known."" There was no need, the attorneys claimed, to send her to prison, as she posed no threat to the public. Jones told the court in October that her then-coach, Trevor Graham, first gave her steroids in 1999, telling her it was flaxseed oil. She said she took the steroid known as ""the clear,"" or THG, from that time until 2001, including during her competition at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney. Her admission contradicted years of public --- and often angry -- denials from her regarding steroid use. In 2004, she filed a $25 million defamation lawsuit against Victor Conte, founder of BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative), marketer of THG, accusing him of trying to ""destroy her career and reputation"" when he said he supplied her with performance-enhancing drugs. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and Conte in 2005 pleaded guilty to conspiracy and money laundering. A statement released by the U.S. attorney's office also outlined Jones's complicity in a multimillion-dollar check-fraud scheme. The money-laundering plot involved Olympic gold medalists Timothy Montgomery and Steve Riddick and more than a dozen others who attempted to defraud numerous banks by altering and counterfeiting checks. Jones originally claimed to have no knowledge of the scheme. USA Track & Field President Bill Roe issued a statement calling Jones's saga ""a vivid morality play that graphically illustrates the wages of cheating in any facet of life, on or off the track."" ""No one wanted to see this happen, and we hope that Marion and her family can move on as well."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Many have claimed to know the identity of the notorious Zodiac Killer, who terrorized northern California with a trail of unresolved murders in the 1960s. But their stories have not panned out. Now, a Louisiana man believes he has the definitive answer to the chilling mystery: Who was the crazed, elusive killer who wrote letters bragging about his conquests? Gary Stewart says it was Earl Van Best, Jr., his biological father, who died in 1984. ""I believe for the first time in the history of this case that I have presented more evidence that has ever been presented on any one suspect,"" Stewart told CNN's Erin Burnett about his new book. The Zodiac Killer has been connected to five deaths between 1968-69. Though he was never caught, he gained notoriety by writing several letters to police and newspapers boasting of the slayings. He included swatches of bloody clothing as proof of his claims of killing as many as 37 people. Stewart's quest for dad . Stewart was born in New Orleans, abandoned as a newborn in a stairwell in Baton Rouge, and later adopted. About 10 years ago, when he was 39, his birth mother, Judy, contacted him for the first time. He then began his search for his biological father, whom both had not contacted since Stewart was abandoned. The vice president of a cleaning company in the capital of Louisiana recounted his decade-long search for his biological father, which ended with the discovery that Best was the serial killer. During the search, Stewart, who is married with a child, kept a journal that became the basis for the book, ""The Most Dangerous Animal of All."" A chilling wanted poster . At one point during his search, he was watching television when a 1969 ""Wanted"" poster from the San Francisco Police Department flashed on the screen. ""And my heart stops. And I think I let out an audible scream, noise,"" he said. His son rushed into the room, his eyes transfixed to the television. ""And he says hey, Dad, it's you. And I walked back to my office ... where I had the only photo I've ever had of my father, which I was told was an old DMV photo. But it turned out to be his 1962 mug shot for his rape of my mother. And I said, 'No, son, it's not me. It's my father.' "" Revealing initials . Stewart said he reached his conclusion after years of research, including forensic experts comparing notes from the killer with his dad's handwriting on his marriage certificate. He said he also discovered his father's initials in cryptograms or ciphers the killer sent to newspapers. ""The Zodiac Killer insisted to the police ... if you crack the cipher, you'll have my identity,"" Stewart said. They did, and they found the initials, but they still didn't know whom they belonged to, he said. The San Francisco Police Department said it will investigate the revelation -- the latest person claiming links to the killer. ""It's an open and active case, so we don't comment,"" police spokesman Albie Esparza said this week. ""But (it's) certainly something our homicide investigators will take a look at."" Many past claims . Stewart is the latest in a series of people to make the claim that they descended from the famed Zodiac Killer. There's the self-proclaimed ""Stepson of the Zodiac Killer,"" Dennis Kaufman, who has appeared on TV news and a crime show touting his deceased stepfather Jack Tarrance as the crazed killer. He said his stepfather's handwriting was similar to the killer's. There's Deborah Perez, who said she wrote some of the claims of responsibility for her father, Guy Ward Hendrickson, when she was 7 years old. Her half-sister called her claims lies. There's Steve Hodel, who says his father was a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle -- the paper to which the Zodiac Killer sent his mocking notes. His claim, too, was discounted. Whether Stewart's contention will hold true is yet to be seen. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Gary L.

"(CNN) -- A couple accused of kidnapping of two Amish girls in upstate New York last month was indicted on federal sex exploitation charges Thursday. Nicole Vaisey, 25, and boyfriend Stephen Howells II, 39, were named in a five-count indictment in Syracuse. The charges included conspiracy to sexually exploit the two Amish girls along with a third female minor, according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian. Howells also was charged with possession of child pornography. The pair had previously been charged with the kidnapping of the two Amish girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13. ""This indictment charges Howells and Vaisey with enticing and coercing children to engage in sexual conduct and making a video recording of it,"" Hartunian said in a statement. Vaisey and Howells both face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the sexual exploitation charges against children. Howells faces a maximum of 20 years on the child pornography charge. If convicted, both could be fined up to $250,000 on each count. The pair also faces criminal court charges of first-degree kidnapping after luring the young Amish girls into a car with a puppy, authorities in New York's St. Lawrence County said. Details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County in August. Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. Vaisey told investigators that she and Howells were on a ""shopping trip"" for ""slaves"" when they allegedly kidnapped the girls. ""They had been planning this for several weeks,"" Bigwarfe said. The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside a family farm. Howells and Vaisey pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Howells allegedly scouted out the stand the previous week. Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog, a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope, police said. When the older child grew suspicious, Bigwarfe said, Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car. ""When he started forcing them into the vehicle, they were both screaming and yelling,"" Bigwarfe said. The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours, during which they were handcuffed together, shackled to a bed and sexually abused, according to the sheriff's department. With widening media coverage, a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert, the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls, he said. Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held, Bigwarfe said. Attorneys for Vaisey and Howell did not immediately return calls seeking comment. After her August arrest, Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, told CNN that his client was allegedly in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping.","Two Amish girls were kidnapped -- and later found -- in upstate New York last month .

"(CNN) -- On Nikola Tesla's 158th birthday, it was the effort to build a museum in the influential scientist's honor that got the gift. Elon Musk, the magnate and inventor behind electric-car company Tesla Motors, has pledged $1 million to the Tesla Science Center in Shoreham, New York, on the site of Wardenclyffe, Tesla's only remaining laboratory. And it's all due, at least in large part, to an appeal from a webcomic creator. Matthew Inman, whose comic and website the Oatmeal draws millions of readers each month, wrote Thursday that he had spoken to Musk and confirmed the pledge. ""So, I had a call with Elon Musk earlier this week ..."" Inman wrote on his site. He said Musk, who named his car company as a tribute to the inventor, told him two things during the phone call: that he would install a Tesla charging station in the museum's parking lot and that he'll donate the million to the effort to fully restore and operate it. Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Science Center, announced the pledge at a birthday party at the center on Thursday. ""(Musk) has challenged us at the center to use our resources wisely, find additional resources, and reach our goal of creating this museum,"" she said. ""We are excited and extremely grateful for Mr. Musk's generous gift to Tesla Science Center, and also to Matthew Inman for arranging the opportunity."" The Tesla Science Center had confirmed the news on its Twitter feed earlier. ""Elon Musk: from the deepest wells of my geeky little heart: thank you,"" Inman wrote. ""This is amazing news. And it's Nikola Tesla's 158th birthday. Happy Nikola Tesla Day."" In one of his comics, Inman compared Tesla favorably to his better-known contemporary -- and rival -- Thomas Edison. Then, in 2012, he joined forces with an effort to buy Wardenclyffe and turn it into a Tesla museum. A fundraiser he started on Indiegogo, cheekily named ""Let's Build a G**damn Tesla Museum,"" raised a whopping $1.3 million, more than enough to buy the property. Since then, the foundation has been raising the roughly $8 million needed to restore the site and build the museum itself. That's why this year, in a comic reviewing his new Tesla Model S, Inman devoted part of it to calling on Musk to help out. Though Tesla Motors is named in honor of the scientist, whose work included early electrical experiments, the Tesla family is in no way involved with the company. Within hours of the comic being posted, Musk, who had donated $2,500 to the initial effort, sent Inman a simple message on Twitter: ""I would be happy to help."" A representative for Tesla Motors also confirmed the gift to CNN on Thursday. Born in 1856, Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American engineer and inventor who helped pioneer the use of electricity, among other achievements. At Wardenclyffe, Tesla worked on developing wireless communications, more than 100 years before anyone would hold a smartphone, and methods for delivering clean, free energy. But his work lost much of its financial backing after inventor Guglielmo Marconi sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean, and the lab site was lost in 1915. Tesla died at age 86 in 1943, in debt and living in a New York hotel. His legacy and work languished in relative obscurity for decades thereafter. But in recent years, people in the science community have begun championing him as the true innovator of his age, saying that if his work had been properly funded, it may have led to dramatic changes in the way utilities like phone and electric service are delivered today.","The founder of Tesla Motors is giving $1 million to a museum for its namesake .

"(CNN) -- North Korea is holding an American man who it claims arrived in the country this month to seek asylum, the nation's state news agency reported Friday. KCNA identified the man as Miller Matthew Todd, who it says was taken into custody on April 10. The man, according to KCNA, entered the country on a tourist visa. He tore his tourist visa and shouted that ""he would seek asylum"" and ""came to the DPRK (North Korea) after choosing it as a shelter,"" KCNA said. The report came on the day that U.S. President Barack Obama visited South Korea -- a trip that North Korea's foreign ministry condemned as being ""aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race."" The United States is aware of the report and has been in touch with Sweden -- which represents American interests in North Korea -- about it, State Department press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. Psaki said the United States has ""no greater priority"" than the welfare and safety of Americans, but had no further information to release about the situation. Photos: Americans detained abroad .

"(CNN) -- One of the jurors in the trial of Michael Dunn said that race played no part in the case. The Florida jury on Saturday convicted Dunn, 47, on three charges of attempted second-degree murder for shooting into an SUV holding four black teenagers, after arguing with Jordan Davis, 17, about the volume of their music. Dunn is white; Davis was black. The shots continued even as the SUV was fleeing, and Dunn was also convicted of one count of shooting into the vehicle. But a first-degree murder charge for Davis' death resulted in a hung jury. ""I never once thought about, oh, this was a black kid. This was a white guy,"" Juror No. 8 Creshuna Miles told CNN on Thursday. ""We didn't even think about the race aspect of it,"" she said. ""Race was never a factor ... when I was making my decision."" The case, for Miles, was just about justice. ""When I walked into it, I just wanted to bring justice to whoever it was,"" she said. Miles, 21, said she believes Dunn is guilty of murder, but not as charged. She thinks he was guilty of second-degree murder. ""I think he is a good guy. I don't think he hates everybody. I don't think he walks around wanting to shoot everybody. I think that he made bad decisions,"" she said. Like Juror No. 4, who spoke to ABC News' ""Nightline,"" Miles said that the jury was split over the issue of self-defense. In his testimony, Dunn insisted that Davis threatened him and that he saw a gun. Police never recovered a weapon. Both jurors felt Dunn crossed a line when he continued to fire at the SUV as it fled the scene, that any threat Dunn may have felt earlier had passed. ""I was honestly convinced that he was in self-defense until he chased the car down and started shooting more,"" Miles said. ""Even if initially you didn't have the opportunity to take yourself out of the situation to stop, running behind the car and shooting more, that's where you completely push your limits."" Miles is one of two black women who served on the jury. The others were four white women, four white men, an Asian woman and a Hispanic man. 'Could not agree' Miles said that Dunn's fiancee, witness Rhonda Rouer, made the biggest impact on her. Rouer testified that in the weeks after the shooting, Dunn had never mentioned to her that he had seen a weapon of any kind. ""She's the sweetest lady, you can tell. She was nervous. She was shaking. She was trembling, like she could hardly move, but she yet she still got up there and told the truth,"" Miles said. ""She knew she had to tell the truth, but she knew how much it would hurt her life. But yet, she still told the truth."" Miles said that she and the other jurors ""just could not agree"" on the murder charge. When asked what she would tell Davis' family members, the juror said that she would tell them that she tried. ""I really did try. I tried to fight for his son. We, everyone that felt he was guilty, we fought and we fought and we fought, and I saw the look on his dad's face when we came to nothing,"" she said. ""I know it hurts. It's like thinking you've got this wound healed and then somebody slices it open again because now they have to go through that whole process all over again."" Misgivings about Florida law . Miles spoke the same day Davis' parents told CNN's ""New Day"" that Florida's laws about self-defense need to be changed. ""We're going to go to Tallahassee, the state capital, and we're going to try to get the 'stand your ground' law rewritten,"" said Ron Davis. ""That's our mission -- to make sure that we bring to light and expose all the laws in our nation that are not effective in keeping our citizens safe,"" said the teen's mother, Lucia McBath. Florida law says the use of deadly force is justifiable if someone reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. Its law also says people have no ""duty"" to retreat from a would-be attacker, as do laws in 21 other states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Dunn's attorneys did not use the ""stand your ground"" defense, but prosecutor Angela Corey told CNN on Wednesday that the laws need to revert to what they were before ""stand your ground"" was enacted, in 2005. ""I believe prosecutors and the sheriffs association are in favor of the former laws that we had on use of deadly force, and we do believe that, before someone should engage in a physical altercation, or especially an altercation where deadly force is used, we do believe there should be a duty to retreat,"" she said. Ron Davis said the jurors who deliberated for four days whether his son's killer committed premeditated murder in the first degree faced another hurdle in not being able to use their ""common sense,"" as prosecutor John Guy had urged them to do in his closing-argument rebuttal. ""Common sense and the law is not the same thing, unfortunately,"" Davis said. ""To the layman, premeditation is if you go home to get a gun or you go in your car separately to get a gun or you plan something -- to us, that's premeditation. But to the law, it could be three seconds."" Despite his assertion that the current law was responsible for the hung jury, Davis said he supported Corey's decision to retry Dunn on the murder charge. ""The world needs to know that Jordan Davis did nothing wrong and that this man is guilty of killing our son, of murdering our son,"" he said. 'Rap crap' The incident occurred November 23, 2012, when Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville, parking next to a red Dodge Durango with four teenagers inside. The teens had gone there for gum and cigarettes; Dunn, had just left his son's wedding with his fiancee, who'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips. Dunn didn't like the loud music -- ""rap crap,"" he called it -- coming from the teens' SUV. So he asked them to turn it down. What followed next is a matter of debate. Dunn testified that Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. But prosecutors say Dunn lost control, firing 10 bullets, nine of which struck the SUV, over music he didn't like. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he testified. ""It just worked out that way."" Police found a basketball, basketball shoes, clothing, a camera tripod and cups inside the Durango, but no gun.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The suspected Los Angeles International Airport gunman walked up to a security checkpoint, shot a TSA officer ""at point-blank range,"" went up an escalator, then came back down to shoot his victim again, a federal prosecutor said Saturday. That TSA officer, Gerardo Hernandez, died of his wounds. The man who shot him, authorities say, is 23-year-old Paul Anthony Ciancia. A federal complaint was filed Saturday afternoon charging Ciancia with two felony offenses -- murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport, said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr.. If convicted, Ciancia would face life in prison without parole or the death penalty, according to the federal prosecutor. The U.S. attorney general would decide if a death sentence would be sought. According to Birotte, the suspect walked up to a TSA checkpoint in Terminal 3 around 9:20 a.m., pulled a ""Smith & Wesson .223-caliber M&P15 assault rifle out of his bag and filed multiple rounds"" at the uniformed officer. He walked away, went up an escalator, then came back down to fire more shots at Hernandez, Birotte said. The gunman then proceeded through the terminal -- hitting two other uniformed TSA officers and a civilian passenger with gunfire, said Birotte -- before he was shot and wounded himself by airport police. By then, people were sprinting for their lives -- down escalators, out emergency exit doors, cramming into bathrooms and first-class lounges, anything to get out of the line of fire. Two people suffered what FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich called ""evasion injuries,"" getting hurt as they were trying to avoid being shot. Ciancia is being treated in a hospital after being shot himself by airport police, Bowdich said late Saturday afternoon. ""He is unresponsive,"" the FBI official added, ""and we are unable to interview him, as of today."" 'Conscious decision to kill ... TSA employees' So how did he ended up handcuffed to a gurney, leaving behind five magazines of ammunition that Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said ""could have literally killed everyone in that terminal""? Source: Angry, rambling texts . Some clues have emerged -- including that authorities found he'd been carrying a rant that appeared to refer to the New World Order plus anti-government claims, a federal law enforcement official said Saturday. It's not clear what gave rise to the references, and federal investigators have found no known links to known groups or anything in the suspect's background to explain them. The New World Order is generally considered to be a conspiracy theory in which people suspect a group of elites is conspiring to form an authoritarian, one-world government. Bowdich, from the FBI, said the handwritten note indicated the suspect made ""a conscious decision to kill multiple TSA employees."" ""He addressed them (TSA officers) at one point in the letter,"" Bowdich said, ""and stated that he wanted to 'instill fear into their traitorous minds.'"" In his diatribe, the gunman claimed the TSA treats Americans like terrorists even though all people aren't equally dangerous, a U.S. law enforcement official said. And near the end of the note was a derogatory reference to Janet Napolitano, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security that includes TSA, according to the same official. Another clue to the state of mind of Ciancia -- who was dropped off at the airport by a roommate who, investigators believe, didn't know about any shooting plot, the law enforcement official said -- came from his family. He lives in Los Angeles, but his family back in New Jersey were concerned about him, said Allen Cummings, chief of police in Pennsville, New Jersey. Ciancia's family became concerned in recent days after he sent his brother and father ""angry, rambling"" texts venting about the government, living in Los Angeles and his unhappiness generally, an intelligence source said. Opinion: Arming TSA officers not the answer . But despite the unsettling text, Ciancia's family was still surprised by Friday's events. ""They're upset,"" Cummings told reporters. ""I mean this is a shock to them, it's a shock to our community."" Widow of victim: 'I am truly devastated' Ciancia is being treated for his injuries at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, according to an intelligence source. So, too, is one other person -- the hospital said Saturday one person is in critical condition and the other is in fair, without specifying their names, and noted another person was treated and released Friday. Two other patients were transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said David Klurad, a trauma surgeon there. Klurad described one as a ""middle-aged"" person with minor injuries from being shot in the shoulder. The other had no signs of life when he arrived at the hospital, the surgeon said Friday. It's presumed that fatality is Gerardo Hernandez, the lone person killed in the shooting according to authorities. He's the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was founded in 2001. The late officer was working as a travel document checker at the time, TSA workers' union and federal sources say. Gannon said airport police quickly applied first aid to Hernandez, put him in a wheelchair, then rolled him to an ambulance. ""They were absolutely committed to trying to save a life,"" the police chief said. ""Unfortunately, that didn't work out."" Gerardo Hernandez would have turned 40 next week. His widow described him as a ""wonderful husband, father, brother, son and friend."" ""I am truly devastated,"" his widow said. The chaos also affected more than 165,000 passengers on hundreds of flights, as the airport shut down for hours. By early Saturday afternoon, all of it -- including Terminal 3 -- was reopened. By then, security was out in force -- an ""enhanced deployment"" that included Los Angeles police department officers and air marshals in addition to airport police, according to Airport police Chief Patrick Gannon. Some were uniformed, others were undercover. ""For today and for the foreseeable future, we'll continue (to have) a very high profile at the curbs and anywhere in those ticketing areas and anywhere on our campuses,"" the chief said. TSA: Number of guns discovered in airports rising . Questions about recent repositioning of airport police . The shooting has stirred questions about a recent repositioning of airport police officers around what is known as LAX. Gannon explained Saturday that, in the past year, he decided to move officers from behind a TSA security checkpoint to in front of it, where they also took on ""greater responsibilities"" such as monitoring both the arrival and departure floors of the terminal. ""The threat ... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium, the threat exists from the curbline on,"" Gannon said. ""So ... we have our people stationed throughout the airport. ""That particular individual"" -- he added, referring to the nearest police officer to the site of Friday's initial shooting -- ""was just moved to the front part of the airport."" At the same time, Gannon acknowledged the trade-off of having the officers roam a larger area, rather than sit at a checkpoint. ""So are they going to be in the exact same (place), exactly where I'd hoped they would be? No,"" he said. ""It didn't happen in this particular case."" Was there anything more behind the shift? A law enforcement source told CNN on Saturday that airport police officers had complained to their union about being ""bored with the assignment"" of being stationed behind the TSA checkpoint. Concurrently, TSA management complained that airport police officers weren't paying attention -- sometimes perusing their phones, using iPads or reading books on the job -- according to the same source. Then came ""a fix"" agreed to by TSA and airport police management, to keep officers in the public areas but position them in front of the checkpoints, including the one where Friday's shooting began. Part of the deal was that officers would never be more than two minutes from the checkpoint screening area, if needed, according to the law enforcement source. While Gannon hasn't addressed the claims of ""bored"" and ""distracted"" officers, he said Saturday the FBI has indicated his officers ""were 60 seconds behind the suspect."" However it was decided where they'd be standing, he insisted the two were where they were supposed to be, and did what they were supposed to do. ""Our officers were deployed where they were supposed to be and performed heroically in this particular matter,"" Gannon said. TSA Administrator John Pistole called the shooting ""a significant event"" that will prompt a review of security protocol with partner agencies. Speaking Saturday from Los Angeles, Pistole said,""This gives us great concern, so we'll look at what our policies are."" CNN's Dan Simon in Los Angeles and CNN's Greg Botelho in Atlanta reported and wrote. CNN's Lateef Mungin, Michael Martinez, Evan Perez, Joe Sutton, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Ephemeral messaging apps such as Snapchat, Wickr and Frankly, all of which advertise that your photo, message or update will only be accessible for a short period, are on the rise. Snapchat and Frankly, for example, claim they permanently delete messages, photos and videos after 10 seconds. After that, there's no record. This notion is especially popular with young people, and these apps are an antidote to sites such as Facebook where everything you post lasts forever unless you take it down -- and taking it down is no guarantee that it isn't still available. These ephemeral apps are the first concerted push against the permanence of Internet conversation. We started losing ephemeral conversation when computers began to mediate our communications. Computers naturally produce conversation records, and that data was often saved and archived. The powerful and famous -- from Oliver North back in 1987 to Anthony Weiner in 2011 -- have been brought down by e-mails, texts, tweets and posts they thought private. Lots of us have been embroiled in more personal embarrassments resulting from things we've said either being saved for too long or shared too widely. People have reacted to this permanent nature of Internet communications in ad hoc ways. We've deleted our stuff where possible and asked others not to forward our writings without permission. ""Wall scrubbing"" is the term used to describe the deletion of Facebook posts. Sociologist Danah Boyd has written about teens who systematically delete every post they make on Facebook soon after they make it. Apps such as Wickr just automate the process. And it turns out there's a huge market in that. Social media users migrating to smaller circles . Ephemeral conversation is easy to promise but hard to get right. In 2013, researchers discovered that Snapchat doesn't delete images as advertised; it merely changes their names so they're not easy to see. Whether this is a problem for users depends on how technically savvy their adversaries are, but it illustrates the difficulty of making instant deletion actually work. The problem is that these new ""ephemeral"" conversations aren't really ephemeral the way a face-to-face unrecorded conversation would be. They're not ephemeral like a conversation during a walk in a deserted woods used to be before the invention of cell phones and GPS receivers. At best, the data is recorded, used, saved and then deliberately deleted. At worst, the ephemeral nature is faked. While the apps make the posts, texts or messages unavailable to users quickly, they probably don't erase them off their systems immediately. They certainly don't erase them from their backup tapes, if they end up there. The companies offering these apps might very well analyze their content and make that information available to advertisers. We don't know how much metadata is saved. In SnapChat, users can see the metadata even though they can't see the content and what it's used for. And if the government demanded copies of those conversations -- either through a secret NSA demand or a more normal legal process involving an employer or school -- the companies would have no choice but to hand them over. Even worse, if the FBI or NSA demanded that American companies secretly store those conversations and not tell their users, breaking their promise of deletion, the companies would have no choice but to comply. That last bit isn't just paranoia. We know the U.S. government has done this to companies large and small. Lavabit was a small secure e-mail service, with an encryption system designed so that even the company had no access to users' e-mail. Last year, the NSA presented it with a secret court order demanding that it turn over its master key, thereby compromising the security of every user. Lavabit shut down its service rather than comply, but that option isn't feasible for larger companies. In 2011, Microsoft made some still-unknown changes to Skype to make NSA eavesdropping easier, but the security promises they advertised didn't change. This is one of the reasons President Barack Obama's announcement that he will end one particular NSA collection program under one particular legal authority barely begins to solve the problem: the surveillance state is so robust that anything other than a major overhaul won't make a difference. Of course, the typical Snapchat user doesn't care whether the U.S. government is monitoring his conversations. He's more concerned about his high school friends and his parents. But if these platforms are insecure, it's not just the NSA that one should worry about. Dissidents in the Ukraine and elsewhere need security, and if they rely on ephemeral apps, they need to know that their own governments aren't saving copies of their chats. And even U.S. high school students need to know that their photos won't be surreptitiously saved and used against them years later. The need for ephemeral conversation isn't some weird privacy fetish or the exclusive purview of criminals with something to hide. It represents a basic need for human privacy, and something every one of us had as a matter of course before the invention of microphones and recording devices. We need ephemeral apps, but we need credible assurances from the companies that they are actually secure and credible assurances from the government that they won't be subverted. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","Bruce Schneier: Ephemeral messaging apps such as Snapchat are on the rise .
Schneier: These apps claim they permanently delete your post, but that's not quite true .
He says the app companies might analyze their content and give info to advertisers .

"(CNN) -- If the United States is serious about thoroughly defeating ISIS, it must -- somehow, some way -- go through Syria. But how? And in what way? Those are the big questions now, as President Barack Obama weighs what to do inside the war-ravaged nation where ISIS leaders are based and where the Islamist terror group rose to prominence. Obama ceded Thursday that ""we don't have a strategy yet"" for what to do about ISIS inside Syria, with a senior administration official adding that a decision is ""a week or so"" away. There are certainly options, but none is clear-cut. ""There is no such thing as a no-risk strategy,"" said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington. ""It's a matter of taking the right risk and balancing that risk to make the right choice."" Here's a look at some possibilities, including why and how they could and could not work: . 1) Ground forces . In other words, go all in. When terrorists attacked on September 11, 2001, the United States showed its willingness to use its full military might when it attacked Afghanistan -- a campaign that dragged on for years and killed more than 2,300 American troops. That steep cost, both human and financial, is the big reason this is very, very unlikely to happen again in Syria. No U.S. officials have suggested troops on the ground. The fact none were sent to fight in Iraq -- a country where the U.S. has deeper ties and a government it works with -- is further indication there will be no U.S. ground invasion of Syria anytime soon. There could be smaller-scale, targeted operations, though. After all, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN that, this summer, elite U.S. commandos from units like Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 went into Syria and tried to rescue American journalist James Foley and others held by Islamic militants. They didn't find hostages, but who's to say U.S. Special Operations Forces couldn't conduct more such missions to save others or for some other purpose? Then there's the possibility American troops could go into Syria to help with the targeting of U.S. airstrikes. Of course, all bets are off if ISIS pulls an al Qaeda and strikes inside the United States. That hasn't happened yet, though some experts believe that such an attack from ISIS -- which, upon beheading Foley, warned other U.S. citizens could be next -- might be a matter of time. 2) Airstrikes . Obama gave the go-ahead to pound ISIS forces in Iraq from the air. Why not do the same in Syria, a country the President himself ceded Thursday has become a ""safe haven"" for the terror group? Except it's not that simple. It starts with the fact that Syria is a mess. Three years of civil war have torn apart the country, spurring the emergence of rebel groups fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad and sometimes against each other. About the only thing al-Assad and rebel groups have in common is that ISIS is their enemy. Obama is pushing to get al-Assad too, but they're on the same side when it comes to ISIS. Yet U.S. officials insist this shared cause doesn't mean they'll coordinate any military action with al-Assad's government, even if Syrian officials are demanding it. It's one thing to anger Syria even more. It's another thing to anger its allies Iran and Russia. Russia, which is already at odds with the West over Ukraine, could block any U.N. Security Council effort to give a seal of approval to international strikes. All of this brings many questions: Does the United States really want to conduct a military campaign in a country without a government that is stable and that it trusts? Can it count on opposition factions it supports to provide any long-term stability? And does it know that airstrikes will wipe out ISIS in Syria rather than stalling the group? Absent a fortune-teller, it's hard to tell how any military action would turn out. Still, if Obama decides that's the way to go now, White House spokesman Josh Earnest stressed, more needs to be done politically, diplomatically and economically long-term to keep ISIS down. ""Any sort of strategy that's predicated only on the use of American military force will not be an enduring solution,"" he said. 3) Support factions in Syria to fight ISIS . The Obama administration frequently touts its support for ""moderate opposition"" battling both al-Assad's forces and ISIS. Yet, for all its talk, it hasn't directly armed such forces. The ideal is, if you arm groups like the Free Syrian Army, they can help take out ISIS. That may not be realistic, considering ISIS with the Syrian government may be the most powerful forces now in the nation. Then there's the real possibility that if moderate forces lose, American weaponry may end up in the hands of ISIS, as has happened in Iraq. Still, it helps to have someone local you trust to provide on-the-ground intelligence for airstrikes or compliment those strikes with a ground assault. Smith, the Democrats' ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, is among those who believes ""U.S. military might alone is not going to contain ISIS. We are going to need partners locally."" ""We have to strengthen them, not so much so they can win,"" Smith said of the Free Syria movement, ""but so that they can survive and maintain some territory to give us a partner to work with."" 4) Cut off ISIS's funding . If you can't pound ISIS into submission militarily, the reasoning goes, you can hit it where it hurts: the wallet. The thinking goes that, in order to wage war, you need weapons, vehicles, ammunition. In order to govern a country, you need access to food, water and electricity. And usually to address these needs, a group needs money. Implementing sanctions and freezing bank accounts are often the first, least controversial steps to go after a terrorist group. And they can have an impact, but they also have their limits. For one, one shouldn't think such efforts will be effective overnight. They take time to coordinate, and it takes time to drain militants' piggy banks. Plus, it's not like there's a readily available list of ISIS donors to go after. And the fact is, ISIS isn't like many other terror groups. Unlike others like al Qaeda, it's chief goal is as practical as it is ideological: to take over and govern territory. Already, ISIS has proven adept at seizing weaponry. It's also paid attention to things like food stocks, electricity, sewage, medical care and more, as a recent Foreign Policy article noted. ""They are in this for the long haul,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said. ""They are trying to structure themselves in a way that they can hold and expand their holdings."" Whether its government is effective or not, one thing ISIS has proven is its zealousness for the cause and willingness to sacrifice civilians who haven't believed in it from the beginning. 5) Build a true international coalition . One big thing the United States has going for it: Practically no one likes ISIS. Sure, there are groups and individuals backing the formation of an Islamic State -- which is what ISIS calls itself now that it controls a vast swath of Syria and Iraq -- governed by sharia law. Some from oil-rich Muslim states in the Middle East may bankroll the group; others fight, with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder this summer estimating that there are 7,000 such foreigners with militant groups in Syria. ""There are clearly two camps in the world today: those who believe that sovereignty and supremacy in the world belongs to God, they are the Islamic State, (and) those who believe sovereignty belongs to man,"" said British firebrand preacher Anjem Choudhary, who sides with the Islamic State. Yet ISIS has far, far more detractors than supporters. It has a bloody track record of beheadings, crucifixions, stonings, not to mention the widespread slaughtering of minorities, Christians and Muslims who don't prescribe to its strict interpretation of Islam. Such actions -- like Foley's execution -- spurred widespread condemnation. Some have incentive to go beyond condemnation and act, militarily, against ISIS. Start with nations that border Syria, like Jordan and Turkey. As its self-ordained caliphate shows, ISIS has shown that it doesn't abide by national borders. What's to stop it from advancing into another country, especially if it gets bigger, stronger and richer? That possibility might spur other countries, besides the United States, to step in sooner rather than later. Even if they don't neighbor Iraq or Syria, nations with significant populations of Sunnis -- which is the sect of most Muslims worldwide, including in Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt-- may have reason to worry. Like with al Qaeda previously, disaffected young Muslims anywhere-- even in the West -- could join ISIS, then perhaps deciding to act out in their homelands. ""It's certainly not in the interest of governments in that neighborhood to have (ISIS) wreaking havoc or perpetrating terrible acts of violence,"" said Earnest, the White House spokesman. These nations could band together. The United States could be part of this coalition, perhaps letting others take an equal or greater role in military operations. The idea of Washington leading ""from behind"" has precedent: look at Libya. This international coalition got what it wanted with the downfall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. But years later, Libya is not a model of anything good: beset by warring militias and without an effective central government. Rogers, the House Intelligence committee chairman, thinks the Obama administration has had ""no real strategy"" on ISIS so far -- especially a strategy that addresses the group's base in Syria -- even though the group's been growing stronger for years. ""We're so far along into this,"" the Republican said of ISIS's rise. ""It's not like this happened just last week.""","Obama: U.S. has no military strategy yet on what to do against ISIS in Syria .

"(CNN) -- Lou Reed, who took rock 'n' roll into dark corners as a songwriter, vocalist and guitarist for the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, died Sunday, his publicist said. He was 71. The publicist, Peter Noble, confirmed Reed's death but released no details. Reed had undergone a liver transplant in May, his wife, the musician/performance artist Laurie Anderson, disclosed over the summer. Reed was a rock pioneer who went from record label songwriter to a member of the short-lived but innovative and influential Velvet Underground. The band and Reed's solo work tackled taboo topics like drug addiction, paranoia and sexual deviancy in songs that were largely spare, muscular and often saturated in feedback. ""Lou Reed's influence is one that there are really only a tiny handful of other figures who you can compare to him,"" said Simon Vozick-Levinson, a senior editor at Rolling Stone. ""He spoke incredibly frankly about the realities of being an artist, being a person who lived life on one's own terms. He didn't prettify things. He didn't sugarcoat things. He showed life as it really is and that's something that made him a true original, and one of our great all-time artists,"" he said. Reed, violist/keyboard player John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played their first show as the Velvet Underground in 1965 and soon drew the attention of pop artist Andy Warhol, who became their manager. Rock mythology has it that even though the group sold few albums, everyone who bought one started a band. ""We had fans who made us realize it was worth it,"" Tucker told CNN. ""But when we were together, actively, we didn't have a big splash like the Doors or whatever."" Opinion: Rockers stand in Lou Reed's shadow . Nevertheless, Rolling Stone ranks the group's debut album, ""The Velvet Underground and Nico,"" as the 13th greatest of all time. Tunes like ""Sweet Jane,"" from the group's 1970 album ""Loaded,"" have become rock standards. Performers from David Bowie to R.E.M. and U2 have cited them as inspiration, and the Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. ""The world has lost a fine songwriter and poet. I've lost my 'school-yard buddy,' "" Cale wrote on Twitter. Tucker called Reed ""generous, encouraging and thoughtful."" Working with him ""sometimes could be trying"" to some people, but ""never to me."" ""I guess we learned from each other. We all learned from each other,"" she said. In 1970, Reed left the Velvets for a long solo career. He had his only Top 40 hit with ""Walk on the Wild Side,"" from the Bowie-produced 1972 album ""Transformer,"" and Rolling Stone put both that album and 1973's ""Berlin"" on its top 500 list. Reed ""was one of the first artists to experiment with guitar feedback on record and to show that sort of ugly noise can actually be quite beautiful and moving. He also, lyrically, wrote about all kinds of topics that were taboo before he started exploring them,"" said Vozick-Levinson. He also gave a voice to gay and transgender people in a way that had never been done before by a popular artist, which made his work incredibly important to many people, Vozick-Levinson said. In 1982, Reed told The New York Times that his goal wasn't just to make music, but create literature. ""People say rock 'n' roll is constricting, but you can do anything you want, any way you want,'' he said. ""And my goal has been to make an album that would speak to people the way Shakespeare speaks to me, the way Joyce speaks to me. Something with that kind of power; something with bite to it."" And Tucker said Reed ""influenced probably millions of people into maybe reading more, into playing music."" ""When I have been on tour, there have been kids from 15 years old to 60 years old commenting on how they were influenced by Lou and the Velvets,"" she said. The rock band the Pixies wrote on their Twitter page, ""R.I.P. LOU REED....A LEGEND."" Iggy Pop wrote simply: ""Devastating news."" Reed won a Grammy award in 1998 for best long-form music video, for a documentary on his career up to that point. Neil Portnow, president and CEO of The Recording Academy, called him ""an exceptionally gifted singer, songwriter, and musician who has had a profound impact on rock music and our culture,"" ""We have lost a true visionary and creative leader, and his groundbreaking work will forever hold its rightful place in music history,"" Portnow said.

"(CNN) -- In the Old Testament, camels made for a very useful literary device. Primarily, they represent great wealth; When Abraham journeys to Egypt, the Pharaoh offers him a huge bounty, including sheep, servants and -- the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me -- camels, in exchange for Abraham's wife, Sarah (though in fairness, the Pharaoh thought they were siblings). Camels are used later to demonstrate Abraham's own riches (acquired later in life), and ultimately, the good heart of his future daughter-in-law, Rebecca, who is chosen after she kindly offers the beasts of burden some water. Though these animals play a central role in Genesis, new evidence has called into question their existence in Israel during the lifespans of Abraham and his immediate descendents (believed to be between 2000-1500 BC), and with it, the authorship of the bible. Professors Erez Ben-Yosef and Lidar Sapir-Hen, archaeologists from Tel Aviv University in Israel, recently published a study after radiocarbon dating camel bones uncovered during excavations in the Aravah Valley -- an area on the border of Israel and the Arabian Peninsula, and one of the most logical spots where camels would have first been introduced into the country. Excavations uncovered the oldest camel bones yet found in Israel, and these dated no earlier than 940 BC -- at least 500 years later than when they are described in the bible. Read more: Inside the tomb of an ancient Egyptian brewer . ""This is a very good example that the stories were written at a much later time than they supposedly took place. The editor of these stories knew the camel was a draft animal used in his time for traveling across the desert, so of course Abraham, Jacob and David used camels. We call it an anachronism; he projected the reality that he knew at his own time,"" says Ben-Yosef. He is also quick to point out that though the stories may have been written later, his findings do not necessarily cast doubt on the tales themselves. ""It doesn't necessarily mean the stories are fiction or that there is no grain of truth in them. It doesn't mean Abraham wasn't a real figure; he can still be a real figure. It just means that the guy who put them into written form gave the background according to his realities. There were no archaeologists back then to tell the author that camels were not around."" Read more: The fight to save Bahrain's 4,000-year-old burial mounds . The findings are not exactly new -- archaeologists have been doubting the feasibility of Abraham riding a camel into Egypt since the 1950s -- but according to Ben-Yosef, the use of radiocarbon dating of the bones does narrow down the window of possibility considerably. Naturally, not all are in agreement with the study's conclusions. Alan Millard, a professor of Hebrew and ancient Semitic languages at the University of Liverpool says that while he doesn't doubt the radiocarbon dating, he doesn't believe it disproves that camels existed in the Patriarchal Age. ""The archaeologists were working in a valley south of the Red Sea, but the stories place Abraham in South Iraq in Ur and in Southern Turkey in the area of Harran before coming to Canaan. The fact that there were no camel bones from before 1000 BC in the south of the land doesn't mean there were no camels anywhere else,"" he says. Read more: Mysterious structure found at bottom of ancient lake . ""It's always dangerous to make a widespread statement on the basis of a small piece of evidence,"" he adds. Millard says that though rare, there is evidence that camels were used domestically during that period, including a Babylonian seal from between 1800 and 1700 BC carved in the style of Syria that depicts two deities sitting on a camel. Despite the biblical debate the study has kicked off, Ben-Yosef and Sapir-Hen say the primary focus of the research was not to question Genesis, but shed some light on the economic workings of the time. ""The introduction of domestic camels enabled long journeys in the Levant, and all the way to India. It represented profound socio-economic change,"" says Sapir Hen. ""Before then, they used donkeys, and they can't travel those long distances without water. It really opened up trade to the rest of the world.""","A new study dating the remains of camel bones has spurred a debate on the bible's authorship .

"(CNN) -- Double-punched by two Indian Ocean storms, the southern African nation of Mozambique on Tuesday struggled with the destruction of a portion of its main national highway, cut-off communications and a reported death toll of 18, according to the nation's National Institute for Natural Disasters. Tropical Cyclone Funso is lashing the central portion of the country, causing flooding along the Incomati River. Officials fear fuel and food shortages will start hit northern cities in Mozambique that usually get supplies via roadway from the capital, Maputo. Funso currently has winds of 213 kph (about 132 mph), which would make it equal to a Category 4 major hurricane if located in the Atlantic, said CNN Senior Meteorologist Brandon Miller. The center of circulation is in the Mozambique Channel, between central Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. It is forecast to strengthen as it meanders south through the Mozambique Channel over the next several days, Miller said. The storm is spreading rainfall over much of Mozambique and Madagascar, and this will continue for several days as the storm is moving very slowly, Miller said. Last week, southern Mozambique was hit by heavy rains from tropical depression Dando. Cecilio Grachane, the chief of the National Roads Administration, expects provisional repairs will be done on the nation's critical north-south highway by Wednesday. But because of poor communication, traffic continues to move toward the place where the waters of the Incomati are overwashing the highway. The U.S. Embassy in Mozambique said Tuesday it had received reports from two American citizens unable to travel because of a road closure. There have been no reports of Americans injured, it said. Prime Minister Aires Ali visited the area on Sunday, urging people to not move on the road before they get clear advice on road and weather conditions. On Monday, small boats were helping move people trapped by floodwater along the highway. The Movene River, a tributary of the Umbeluzi, has risen substantially, limiting access to the Umbeluzi water treatment station on which Maputo relies for its water supply. Water used by residents of the capital city now has a brown color.","Mozambique struggles after onslaught of two Indian Ocean storms .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The guards at the Baghdad detention facility called their prisoner ""Vic,"" and let him plant a little garden near his cell. The cell where Saddam Hussein spent his final days is furnished with the basics. The rest of the world knew him as Saddam Hussein, a man blamed for the death of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis during more than 20 years as the country's president. The nickname and the garden are among the details about the former Iraqi dictator that emerged during a tour of the Baghdad cell where Hussein slept, bathed, and kept a journal in the final days before he was executed in December 2006. U.S. Marine Maj. Gen. Doug Stone, who oversees detention operations for the U.S. military in Iraq, shared excerpts from the journal and showed CNN the cell -- the first time it's been recorded on video. Hussein was hanged on December 30, 2006, for his role in the killings of 148 people in a town north of Baghdad after a 1982 attempt to assassinate him.  Watch Stone tell how Hussein prepared for execution » . Stone described how Hussein began that day. ""So he got up. He was informed that, in fact, [this] would be the day that he would be going to the execution. He bathed himself here in a very modest manner,""  Stone said, pointing to the sink in the corner of the room. ""It was winter, so it was cold."" Hussein took extra time to put on the familiar dark suit he always wore to court, Stone recalled. ""As he went out, he said goodbye to the guards and then got into the vehicles and proceeded to the execution,"" the general said.  See timeline of events leading up to Hussein's execution » . Notes taken by the guards assigned to Hussein said he asked them to give his belongings to his lawyer and tell his daughter he was going to meet God with a clear conscience, as a soldier sacrificing himself for Iraq and his people. The cell is a small, windowless room painted a nondescript beige, with a gun-metal gray floor and concrete sleeping platform. It has a stainless-steel combination sink and toilet in the corner. Those guarding the former Iraqi leader developed a sort of rapport with him, giving Hussein the nickname Vic -- derived from the initials V-I-C posted near his name in the holding facility. ""Why did you all call him Vic?"" asked CNN's Kyra Phillips. ""Ah, a little-known secret,"" Stone said. ""When he came here there was a debate. Do you call him Mr. President? No, that doesn't sound very good. What do you call him?"" Hussein also had a prisoner number, but that wasn't going to work as a name either. ""One day he looked across at us and said why do you have initials by my name?"" Stone said. ""And we said, well, that stands for 'Very Important Criminal'"" ... and he said, 'OK, that's what I want to be called.'"" Guards allowed Hussein to exercise and keep a garden in a small outdoor courtyard. ""This was probably his favorite area,"" Stone said of the courtyard, where Hussein also smoked cigars and wrote in his journal, trying to shape his legacy even though he had lost control of the country. In his writings, Hussein said it was his responsibility to document history so that ""the people ... may know the facts as they are and not as those who want to counterfeit it."" ""So he is afraid that history will not be recorded as he wants it recorded?"" Phillips asked. ""As he wants it recorded, exactly!"" Stone said. The former Iraqi leader showed a philosophical side in his poetry. ""The nights are darker after the sunset, but the smoke and the burning overwhelms the city,"" Hussein wrote as bombings and fighting enveloped Baghdad and echoed into the prison. ""You will feel suffocated under its skies. The days are now nights. No stars. No moon, but lots of screams."" In another piece, Hussein called on citizens to change. ""Dear nation: Get rid of the hatred, take the clothes of hate and throw it into the ocean of hatred,"" he wrote. ""God will save you and you will start a clean life, with a clean heart."" Though authorities executed Hussein for his role in killing about 150 people, he was on trial at the time of his death for genocide. Those charges implicated him in the killings of up to 100,000 Kurds during the 1988 Anfal campaign against Kurdish rebels -- a campaign that included the use of poison gas against Kurdish towns in northern Iraq. Stone said Hussein's poetry may have been another attempt to ensure his legacy. ""There is a certain cunningness to him,"" Stone said. ""There's a desire to sort of piece things together so that this is what you'll remember.""","CNN shoots first video inside Saddam Hussein's cell, gets a look at his journal .

"Springfield, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A former police chief was found not guilty Friday of involuntary manslaughter in the 2008 death of an 8-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with a micro Uzi machine gun during a gun show. Former Pelham, Massachusetts, Police Chief Edward Fleury, 53, was also acquitted of three counts of furnishing a machine gun to a minor in connection with the show that he helped organize. It was held at the Westfield Sportsman's Club in Westfield, Massachusetts. During the gun show, 8-year-old Christopher Bizilj was firing the micro Uzi when he accidentally shot himself in the head. He died instantly. Upon hearing the verdict, Fleury broke into tears. He later hugged his wife and spoke to reporters outside the courtroom, offering his condolences to the Bizilj family. ""This was meant to be an educational event for people and unfortunately this terrible accident happened,"" Fleury said, his voice heavy with emotion. ""And I do want to express my heartfelt sympathy to the Bizilj family and their friends for this terrible accident."" Christopher's father, Charles Bizilj, was present at the time of the shooting and videotaped the entire incident. Parts of that tape were shown to the jury, which also heard emotional testimony from the father. The trial lasted 10 days. ""I ran over to him. His eyes were open and I saw no reason for him to be on the ground. And I tried to talk to him and he didn't respond. I put my hand behind his head to try to pick him up and there was a large portion of his cranium missing. And I put my hand against the back of his head,"" Charles Bizilj told members of the Hampden County jury. Fleury faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter and up to 10 years for each count of furnishing a machine gun to a minor. His lawyer, Rosemary Scapicchio, had argued that while Fleury helped organize the show, he wasn't directly responsible and hadn't actually given guns to the children there. Carl Giuffre and Domenico Spano have also been charged in connection with the incident. The two were in charge of the show's shooting range and are accused of having provided the Uzi that killed Christopher Bizilj. Prosecutor William Bennett said he will decide next week whether to proceed with the case against them, given Fleury's acquittal.","Edward Fleury is acquitted of involuntary manslaughter .

"London (CNN) -- It is 100 years since British explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott set off on his ill-fated journey to be the first man to reach the South Pole. Now, for the first time, writings, photographs and items from the arduous Terra Nova expedition, which lasted from 1910 to 1913, have been brought together for public display. ""It's a story of immense heroism,"" said curator Kay Smith at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, where the exhibition is taking place. Entitled ""These Rough Notes: Captain Scott's Last Expedition,"" the exhibition includes fragile journals and letters written by the men who set out to traverse the Antarctic wastes, and features the last journal Captain Scott ever wrote, as well as his final letter to his wife. It also includes pictures taken by photographer Herbert Ponting, showing scenes of ice caves, frolicking penguins and the men relaxing at their camp, Cape Evans, in preparation for the assault ahead. ""He was one of the finest photographers of the 20th century,"" said Smith of Ponting. ""Scott realized that expeditions like this, just like today, run at a loss, so he realized that once he got to the South Pole and back, he would have to give lecture tours, and would need photographic records,"" she continued. Also included in the exhibition are items from the company's midwinter's day festivities in June 1911, which they celebrated in lieu of Christmas with a big meal and a ""tree"" they decorated with little flags. On display are the paper hats they made for themselves as well as a menu one of the men fashioned in the shape of an Adelie penguin. But it is the journals, letters and notebooks that tell the story best. ""It's a once-in-a-hundred-year opportunity to read this material and actually see the handwriting,"" said archivist at the institute, Naomi Boneham. ""A lot of it has been quoted, but actually seeing the handwriting and seeing how shaky their hands were from when the weather was so extreme, is slightly different from seeing a typed page,"" she continued. A hand-produced newspaper by the so-called ""Northern Party,"" who were trapped for months in an ice-cave during a perilous geological expedition in 1911, are blackened with soot from the blubber-burning stove the men used in order to stay warm. The final, tortuous journey to the South Pole is also brought to life through the writings and photographs on display. ""When they set off on November 1st with the ponies, the dogs and the motor sledges, it's all very upbeat, they're not setting out to die, they're setting out to reach the South Pole, hopefully to be the first but if not the first, then one of the first people to be there,"" said Boneham. But the farewell letters from the last three men standing -- Scott, Dr. Edward Adrian Wilson and Henry Robertson (Birdie) Bowers-- are written in the knowledge that they were dying and are, said Boneham, ""very personal."" Heart-rending photographs of the team finding rival Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen's tent already at the South Pole complement the written details of their arduous journey there -- and cast a shadow on their harrowing and ill-fated journey back. It is through their writing that we now know the story of Captain Lawrence Oates, one of the five men to reach the Pole, who suffered horribly from injury and frostbite on the way back and walked out into a blizzard in order to save his companions. ""It's an incredibly poignant story to walk out into a blizzard to try to save your companions and then to have them die too,"" said Smith. ""For them to know they were dying and to sit there writing letters, it can't fail to make you emotionally involved,"" she continued. Scott, Wilson and Bowers died of starvation and exposure in their tent in late March 1912. Months later, a search party found them, along with their last letters and journals. Smith believes people remain fascinated by this tale of endurance because it involves extremes: Of temperature, of effort and of emotion. But, she said, ""The story is actually much better than fiction. It's a tremendously heroic story, and it's real."" Cape Evans still stands today, preserved almost exactly as Scott and his men left it a century ago. You can visit it, but, Smith said, much like then, ""It does rather depends on your wallet.""","Landmark exhibition celebrates centenary of Captain Scott's expedition to the South Pole .

"(CNN) -- Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom has announced he is launching a new political party in his adopted home of New Zealand. ""My new political party won't be named Mega Party. We are the Internet Party,"" he tweeted Wednesday. The aim of the Internet Party is to make politics exciting again, he said through Twitter. The larger-than-life entrepreneur is a German native and can't personally run for office as he is not a citizen of New Zealand. However he alluded to his desire to focus his party's policies around internet privacy and government surveillance. Dotcom founded file-sharing website Megaupload in 2005, which allowed users to upload music, videos and files. It was accused of being an online haven for digital pirates. The U.S. government shut down the site in 2012 in a piracy crackdown. Dotcom had assets frozen and was arrested in the crackdown that included a police raid on his luxurious house near the capital, Auckland and was remanded to Mt. Eden prison. A judge overturned the verdict just over a month later. Since then, he has faced numerous legal battles. In New Zealand, Dotcom has worked on various projects -- with politics being the latest. Antihero appeal? Bryce Edwards, a political commentator and lecturer at the University of Otago in New Zealand, believes that Dotcom has become an unlikely beloved figure in the country. ""We haven't seen a maverick like Kim Dotcom throw his weight into politics, this is someone wanted for crimes allegedly committed and has an extreme personality, and strangely New Zealanders have really warmed to it,"" Edwards said. New Zealand's general elections are expected to take place before the end of this year. According to numerous political analysts, there is no clear front-runner, making it difficult to predict the outcome. ""In the past, Dotcom has infamously donated money to a politician called John Banks who is quite far on the right of the political spectrum, so there are assumptions that Dotcom is politically at the right but it's pretty uncertain,"" said Edwards. He also cautioned that Dotcom's Internet Party must win at least 5%in order to make any impact on the political scene. Gaining anything less would make people ""feel like they are wasting their vote."" In order for a party to be sworn into parliament in a country with over 3 million eligible voters, it must obtain this crucial 5% threshold or win a constituency. In a further comment on Twitter, Dotcom appeared confident that the Internet Party would make it mark at the election. ""Get ready for low blows and smear against me and my political party. My attackers are worried. They should be. We will get more than 5%,"" he stated on the microblogging site. Other than technological advocacy, it's unclear what the party's exact policies are. Edwards believes the Internet Party is set to focus on some key voting groups including the youth, tech-savvy people and those that have become disillusioned with the current system such as those from a lower socio-economic background and ethnic minorities. A man of many talents . It's not only politics that Dotcom has dabbled in lately. He was planning to launch his debut album titled ""Good Times"" at a huge birthday bash for himself on January 20. However, he had to cancel the event because of a potential breach of electoral laws as it was being held for free. Over 20,000 people had registered on Twitter to attend. Dotcom says he increasingly turned to music to escape his legal woes of the past few years. ""When you have a family with five kids, and you're facing an indictment with potentially 80 years in prison, you're not in a good state of mind. But that's why the music really helped me. When I was in the studio, everything else just turned off,"" he said in an interview with The Guardian this week. Megaupload has since been succeeded by an almost identical venture under a new, shortened name -- Mega. Dotcom has said that he will release more details of his new political party on January 20.","Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom launches a political party in New Zealand .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States on Monday condemned the violence in Libya and called for a halt to the ""unacceptable bloodshed"" in response to civil unrest, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. ""The government of Libya has a responsibility to respect the universal rights of the people, including the right to free expression and assembly,"" Clinton's statement said. ""Now is the time to stop this unacceptable bloodshed. We are working urgently with friends and partners around the world to convey this message to the Libyan government."" It was the highest-level statement so far by the U.S. government on the accelerating strife in Libya, where reports Monday indicated a deteriorating situation with some military forces and pro-government allies attacking anti-government demonstrators. Two Republican senators called Monday for President Barack Obama to publicly denounce what they called ""egregious violations of human rights"" by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. ""We urge the president to speak out clearly in support of the Libyan people,"" said a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, and Mark Kirk, R-Illinois. U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya's rapidly unfolding political crisis, in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform, a senior Obama administration official said. Among other things, Washington was taking a close look at a speech early Monday by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- the Libyan leader's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the North African country don't stop. In the speech, Saif Gadhafi also acknowledged political change occurring throughout North Africa and the Middle East, and proposed ""radical"" reforms -- such as bolstering local governments, relaxing restrictive laws, raising salaries, extending loans and drafting a constitution, which doesn't exist now. Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters, the Obama administration official added. The State Department, meanwhile, ordered all U.S. Embassy family members and non-emergency personnel to depart Libya. U.S. citizens were urged to defer all travel to the country. Despite the warning from Gadhafi's son, Libya's protesters showed no sign of backing down. After Gadhafi's government apparently lost control of the city of Benghazi, angry protesters said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the capital, Tripoli. Tripoli residents said state-run al-Shababiya TV was attacked Sunday evening by anti-government protesters. CNN, however, could not immediately confirm reports. The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country. CNN has interviewed witnesses by phone. The unrest, spurred largely by high unemployment and demands for freedom, has left at least 233 people dead in Libya, according to Human Rights Watch, citing hospital sources. The growing U.S. pressure on Gadhafi -- a famously mercurial leader -- is only the latest in a series of twists and turns in the relationship between Washington and Tripoli over his 42 years of rule. In 1986, Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that resulted in the death an American service member. President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions. Reagan dubbed Gadhafi the ""mad dog of the Middle East."" Two years later, Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. In 1999, Gadhafi tried to thaw his icy relationship with the West, agreeing to demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. In 2003, he agreed to eliminate his pursuit and stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. The moves helped Libya regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006. In 2008, however, Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi's sons, prompting the furious leader to cut off the country's oil supplies, withdraw Libyan money from Swiss banks and threaten to sever diplomatic ties. Two years ago, Gadhafi returned to the international spotlight yet again when Scotland agreed to release convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, who received a hero's welcome in Libya. Scottish authorities said al-Megrahi was terminally ill with cancer and, as a result, was released on compassionate grounds. Skeptics, including several U.S. senators, contend that al-Megrahi was released as part of a deal fueled by British business interests in Libya, including oil giant BP. Libya is one of Europe's key oil suppliers. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Jill Dougherty and Mike Pearson contributed to this report.","NEW: Clinton calls bloodshed in Libya unacceptable .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- A U.S. Marine pleaded guilty Friday to abusive sexual contact with a child under 16, bringing to a close a criminal case that stoked outrage in Japan, a Marine spokesman said. Staff. Sgt. Tyrone L. Hadnott was sentenced to four years of confinement, said First Lt. Judd Wilson, a Marine spokesman in Okinawa, Japan. The Marine Corps withdrew several other charges, including rape of a child, kidnapping and making a false official statement, Wilson said. Japanese police arrested Hadnott in February on charges alleging that he raped a 14-year-old junior-high school student. He saw her while riding his motorcycle, offered to give her a ride and later assaulted her at a park, the police said then. The case stirred outrage at the highest levels of the Japanese government. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda deplored the incident as ""unforgivable."" The Japanese Foreign Ministry lodged an official protest with the U.S. government. And Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima said the offense ""violates the rights of women"" and that ""this is a crime that we should not accept."" The Japanese authorities released Hadnott after the girl withdrew her allegations, but the Marine Corps conducted its own investigation. The Marines charged Hadnott with rape of a child, abusive sexual contact, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa. The U.S. military presence has at times bred resentment among locals, who have long complained about crime, noise and accidents. Anti-American sentiments boiled over in 1995, after three American servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl. Two years ago, a U.S. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women. The Marine Corps said in a statement on Friday that it does not tolerate sexual assault.

"(CNN) -- Shortly after McDonald's celebrated its 30-year presence in France, the fast-food chain is conquering one of the country's most valued cultural institutions --the Louvre. McDonalds' burgers and fries will be available under the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. The restaurant will be serving its fast burgers in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall which lies under the main entrance of the museum and which still contains an ancient wall that was discovered during construction works.  McDonald's' plans seem to have caused more media attention abroad than in France, but for some French outlets, the idea of combining fast food and ancient art is stomach churning. The Parisian Web site ""Louvre pour tous"" (Louvre for everyone) describes McDonald's' decision to open a restaurant in the prestigious museum as ""bad taste"" and blamed the Louvre's directors for failing to prevent what could result in ""fragrances of fries drifting under Mona Lisa's nose"". A spokeswoman for the museum told CNN it was not their decision and declined to comment further on the issue. The Carrousel du Louvre mall is managed by Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest property company, and not the museum itself. The mall, which is situated next to the most visited museum in the world, counts 8.3 million visitors a year and enjoyed a total gross sales of $75 million in 2008. Le Parisien, a daily newspaper described the difference between McDonald's and the Louvre by comparing Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's clown character, to Venus de Milo, the famous ancient Greek statue of Aphrodite, which is on display at the Louvre. Should McDonald's be in the Louvre? Tell us what you think in the Soundoff box below.  Museum lovers in France are shocked about the news, but not surprised. ""Museums have to offer services like restaurants and boutiques, it's completely normal,"" Jean-Michel Raingeard, President of the Federation of French Friends of Museums told CNN. What worries him, however, is the choice of shops. ""Museum directors seem to care more about the number of people they attract rather than the quality of people. Should a museum be a museum or an amusement park?"" asks Jean Michel Raingeard, who is also the European vice president for The World Federation of Friends of Museums. McDonald's sees the opening of its new restaurant next to the home of Mona Lisa as something completely normal. ""There are already many other restaurants in the mall, so we will only be one of the many restaurants that offer visitors their products."" says a spokeswoman for McDonald's in France. ""There's even a Starbucks,"" she added. Criticism, though fierce, has not been successful: the construction work will start soon and the restaurant should be open ""by the end of the year."" In spite of its location, the menu will very likely stay the same. ""McDonald's functions the same way in all of France, so there will probably be no special menus,"" the spokeswoman said.","McDonald's to open restaurant in the mall of the world's most visited museum .

"(CNN) -- Libyans opposed to longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi vowed to hit the streets again Sunday, saying a violent crackdown by security forces since demonstrations began last week has energized their ranks. Benghazi, the North African nation's second-largest city and hub of its eastern province, was home to some of the bloodiest clashes Saturday. Still, an anti-government demonstrator there said that despite having been barraged for days by tear gas and bullets, many of his colleagues slept overnight outside the city's courthouse and planned another rally at 1 p.m. Sunday. ""There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom,"" the man, who was not identified for safety reasons, told CNN early Sunday. ""Our goal is simple: We want Gadhafi to leave. We want freedom. ... We want democracy."" The man, a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi, estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown 20% since the protests began Tuesday. Another protester in Misratah, a city about 250 km (155 miles) east of Tripoli, said that roughly 1,300 remained on the streets there through the night and into the morning Sunday, burning pictures of Gadhafi and calling for an end to his rule. CNN could not independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya, the most isolated nation in the region, though it has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone. The government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications. Instead, a report from Libya's state-run JANA news agency blames ""acts of sabotage and burning"" on outsiders aiming to undermine the nation's stability, security and unity. The report claims that the unrest has been fomented in Libya as well as Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon and Iran by an Israeli-led network of covert operatives. Since Wednesday, authorities have arrested ""dozens of foreign members of this network who were trained on starting clashes,"" the JANA story said, adding that the outsiders were of Tunisian, Egyptian, Sudanese, Turkish, Palestinian and Syrian descent. Meanwhile, the toll from the unrest continued to mount Saturday. While Human Rights Watch, citing interviews with hospital staff and witnesses, reported 84 deaths since Tuesday, the total number is unknown and couldn't be independently confirmed by CNN. Medical sources at Misratah Medical Complex said that at least three died and 70 were wounded in clashes Saturday between security forces and anti-government protesters. Three of those injured are in critical condition, the sources said. A doctor treating the injured in Benghazi's Al Jala hospital said that at least 30 people died Saturday, most from gunshot wounds to the head. Hovering helicopters fired into the crowds and the hospital was receiving a steady stream of injured people, said the doctor, who CNN is also not identifying for security reasons. His count did not include casualties from a clash between the protesters on the funeral march and soldiers at a military camp. Soldiers there fired tear gas and guns; the protesters hurled rocks and at least two hand grenades, witnesses said. ""The situation is critical right now,"" said the doctor. ""The city is effectively under siege."" Lt. Col. Mohammed al-Majbari, who helped lead Libyan military forces in Benghazi before deciding early this week to join the opposition, claimed that government forces, aided by mercenaries from other African countries, ""caused a massacre."" ""It is time for freedom,"" al-Majbari said. ""(Gadhafi) is not a human being. A Libyan would never do this to his people. He is a dictator."" Several eyewitnesses told CNN that cars of riflemen drove past protesters, indiscriminately firing at them. A Libyan woman supportive of the protesters, who was not identified to protect her safety, told CNN that army soldiers on Saturday initially claimed solidarity with the demonstrators, only to reverse their tack and open fire on the crowd. ""The soldiers ... said, 'We are with you.' We believed them,"" she said. ""After that, they started shooting the people. Why? Why did they lie?"" Other eyewitnesses told CNN that anti-government demonstrators used a bulldozer Saturday to tear down part of a wall at Alfadeel Abu-Omar military camp, and were fired upon as they retreated. Many were hit by mortar and automatic weapon fire, the witnesses said. ""We are peaceful people,"" the technology expert said early Sunday from Benghazi. ""They are killing unarmed civilians."" Others in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida, Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east were spreading west. Anti-government protesters leaving noon prayers Saturday at Misratah's Al-Sheikh mosque were confronted by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators, two witnesses told CNN. Security forces stepped in, firing tear gas to disperse the crowds. After the anti-government group moved to another square, security forces fired into the crowd, one protester said. A protester, identified only as Moftah, told CNN that Libyans, inspired by the toppling of dictators in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia, had simply had enough of Gadhafi. ""He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere,"" Moftah said. ""It's time to break this fear barrier. We reach a point that we don't care anymore."" A Libyan source in exile, who has knowledge of events inside the country, said Saturday that the government was bringing in special military units. He said anti-Gadhafi factions now ""control"" increasing parts of eastern Libya, aided by ""police and security forces there (who) also belong to tribes."" To counter that, the government is using ""military squads of African origin,"" the source said, voicing the same claim made by Majbari. ""They are not restricted or bound by tribal ties,"" and can therefore be better counted on to suppress the opposition. ""Violence in the east will escalate because of the tribal mentality of revenge,"" the source said, claiming reports of violence there had already fueled sporadic demonstrations in western Libya. Gadhafi's regime, however, has sought to portray a different picture of events. Having previously aired extensive footage of pro-Gadhafi rallies in Tripoli, a Libyan state television program on Saturday described the anti-government protests as acts of sabotage. The report claimed that hospitals, banks, courthouses, prisons, security centers and military police headquarters had been burned, showing videos of buildings on fire and the aftermath of destroyed and scorched locales. The anchor said that security forces had managed to arrest dozens of people, claiming they were part of a foreign network of agitators trained to spark clashes and create chaos. The official Jamahiriya News Agency also reported that Gadhafi had spoken in recent days with fellow leaders from Guinea, Liberia and Yemen. The government also sent out, via text, a tacit warning against ""the inappropriate use of telecommunications services (that) contradict our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions."" Internet service in Libya shut down Friday evening, though it was more available by Sunday. The government's firm grip on power heightened the concerns of a woman from Benghazi, who urged U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders to help the Libyan people in the face of the government crackdown. ""We have no freedom here,"" she said. ""I speak to all the world, to America, to Mr. Obama: Please help us. We (did) nothing. We want to live a good life."" CNN's Moni Basu, Amir Ahmed, Yousuf Basil, Greg Botelho, Salma Abdelaziz, Zain Verjee and Anderson Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: A protester in Benghazi says ranks have swelled; a major rally is set for Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's midterm elections marked a new milestone for women in American politics. For the first time in the nation's history, the number of women in Congress will reach 100. Is that cause for celebration? No, not at all. Think about that number for a moment. Having 100 women out of 535 legislators (435 representatives, 100 senators) means that more than 80% of the country's federal legislators are still men. And we've seen how well that is working out. Sure, women made some gains -- bravo. But the total female representation will rise by about 1%. Again, let's put away the champagne. Obviously, the best candidate -- man or woman -- should be the one we choose in each circumstance. But the comparatively low number of women with political power in Washington should concern us all. The embarrassingly small percentage is far lower than in most advanced democracies. No one doubts that Americans have to fix the dysfunctional U.S. political system. There is reason to believe that electing more women to Capitol Hill could help repair the problems that have made Americans of both parties lose faith in Congress. Women usually enter politics because they want to solve a problem, because they see a policy issue they want to address, according to Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. In general, women run for office to accomplish something. Men usually run because they want to pursue a political career. Today, Congress is not a place to find solutions, so many women who want to make a difference look elsewhere. That's one of the reasons that we don't have more women leaders. There are also the challenges of raising vast sums of money, which are more easily surmounted by well-connected men. Women tend to enter politics later, which leaves less time to build power and recruit other women into the field. And there's the fact that incumbents almost always win. Anything that preserves the status quo tends to preserve the gender imbalance. Don't blame voters for the low number of women in Congress. When women do run, they win in similar numbers as men, says Walsh. Once in office, women tend to function more as consensus builders than men do. Of course, there are exceptions. But women on both sides of the aisle seem better at listening to those with whom they disagree. Women senators, Democrats and Republicans, have been having regular dinner together for years, exchanging views, building bridges. There is growing evidence that women are more effective at building bipartisan support for legislation. It was Susan Collins who led a group of women senators to find a way out of that awful congressional spectacle in 2003 -- the 2003 government shutdown. On Tuesday night, there were many firsts for women, and each one is a great story. The Senate will have its first female combat veteran when Joni Ernst is sworn in, joining a small group of women veterans now serving in the House. Incredibly, Ernst is the first woman from Iowa elected to either chamber. Let me repeat -- in all the history of the Republic, Iowa -- that epicenter of presidential primary politics -- never, not once, elected a woman to Congress. If Ernst smashed the stereotype of the combat veteran and broke a dismal statistical record, how about Mia Love, the first black woman ever elected to Congress as a member of the Republican Party? The charismatic 38-year-old Love has an inspiring American story. She is the child of Haitian immigrants, who converted to Mormonism and ran for office -- in Utah -- as a champion of conservative self-reliance. The story of women in American politics is one of persistent and very-slowly-eroding inequality. To break that pattern, more women need to run on both parties. Each victory is a sign to other women that politics is a field where they can succeed. And, as it happens, success for women would give the entire country, Democrats and Republics, a real reason to celebrate.","Tuesday night marked the first time in America in which Congress has 100 women .

"(CNN) -- Last month Facebook announced it had signed up its 500 millionth member. Many news outlets began stories on this milestone by declaring that if Facebook were a nation, it would be the third-most populous on the planet. Immigrants to this nation include tens of millions from Mexico, Turkey, France, Italy, India and the Philippines. The 125 million Americans who've joined the service represent only a quarter of the citizens. And with support for 100 languages, Facebook would be one of the world's most polyglot lands, far surpassing India's 22 official languages. Facebook, of course, is not a nation. It's a service that allows users to share photos, updates, news and play games with other users of the service. And while 500 million people from all over the globe use the service, for most of us, Facebook feels less like an transnational melting pot and more like the neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name. While more than 5 percent of Facebook users are Indonesian, it's unlikely that you're friends with any of them, unless you have Indonesian friends in the offline world. That's because Facebook is designed to connect you with people you already know, not introduce you to new people. When you sign up for Facebook, the service first searches for any mentions of your name and suggests you befriend anyone who has mentioned you in their posts. It then asks to access your e-mail account so you can connect with anyone with whom you regularly correspond. Finally, it encourages you to add information about your high school, college and employer to your profile. It uses this information to find friends within your classmates and co-workers. You have ample opportunity to connect with people you already know before you have a chance to discover anyone new. Read more about Ethan Zuckerman on TED.com . Once you've found your friends on Facebook, they share their news, gossip and discoveries with you. This can be a source of serendipitous discovery, as friends find stories and inspirations you would have missed. Or it can serve as an echo chamber, slowly persuading you that everyone views the world the way you do, because the people you know on Facebook share your prejudices and views. I study the ways new media shapes people's perceptions of the world. It's my fond hope that social networks such as Facebook will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life. But I fear services such as Facebook may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans. We hear that 500 million people from around the world are using Facebook and forget that we hear mostly from our 130 (on average) friends, many of whom we've known since we went to high school together. On the internet, information from Indiana and India is equally cheap and easy to access. But of the 100 most popular news and information sites in the United States, only 10 are hosted outside the country. And 94 percent of those page views are to U.S. sites. This pattern holds true in all 10 countries with the largest numbers of internet users. Despite ample opportunity to use the internet to seek information from beyond our national borders, most of our internet usage is local. Like the Internet itself, Facebook is one of the most powerful technologies ever built to increase connection between people separated by borders of nation, language, religion and culture. Armenian journalist Onnik Krikorian reports that Facebook has created a space where young Armenians and Azeri -- separated in physical space by a decades-old border dispute -- can explore friendships that would never otherwise develop. But Facebook can also spawn spaces that make cross-cultural dialog more difficult. The ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day"" Facebook campaign began as a humorous protest in support of freedom of expression, inspired by a cartoon drawn by Molly Norris. As the group attracted 100,000 members on Facebook, the drawings of the Muslim prophet submitted to the group became increasingly offensive and violent. Norris and others initially involved with the protest distanced themselves as the group became a campaign against Islam rather than a campaign for free speech. Before Facebook removed the campaign from its site, a Pakistani court ordered a nationwide ban on the social networking service in reaction to the offensive content. Is Facebook a space for cross-cultural interaction? For fomenting reactionary hatred? Or is it primarily a space for online interaction with our local, offline friends? ""Peace on Facebook"" is a page where Facebook tries to quantify connections made on the service across lines of religion and nationality. Some of the news is encouraging: 29,651 connections between Indian and Pakistani users made in the past 24 hours. Some is dispiriting -- only 974 Muslim/Jewish connections in the previous day. With half a billion users and an estimated 65 billion friendships, such numbers are small. To me, they suggest we have work to do if we want a network such as Facebook to do its part in making the world a wider and better-connected place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ethan Zuckerman.","Facebook has half a billion users, notes Ethan Zuckerman .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A volcanic eruption in Indonesia that has displaced more than 22,000 people is intensifying, local authorities say. Mount Sinabung, which began spewing gas in September after a three-year slumber, has erupted over 220 times this week. The hot ashes and smoke have caused pyroclastic flows -- a fast-moving mass of gas and rocks -- to stretch to seven kilometers down the southeast slope of the 2,600 meter (8,530 foot) mountain in North Sumatra. Last week, flows reached three kilometers. The local government is still able to cope with the disaster, and no casualties have been reported according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's national agency for disaster management. The government has evacuated more than 22,000 people to 34 temporary camps. However one area, housing at least 1,000 residents, still lacks necessary provisions and shelter. The displaced say they have urgent need for baby formula, clean water and gas, said local aid coordinator in Jambur Siabang-abang. A national emergency hasn't been declared, but the government is prepared for the ""worst case scenario."" In case of bigger eruptions, the danger zone would be extended to a radius of 10 kilometers from 5 to 7 kilometers currently. If the zone is enlarged, Nugroho estimates that 59,000 people would have to be evacuated. Kathy Quiano in Jakarta, Indonesia contributed to this report.","A volcanic eruption in Indonesia is intensifying .

"(CNN) -- In the face of injustice, the Book of Isaiah tells us to ""cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet."" North Carolina's State Constitution says the people have a right to assemble and petition their lawmakers for the redress of grievances. It is in this spirit that a growing coalition of North Carolinians is exercising its moral calling and constitutional right by challenging the shameful leadership of our state government -- even if it means going to jail. We don't take civil disobedience lightly. But the avalanche of extreme policies from Gov. Pat McCrory and the North Carolina General Assembly -- attacking the poor and unemployed, cutting crucial funding from public education and dismantling voting rights -- left us no choice. From teenage college students to elderly grandmothers, we are assembling in the State Capitol, week after week, to sing, pray and force politicians to hear our voices. After our first nonviolent protest, 17 of us were arrested and jailed. The next Monday, 30 moral witnesses were carted off in handcuffs, and the next week the number was 49. Last week, 57 protesters were arrested and jailed. Still more of us are prepared to put our bodies on the line to oppose the backward, far-right ideological vision taking hold in our state. Here's why. In the first 50 days of this session alone, the General Assembly and McCrory cut the earned income tax credit for more than 900,000 poor and working people. They rejected federal funding to expand Medicaid to cover 500,000 North Carolinians without health insurance. They slashed state unemployment benefits and rejected federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation to 170,000 laid-off workers. This vicious war on the poor will devastate hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians who are already suffering. And with no checks on the Republican hold on the legislature and governorship, these laws are only the beginning. Piling further indignities on the poor, they also want to require people applying for temporary assistance or benefits to submit to criminal background checks, and force applicants to a job training program for low-income workers to take a drug test, for which they have to pay. Now the legislature wants to increase and expand taxes on groceries, haircuts and prescription drugs. They're even taking aim at poor children with a bill to lower the income requirement for North Carolina's prekindergarten program, making it off limits to nearly 30,000 children who would have previously qualified. Perhaps most terrifying is that the politicians who have seized control are trying to rig the state's election rules, seeking to remain in power far after this legislative session. In their kitchen sink approach to voter suppression, they have pushed bills to require strict forms of photo ID for voting, repeal same-day registration, cut early voting from 17 days to six and ban early voting on Sundays. They even want to impose a tax penalty on the parents of students who register to vote at their North Carolina college addresses, and pass the most restrictive felony disenfranchisement law in the country. These measures have been carefully crafted to make voting harder for people of color, students, seniors and the working poor. McCrory, House Speaker Thom Tillis and Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger apparently intend to be the new George Wallaces, adopting the same Southern Strategy of blocking the vote and dividing our state further into haves and have-nots. So our battle continues. We will not sit idly by as this governor and legislature trample on the most vulnerable in our state without the world knowing about it. We will keep going to the State Capitol where their bills are being passed, bearing witness to their ugly, immoral and unconstitutional agenda. We will not allow this to happen in the dark. This battle is so urgent that Dr. Charles Van Der Horst, a pioneering AIDS researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was arrested at the General Assembly, despite having completed a 199-mile ultra-marathon the previous day. Though physically drained, he still took a stand. When Molly McDonough, an 18-year-old freshman at North Carolina State University, decided to participate, her friends and family expressed concerns about her future. Her courageous response to them: ""I'm doing this so I can have a future."" We call on all North Carolinians of conscience to join us in using the tools of protest to show the nation the shameful acts taking place here. Our arrests will not stop us. Now is the time. Here is the place. We are the people. And we will be heard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the William J.

"(CNN) -- One of this week's most astounding stories is Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp, a mobile messaging service that has more than 450 million monthly active users globally. The $19 billion that Facebook will spend on buying WhatsApp created a collective jaw-drop in the tech world. Sure, the price tag is getting a lot of buzz -- $19 billion is a historically big number for a venture funded company. But what exactly is Facebook getting out of it? A company just a few years old with less than a billion dollars in revenue and a service that is nearly (but not quite) free. Is all of that worth so much money? Just as with the acquisition of YouTube by Google for $1.65 billion or Facebook's purchase of Instagram for $1 billion, many people simply have a hard time wrapping their mind around an acquisition of a service that doesn't fit with traditional valuation principles. In the old world, company valuations were based on a multiple of revenue or free cash flow, while also factoring growth over time. But in the new world of Internet and social media, revenue is often something that will come later as the result of hyper growth, and traditional valuation techniques don't apply. Still, because of the eye-popping price, many are naturally asking if this acquisition is a sign of a tech bubble. After all, prices for social media and Internet service startups seem to be getting bigger by the day and, well, $19 billion is a mind-blowing number. To which I would say that while the price seems enormous - mainly because it is - the price per user is actually in line with acquisitions in the past decade. When looking at price-per-user from acquisitions over the past decade and throwing out outliers like Yahoo's acquisition of Broadcast.com for nearly $11,000 per user (nice job, Mark Cuban), what Facebook paid for each WhatsApp user is solidly in the middle of the pack at $42, above Instagram's $28 cost per user and Tumblr's $33 per user, but below the $48 or so Google paid for each YouTube user back in 2006. So while other acquisitions have been much cheaper in total price paid by Facebook, that's because the total user base of these other services has been much lower. And that's the thing that makes WhatsApp such an attractive prize for Facebook: 450 million active users. Not only is that a massive number, but the number is also growing very quickly, having doubled in just the past year. In short, with this acquisition, Facebook is getting the most popular mobile social messaging app in the whole world. The importance of this can't be understated. Facebook has been trying over the past few years to adapt to the mobile world with mixed results, and now with WhatsApp, Mark Zuckerberg is not only getting a massively popular mobile social messaging service, but one that is also enormously popular in emerging markets. As others have aptly noted, because Facebook doesn't control a mobile platform itself (unlike Google with Android), and with its stock rising, Zuckerberg likely felt it had to make this move now to add fuel to its transition to the world of mobile computing. If Facebook didn't make this move, Google, which reportedly offered $10 billlion for WhatsApp, likely would have. Facebook is showing that it is willing to bet big chunks of the company (the WhatsApp acquisition will cost them roughly 10% of outstanding Facebook shares) to disrupt themselves and remain relevant. A high price to be sure, but judging by recent history, the price it paid is about right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolf.","Facebook bought WhatsApp, a mobile messaging service, for $19 billion .

"(CNN) -- Veteran character actor Ralph Waite -- who many knew best from his time on ""The Waltons,"" though he also had regular roles in more recent series like ""Bones"" and ""NCIS"" -- has died. He was 85. Waite died on Thursday afternoon at his Palm Desert, California, home, according to Steve Gordon, his family accountant. Jane Mead, a representative of the Spirit of the Desert Presbyterian Fellowship that Waite attended regularly, confirmed his death. According to IMDB.com, Waite was already a Hollywood veteran with parts in movies like ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""Five Easy Pieces,"" plus TV series such as ""Bonanza"" when he landed the role of John Walton Sr. ""The Waltons"" struck a chord with many viewers during its run from 1972 to 1981, with Waite being a constant on that show as well as in several TV movies to follow. Waite was twice nominated for an Emmy, first in 1977 for supporting actor in a comedy or drama series for ""Roots"" and the next year as lead actor in a drama for his Waltons' role. Waite also tried his hand at politics, running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for a U.S. representative seat that includes Palm Springs -- narrowly losing in 1990 and again in 1998 to Mary Bono, the widow of former congressman and ""Sonny and Cher"" star Sonny Bono. These forays didn't stop Waite from continuing his day job, however. He continued to score regular roles, for instance, on TV shows like ""The Mississippi,"" ""Murder One,"" ""Carnivale,"" ""The Practice"" and ""Grey's Anatomy."" In fact, Waite was busy working right through last year playing recurring characters on not only ""Bones"" and ""NCIS"" but also ""Days of Our Lives.""

"New York (CNN) -- The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will undergo renovations totaling more than $27 million beginning in late October, according to Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Liberty Island, where the iconic statue is located, will remain open during the yearlong project and views of Lady Liberty will remain largely unobstructed. ""Two years ago, when we reopened Lady Liberty's crown to visitors for the first time since the September 11 attacks, I promised that we would continue to upgrade the interior to make it safer and more accessible for all,"" Salazar said Wednesday. ""With today's announcement, we are taking a major step in bringing a 19th century icon into the 21st century."" The National Park Service will keep the monument open to the public through the October 28 celebration of the 125th anniversary of the statue's dedication. It will be closed the following day as work commences. The National Park Service awarded the work to Joseph A. Natoli Construction Corporation of Pine Brook, New Jersey, to install code-compliant stairways within the monument, refurbish mechanical, electrical and fire suppression systems, replace the elevators, and improve restrooms. The upgrades will also allow for increased visitor access to the monument, including the pedestal and the museum. Similar work will take place at facilities on Ellis Island, the entry point to the United States for millions of immigrants. The project will be funded through a combination of National Park Service appropriations and the park Concession Franchise Fee program. National Park Rangers will remain on site to provide tours of the grounds and history of the statue to visitors, said Jane Ahern, spokeswoman of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Approximately 3.5 million people visit Liberty Island every year.","Yearlong upgrades to Lady Liberty and Ellis Island begin in late October .

"(CNN) -- It's always been a mystery to me why Republican lawmakers who denounce the evils of government choose to run for office. If your belief is that the private sector holds the answers to all that ails us, it seems like you would want to go out and prove the case. So the May 9 vote by the House GOP to eliminate the American Community Survey, which collects statistics about the nation's population, is confusing. Doing away with the data collection would seem to commit two cardinal sins against the right's ideology: Make government less efficient and eliminate a critical tool for profit-driven business. You may not know the American Community Survey as separate from the U.S. census. While the census takes place once every 10 years, the ACS is an ongoing data collection survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau to provide more in-depth and current statistics about demographic patterns in America. This information is crucial if you care about smart direction of the $400 billion in annual state and federal grants to schools, hospitals, infrastructure projects and other critical services. The data derived from the survey provides guidance about how to divvy up best those hard-earned taxpayer dollars so that they are spent with as much care and precision as possible. Apparently, that dynamic is lost on U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster, a Republican who beat Alan Grayson to win Florida's 8th Congressional District in 2010. He introduced the amendment to repeal the survey as a way to make good on his campaign promise to ""stop wasteful spending."" With the affirmative House vote, he hopes to save $2.5 billion over the next decade. Here's the rub though. If Webster gets his way, Americans will spend $4 trillion in that same time period with no data to guide the funds -- essentially shooting in the dark with a massive amount of money. That's the antithesis of efficiency; vastly more than $2.4 billion is likely to be wasted in the process. It seems that along with climate change and evolution, statistical science now appears to be viewed with suspicion by the tea party. I've not heard an alternative: perhaps a dartboard with pictures of all the states on it? The GOP claims the survey is intrusive. But I have to wonder if the vote to repeal the survey is just a step toward tea party Republicans' Holy Grail of eliminating government spending entirely and with it, the $400 billion in annual disbursements. If that is the path forward, let's look at where that road functionally leads us: Without the American Community Survey, we won't know where veterans are living, so we can't get them the financial assistance they're owed for their service to our country. Without the federal and state grants, we simply can't take care of them at all once they come home. Without the survey, we can't know where there are pockets of uninsured people, so health care funds can be directed toward offsetting the costs of emergency room visits. Without the state and federal grants, doctors will be forced either to let people suffer and die or raise costs on all their patients to make good on their Hippocratic oath. Without the survey, we won't know where Americans still lack flush toilets and therefore risk contaminating the groundwater we all drink. Without the federal and state grants, we can't mitigate the impact of raw sewage on our water supply and prevent disease from spreading when our water gets tainted. Webster might say: ""Let the private sector take care of it."" On that point, we can agree: The private sector can and should play a larger role maintaining the health of our country. The flaw in that plan is that our business sector is very reliant on the American Community Survey in making decisions about how best to serve their customers. That's why trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Homebuilders have voiced their opposition to the Webster amendment. The data provided from the survey has informed everything from where to locate new stores to what kinds of products are popular with consumers. These trade groups are hardly a bastion for government expansionists, and their opposition to this bill reveals the critical wedge in the Republican coalition. The business-first wing of the party is all too happy to allow government to foot the bill -- in this case, for solid market research -- when it's convenient for them. The small-government ideologues are more than happy to dismantle government piece by piece even when it harms business and creates bad spending strategies. When asked about the elimination of the survey, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber said, ""If you're opposed to the survey, you're opposed to understanding what's going on in America."" For this reason, it will be an uphill climb to get the measure to pass the Senate and get signed by the president. Still, the initiative and the vote are telling. If knowledge is power and ignorance is bliss, eliminating the American Community Survey will only pay dividends for those who live in powerful bliss. The rest of us would have to suffer through the mess being made of the informed and democratic process.

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts child rape suspect who was wanted in connection with a cross-country series of sexual assaults, kidnappings and armed robberies has been arrested. Gregory Lewis was arrested shortly before midnight in Fort Edward, New York, near the border with Vermont, the Massachusetts State Police said early Wednesday. Lewis, 26, allegedly committed at least six sexual assaults in various states since fleeing Massachusetts in September, according to the Massachusetts State Police. Several victims in the assaults were women he arranged to meet at local hotels through online escort services, police said. The victims were handcuffed, threatened with a gun, robbed and sexually assaulted. His capture and alleged crimes . Police said that when New York state troopers tried to pull over the vehicle Lewis was driving for a missing license plate, he fled, crashing into a river. ""Preliminary reports indicate that LEWIS emerged from his sinking vehicle and brandished a gun at a witness who had heard the crash,"" the Massachusetts State Police tweeted. Troopers and police converged and took him into custody Tuesday night. Lewis committed his alleged crimes on his trip west and then circled back east, police said. He was spotted in Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; Boise, Idaho; and Salt Lake City, Utah, in October, authorities said. On Saturday, he was spotted in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he allegedly committed a robbery at a hotel and was captured on surveillance video. The initial arrest . Lewis was arrested on August 5 and charged with raping a 14-year-old girl in Southbridge, Massachusetts, police said. He was accused of four felony child rape charges, along with counts related to home invasion, kidnapping and firearms possession. The suspect was released on bail after his initial court hearing and ordered by the court to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet. On September 15, he cut off the bracelet, left it in the front yard of his young victim's home and fled Massachusetts in a 2004 Jeep Cherokee, police said. After fleeing Massachusetts, Lewis first traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and robbed a woman on September 23, police said. The alleged victim, who spoke with CNN affiliate WSOC over the phone, said she met him on the Plenty of Fish dating website. ""He put me in a chokehold and put handcuffs on me with my hands behind my back and said I'm not going to hurt you. I just want your money,"" she said. An attack on his stepfather . Two days after the North Carolina assault, police said, Lewis returned to his family's home in Massachusetts, where he allegedly beat and robbed his stepfather. ""This gentleman was literally shackled and held in the home, with a metal shackle,"" Southbridge Police Chief Daniel Charette told CNN affiliate WCVB. Southbridge Police Detective Sgt. Carlos Dingui said Lewis handcuffed his stepfather to prevent him from calling police. Lewis left Southbridge with his stepfather's Beretta 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, according to Dingui. He also took approximately 200 rounds of ammunition. The firearm that police recovered from Lewis after his arrest Tuesday night matches the description of the one taken from his relative's house.","Gregory Lewis, 26, was wanted in connection with violent crimes spanning several states .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- A neighbor and friend of George Zimmerman's said Tuesday on CNN that their neighborhood had suffered eight burglaries, all committed by young black men, in the 15 months prior to Trayvon Martin's shooting. Frank Taaffe's account paints a picture of a neighborhood watch volunteer making rounds in a community suffering a spate of burglaries when he ran across what he thought was a suspicious figure walking the streets. Police records appear to only partially substantiate Taaffe's claims about the burglaries, citing three of eight cases in which suspects were identified as black males. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, profiled Martin, who was black, as ""suspicious"" and ignored a police dispatcher's request not follow him. Martin did not live in Sanford, but was there with his father, whose fiance' lives in Zimmerman's neighborhood. Zimmerman, 28, fatally shot Martin, 17, on February 26. The case has triggered a nationwide debate about Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, race and racial profiling. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, has said he killed Martin in self-defense, saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting, according to family members and police. Martin family attorney Jasmine Rand said that Zimmerman ""was the aggressor."" ""He pursued Trayvon in this instance. If he did have any medical injuries, that did not give him the right to use deadly force and shoot and kill Trayvon,"" Rand said. Here's what police documents have to say about Taaffe's account of the burglaries in his neighborhood: . City officials posted police reports to the city website detailing eight burglary reports in the neighborhood in the 14 months prior to Martin's February 26 death. In three of those incidents, black males were implicated by witnesses or arrests. A fourth incident was less clear. A homeowner who reported that someone had broken into her home and had stolen a video game console referred police to a black man who had previously visited her home asking for her son. Police do not list that man as a suspect in their report. In the other four incidents, there were no witnesses or suspects, according to police reports. It was not clear if the documents posted to Sanford's website include all burglary incidents in the time period mentioned by Taaffe. A city spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comments. Taaffe declined further comment to CNN on Tuesday afternoon. In his CNN interview, Taaffe credited Zimmerman with preventing what he said would have been a ninth burglary by reporting a suspicious black man trying to break into Taaffe's home. City documents show that Zimmerman did call police on February 2 to report a black man was possibly trying to break into the house. By the time police arrived, no one was at the scene, according to a call log posted on the city website. Zimmerman's supporters say he was just trying to do the right thing in guarding his neighborhood. ""It was just a perfect storm that all of the components were there for this tragedy to transpire,"" Taaffe told CNN Tuesday. Martin's father, Tracy Martin questions why Zimmerman suspected his son. When asked what he would say to Zimmerman if he had a chance to speak to him, Tracy Martin told CNN's Piers Morgan: . ""I would ask him why did he in fact pick out my son, what was going through his mind that night?"" CNN's Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.","George Zimmerman's friend says black men were behind eight neighborhood burglaries .

"(CNN) -- Americans needing health insurance or disability services could be overlooked by their local governments if a bill now being considered by the Senate passes. It would eliminate a survey that some call a vital source of information about health indicators of millions of Americans, but which House Republicans say is too expensive and raises privacy concerns. It's called the American Community Survey. The Census Bureau surveys about a quarter of a million Americans every month. Community officials, academics and businesses rely on this information to understand the markets they operate in and the needs of individual localities. The House last week passed a Republican-backed bill that would cut the survey altogether, citing costs and privacy issues. The survey program, which reaches more than 3 million people annually, could cost taxpayers upwards of $2.4 billion over the next 10 years. Survey supporters say that isn't much money in the grand scheme of government, but opponents say the survey is needless and unconstitutional. ""Given the intrusive nature of some of these questions, which are mandatory for Americans to answer under penalty of law, it would seem that these questions hardly fit the scope of what was intended or required by the Constitution,"" Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Florida, told Congress last week. But the American Community Survey is vital to state legislators, mayors, city councils and city planners, said Robert Moffitt, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. These officials need to know information such as how many families don't have health insurance, how many people are living in poverty, and how many individuals are disabled, so that services can be directed toward the appropriate number of people in particular places, he said. Academics who rely on the data for research have been particularly concerned about maintaining the survey, whose data is used in a wide variety of analyses. ""If you're opposed to the survey, you're opposed to understanding what's going on in America,"" said MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, director of the Program on Health Care Research at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The poverty question is particularly important because in areas where poor families are concentrated, problems multiply, and community officials should know where those areas are, Moffitt said. High crime, health conditions and underperforming public schools are all consequences of poverty clusters, according to the Brookings Institution. And with health insurance, as communities devise health insurance programs for those who are not covered, it's useful to know exactly where the uninsured live and other facts about them, such as whether they are also unemployed, Moffitt said. Gruber says the survey is probably the best source of data on health insurance coverage currently available. Health insurance markets are quite different across areas. The survey additionally allows researchers and policy-makers to look for trends among minorities. ""If you want to do any local estimates, you need big samples, and that's what the ACS gets you,"" he said. The Affordable Care Act, whose constitutionality will be decided by the Supreme Court, would require that everyone have health insurance. But irrespective of that, any state doing health care exchanges needs to know about the markets it's operating in, he said. In 2008 the American Community Survey began including questions about marriage -- for instance, how many times people have been married, and whether they have been married, divorced or widowed in the previous 12 months. This could be used to zoom in on needs surrounding child care and child support for single-parent households, as well as to create and evaluate policies and initiatives relating to the institution of marriage. The survey is also important to businesses. Joan Naymark, director of market analytics and planning at Target Corporation, said in a video on the Census website that her company uses Census Bureau data to see the characteristics of potential customers who live in communities throughout the United States. Target's director of guest insight, Kate Whittingon, said in the video that Target looks at the American Community Survey for information about family structure and household size. Educational attainment and workforce age are two statistics from the survey that are valuable to the Greater Houston Partnership, a nonprofit geared toward building economic prosperity in Houston. As examples of the intrusiveness of the survey, Webster cited questions that ask if respondents have difficulty dressing, concentrating and making decisions, how long it takes them to get home from work, and what their emotional condition is. He also said that failure to answer the survey can result in a $5,000 fine. But Martin Gaynor, professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, called concerns about privacy ""very foolish."" ""People volunteer all kinds of far more intimate, sensitive information online without a thought about who is watching,"" he said. And there's a harsher penalty for Census Bureau employees who identify individuals filling out the surveys: five years in prison or $250,000 in fines, or both, according to the Census website. All employees take an oath of nondisclosure, and the information is kept private. The American Community Survey has been administered since 2005. Before that, there was a long-form questionnaire that accompanied the general U.S. Census, which is given out every 10 years. ""There was a general sense in the statistical community that there was a burden and people objected to it,"" said Margo Anderson, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Supporters of the cost-cutting bill won the vote to kill the survey 232-190 in the House. But it's far from being a law -- the Senate hasn't voted on it yet, and White House has suggested it would veto such a bill. ""I think the issue really is: The Republican House right now is looking for ways to cut the federal budget,"" Anderson said. ""What's likely to happen is: There's now going to be a much more robust public debate about whether (cutting it) is prudent or not.""","Congress threatens to kill survey used for health coverage data .

"Washington (CNN) -- The number making Mike Podhorzer anxious these days is 15. That's the lead Democrats have over Republicans among working class voters in the final days of the 2014 midterm elections, according to his polling at the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor federation. That might seem good for Democrats, but in modern times, the party always wins voters making $50,000 or less. For Podhorzer, the AFL-CIO's political director and one of the Democratic party's top thinkers on voter turnout, it's the spread that matters. ""Democratic victories are powered by the votes of the people who are more financially stressed,"" Podhorzer said in an interview with CNN at the labor federation's Washington offices, just up the street from the White House. ""That's been the case going back to the New Deal. When working class people turn out and vote Democratic, that more than compensates for the advantage that Republicans have among upper income voters."" In other words, with GOP dependably winning upper-income Americans, it's up to Democrats to run up the numbers with downscale voters, who made up about 40% of the electorate in the last election. When Democrats clobber Republicans nationally among working class voters — as they did by 22 points in 2012 — they win. When the margin is tighter — it was only an 11-point win for Democrats in 2010 — they lose. The 55-40 lead Democrats are clinging to among people making under $50,000 is wider than the 50-39 lead they had earlier this summer, making this year's outcome harder to predict. Podhorzer said it does explain why Democrats are still in the hunt heading into next Tuesday, suggesting that next week's election won't resemble the GOP tidal wave of 2010. But it still makes him nervous. Too many Democratic campaigns have failed to rally their working class base, Podhorzer said, choosing instead to run on wedge issues -- like Sen. Mark Udall's relentless opposition to a personhood amendment in Colorad -- rather than broader economic populism. ""It's very dangerous,"" he said. ""I think that picking niche issues and trying to run on a collection of issues and contrasts in this environment is less effective than mobilizing the voters they need to turn out."" ""Throughout this cycle, polls have shown Republican voters to be more enthusiastic, because Democrats have been taking an approach in general that's more about slicing into independent voters and into the middle, and has left the base fairly unmotivated,"" he said. The Democrats who have nurtured working class voters with an economic message — like Gary Peters in Michigan and Al Franken in Minnesota — aren't getting much national attention, he said, because they have pulled away from their opponents and aren't being covered by the horse-race-obsessed media. Tight races are not breaking open in the final days, an indicator of ""the cynicism and apathy that people have."" But even with a motivated base, Podhorzer said Republicans are still not where they would like to be heading into Election Day. ""It's really remarkable how many close races there are right now,"" he said. ""And unlike 2010, Republicans are not making inroads into blue territory. In 2010, they were able to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and so forth. This time around they may be able to win races like Colorado or others, but they are not changing the presidential map at all. They have their work to do to figure out how to get the map from the way it looks now to a winning map in 2016."" Podhorzer, an engineer of the progressive movement's superior voter turnout machinery, said the battle on election day will be about get-out-the-vote mechanics. He framed the contest as a test of the GOP's ""wholesale GOTV"" — paid media and base enthusiasm in a good Republican year — versus the ""retail GOTV"" of the Democratic coalition that relies on the party's technological advantages and focuses on person-to-person contact and. WATCH: Hillary Clinton clarifies 'jobs' remarks . The AFL-CIO's super PAC, Worker's Voice, is part of the field program Democrats are counting on in tough Senate and gubernatorial races in place like North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. ""The Democrats' retail GOTV has gotten much, much stronger than in 2010, when the base was even more disillusioned,"" he said. ""Democrats will do a better job on retail GOTV, and have more of the personal networks on the ground to pull people out. It's going to be interesting to see how effective that can be.""","AFL-CIO political director Mike Podhorzer is worried about Democrats' standing with working class voters .

"(CNN) -- Susan Blake writes her son Joseph all the time. ""I send him e-mails,"" she says, ""keeping him updated on what's going on."" Each e-mail goes unanswered. All she can do is hope that he sees them. It's how she copes with one of the most unsettling and baffling missing persons cases in recent years: the mystery of the McStay family. Next week marks the third anniversary of the disappearance of Joseph McStay, 43; his wife, Summer, 46; and their two young children, Gianni, 7, and Joseph Mateo, who would be 6 this month. February 4, 2010 was the last day anyone saw the family or heard from them. When police entered their Southern California house more than 10 days later, they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room. Their two dogs were also in the home. But not a single trace of the McStays. 2010: California police search for missing family . Did they voluntarily leave? Are they in Mexico? Are they in danger? Are they dead? Despite hundreds of tips and several high-profile television reports and interviews, no one has a clue. ""This is definitely an unusual case,"" says Lt. Glenn Giannantonio of the San Diego Sheriff's Department's homicide division ""At this point we are no closer to finding them than on the day they disappeared. I know that sounds horrible, but we just don't know what happened to them."" The sentiment is shared by Dennis Brugos, who led the sheriff's department investigation into the McStays' disappearance before retiring last year. ""Nothing makes any kind of rational sense that you can put together,"" Brugos says. The McStays lived on a cul-de-sac in Fallbrook. Described on its website as the ""friendly village,"" Fallbrook is about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and some 50 miles north of San Diego. Joseph McStay owned Earth Inspired Products, a company that built custom water features for high-end commercial businesses around the world, says Mike McStay, his younger brother. Summer stayed home to raise the children, but according to Mike was planning on getting back to work. The family's locked and abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located February 8, 2010, in San Ysidro, just two blocks from the border. Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico. ""If you look at the clothing that they were wearing at the time, it coincides with when the vehicle was found; it leads you to believe that that was them crossing the border,"" Brugos says. ""I can't say definitively it's them, but it's a high probability."" Giannantonio agrees. ""We do believe the family on the tape going into Mexico is that of the McStays, "" he says. But Joseph's mother isn't convinced. ""My son's meds were in that car,"" she tells CNN. ""My son has asthma and doesn't go anywhere without the meds on him. And to have babies go without car seats. This is the stuff that doesn't add up."" Mike McStay says he is not sure if the family is on the video. ""The best is that the children appear to be size appropriate, but I could never get an ID off the adult. Even if it were them crossing, we still don't know to what intent. We don't know if it was under duress or willingly."" However, he says he believes someone has an answer. ""How does somebody not see them?"" he wonders. ""They have to go get groceries, get the basic necessities of life; they have to have a way to generate an income. There has to be something. ""My brother is out there. I want what everyone wants, a phone call, a letter, something. I don't want to know why he left. We just have to know that they are OK."" Mike McStay is familiar with the theories speculating on what might have happened, including one presented in the new book, ""No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family."" Author Rick Baker says his own investigation, including reviewing hundreds of personal e-mails, shows that Summer and Joseph were having problems and that their relationship was, in his words, about to ""explode."" Baker speculates, among other things, that at least one of the family members may have met with foul play. Mike McStay bristles when asked to comment on Baker's suggestion. ""I don't know how he sleeps at night,"" McStay says of the author. ""I suspect he's looking for money. He's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things. He's just trying to sell books."" Blake, the mother, says there were many inaccuracies in the book. ""It was very hard to read all this, very heartbreaking, the accusations."" She says, ""The bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family, sad to say."" Giannantonio cautions there is no evidence of any criminal activity. ""Everything leads us to believe the disappearance is voluntary. It's still categorized as a missing persons case,"" he says. ""We have to rely on facts and evidence. We don't want to publicize unsubstantiated theories. Everyone has theories, however we can't come out and say this is what actually happened unless we have something to back that up. Other people can, but that's not the business we are in."" Brugos says he thinks anything is possible. ""If you are staying together as a group, as a family of four, it's probably a little more difficult. If you want the kids to go to school, questions are asked, and with the Internet everybody is an amateur detective."" Mike and his mother get reported sightings of the McStays on a regular basis. They come from all over the country. Mike, who says he chases them all down, recently received a tip from Belize, where his brother owned property. ""Every time one comes your heart pumps and you hope to God that this is it,"" Blake says, ""and when it's not you fall apart. It's heartbreaking and very hard."" She isn't giving up. Neither is Mike, though both are mindful that ultimately the truth could be devastating. ""Until my dying day I will try to resolve this thing. I have to know where my brother and my family are,"" Mike says. ""I'm going to have to stick with this for the rest of my life. Until we have closure. So that we can have some peace. I know all of us need peace."" Blake says the search for her family is the biggest fight of her life. ""I refuse to give up. I hope to God, but at the same time it's been three years. ""How can a family of four just disappear?""","McStay family went missing nearly three years ago .

"(CNN) -- If you want to understand the way prescription drugs are marketed today, have a look at the 1928 book, ""Propaganda,"" by Edward Bernays, the father of public relations in America. For Bernays, the public relations business was less about selling things than about creating the conditions for things to sell themselves. When Bernays was working as a salesman for Mozart pianos, for example, he did not simply place advertisements for pianos in newspapers. That would have been too obvious. Instead, Bernays persuaded reporters to write about a new trend: Sophisticated people were putting aside a special room in the home for playing music. Once a person had a music room, Bernays believed, he would naturally think of buying a piano. As Bernays wrote, ""It will come to him as his own idea."" Just as Bernays sold pianos by selling the music room, pharmaceutical marketers now sell drugs by selling the diseases that they treat. The buzzword is ""disease branding."" To brand a disease is to shape its public perception in order to make it more palatable to potential patients. Panic disorder, reflux disease, erectile dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, bipolar disorder, overactive bladder, ADHD, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, even clinical depression: All these conditions were once regarded as rare until a marketing campaign transformed the brand. Once a branded disease has achieved a degree of cultural legitimacy, there is no need to convince anyone that a drug to treat it is necessary. It will come to him as his own idea. Disease branding works especially well for two kinds of conditions. The first is the shameful condition that can be destigmatized. For instance, when Pharmacia launched Detrol in the late 1990s, the condition the drug treated was known to doctors as ""urge incontinence."" Patients called it ""accidentally peeing in my pants"" and were embarrassed to bring it up with their physicians. Pharmacia fixed the problem by rebranding the condition as ""overactive bladder."" Whereas ""incontinence"" suggested weakness and was associated mainly with elderly women, the phrase ""overactive bladder"" evoked a supercharged organ frantically working overtime. To qualify for a diagnosis of ""overactive bladder,"" patients did not actually have to lose bladder control."" They simply needed to go to the bathroom a lot. The vice president of Pharmacia, Neil Wolf, explained the branding strategy in a 2002 presentation called ""Positioning Detrol: Creating a Disease."" By creating the disease of ""overactive bladder,"" Wolf claimed, Pharmacia created a market of 21 million potential patients. Another good candidate for branding is a condition that can be plausibly portrayed as under-diagnosed. Branding such a condition assures potential patients that they are part of a large and credible community of sufferers. For example, in 1999, the FDA approved the antidepressant Paxil for the treatment of ""social anxiety disorder,"" a condition previously known as ""shyness."" See more CNN.com opinion articles . In order to convince shy people they had social anxiety disorder, GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil, hired a PR firm called Cohn and Wolfe. Cohn and Wolfe put together a public awareness campaign called ""Imagine being allergic to people,"" which was allegedly sponsored by a group called the ""Social Anxiety Disorders Coalition."" GlaxoSmithKline also recruited celebrities like Ricky Williams, the NFL running back, and paid them to give interviews to the press about their own social anxiety disorder. Finally, they hired academic psychiatrists working on social anxiety disorder and sent them out on the lecture circuit in the top 25 media markets. The results were remarkable. In the two years before Paxil was approved for social anxiety, there were only about 50 references to social anxiety disorder in the press. But in 1999, during the PR campaign, there were over a billion references. Within two years Paxil had become the seventh most profitable drug in America, and Cohn and Wolfe had picked up an award for the best PR campaign of 1999. Today, social anxiety disorder, far from being rare, is often described as the third most common mental illness in the world. It is hard to brand a disease without the help of physicians, of course. So drug companies typically recruit academic ""thought leaders"" to write and speak about any new conditions they are trying to introduce. It also helps if the physicians believe the branded condition is dangerous. When AstraZeneca introduced Prilosec (and later Nexium) for heartburn, for example, it famously repositioned heartburn as ""gastroesophageal reflux disease,"" or GERD. But it also commissioned research to demonstrate the devastating consequences of failing to treat it. If all drugs were harmless, disease branding would be relatively harmless, too. But no drug is completely benign. For example, Detrol can make elderly people delirious and may cause memory problems. Paxil is associated with sexual dysfunction and dependence. It also carries a black-box warning for suicide in children and adolescents. Side effects like these are a part of every drug. But they are never part of the brand. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Elliott.","Carl Elliott: Drug makers have mastered the art of branding medical conditions to sell cures .

"(CNN) -- A beautiful 29-year-old woman with a rare brain tumor, Brittany Maynard and her tragic death have sparked the on-again, off-again debate about whether assisted suicide should be legalized in this country. The media frenzy over the Maynard story has made it almost impossible for a legitimate opposing view to be heard, and many people believe that any opposition has to come from religious extremists or right-wing busybodies. I am neither. As a disability rights advocate for over 40 years as well as a person living with a disability, I am deeply troubled about the Maynard media swarm. Assisted suicide legalization isn't about Brittany Maynard. It's about the thousands of vulnerable ill, elderly and disabled people who will be harmed if assisted suicide is legalized. A recent report from the Institute of Medicine calls the country's system of caring for terminally ill people ""largely broken,"" ""poorly designed to meet the needs of patients"" and refers to Medicare and Medicaid, health care systems designed to meet the needs of the poorest among us, ""in need of major reorientation and restructuring."" More from Opinion: Why assisted suicide laws are dangerous . The idea of mixing a cost-cutting ""treatment"" such as assisted suicide into a broken, cost-conscious health care system that's poorly designed to meet dying patient's needs is dangerous to the thousands of people whose health care costs the most -- mainly people living with a disability, the elderly and chronically ill. Assisted suicide drugs cost less than $300. Compare that with the cost of treating a terminal illness. This is one of the many reasons every major disability rights organization in the country that has taken a position on assisted suicide is opposed to legalization, along with the American Medical Association, palliative care specialists and hospice workers who know better than anyone that advancements in palliative care have eliminated pain as an issue for patients who receive appropriate care. Anyone dying in discomfort may legally today, in all 50 states, receive palliative sedation, wherein the patient is sedated and discomfort is relieved while the dying process takes place peacefully. This legal solution does not raise the very serious difficulties that legalizing assisted suicide poses. More from Opinion: When assisted suicide is not the answer . Assisted suicide ultimately affects everyone's health care. In Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal and where Maynard moved to be prescribed the lethal dose, patients have been harmed. In 2008, cancer patient Barbara Wagner was prescribed a chemotherapy treatment by her doctor, but Oregon's state-run health plan sent a letter which denied coverage of this chemo, yet offered to cover other ""treatments,"" including assisted suicide. The same scenario happened to another Oregon resident, Randy Stroup. The Oregon assisted suicide reports tell us that over 95% of those who supposedly received lethal prescriptions in Oregon had insurance, but how many got a denial like the one sent to Wagner and Stroup? When assisted suicide is encouraged, it becomes a covered ""treatment"" and ultimately removes choices from patients. Assisted suicide's supposed ""safeguards"" are hollow. Nothing in the Oregon, Washington and Vermont laws prevents an heir or caregiver from suggesting assisted suicide as an option, taking the person to the doctor to sign up and witnessing the consent form. Once the prescription is obtained, with no further witness required, nothing in the law ensures the person's consent or self-administration at the time of death. More from Opinion: Maynard was courageous and right . With the rising tide of elder abuse in this country, we can't ignore the dangers of granting blanket legal immunity to all the participants in an assisted suicide. When voters are given all the facts surrounding assisted suicide, they reject bills to legalize it. This was the case in Massachusetts when Question 2, which would have legalized assisted suicide in the Bay State, was on the ballot in 2012 but was defeated. In 2014, bills again in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire failed because of lack of support in the legislature. Brittany Maynard's story is incredibly heart-wrenching. When you look at assisted suicide based on one individual, it often looks acceptable. But when you examine how legalization affects the vast majority of us -- especially those most vulnerable -- the dangers to the many far outweigh any alleged benefits to a few.","Diane Coleman: I am deeply troubled about the Brittany Maynard media swarm .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Countries whose top leadership meet with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, lose on average 8.1 percent in exports to China in the two years following the meeting, according to a recent study. Called the ""Dalai Lama Effect,"" the study by the University of Gottingen in Germany found the negative impact on exports began when President Hu Jintao took office in 2002. The study is the first empirical analysis demonstrating the economic consequence of such meetings. Machinery and transportation equipment exports suffered the most consistent negative impact, following meetings with the 14th Dalai Lama, according to study authors Andreas Fuchs and Nils-Hendrik Klann. ""We wanted to find out the impact of the rising role of China in the world ... to find out what we should expect of China's role in the world in the coming years,"" researcher Fuchs told CNN. ""It is clear that politics has played a huge role in China's commercial relationships."" China says it opposes politicizing trade and economic ties. However, prior to each of the Dalai Lama's meetings with leaders, the Chinese government often openly threatens that such meetings will lead to damaged trade relations with China. Using data from the United Nations, Fuchs and Klann tracked exports from 159 countries doing trade with China from 1991 to 2008. They discovered that exports to China decreased only after the Dalai Lama met with heads of state, such as presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens and the Pope. The Dalai Lama's meetings with heads of state -- including U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy -- have been a consistent source of diplomatic tension with China. No negative impact was found after meetings of the Dalai Lama with lower-ranking officials, the study said. Dalai Lama talks of retirement . In response to the study findings, Tenzin Taklha, joint secretary for the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, told CNN: ""His Holiness has no intention of causing any inconvenience to the host country he visits."" Taklha added, ""It is unfortunate that the Chinese government views everything His Holiness does through a political angle."" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. The ""Dalai Lama Effect"" is not permanent, according to the study. The negative impact on exports disappeared on average two years after each meeting takes place. ""China has an interest in having its commercial relationships restored. On the other hand, they have interest to really show their anger about a Dalai Lama reception or meeting,"" Fuchs said. My Take: Why the Dalai Lama became a global icon . The study went on to say, ""China's political leadership may be willing to bear the economic and political costs that arise from diverting trade away from the Dalai Lama-receiving countries if such 'punishment' increases the likelihood of its political survival."" The implications of decreased exports to China could hurt the Chinese economy. ""Blocking trade endangers Chinese economic growth, both from a immediate short-term perspective, and longer-term perspective as trade partners seek to diversify away from a potentially-aggressive China,"" said Alistair Thornton, China Analyst at IHS Global Insight, a macroeconomic research firm. Moreover, the government may not be responsible for the negative impact on exports in the aftermath of meetings with the Dalai Lama. ""The possibility remains that Chinese companies are taking it upon themselves to curb trade links, rather that it being a direct order from the highest levels,"" Thornton said. ""As machinery tools are strongly linked to trade missions, and the government controls the trade missions, the government would appear to be in control here. But it could be less that the government has ordered a freeze on imports, rather than removed one easy way for companies to strike deals for those imports."" More than 95 percent of the Dalai Lama's visits to foreign countries are non-political in nature, says the Dalai Lama's joint secretary, but his meetings have long been the subject of intense debate in Beijing. When the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, China threatened to sever economic ties with Norway if Norwegian leadership attended the ceremony. In February of this year, U.S. President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama in Washington despite warnings from Beijing. Following the meeting, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai summoned the U.S. ambassador to express China's discontent. ""The U.S. act grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, gravely hurt the Chinese people's national sentiments and seriously damaged the Sino-U.S. ties,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu in a statement in February. The long term impact of the ""Dalai Lama Effect"" is uncertain. ""Chinese trade relations are not free of political biases ... the country seems to exploit trade ties as a foreign policy tool,"" Fuchs and Klann wrote. ""[However] such an economic punishment mechanism will only prevail as long as the expected political gains from stabilizing the regime outweigh the losses from trade diversion.""","Study: Countries that meet with the Dalai Lama lose  8.1 percent in exports to China .

"(CNN) -- David Cameron is in danger of becoming the Prime Minister who takes Britain out of the European Union by mistake. Cameron's looming confrontation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the European Union's principle of free movement of peoples could set off a chain reaction which sees Britain choose to exit the EU in a referendum Cameron has promised voters in 2017. Just a few weeks ago it appeared that miscalculations by Cameron might have seen the breakup of the United Kingdom. In the referendum granted to Scotland on its continued membership in the UK, he was widely criticized for agreeing to the wrong question at the wrong time, with no qualifying majority built in and with no participation rights for Scots living elsewhere in the UK. That the Scots in the end voted to stay was widely reckoned to owe far more to the intervention of former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown than to anything Cameron did. Now Cameron is under fire again for failing to do his homework, for entering battles he cannot win and for employing dangerous short-term tactics in the hope of averting further blows from the advancing United Kingdom Independence Party at a forthcoming Parliamentary by-election and in next summer's General Election. Cameron is a pragmatic Tory centrist who warned his Conservative party in 2006 that it had been losing elections because instead of talking about issues like the National Health Service and education, ""we kept banging on about Europe."" He was then -- and probably still is -- an advocate of continued British membership of the EU. But in order to win the support of the Euro-skeptic right wing of his party in the election that brought him the Tory leadership, Cameron made a promise to take the Conservatives out of the European People's Party -- the main center-right grouping in the European Parliament. That cynical exercise in ""gesture politics"" alienated Angela Merkel and other potential key allies in Europe. It also taught the Euro-skeptics that Cameron could be pushed around. The clever exploitation of Britain's ""anti-politics"" mood by UKIP in recent months has seen Cameron forced onto the back foot. Now he himself is constantly in the headlines, ""banging on,"" as he used to put it, about Europe. The trouble is that he has chosen the wrong issues and made undeliverable promises which only strengthen UKIP's claims that mainstream parties are not to be trusted. He has pledged to renegotiate Britain's terms of EU membership before the promised referendum, but has failed to coax any European allies into an agreement on the specific reform issues that he has in mind. He vehemently opposed the candidacy of former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker as the new President of the European Commission, but found only Hungary willing to support him in what ended up being a 26-2 endorsement for Juncker. Angered by the new financial demand from the EU in its ten yearly accounting system for a further 2.1 billion euros ($2.7 bn), Cameron has huffed that he simply won't pay. He certainly deserves some sympathy on that issue: the timing could not have been worse for him politically. But there is no evidence that the EU's claim under the existing rules is illegitimate and Britain has always prided itself previously on obeying the rules of the club when others sought to bend them. The issue that UKIP has most successfully exploited is that of immigration, and now Cameron is running scared, making a lot of noise on a subject whose constant presence in the headlines can only benefit his opponents. Again luck has deserted him. The coalition government has made progress in curbing immigration into the UK from countries outside the EU. But Britain's swifter recovery than other European nations from the economic crisis has made it a magnet to EU citizens who see a better chance of work there than in their own countries. The Conservatives have not therefore been able to meet their pledge to reduce immigration to under 100,000 people a year. With few positive policies to offer, UKIP has made the immigration issue its own. So now Cameron is insisting that he wants an end to the basic EU rule on the free movement of its citizens between member nations. But again he is without obvious allies and raising expectations he cannot fulfill. Angela Merkel and some other leaders may be willing to help David Cameron curb exploitation of the benefits system by ""benefit tourists"" and the like. But there is no way, as Merkel is making clear, that she will agree to the ending of the basic EU principle of the free movement of its peoples between nations. If Cameron does somehow manage success of a sort at the next election and return at the head of another coalition government, he will do so as a leader pledged to alter Britain's terms of EU membership and pledged to an in-out referendum on Britain's membership. He will have made further fearsome noises on restricting immigration which his speech writers are even now desperately trying to cobble together. The problem: No one else in Europe is showing the slightest interest in altering those terms of membership, especially on altering the free movement of people. Cameron will try, and almost certainly he will fail -- with a serious prospect that a disillusioned British people, stoked up by his rhetoric as well as UKIP's, will then insist that they want out. And the only question remaining will be: which side will the previously pro-European Cameron then be supporting -- the Ins or the Outs? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.","David Cameron has pledged to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership in the EU .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners gathered Friday in the West African nation of Ghana to pay their respects to the late President John Atta Mills, as his funeral was held in the capital, Accra. Mills died last month at age 68, prompting outpourings of grief from many Ghanaians. Ghanaians from all walks of life, many dressed in the traditional black and red of mourning, thronged Independence Square in Accra to witness the ceremony, in a show of national unity. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was among the many foreign dignitaries who traveled to Ghana for the funeral. Ghana's Deputy Minister of Information Samuel Okudzeto-Ablakwa said 67 foreign delegations were represented from all over the world. More than 15 heads of state, including almost all the West African leaders, attended the ceremony, which ended with the release of 100 doves into the air. Can Ghana's economy prosper against the odds? After the ceremony, the casket was laid to rest near Osu Castle, the seat of government where Mills had lived and worked since he became president. The late president's body was laid out for public viewing Wednesday and Thursday. Some of the visiting heads of state took turns to file past the body Friday morning. Giant screens were set up around the country for those who could not travel to Accra to watch the ceremony. One Ghanaian mourner at the funeral said he prayed for the sense of unity that has followed Mills' death to continue. ""I'm confident we will have an even more peaceful election this December because most Ghanaians I have spoken to say they enjoy the atmosphere and will urge the politicians to keep it that way"", he said. Mills died suddenly at a military hospital a few hours after becoming ill, his Chief of Staff John Henry Martey Newman said in a statement at the time. The president had denied rumors about his health for months before his death. John Dramani Mahama, formerly Ghana's vice president, was sworn in as the country's new president within hours of his death on July 24. Ghana swears in new president after leader's death . Taking office, he paid tribute to Mills as a ""prince of peace"" who ""brought a distinctive insight into Ghanaian politics."" Mills, a former law professor and a tax expert, was Ghana's vice president from 1997 to 2000. He became president in 2009, narrowly winning a runoff vote, having unsuccessfully run for the top office in 2000 and 2004. Before his political career, he taught at the University of Ghana and also was a visiting lecturer at Temple University in Pennsylvania and Leiden University in the Netherlands. Mills' death came several days after he celebrated his 68th birthday. He had said he would run for re-election in December. U.S. President Barack Obama met with Mills when he visited Ghana in July 2009. Obama praised the country as a model for democracy and stability when Mills visited Washington this year, saying that it had become ""a wonderful success story economically on the continent."" British Prime Minister David Cameron described Mills as ""a tireless defender of democracy in West Africa and across the continent."" Part of a former British colony, Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence, in 1957. It endured a series of coups before a military dictator, Jerry Rawlings, took power in 1981. Rawlings led Ghana through a transition to democracy about 10 years later.

"(CNN) -- A new study on healthy women with genetic mutations that sharply increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer supports the old adage: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The report, published online Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, studied nearly 5,800 women with specific genetic mutations called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Researchers found that women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who protectively had their ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer by 80%, and their overall risk of death by 77%. BRCA stands for breast cancer susceptibility genes, a class of genes known as tumor suppressors. Mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. According to Monday's study, women with BRCA1 mutations should have preventive ovarian surgery-- known as prophylactic oophorectomy -- by age 35, as waiting appears to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. In contrast, women with BRCA2 mutations can safely delay surgery until their 40s, the study suggests, as their risk of ovarian cancer is not as strong. The new research provides doctors with additional information to support the risk-reducing surgery, said ovarian cancer expert Dr. Shannon Westin. Removing the ovaries in these patients ""provides more benefits than just the reduction in ovarian cancer because this study shows there's a survival benefit that has not been shown this clearly before,"" she said. 7 questions on cancer gene testing . Westin is an assistant professor in the Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She was not involved in the study. According to the American Cancer Society, previous studies have shown that removing the ovaries of a premenopausal woman with BRCA mutations can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by 85% to 95%, and the risk of breast cancer is cut by 50% to 60%. But Monday's study is the first study to show an overall mortality reduction benefit. ""To me, waiting to have oophorectomy until after 35 is too much of a chance to take,"" said Steven Narod, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto in Canada, and the study's lead author. ""These data are so striking that we believe prophylactic oophorectomy by age 35 should become a universal standard for women with BRCA1 mutations."" BRCA mutations grabbed national headlines last year when actress Angelina Jolie announced she carries a mutation of the BRCA1 gene and had underwent a preventive double mastectomy at age 37 to reduce her risk of breast caner. Jolie's mother, actress and producer Marcheline Bertrand, died of ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56. ""My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman,"" Jolie wrote in a New York Times op-ed article in May. ""Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much I could,"" she said. ""I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex."" Dr. Agustin Garcia, an associate professor of Clinical Medicine at Keck Medicine of University of Southern California, said another important aspect of the study is how it breaks down the differences researchers saw between BRCA1 and BRCA 2 carriers. ""In most of the guidelines, we don't distinguish between the two, but this study separated the two groups for potential age for prophylactic oophorectomy,"" said Garcia, who was not involved in the research. He said the study tells women with the BRCA2 mutation they can probably wait until they are 50 to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. ""These results could make a real difference for women with BRCA mutations, who face tough decisions about whether and when to undergo a prophylactic oophorectomy,"" Don Dizon, a member of the cancer communications committee at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said in a statement. ""Importantly, for women who will be undergoing this surgery early in life, it's reassuring to see that it carries long-lasting benefits, substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- One of the great Olympic ideals is the importance of taking part, bringing together athletes of all backgrounds from all around the world. But not everyone has had the chance to compete. Saudi Arabia is one of only three countries -- along with Qatar and Brunei -- which have never sent female athletes to an Olympic Games. That may change in London this year after a groundbreaking meeting with Olympic and Saudi officials, but it raises a bigger question -- are the Arab kingdom's women actually ready to compete in top international sporting competitions? The plan, at this stage, is to send Saudi women to the UK capital for the July 27-August 12 event. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) met with Saudi Arabian Olympic officials this week. ""A list of potential female athletes for the Games was presented. This will now be studied by the IOC together with the relevant International Sports Federations in order to assess the level of each athlete,"" ran a statement on the IOC's website. It's a significant development, says Rima Maktabi, host of CNN's Inside the Middle East, but the move might come a bit too late for Saudi Arabia's female athletes. ""When you talk to Saudi women, even those who are professionals, they tell you that they are not even qualified,"" Maktabi said. ""We're not even close,"" says Lina Al-Maeena, co-founder of Jeddah United Sports Company. ""At this point, we are trying to make it on a national level, integrate into public schools and then maybe compete on a regional level before we even think of the Olympics,"" Al-Maeena, who is also captain of the Saudi women's basketball team, told CNN. Al-Maeena says that Qatar and Brunei's non-participation at the Beijing Olympics four years ago wasn't because they didn't allow women to compete, but rather their female athletes just weren't at the required Olympic standard. ""We will need a long time,"" she concedes. Saudi Arabia is a conservative country which has historically failed to promote women's participation in sport, says Christoph Wilcke of Human Rights Watch. ""Government policy hasn't been effectively challenged -- there is a predominant conservative view in society that doesn't afford women equality in a number of issues, including sports,"" Wilcke, senior researcher in the organization's Middle East and North Africa Division, told CNN. The IOC says an assessment of each athlete's capabilities will make up part of a formal proposal which will be submitted to the IOC Executive Board next meeting which takes place in Quebec in May. ""The IOC is confident that Saudi Arabia is working to include women athletes and officials at the Olympic Games in London in accordance with the International Federations' rules,"" the IOC said. Wilcke believes the move is a ""very positive"" development. ""I think international public pressure by the IOC and public media pressure helped get us where we are today,"" he said. ""The goal has to be trying to open up the possibilities, the access for women to sports in Saudi Arabia."" But he added a note of caution. ""The female participation in the Olympics is a symbolic leap forward, but in order for it not to remain symbolic it's really for the Saudi authorities to start acting,"" Wilcke said. ""If sporting opportunities truly increase, I think it will have a broader impact on life for women."" Maktabi said recent Saudi government reforms, aimed at putting more women in the workforce, gave them encouragement for a greater role in society. ""There is high unemployment, it is 17% across Saudi Arabia -- 7% among men, and 28% among women,"" she said. ""But it is interesting that 55-57% of the university graduates are women. So Saudi women are ready. This decision is quite symbolic -- even if it's only on the sports level, it will reflect on all levels in Saudi Arabia, on the economy. ""Definitely it will get women more involved. However, women are battling with conservative views. Many people in Saudi Arabia think it's un-Islamic to work, un-Islamic to be in sports. ""Even some of these ladies I saw, among the sports team, they had to veil just to prove that they are conservative, very Islamic and traditional, but that they can play sports and compete internationally.""","Saudi Arabia and IOC meeting to consider female participation at 2012 London Games .

"Kamaishi, Japan (CNN) -- Six months ago, I stood on a corner in Kamaishi, in northeastern Japan and believed this small city would never recover from the devastation caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. I wasn't being a pessimist. It was simply that my eyes could barely comprehend the damage to this town. Cars sat atop four-story apartment buildings, as entire neighborhoods looked as if the homes had been placed in a blender. A fishing vessel was even swept from its mooring onto a street. But the physical damage paled in comparison to the human toll. Missing person notices wallpapered the makeshift city hall. The line of family members filing for death certificates went from one side of the building to the other. Living with aftermath of Japan's tsunami . To an outsider it appeared Kamaishi had little to offer other than grief and despair moving forward.

In his unheated city office, Murai told me in March that Kamaishi was his city, the only place he ever wanted to and hoped to live. ""I fear the residents may be too afraid to come back and live here again,"" he said. But when I asked if Kamaishi as a city would cease to exist, Murai was emphatic. ""I am convinced it will come back. I will do all that I can for that."" He paused, tears choking his next sentence. ""This is the city I was born in. I don't want to lose my hometown. I want to see my city come back."" I met up with Murai again recently, my first trip to Kamaishi since the immediate aftermath of the tsunami. He was keen to point out the progress made in the reconstruction effort. The change in Kamaishi's downtown is remarkable. The massive job of clearing debris, while not complete, has been successful throughout much of the city. The hotel around the corner, he said, is back in business. Look down the street, he added, smiling, there's no debris. But what makes Murai most proud is being able to report that only 2,000 people from this city of 39,000 have actually left. ""Kamaishi will come back and will become an even better city,"" he said. ""That sort of spirit didn't exist before the tsunami. But we all have a passion and we're all determined."" But he admits the city still faces massive challenges. The steel and fishing industries, Kamaishi's economic base, have yet to resume their operations, while many businesses and jobs have not returned. Thousands of people, including Murai, his wife and two children, are in temporary housing, with no immediate prospect of an income. But one by one the city is tackling each obstacle, united in its goal. ""At the end of each day, I now think 'another day has ended and I'm glad to have lived this day,'"" reflected Murai. ""And I'm glad when morning comes.""","Much of Kamaishi looked as if it had been placed in a blender after the tsunami .

"(CNN) -- Choi Byung Kwan undertook a special operation for the Republic of Korea's army in one of the world's most sensitive areas. He was not a highly trained soldier, but a photographer armed only with a camera. Over a period of years in the late 1990s and early 2000s he traversed the 155-mile truce line of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the Korean peninsular photographing the area's remarkable ecology that was littered with reminders of the Korean war. ""I often came across fantastically charming wild flowers blossoming through the bullet holes of rusty iron helmets in mine fields,"" he says. ""[T]hey always struck a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow in my heart because they looked like reincarnations of the young souls of fallen soldiers."" His photographs will be shown in an exhibition at the UN headquarters in New York in June commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Korean war, and it is hoped by Choi, celebrating peace. ""I gradually realized during my work that the Korean DMZ was not only a valuable source of irreplaceable natural life but also a historical site reminding humanity of the preciousness of peace,"" Choi says. ""I thought many times that this buffer zone deserved serious international attention as a possible world conservation site, which could naturally facilitate peace in the Korean peninsula.""","Photographs of Korea's DMZ to be displayed at UN HQ .

"(CNN) -- With a parade of performers already canceling appearances at SeaWorld, now at least one school class says it's dropping a long-scheduled trip to the park over concerns about the treatment of whales as shown in the documentary ""Blackfish."" The overnight trip to SeaWorld has been a tradition for fifth-graders at Point Dume Marine Science Elementary School in Malibu, California, for at least a decade, according to Principal Rebecca Johnson, but concerns from parents and students including one determined 10-year-old prompted a decision to go elsewhere on this year's trip. Although Johnson mostly credited parents for influencing the change, several parents CNN spoke with said 10-year-old Kirra Kotler played a major role in the decision. The girl watched the film ""Blackfish"" with her parents and immediately afterward announced, ""I never want to go to SeaWorld again,"" according to her father, Kirby Kotler. The Kotler family had taken trips to SeaWorld several times, he said. Kirby, 50, who attended Point Dume the year it first opened, said the entire family was affected by the film but Kirra became especially determined. ""She's always said she's going to be a veterinarian,"" Kirby said. ""She's very passionate about animals."" 'Blackfish': A chilling doc on captive killer whales . A SeaWorld spokesman told CNN by e-mail that Point Dume ""is the only instance of a camp cancellation that we've experienced."" Dave Koontz, SeaWorld's communications director, also wrote that the theme park believes ""Blackfish"" is misleading and inaccurate. ""It's disappointing that this year's class (from Point Dume) will not be participating because of the film,"" he wrote. ""Blackfish"" -- which first aired on CNN in October -- traces a 39-year history of killer whales in captivity leading up to the 2010 killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by the 12,000-pound orca, Tilikum, a whale previously associated with the death of two other people. At least seven entertainers and groups, from the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies to country music singer Martina McBride, have canceled appearances at SeaWorld in the wake of ""Blackfish."" After seeing the film, Kirra Kirby wanted to share it with her friends, her father said. She was determined to get the school to consider other options for the annual trip. 'Blackfish' sparks debate over taking kids to animal parks . ""She's very shy,"" Kirby said of his daughter. ""But she finally found her voice."" Kirby said Kirra launched a word-of-mouth to campaign for the change, in some cases receiving backlash from fellow students who thought she was trying to cancel their overnight trip entirely instead of just changing the destination. Principal Johnson said she is in the process of verifying details for a new trip.

"(EW.com) -- Perhaps it's just the nature of the cycles of pop music, but doesn't it seem like Britney Spears has been gone for a while? Her last album, ""Femme Fatale,"" came out in 2011, but for some reason it seems like she's been missing in action for twice that time. Regardless, Brit is back with a vengeance. Her new album's first single and video, ""Work B***h,"" has already dropped, and yesterday she revealed that the new collection, which will be out December 3, is called ""Britney Jean."" Before you go assuming that she's making some sort of awesome meta-allusion to Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean,"" just know that ""Jean"" is actually Spears' given middle name. Call the governor, Britney Spears lives fancy in 'Work B***h' ""It's a personal album, and all my family, they all call me Britney Jean, it's like a term of endearment, and I just wanted to share that with my fans,"" she told London's Capital FM yesterday. Other details are relatively scarce, though we do know that Will.i.am is serving as executive producer and that ""Work B***h"" doesn't necessarily represent the album as a whole. Is Britney Spears' 'Work B***h' video too sexual? Director weighs in . ""That song is a reflection of Britney moreso than the album,"" Will told Billboard. ""The album is what the album is, but we felt that song needed to come out to keep the foundation on what Britney represents. But it shouldn't reflect the albumâ€”an album is a body of work as a collective. If we had to pick a song like, 'Oh, what song fits every color of the record,' you shouldn't do that...

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- It's early on a Saturday morning, and Sarah Markowitz limbers up before her dance class begins. Sarah stretches on the bar at the school run by the Boston Ballet as her fellow students start to wander in. They are all excited, because today they get to perform for their parents. ""I like dance because I like Gino,"" Sarah says, referring to Gianni di Marco, the instructor for this class of more than a dozen very special dancers. Gino, as his students call him, has taught various ballet classes for the school but now focuses mostly on this one, Adaptive Dance. It is a class specifically for kids with Down syndrome. ""It's about movement,"" Di Marco explains. ""It's about trying to coordinate the body with the music and have joy."" As a conga drumbeat fills the room, the class begins. Di Marco starts in front of his students. They are all seated, facing the floor-to-ceiling dance studio mirror. He leads them through a series of motions timed to the rhythm, gradually working to a standing position. They are all smiles, and Di Marco encourages them with ""Oh, yeah!"" as they shout with enthusiasm, bodies swaying, feet stomping. ""Dance is something that has no limitations,"" Di Marco says. He leads them all in a circle, a pied piper with his loyal and happy group. They each take turns, one at a time, in a freestyle dance in the center. High-fives, hugs and fist bumps are common as each of the friends completes his or her routine. The program started in 2002 and was the idea of Michelina ""Mickey"" Cassella, a physical therapist from Boston Children's Hospital who also works with dancers from the Boston Ballet Company. ""They've had physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy,"" Cassella says of the kids in the Adaptive Dance class. ""I wanted them to come into this building,"" she goes on, ""and to be able to participate in a class like other children."" Though not a dance instructor, Cassella is always there to help guide the students if one of them becomes distracted or just needs a little encouragement. ""They're moving to music beautifully,"" Cassella says. ""They're developing moves we didn't even know they could do!"" She has seen these kids grow into teenagers during their time here and has been amazed by their progress. ""It's just been a beautiful thing to watch."" In the studio, Di Marco has brought the parents in to watch their children perform. Anne Markowitz smiles as she watches her daughter, Sarah, lead the class through spontaneous poses, using the opportunity to ham it up a little. ""I think it's fabulous,"" Anne Markowitz says of the program, and Sarah loves every minute of it. Down syndrome is nothing new to Markowitz, nor are the many capabilities of her daughter and the rest of the students. ""It doesn't matter what your special needs are,"" she says. ""You can do; you can dance; you can express yourself."" Di Marco explains that his students were sometimes hesitant to join in when he first started teaching them. But now he thinks dance has given them all a confidence that goes beyond the dance studio. ""It's not just to learn how to dance,"" he says, ""but also to learn how to be who you are, and I think they're developing that very well, here, in this environment."" The reward goes both ways, however. Di Marco says that seven years ago he was nervous when the classes began. But now, he says, ""Here I am having the time of my life teaching these children."" This is the last class of the session, and the students won't be back until March. Di Marco invites the parents to join their children in a dance. They form a circle again, but this time each student shares a dance with their family members instead of solo. The excitement culminates in one large group hug in the center. They are all exhausted and all smiling. Di Marco, his arms outstretched as if to embrace every one of them, says, ""This is life. I love you guys. Thank you for bringing your children to play with me!""","Adaptive Dance is class specifically for children with Down syndrome .

"(CNN) -- Oh, those cheekbones, those piercing eyes, that hint of danger. Move over, Jeremy Meeks, there's a new bad boy in town when it comes to lawbreakers the Internet lusts after. You might remember Meeks, the California man who -- despite a rap sheet littered with charges related to gang membership, firearm possession and grand theft -- became a viral sensation in June because of his attractive mugshot. Now, Sean Kory has stolen the social media spotlight after his alleged Halloween escapades and subsequent police photograph. Police in Santa Cruz, California, said the 29-year-old dreadlocked man attacked a person dressed as a Fox News reporter during the city's downtown festivities on October 31. Kory ""attacked the victim telling him he 'hates Fox News' "" and then ""grabbed the victim's microphone and placed (it) down the front of his pants and proceeded to rub the microphone on his crotch,"" according to the police report. Police said Kory then attacked the victim with an aluminum tennis racquet. The victim was not injured and reported the incident to police, who chased down the fleeing Kory, the report continued. Kory's mugshot sparked numerous reactions on Twitter, many from women praising his looks or comparing him to Meeks. Kory wasn't the only Halloween reveler to get in trouble in Santa Cruz over the weekend. Among the other notable mischief makers in the coastal California city was a resident dressed as Edward Scissorhands who got a little too into character and was cited ""for mutilation of city trees."" Meanwhile, as much of the Internet glorifies criminal behavior, we'll be over here trying to get a sexy humanitarian portrait to go viral.","Sean Kory's mugshot has attracted social media because of his looks .

"(CNN) -- Lookin' good, Trivago Guy. In a brief new commercial, Tim ""Trivago Guy"" Williams comes across as more polished than the disheveled pitchman he was a few months ago. His hair is nicely tousled, his slim-fit shirt hugs his torso, and he has a fashionable touch of facial stubble. OK, it's hard to tell whether he's wearing a belt, but that's because his shirt is untucked. The new look is a response to the complaints -- some wry, some serious -- the company got after an earlier series of ads featuring Williams. As one person on Twitter wrote, ""I had no idea #trivagoGuy was a thing, but I do know that my wife and I both wondered why homeless people were doing travel ads."" Some people even dressed up as him for Halloween, perhaps as a way to frighten children (or, more likely, Anna Wintour). Does 'Trivago Guy' need a makeover? Trivago wasn't going to let that slide. ""Trivago was listening!"" the company trumpeted in a news release. The company sponsored a contest to give Williams a style makeover. The winner was Aaron Marino, an Atlanta-based style consultant (PDF) who not only got to reshape Williams' image, he received a five-day trip to Berlin to watch the new spot get shot. (Hey, Trivago is a travel website.) Opinions on Twitter were mostly favorable ... ""Someone @ @trivago was listening - the #trivagoguy got a #makeover. Better fitting shirt in a flattering color. The scruff looks intentional,"" wrote The Quiet Car. ... though there was the matter of the beard. ""Hey, the creepy #TrivagoGuy got a new shirt & a haircut! Still, would it kill him to shave? @TravelinAnn #travel,"" wrote JohnCinnamon. Williams has enjoyed the notoriety the campaign has brought. (Incidentaly, the reason for the disheveled style was because he had to maintain a look he had on a German soap opera.) But don't push him to put on a belt. ""I had a belt on at one point, and it just didn't kind of go with the outfit and we scrapped the belt,"" he told CNN in August. ""It's probably one of the best decisions we ever came up with, because look what it's created."" CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this story.","Tim ""Trivago Guy"" Williams cleans up for new ad .

"(CNN) -- The setup was bizarre. North Korean officials whisked a CNN team away in a van, purportedly to go meet with a high-ranking government official. Hours later, they arrived in the capital and were presented with three Americans held captive in the reclusive country. Like virtually everything in Pyongyang, the interviews were carefully managed by the regime. Each man had exactly five minutes to speak. Some of their statements seemed eerily similar. So what was the government's motive in letting Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle address the world? ""First of all, their motivation always behind these interviews has been to gather U.S. attention and then try to pave a way for high-level dialogue with Washington,"" said Ellen Kim of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. During their interviews Monday, all three men said they hope the U.S. government will send an envoy to help get them out of their situations -- similar to how former President Bill Clinton helped secure the release of two journalists in 2009. ""I do believe that (a) special envoy need to come in order to resolve the situation I am in right now,"" said Bae, who is serving 15 years at a labor camp after North Korea claimed he was part of a Christian plot to overthrow the regime. What might North Korea want in return? ""Their negotiating ploy with the U.S. is to try to get us to agree to nuclear arms control, to sort of accept them as a nuclear weapons state -- which we can't do,"" said Michael Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Another possibility: That North Korea wants sanctions against the regime lifted. Victor Cha, the North Korea adviser to former President George W. Bush, said the presentation of all three Americans at once could be telling. ""My guess is the fact that all three of them were put on tape for an American audience on Labor Day as a signal from the North Koreans that they're looking for some sort of package deal to try to get them all out,"" Cha said. ""Whether they're trying to connect this to the long-style nuclear negotiations is anybody's guess."" Washington responds . The detainees' surprise interviews with CNN's Will Ripley on Monday prompted renewed calls out of Washington for the men's release. ""Out of humanitarian concern for Jeffrey Fowle, Matthew Miller, and their families, we request the DPRK release them so they may return home,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, using the initials for North Korea's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. She said the United States is in ""regular, close coordination"" with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which acts as the ""protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea."" But it's apparent the three men are now being used by North Korea as ""bargaining chips,"" said Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has traveled to the isolated country. ""They're sending a signal, saying, 'We're ready to bargain for the three hostages,'"" Richardson said. What the detainees said . All three men said they have signed statements admitting their guilt. North Korean officials monitored and recorded all three interviews, and CNN was unable to assess independently the conditions under which the men were being held. Bae said he is working eight hours a day, six days a week at a labor camp, even though he said his health has ""been failing"" over the past 1Â½ months. The 46-year-old has diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney stones. Despite what he called ""hard labor,"" Bae said he has been treated ""as humanely as possible."" U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae, but to no avail. Even former basketball star Dennis Rodman, who has visited North Korea and called its ruler Kim Jong Un a ""friend for life,"" asked Kim to ""do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose."" Terri Chung, Bae's sister, told CNN on Monday the video of his interview was ""really difficult to watch."" ""It is clear from the video that he is under a lot of stress. And he talks about his health failing and being in complete isolation for almost two years. And it is devastating for our family to see that on TV."" She also released a statement asking the North Korean authorities to have mercy. ""It is in your power to release my brother. You could do it today. Please do so,"" Chung said. ""He has confessed to the crimes for which he has been charged, and he has served a longer detainment than any other American since the war."" Miller: 'My situation is very urgent' Dressed in a black turtleneck and often avoiding eye contact, Miller said he has admitted his guilt -- even though he won't learn of his charges until he goes to trial. ""But I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here,"" Miller told Ripley. The 24-year-old is accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry. He expressed frustration that ""there's been no movement from my government."" Miller said he wanted to tell the United States that ""my situation is very urgent, that very soon I am going to trial, and I would directly be sent to prison."" ""I think this interview is my final chance to push the American government into helping me,"" he said. Fowle describes 'desperate situation' Fowle, an American tourist accused of leaving a Bible in a hotel where he was staying, said he has ""no complaints"" about his treatment. ""It's been very good so far, and I hope and pray that it continues, while I'm here two more days or two more decades,"" the 56-year-old said. North Korea announced Fowle's detention in June, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" ""The charges are violations of DPRK law, which stems from me trying to leave a Bible,"" Fowle told Ripley. ""It's a covert act and a violation of tourists rules. I've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the DPRK."" Fowle said with his trial expected to begin within a month, he is getting desperate. ""You guys should convey my desperate situation,"" he said. ""I've got a wife and three elementary school-aged kids that depend on me for support.""
