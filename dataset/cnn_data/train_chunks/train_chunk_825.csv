"By . Ryan Lipman . An Australian tennis player who  allegedly threatened to post nude photos of his ex-girlfriend online has been charged in the U.S. with aggravated stalking. Mark Terry Henderson was once part of one of the world's top-60 doubles team and was ranked Australia's top-ranked tennis junior in 1999, before going on to play at two U.S. universities and coach at Northwestern and Western Michigan universities. For about five years, Henderson, 32, had been in an on-and-off again relationship with a 29-year-old Chicago woman when she ended the relationship in February, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. Mark Terry Henderson, pictured, was charged in the U.S. after he stalked and threatened his ex-girlfriend . Despite having returned to Australia to live in Brisbane, for months the former tennis star allegedly harassed his ex-girl friend with emails, texts and phone calls, including threatening her life, prosecutors alleged. Prosecutors said Henderson even sent a collage made up of naked photos of his former partner to her and threatened to post it on the internet if she refused to send him more naked photos. But even after police in Australia and Chicago contacted him about the harassment, Henderson continued his behaviour. Police in Chicago and Australia contacted him, but he allegedly continued the harassment. Henderson was previously ranked Australia's top junior tennis player and went on to enjoy a career coaching at U.S. universities . On May 6, Henderson left Australia bound for Chicago and was found by police the following day sitting outside his ex-girlfriend's parents house, it has been alleged. On a nearby street later that day, the Australian man approached the woman and again threatened her life before she ran to her car and locked her self inside, prosecutors said. Henderson tried opening all of the car's door handles,  but the woman successfully escaped and call police, prosecutors said. Following the incident, Henderson fled to Tennessee, was arrested and extradited back to Chicago on Thursday. A judge granted him $US500,000 ($A540,980) bail if he surrendered his passport, stopped using social media and required to be GPS monitored. Henderson told the judge on Saturday that he wanted the Australian consulate notified of his arrest. He returns to court on Tuesday, reported the Chicago Tribune.","Australian man charged with stalking his ex-girlfriend in the U.S.

"A new batch of Australian anti-drinking videos encouraging young people to hold back on the booze is actually doing more harm than good, experts warn. The DrinkWise videos form part of a new anti-booze campaign designed to detract young people from hitting the bottle. The online ads, posted to YouTube, feature a man in a suit promoting drinking as a classy social activity only to be enjoyed in moderation. Drunks are portrayed as 'dickheads' and the message that drinking ruins reputations, is an unattractive social norm and inhibits men's appeal to the opposite sex is a recurring theme throughout. Scroll down for video . Encouraging: health experts believe the anti-drinking campaign could have a positive affect on alcohol sales, doing more harm than good . Appealing to young adults: One advertisement encourages university students to make a judgement call to determine whether taking out a loan is worth the the high price of alcohol . It is implied that sober men are more appealing to mothers, and this is a reason why men shouldn't get drunk . The mostly minute-long 'Classy as F***' videos  attempt to offer tips on how to be an 'experienced' drinker rather than an 'amateur.' One video even implies sober men have a better chance of sleeping with older women. 'There's a place for mothers,' the narrator says, before cutting to a scene of two mothers propped up in bed alongside the man in the suave suit. More... Are these the most precocious 11-year-olds in Britain? Benefits cheats. Gay marriage. Absent fathers. The young stars of a new TV show with an opinion on EVERYTHING . Living advertisement: How Japan's sleeping street drunks have been turned into human billboards for alcohol awareness campaign . But the sleek, black and white animated ads may be having the opposite affect of their good intentions. Results of a university study show that young people actually felt the urge to drink after viewing one of the 'How To Drink Properly' advertisements. The downsides of drinking are not as unappealing as the videos aim to make out. Researchers say one in particular is encouraging young people's drinking habits. The campaign CEO has defended the videos saying they are hitting the mark with their intended audience . Professor Simone Pettigrew, who co-authored a letter published in the Medical Journal of Australia, said: 'What DrinkWise is touting as being helpful is just reinforcing their sales.' What's worse, she said, is that the videos are online and are likely to be watched by children. The study by Prof Simone Pettigrew and her team at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia showed about two thirds of the 40 people who viewed the ad said the animation format appealed to them, as did the humour and swearing. She said while the video's message of discouraging people from drinking too much is helpful, it fails to inform people how much 'too much' actually is. 'The video fails to tell them more than four drinks is binge drinking,' Prof Pettigrew said. 'They think 10 beers is OK.' But DrinkWise CEO John Scott said the campaign was achieving its aims. 'We are weeks into a three-year campaign, but we are confident we have hit the right mark,' he said. He said a DrinkWise study of more than 750 young people had changed their behaviour after seeing the video. 'It shows the campaign is doing the right things. We are speaking to young people for the first time in a language in which they can start to understand the moderation message.' In one of the advertisements offering anti-drinking tips, the narrator says people should consider against forking out on a loan to pay for more shots at the bar . There's a right way: the ads send a message to people that drinking too much ruins reputations . Sober men are much more appealing to women .","Australian anti-drinking videos 'have the opposite affect of their intentions'

"By . Lucy Crossley . This is the heartwarming moment a three-year-old girl with a rare brain condition realises she is about to meet Peppa Pig. Sophie Ryback, who has polymicrogyria affecting the right side of her brain, came face to face with the pre-school children’s cartoon character at Paultons Park in the New Forest, Hampshire. Her parents Michelle and Michael decided to film their daughter's reaction as she arrived at the theme park, before uploading their video to Facebook, where it has been liked by more than 6,000 people on the Peppa Pig World page.

"By . Kate Lyons . A New Zealand couple whose triplets died in a Qatar mall fire two years ago have celebrated the christening of their twins. Martin and Jane Weekes held the christening of Parker and Poppy Weekes, who will turn one next month, on Saturday. The celebration came three days after the May 28 anniversary of the deaths of their three-year-old triplets Lillie, Willsher and Jackson, who were killed in a fire while at a nursery in the Villaggio Mall in Qatar. Jane Weekes (left) and Martin Weekes had their 10-month-old twins Poppy (left, with Jane) and Parker (right, with Martin) christened in Auckland on Saturday . The Weekes lost their three-year-old triplets Lillie (left), Jackson (centre) and Willsher (right) in a mall fire in Doha in 2012 . Mr Weekes said Parker and Poppy were healthy but the lead up to the christening had been difficult as he and his wife remembered the anniversary of the deaths of their older children. 'There's never a day when we don't think about Lillie, Jackson and Willsher. For a lot of the time it's manageable but then something will creep up on you and I found last week very difficult because it's the one day of their life that we don't want to commemorate,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'It's a day we would rather forget. We would rather remember their second birthday parties or when we were travelling but we can't until the court case is finished.' The triplets were killed when a fire broke out at the Gympanzee nursery in the mall.

The chairman of the mall, a mall manager and an official from Qatar's ministry of trade and business have all been sentenced to prison over the fire, but have not spent any time in jail because they are appealing the sentences. The court case has been drawn out, with Mr Weekes saying they were up to the ninth hearing of the case. 'The lawyers on the other side are doing all they can to drag it out and delay it. The last time we had a hearing the applicants' lawyer requested an adjournment for two months so he could go on holiday - and he got it. This time he's decided he wants to call someone else… it is dragging it out so they get to the summer of Ramadan and nothing will happen,' he told the New Zealand Herald.

"By . Emma Innes . A father who lost a leg in a work accident died after taking an accidental overdose of a drug he bought on the internet, an inquest has found. Daniel Batchelor, 36, suffered a number of serious injuries when he fell off a ladder in 2011 and was forced to have his lower right leg amputated. But he struggled to deal with the pain he experienced after the accident and was allergic to the opiate-based medicines that are usually prescribed. Desperate to relieve his pain, he decided to buy a drug called Methoxetamine online. Daniel Batchelor (pictured with his son, Alfie), 36, died of an accidental drug overdose after taking painkillers he bought on the internet. He struggled to deal with his pain after losing one of his legs in an accident at work . The father-of-one was found unconscious in his bed by his long-term partner Shari Newman in January this year. He had choked on his own vomit which caused his brain to be starved of oxygen. Ms Newman told Dorchester Coroner’s Court this week that her partner had bought the drugs on the internet. However, he suffered short-term memory problems after the accident and, as a result, took too much of the painkiller. Sheriff Payne, the coroner, said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Batchelor had taken the drugs with the intention of ending his life and said it was another episode of the father trying to get pain relief and misjudging the amount he was taking. Recording a . narrative verdict, he said: ‘Daniel died as a consequence of excess . drugs but taken with probable intent to relieve him from pain.’ Ms Newman, 35, has now called for more to be done to raise awareness of the dangers of the ‘easily accessible drugs’. She . said: ‘We are still desperately struggling to come to terms with . Daniel’s death - it is hard to believe he’s not coming back. Mr Batchelor (pictured with Alfie) also suffered head injuries in the accident which left him with short-term memory loss. It is believed this caused him to accidentally take too many doses of the painkiller . ‘He knew he was lucky to be alive after the fall and wanted to have a good quality of life and provide for me and Alfie. ‘He chose to have the amputation as he knew it would mean less infection and hospital appointments. ‘But he struggled to manage his pain due to his allergy and it was very hard watching him suffer. I’ll never forget finding him in bed and feeling so helpless as I knew he had gone. ‘These . drugs should not be available over the internet and more should be done . to raise awareness of the huge risks that come with taking them. ‘Anyone can buy them which is very worrying and it is clear more needs to be done to regulate this industry. ‘I . also hope that by speaking out it raises awareness of the importance of . employers protecting their staff, particularly when they are expected . to work at height. ‘Companies have a duty to provide . thorough training and appropriate work equipment, which was something . Daniel was very passionate about following his injuries, and I’m . determined to spread the message far and wide - it’s what he would have . wanted.’ Mr Batchelor (pictured with Alfie) died as a result of choking on his own vomit causing his brain to be starved of oxygen . Mr Batchelor, from Weymouth, was working as a cable fitter when he fell off a ladder in 2011. Lawyers at Irwin Mitchell found he was given a ladder to carry out his work despite it being inappropriate for the task. It collapsed under him, sending him plunging more than 12 feet onto the concrete ground below. He was rushed to Peterborough Hospital by air ambulance and he underwent a total of seven operations to pin and fix his broken bones which included fractures to his arm, wrist, shin and ankle as well as a head injury. His right forearm had been shattered and a plate was inserted from his wrist to his elbow. He also developed compartment syndrome - when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels causing paralysis and infection - in his leg and made the decision last year to undergo an amputation below the knee. Mr Batchelor’s death came just days before a meeting was due with his former employers where it was hoped a settlement would be agreed to allow for aids and equipment, future rehabilitation and care. The family is still seeking a settlement for his son, two-year-old Alfie. Natasha Fairs, from Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘This is a tragic case. Daniel was desperate to get his life back on track and plan his future with Shari and Alfie, who he was desperate to provide for after being in hospital for much of the first few months of Alfie’s early life for ongoing treatment. ‘He went through a very painful and difficult time and showed remarkable strength when faced with the life changing decision as to whether to have an amputation. ‘However, sadly the pain caused by his injuries proved too much to bear and the only relief Daniel could find was from drugs he bought over the internet as he was allergic to opiates. ‘Now Shari must bring up Alfie alone and has many questions about whether more could have been done to help Daniel. ‘Despite legislation to protect employees who have to work at heights during the course of their job, accidents are still regularly occurring resulting in often devastating consequences. ‘Greater training and maintenance of equipment will help to combat this and we urge companies to learn lessons from what happened to Daniel to prevent similar incidents from happening again.’","Daniel Batchelor, 36, fell off a ladder in 2011 and suffered multiple injuries .

"By . Associated Press . A growing number of American homes are keeping African pygmy hedgehogs as pets. Here are some questions and answers about the small animals whose backs and sides are covered with about 6,000 quills that are considerably shorter, but harder and sharper, than those of a porcupine. Furry friend: Hedgehogs, like this one bred in Massachusetts, are growing in popularity as household pets . WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? The breed is a hybrid of the four-toed hedgehog or African white-bellied hedgehog and the Algerian hedgehog. The scientific name is Atelerix albiventris. Its natural habitat is central, eastern and southern Africa. It is now illegal to import them into the United States, meaning the current breeding stock cannot be expanded. Bristly: Hedgehogs weigh one to two pounds and are covered in tiny quills, with a soft, fur underbelly . WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE? An adult African pygmy hedgehog is six to 11 inches long and weighs one to two pounds. A relaxed one is generally oval, with a very short tail and short limbs that keep the body close to the ground. When threatened or disturbed, it contracts a series of muscles, rolls into a ball and forces its quills out in all directions. Female hedgehogs are slightly larger than males. The face and underside are covered with a soft, white fur. Ready to play: While cartoons depict hedgehogs as constantly rolled in a ball, the animals are typically oval-shaped until they feel threatened . WHAT DO THEY EAT? In the wild, the hedgehog feeds mainly on insects. It also eats earthworms, snails and slugs, as well as small snakes and frogs. Pet owners feed cat food to domesticated hedgehogs. Feeding frenzy? While hedgehogs eat worms in the wild, domesticated ones are free to eat cat food . HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE ONE? Their gestation period is about 35 days. Hedgehogs are born in litters of two to ten, each bearing soft white quills that do not injure the mother during birth. The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires anyone breeding at least three hedgehogs to get a license.","It is now illegal to import them into the United States, meaning the current breeding stock cannot be expanded ."
"By . Sophie Borland . Doctors have admitted they are  doling out antidepressants too freely as figures show a huge variation in prescription rates across the country. Overall the numbers of prescribed pills have more than trebled since 1998 – from 15million to 50million. But this varies in different areas, ranging from 71 items per 1,000 patients in Brent, North London, to 331 per 1,000 in Blackpool. Overall the numbers of prescribed pills have more than trebled since 1998 ¿ from 15million to 50million - and now a top GP has said the trend must stop . Dr Des Spence, a senior GP who writes for the British Medical Journal, said: ‘We do over-prescribe. 'There needs to be a recognition among doctors that this is a problem because there is a lot of denial. ‘We’ve got into this mindset that depression is a chemical imbalance and that giving a tablet is going to make it better.’ Although Dr Spence practises in Glasgow, he said the issue was a ‘huge problem’ in England. He blamed drug firms for pushing their products on GPs, saying: ‘The pharma companies have had a very negative impact and are a major force on the prescribing.’ The figures, which emerged in a report from the Nuffield Trust think-tank, also showed prescriptions for antidepressants increased at the fastest rate during the economic downturn between 2008 and 2012. Over this four-year period they rose by an average of 8.5 per cent annually, compared to 6.7 per cent between 1998 and 2008. Soaring numbers of antidepressants were dished out as the financial crisis took hold, with Blackpool, East Anglia and the north of England suffering the most . Experts claim this is because higher numbers of patients are diagnosed with depression after traumatic events such as losing their jobs or running up debts. But the number of prescriptions has risen at a much faster pace than the number of patients being diagnosed with the condition – implying pills could be being handed out too freely. Between 2008 and 2012, while antidepressant prescriptions rose by 8.5 per cent, cases of depression increased by only 3.8 per cent. Prescription rates were highest among young female family doctors, the report found. Professor Nick Barber, director of research at the Health Foundation, which was also involved in the study, said: ‘The report clearly shows a significant increase in antidepressant prescriptions. ‘A crucial finding for doctors and patients to consider is that there is real variation in prescription rates across GP practices. ‘These differences imply that certain practices have a propensity to over- or under-prescribe. This could suggest that not enough attention has been given to individual patients’ needs, including the need to avoid possible side effects of these medicines.’ Isabella Goldie, of the Mental Health Foundation, said: ‘In the brief time that is allocated for [GP] appointments, medication can seem like the only realistic option. ‘Although we are very supportive of the progress made to increase access to psychological therapies, for those patients who are living increasingly difficult lives, it can be challenging to find the energy to engage with a programme of therapy.’ The most commonly-used antidepressants are Prozac and Seroxat, which work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain. Possible side effects can include anxiousness, nausea, dizziness and headaches, although these are less common in newer types of medication.","Prominent GP Des Spence said: 'We do over-prescribe'

"By . Chris Pleasance . More than one in ten of the world's overweight people live in America, a larger amount than any other country, and almost the same as China and India combined . The U.S. is home to more than one in ten of the world's overweight and obese people, a study has shown. Around 13 per cent of the world's fat population live in America, more than any other country. The figures is almost the same as China and India combined, which totals 15 per cent of overweight people. The study also showed that 2billion people - a third of the world's population - are now too heavy. Data also revealed that every country has seen waistlines expand in the last 30 years. The highest rates were in the Middle East and North Africa, where nearly 60 percent of men and 65 percent of women are heavy. 'It's pretty grim,' said Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who led the study. He and colleagues reviewed more than 1,700 studies covering 188 countries from 1980 to 2013. 'When we realized that not a single country has had a significant decline in obesity, that tells you how hard a challenge this is.' Murray said there was a strong link between income and obesity; as people get richer, their waistlines also tend to start bulging. He said scientists have noticed accompanying spikes in diabetes and that rates of cancers linked to weight, like pancreatic cancer, are also rising. The new report was paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and published online Thursday in the journal, Lancet. Last week, the World Health Organization established a high-level commission tasked with ending childhood obesity. 'Our children are getting fatter,' Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO's director-general, said bluntly during a speech at the agency's annual meeting in Geneva. 'Parts of the world are quite literally eating themselves to death.' Earlier this year, WHO said that no more than 5 per cent of your daily calories should come from sugar. 'Modernization has not been good for health,' said Syed Shah, an obesity expert at United Arab Emirates University, who found obesity rates have jumped five times in the last 20 years even in a handful of remote Himalayan villages in Pakistan. His research was presented this week at a conference in Bulgaria. 'Years ago, people had to walk for hours if they wanted to make a phone call,' he said. 'Now everyone has a cellphone.' Globally there are around 2billion overweight people, a third of the world's population, with every country seeing waistlines expand over the last 30 years . Shah also said the villagers no longer have to rely on their own farms for food. 'There . are roads for (companies) to bring in their processed foods and the . people don't have to slaughter their own animals for meat and oil,' he . said. 'No one knew about Coke and Pepsi 20 years ago. Now it's . everywhere.' The report . from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, . published in The Lancet, says there has been an increase in obese . children in developed countries. But the rise in adult obesity has slowed down. ‘In developed countries, peak prevalence of obesity is moving to younger ages,’ says the report. ‘Evidence . of a slowdown in the rate of increase of overweight and obesity in the . developed world provides some hope that the epidemic might have peaked . in developed countries.’ But . obesity remains a ‘major global health challenge,’ the report adds, . with no national success  stories reported over the past  three decades. The UK and Australia have seen large . rises in obesity during this period. However, the US tops the global . league table, containing 13 per cent of the world’s obese people. John Newton, chief knowledge officer at the government agency Public Health England, said that the ‘worrying’ prevalence of obesity among British girls was partly due to peer pressure to eat fast food. He told The Times: ‘We have to look at the environment in which people are living, and the constant pressure to eat unhealthy food means things are particularly a problem for girls more than boys.’","Study revealed 13 per cent of overweight and obese people live in U.S.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Within the next decade, the online video market as we know it could be turned on its head with no more adverts, no more channels, and no more menus. That’s according to Netflix’s chief product officer Neil Hunt who made the statements at the Internet Week event in New York. He predicts that by ‘2025 or sooner’ services such as his own, will have mastered personalisation to the point where sites know what users want to watch before they sign in. Netflix's chief product officer Neil Hunt predicts that within the next decade, grid-style menus of titles will be replaced by highly personalised choices, including guessing what viewers will want before they sign in. Hunt also claims standard channels will be replaced by a 'different channel' for each of its 50 million subscribers . In April, Netflix signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the U.S. to become a regular TV channel. The agreements with Atlantic Broadband, RCN Telecom Services and Grande Communications gives the internet streaming site's subscription service a channel on TiVo boxes that the companies provide their customers. It debuted on Atlantic and RCN before expanding on to Grande's service at the end of April. And everyone will get their own, dedicated channel. ‘Our vision is, you won’t see a grid and you won’t see a sea of titles,’ said Hunt. Instead, Netflix will show viewers up to four TV shows or films it thinks they will want to watch, based on previous shows, the time of day, the day of the week, and more. By linking to social networks, Netflix could even learn a viewer’s mood based on their most recent posts, or suggest films following a change in relationship status. However, this is still a little way off as Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings admitted at today's Recode Conference that only 'a few people' are sharing Netflix views on Facebook, but 'auto-sharing hasn’t yet panned out.' In terms of channels, Hunt believes that as personalisation improves, fewer people will watch standard channels created by networks. Hunt, pictured, made the comments at the Internet Week event in New York. He said that adverts in online videos could be ditched completely, and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods. Alternatively, there could be fewer, but more personalised and targeted adverts . By linking to social networks, Netflix could learn a viewer's mood based on their most recent posts, or suggest shows, such as its own House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey, pictured, based on political beliefs. In terms of channels, Hunt believes as personalisation improves, fewer people will watch standard channels . Instead, each Netflix subscriber - which at the end of April was approaching 50 million - would be served an individual channel, built specifically for them. Hunt also said that adverts could be ditched completely following customer feedback, and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods. Alternatively, there could be fewer, but more personalised and targeted adverts that generate the best conversion. When asked about the controversial topic of internet fast lanes for web traffic, Hunt said Netflix was in support of net neutrality. He added Netflix should be the leading provider because it offers the best service, not because it can afford to pay for faster access. At today's event, Hastings said net neutrality wouldn’t be an issue if cable companies had competition for internet in the home. Until 2010, AT&T and Verizon invested tens of billions of dollars to compete with cable, but ended the project when they admitted they couldn't compete. Hastings added he is concerned cable operators will begin raising the prices for services such as Netflix, and this could impact on the prices they charge.","Neil Hunt made the claims at the Internet Week event in New York .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A trip down to the local video, and more recently DVD, store has become a thing of the past thanks to the rise of video streaming services. Companies including Netflix and LoveFilm let viewers indulge in back-to-back episodes of hit TV series at the click of a button. Now, a new study has shown that streaming can be much better for the environment, requiring less energy and emitting less carbon dioxide (CO2) than some traditional methods of DVD renting, buying and viewing. New research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters suggests that it would be more 'green' to scrap DVDs in favour of using streaming services. This is for two reasons, one that DVD players use more energy than comparable streaming services and also that people sometimes have to drive to buy or rent DVDs . The researchers, who published their study today in the journal Environmental Research Letters, cite modern devices such as laptops and tablets as the reason for this improvement. This is because they are much more efficient than older, energy-sapping DVD players. Furthermore, the driving that is required to go and buy, or rent, DVDs makes this method much more energy- and carbon-intensive. Netflix has signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the US to become a regular TV channel. The . agreements with Atlantic Broadband, RCN Telecom Services and Grande . Communications gives the internet streaming site's subscription service a . channel on TiVo boxes that the companies provide their customers. It debuted on Atlantic and RCN in late April and is now expanding on to Grande's service. A significant proportion of the energy consumption and carbon emissions for streaming comes from the transmission of data, which increases drastically when more complex, high-definition content is streamed. The study was carried out by researchers from Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in California and Northwestern University in Chicago. They estimated that if all DVD viewing in the US was shifted to streaming services in 2011, around 2 billion kg of CO2 emissions could have been avoided and around 30 petajoules (PJ) of energy saved. That's the equivalent of the amount of electricity needed to meet the demands of 200,000 US households. They estimated that in 2011, 192 PJ of energy was used, and 10.4 billion kg of CO2 emitted, for all methods of DVD consumption and streaming in the US. From this, they calculated that one hour of video streaming requires 7.9 megajoules (MJ) of energy, compared to as much as 12 MJ for traditional DVD viewing, and emits 0.4 kilograms (0.9 pounds) of CO2, compared to as much as 0.71 kg (1.6 pounds) of CO2 for DVD viewing. Video streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube, Vimeo and Hulu have risen hugely in popularity in the last few years and have successfully dented the sales of DVDs - but the researchers say it might be time to scrap the format completely . To arrive at their results, the researchers compared video streaming with four different types of DVD consumerism: DVDs that are rented from online mailers; DVDs that are rented from a store; DVDs that are purchased online; and DVDs that are bought from a store. Video streaming was limited to TV and movies and did not include shorter videos that are streamed online through YouTube, Vimeo and so on. They found that video streaming and the online rental of DVDs required similar amounts of energy; however, the renting and purchasing of DVDs from a store were much more energy intensive, due to the impact of driving. 'It's a modern-day equivalent of the debate about which is more environmentally sound - the disposable or the cloth diaper,' says Lead author of the research Arman Shehabi from Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory. 'Our study suggests that equipment designers and policy makers should focus on improving the efficiency of end-user devices and network transmission energy to curb the energy use from future increases in video streaming. 'Such efficiency improvements will be particularly important in the near future, when society is expected to consume far greater quantities of streaming video content compared to today.'","Scientists say that using streaming services is better for the environment .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google is considering buying home security camera firm Dropcam, it has been claimed. The firm sells a $150 internet connected camera that is controlled through an app. It is believed the search giant hopes to expand its home automation products after recently buying thermostat company Nest. Scroll down for video . The $149 Dropcam: Google is considering buying the firm behind the internet-connected webcam, it has been claimed. Dropcam is a cloud-based Wi-Fi video monitoring service with free live streaming, two-way talk and remote viewing. Using a special app, users can see live feeds, zoom and record footage. It also has a night vision mode, two-way talk back, and digital zoom. According to tech blog The Information, 'Google’s Nest division is plotting a move into the home-security market and has considered acquiring connected camera-maker Dropcam to accelerate the push, according to several people close to Google.' Dropcam last year raised raised $30 million in funding for its cameras. The camera has email and smartphone alerts, and the company says it uses bank-level security to encrypt all video. The $149 Dropcam HD includes full 720p streaming, night vision, two-way talk back, and digital zoom, and with the optional cloud recording customers can access stored footage of the past seven or thirty days. 'With a Dropcam Wi-Fi video monitoring camera and optional cloud recording service you can remotely drop in on your house, baby, pets, business, or anything else from a smartphone, tablet, or computer,' the firm says. San Francisco-based Dropcam was founded in 2009 by Greg Duffy and Aamir Virani, and also offers a $199 Dropcam pro with beeter image quality and a larger field of view. The camera is controlled from a special app which can show live footage as well as zoom in on areas and show a night vision view. The move comes as  Apple is preparing to turn the iPad into a universal 'home remote' that could control everything from TVs to washing machines and lights, it has been claimed. The project is set to be unveiled alongside an entirely new version of Apple's iPhone and iPad software at its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco next week, according to the FT. An Apple patent published in November last year gave the first hints of the system, showing a system that automatically turned on lights when a user comes home. It is believed the firm is already working with home automation firms to ensure their gadgets work with the app. The firm already sells home automation gadgets in its stores, including including arch rival Google's Nest thermostats, Dropcam wireless cameras, Philips Hue lightbulbs and Belkin WeMo switches. The firm is also expected to unveil a major overhaul of both its iPhone and Mac software at the event. One improvement is believed to be giving the iPad a new split screen mode so users can run two apps at once, it has been claimed. The move will be a major change to the way the iPad handles multiple applications. However, the tablet will not be the first with the feature - and Microsoft even made the iPad's lack of split screen functionality the subject of a recent ad. 'iOS 8 is likely to supercharge the functionality of Apple’s iPad with a new split-screen multitasking feature, according to sources with knowledge of the enhancement in development,' claims the blog 9to5Mac. Set to be called Healthbook  the app is expected to be included in a new version of Apple's iOS software that will launch alongside its health-tracking wristband. 'These people say that the feature will allow iPad users to run and interact with two iPad applications at once.' Current users can swap between apps, but can only see one on screen at a time. The new feature is also likely to enable users to drag information - text or pictures, for example, between apps. The blog also claims the feature may also be key to a larger-screened iPad, which Apple is actively developing for a launch either later this year or in 2015. Apple is also expected to unveil a major new app for the iPhone and iPad aimed at collecting health data at the conference - as well as possibly unveiling Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine as its latest employees if the much rumoured acquisition of Beats goes head. Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled in June at Apple's annual developer conference. It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk. The app is set to work with Apple's iWatch, which is believed to be set to be announced later in the year - although it could be unveiled at the same event next year. Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours .","Claims search giant could buy maker of $150 home CCTV system .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Samsung is due to release a smartwatch that can send texts and make calls without having to sync to a smartphone. The South Korean company plans to unveil the smartwatch over the next few months in a bid to take a larger slice of the wearable technology market. The unnamed smartwatch will be able to take photos, send emails, monitor the wearer’s heart rate and use GPS tracking, according to sources close to the company. Scroll down for video . A smartwatch design patent, which may be related to Samsung’s standalone phone-watch, has also been published by United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).The patent suggests Samsung's new smartwatch will have a round face resembling Motorola's Android Wear powered Moto 360 . Samsung has declined to say what the device will be called, how much it will cost or whether a user will make calls by holding the watch close to his or her mouth. But the group is currently in talks with carriers in the U.S., South Korea and Europe about its plans, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices. The reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches. Engadget added the headset is also likely to connect to a phone or tablet using wires, to prevent a lag when playing games. The release date, price and other features were not revealed, but it does differ from the rumoured Galaxy Glass project, first reported on in October. Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, particularly in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR. Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $2 billion.

"By . Gary Edwards . Sitting at the desk in Rudyard Kipling’s old wood-panelled study, it’s easy to see why the world-renowned author was so enamoured of The Elms, his home in the coastal East Sussex village  of Rottingdean, where he wrote his Just So stories. For the view from the  bow windows – featuring the village green and pond, as well as the flint walls of the cosy Plough Inn and the old blacksmith’s in the distance – is just so English. A portrait of Kipling sitting here, surveying a scene that has barely changed in more than 100 years, now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. So charming: The Elms, Rudyard Kipling's £1.45million home in the coastal East Sussex village of Rottingdean, is where he wrote his Just So stories . One can imagine him twirling his famous moustache and seeking inspiration for his novel Stalky & Co and poem The White Man’s Burden, which he also wrote here. If that failed, a walk up to the first and second floors reveals views that take in a windmill, the 13th Century St Margaret’s Church across the road, the South Downs and the twinkling English Channel. Kipling, also author of The Jungle Book, rented the house for three guineas a week from 1897 to 1902 after discovering Rottingdean when he stayed with his aunt Georgiana. She was married to the pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones, who lived on the other side of the green. In his autobiography, Something Of Myself, Kipling says of The Elms: ‘It stood in a sort of little island behind flint walls which we then thought high enough, and almost beneath some big ilex trees. It was small, none too well built, but cheap, and so suited us.’ Impressive: The double-fronted home that has five bedrooms, three reception rooms and three bathrooms . In the same tome he remembers his time in Rottingdean – with his wife Carrie and daughters Josephine and Ellie – as a tranquil period in his life. ‘Beyond turning out at 2am to help a silly foxhound puppy who had stuck in a drain, I do not remember any violent alarms and excursions other than packing farm-carts filled with babies and despatching them into the safe, clean heart of the motherly Downs for jam-smeared picnics.’ Indeed, he only decided to move on when the owner of a hotel on the seafront organised buses to bring people out from Brighton to gawp at the home of, at the time, one of the most famous people in the country. That, and the fact that, when he enquired about buying the property, the owner, a Mr AHA Bliss, quoted a price so outrageous that Kipling responded: ‘Obviously you think that there is a goldmine under the green.’ Kipling instead sought peace in the East Sussex countryside at Burwash, where his magnificent former residence Bateman’s  is now open to the public through the  National Trust. Famous resident: Rudyard Kipling rented The Elms for three guineas a week from 1897 to 1902 . Still tucked behind those same high flint walls, the Rottingdean house, which dates back to 1745, is now an imposing double-fronted home that has five bedrooms, three reception rooms and three bathrooms, and is on the market for £1.45 million. The present owners, Frank and Marnya Wenstrom, both in their 70s, bought the Grade II listed property from the daughter of the writer Enid Bagnold in 1978. Enid was the author of National Velvet, which was made into a movie starring a young Elizabeth Taylor, and the play The Chalk Garden. She was also Samantha Cameron’s great-grandmother. But by the time the Wenstroms arrived, the house was in a sorry state. ‘It was a total wreck,’ says Frank, a retired manufacturer of hotel interiors. ‘Everything was taken back and rebuilt. We didn’t move in for two years and lived nearby in Brighton while the work was carried out.’ An impressive hallway now leads to a new kitchen with oak floor, and large bay window doors open out on to a patio and side garden. There’s a dining room off the kitchen, a lounge, Kipling’s former study of course, and stairs down to the large cellar rooms. On the first floor a large drawing room overlooks the green, there’s a master bedroom with en suite bathroom and a dressing area that overlooks the garden, and a second large bedroom. The top floor is home to three further bedrooms. The Wenstroms, who have two grown-up daughters and a son, might be selling the house, but they are not leaving Rottingdean. Ingeniously, they have built on top of the old cellar at the back of the house and incorporated the old maid’s quarters to create a new two-bedroom cottage for themselves. ‘We love the area. Our children grew up here and have moved on so we no longer needed the space, but we never had any intention of moving away,’ says Frank. ‘Rottingdean has everything – pubs, restaurants, shops and its own beach – and Brighton, with its 50-minute train service to London, is just three miles away.’ By coincidence, the house owned by Kipling’s uncle and aunt is also on the market – with an asking price of £675,000. The four-storey, three-bedroom Grade II listed Prospect Cottage – last sold for £499,950 in 2008 – is a blue-plaque house like The Elms. Two historic houses for sale opposite each other, separated by a quintessentially English village green. Just so...

"By . Victoria Woollaston . There is already a 3D printer that creates pancakes, so the next logical step is to top these breakfast items with your very own 3D printed fruit. A Cambridge firm has created a device that uses a culinary technique known as spherification to build replica raspberries and blackcurrants using flavoured gel. The droplets of gel are placed into a dish of solution, and positioned in such a way to mimic the shape and colour of various fruits, which are then spooned out of the dish and are instantly edible.

A Cambridge firm has created a device that uses a culinary technique known as spherification to build pieces of fruit using flavoured gel.  Droplets of gel are dropped into a dish of solution, pictured, and positioned in such a way to mimic the shape and colour of various fruits . Spherification is a technique used in cooking to shape liquids into spheres, designed to look like caviar. For flavoured liquids, including fruit juices that don’t contain any calcium, the liquid is mixed with powdered sodium alginate, then dripped into a bowl of cold calcium chloride or another soluble calcium salt. Each drop of the alginated liquid forms into a small sphere in the calcium solution. The solution reacts with the aginate to create an outer layer of thin, flexible skin. The printer was created by designers at firm Dovetailed, and is aimed at chefs and foodies. It was revealed at the Tech Food Hack event earlier this week, organised by Microsoft Research Cambridge.

"By . Bianca London . With their washboard abs, toned legs and defined arms, Nicole Scherzinger and Suki Waterhouse possess bodies that most of us wouldn't mind having. Now FEMAIL can reveal exactly how Nicole and Suki achieve their honed physiques - and it takes hard work, intense training sessions and a lot of willpower to look this good. The singer and model are both huge fans of the Viking Method, an intense training programme based on the lifestyle of the Icelandic people that promises to teach you how to 'train like professionals, eat like nutritionists and sleep like babies.' Scroll down for video . Their secret is out! Nicole Scherzinger, left, and supermodel Suki, right, follow The Viking Method, which is based on the training programmes followed by the people of Iceland . 'Icelandic men have won the world's strongest man competition more often than any other nation and the Icelandic women are considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world,' says founder Svava Sigbertsdottir, who just so happens to be from Iceland. 'Surviving centuries of isolation, cold, enormous volcanic eruptions and hardship, the Icelanders carry within their genes the toughness to endure anything they are faced with. 'The harder the work, the more they get out of it. And this is shown in their mentality when it comes to fitness. Indoor mixed with outdoor training. Even in the snow. We push ourselves and never give up.' The programme trains clients based on this philosophy and shocks the body's metabolism into burning fat with interval and different HIT (high-intensity training) techniques such as kick-boxing, crawling and leap frogs. Brains behind the brand: Svava Sigbertsdottir, 33, created the method based on her hometown of Iceland, where, she says, they push themselves to their limits and even train in the snow . 'I teach my clients to use their bodies as much as they can. These methods utilise oxygen and energy for fat burning,' said 33-year-old Svava, who moved to London ten years ago to undertake a dance degree. It is designed to strip fat, increase performance, agility, power, speed and create a long, lean athletic physique - as showcased by Nicole and Suki. When Nicole was in the UK for X Factor, Svava trained her three to four times a week and sees Suki three times a week. Svava offers a £200 online nine-week intense training programme - perfect for getting in shape for a holiday - or an online training portal for £120 a month. Speaking about the regime, Nicole said: . 'I love Svava’s technique. With me, she does a combination of her . functional training, martial arts and ballet isolation exercises. In all . my years of training, the Viking Method is unlike anything I have ever . done.' Speaking about 21-year-old model Suki, Svava said: 'My regime is perfect for Suki because she is cool with falling on the grass and getting mud on her face.' Speaking about the diet aspect of her regime, which she tailors to each individual clients, Svava added: 'It is drinking loads of water. It is eating the good protein, the healthy fat and fibre. It is eating buckets of fresh vegetables and fruit. 'It's all about your hormones and balancing your insulin levels. Optimum hormonal balance is crucial for a healthy person and for weight loss. Keeping them in shape: When Nicole, left, was in the UK for X Factor, Svava trained her three to four times a week and sees Suki three times a week . 'We all have six fat-burning hormones and three fat-storing hormones. If any of the fat-storing hormones are activated, none of the fat-burning hormones will work. So if you eat certain things at certain times of the day or close to training, you cannot burn fat. 'My method's diet is all about blocking the fat-storing and activating the fat-burning hormones and keeping the body working at a perfect state. 'Most of all, it is about feeling good. I help create a body that's more like a fantastic machine.' Hard work: Svava teaches her clients to use their body as much as they can. These methods, such as pushing your partner along the floor on a towel, utilise oxygen and energy for fat burning .

Amber Jacobs, 30, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, gained weight when pregnant with her daughter, reaching 13st 2lb two months after giving birth, and was desperate to shed the pounds before she tied the knot. Having tried numerous fad diets throughout her life, Amber decided to try a new - and unusual - method. The app she chose uses mental training to reduce the amount you want to eat. Scroll down for video . Amber lost 4st, dropping from 13st 2lb (left) to 8st 13lbs (right) for her wedding day . 'I've always had a big appetite and portion control was a big problem . from me,' she explains. 'I learned a lot of bad habits from my mother, who has also been a yo-yo dieter. 'When I was pregnant ""eating for two"" was a big thing and then when I was alone at home with my daughter I would graze.' Amber's motivation to tackle her weight came, in addition to wanting to look good for her wedding, from her grandmother Sandra who passed away a month before the birth of her daughter. 'She was a very special woman to me and before she died said: ""Do the most you can for your daughter and be there for her."" 'I promised her I would sort myself out,' she says. Realising that traditional diet regimes were not going to work for her, Amber was inspired by a session of hypnotherapy she had in her youth to tackle low self-esteem. She searched online and came across a £4.99 hypno-app which promised that it could help her to tackle the reasons she overate. Amber says: ‘I started using the app in January 2013, two months after having my daughter and after the Christmas break was over. ‘I felt enormous pressure to lose the baby weight and also to look good for the wedding. I wanted to do it for me but comments from the family also spurred me on. ‘I've tried numerous plans over the years. As soon as I thought I was putting on weight I'd try a fad diet and always ended up losing the weight then putting double on. I couldn't maintain it. I'm a petite person so a little weight really shows. ‘They all worked in the short term but I found when I'm not allowed something I want it even more and found them unsustainable or eating more because I still had 'points/sins' left.’ Amber used to struggle with portion control and grazed a lot when at home (left) but found hypnosis helped her to change her eating habits so she only eats when she is hungry; Amber pictured after weight loss (right) Rather than banning or restricting certain foods, Amber used the hypnosis and mental training on the Virtual Gastric Band app, which offers a step-by-step hypnotherapy program that guides you to weight loss, to try and turn herself off the unhealthy food, as well as increasing portion control. To her surprise, she found it began to work. ‘I noticed a change very quickly in my eating habits. I have always been conscious of eating healthily but do like my Chinese and Indian takeaways and general junk. ‘I seemed to go off those or choose healthier options from the menu and really cut down my portion sizes. I lost 4lb in the first week and was ecstatic it was working without cutting out a food type.’ Amber dropped from 13st 4lb to a slim 8st 13lb and was able to fit into her dream dress for her Antigua beach wedding . I feel so much better and more confident. I find I'm not in between sizes and more and find it easier to find clothes. I still have body hang-ups but no longer need to hide under baggy or frumpy clothes. 'I also am happy with photos that are taken with my daughter without thinking how awful I look. Amber was desperate to lose weight, having failed at many fad diets in the past . ‘It also made me so much more excited about my wedding! When I went to try on wedding dresses none of them fitted in the shop!  Now I've got my dream dress - but two sizes smaller!' In addition to transforming her body, Amber says the app helped her deal with the challenges of having a young child by keeping her calm and well rested. ‘I found that listening to the hypnosis calmed me down and made me focus on myself. It gave me a positive outlook and relaxed me. ‘I found I wasn't sleeping well with a new-born and all thoughts to do with wedding plans and the hypnosis just helped me 'zone out' and achieve a healthy night’s sleep. ‘It also helped me de-stress when my daughter went down for a nap. It has done wonders for me and my self-esteem, I'm proud that I did this myself without effort.’","Amber dropped from 13st 2lb to a trim 8st 13lb using a hypnosis app .

It took Graham Hughes nearly four years to cover 160,000 miles in 1,426 days - and he filmed a selfie video every step of the way. The 33-year-old from Liverpool used . buses, taxis, trains and his own two feet to become the first person in the world to carry out the trip. Scroll down for videos... Official certificate: Graham Hughes celebrates setting the record for the fastest man to visit 201 countries without flying . Record: Hughes' trip around the world has been edited into four short minutes - starting with Brazil . Long way round: His mission began in South America, taking in Guyana along the way . After a year of deliberation and examination, for which officials had to check through 1,000,000 GPS data points, 10,000 photos, 400 hours of video and 192 passport pages, Guinness World Records has finally validated the records. And Hughes was presented with a certificate announcing him as setting the record for the 'fastest time to visit all countries by public surface transport' - taking four years and 31 days. In a video on YouTube, Hughes, who visited 197 UN member states and 20 that are not, said: 'I've just been given my world record certificate. I've had to wait 14 months for my record to be accredited. 'But here it is. So we've brought my friends and family who helped me along the way to help me celebrate the fact I am, and always will be, the first person to visit every country in the world without flying.' A whistlestop visit to Guinea-Bissau happened on his way from The Gambia to Senegal, where he made it through four African countries in one day . The Liverpudlian adventurer filmed himself in front of the sign marking the Zimbabwean border . The 1,426-day journey started in Uruguay and ended with its 201st nation, South Sudan . Hughes filmed his travels, which he . carried out on a shoestring budget of just £65 a week, for a documentary . after setting off from his hometown on New Year's Day 2009. By . December 2012, he crossed the border into the newly-created South Sudan . and cracked open the champagne to celebrate completing his mission. Hughes edited days of footage into a whirlwind tour of the globe, taking in one nation every second. The video sees him posing in the sunshine of South America and the Caribbean, wrapped up warm in Canada, and even pretending to be under arrest by locals in the South Pacific island of Vanuatu. Despite going off the typical backpacker's trail for much of his trip, Hughes still found time to fit in a wonder of the world by visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt . In Bangladesh, Hughes proved he was really there by holding up local currency . Without planes, some of the nations were harder to reach than others - but not the ones you might expect. Hughes said it was easier . to get into North Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan than it was to reach . remote islands such as Nauru in the South Pacific, the Maldives and the . Seychelles. It took seven attempts to get into the Seychelles because of the threat from Somali pirates. He mainly crossed the seas by hitching lifts with cargo ships but struck lucky on the way to the Dominican Republic when a cruise ship let him come aboard. Hughes also shows himself receiving a warm welcome in the Pacific island nation Vanuatu . The end! South Sudan didn't exist as a country when Graham Hughes set off in January 2009, but he crossed its border in December last year and toasted the end of his challenge . His favourite place was Palau, an island state in the Western Pacific. Marco Frigatti, Senior Vice President, Records Management Team, Guinness World Records, said: 'I can’t remember a more absorbing record to verify in recent years, it took a lot of effort and time to authenticate. 'Graham’s achievement is astonishing, though, and it’s a pleasure to recognise his new Guinness World Records title.'

"By . Darren Boyle . A top Swedish skier was hit by a baby elk after it smashed through his window together with entrails when the car hit its pregnant mother as he drove in Oestersund in northern Sweden. Jesper Modin said: 'I had just come over a hill and the sun was shining directly in my eyes, I only saw the elk when it was a few metres away and it was standing right in the middle-of-the-road. 'It hit the front of the car and then smashed into the windscreen and then the body of the elk went tumbling over the roof. I was completely covered in glass and the elk's innards.' Jesper Modin's car was badly damaged when an elk ran out in front of his car in Oestersund, Northern Sweden . The heavily pregnant elk smashed the bonnet, windscreen and roof, losing its stomach contents during the impact . Moments after the horrific smash, Mr Modin noticed the elk calf in the passenger's seat, still attached to its mother by its umbilical cord . Miraculously the calf was still alive despite the trauma of the impact . The 25-year-old said that there was so much blood he was convinced he had been badly cut somewhere and had rushed to check himself, but found only a small cut on his hand. The elk however was dead. He said that he had not wanted to look too closely at the bloody mess inside the car but when the pick-up truck arrived to remove the wreckage and remove the body, he said he needed to go inside the vehicle to get some documents from the glove compartment. He said: 'I was about to grab some things from my glove compartment but when I opened the car door, I was shocked to see the was a little baby elk laying there and it was alive. The umbilical cord was still attached. I was so shocked that I slammed the door again. 'I thought to myself, did I really see what I think I saw?' A friend of his arrived seconds later and he decided to check again realised it was an elk calf and it was alive. They realised that Modin hadn't noticed the calf in the immediate aftermath of the crash, which he attributed in part to being in shock and in part to the car's interior being completely covered in guts and glass. When the mother elk collided with the car, her stomach contents had emptied into the car, including her unborn calf. He added: 'People don't believe me when I tell them what happened, they think it's the weirdest thing they've ever heard. But I just show them the pictures.' He called the police, who in turn called in a wildlife expert who decided that the calf would not survive without its mother and killed it. . Mr Modin added: 'It's a tragedy of course, and I wish I could say the elk survived too. But I'm just happy I'm alive, and so grateful to all the people who helped.' Mr Modin said that he wished the calf could have been saved but he was lucky to have been alive himself following the crash .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Rupert Steiner . Struggle: M&S boss Marc Bolland, pictures with Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley, will lose his bonus and so will his staff after a fall in profits for the third year running . Marks & Spencer's army of 65,000 store workers have today all been denied a bonus because profits have fallen for the third year in a row. Chief Executive Marc Bolland has decided that nobody deserved one because the High Street giant's results for the past year were so poor. He will not have a bonus for the first time since taking over in 2010, having received a cash and shares bonus worth £829,000 last year to take his full package to £2.1million a year. This is because annual . profits to the end of March were £623million, down 3.9 per cent from . £665.2million a year earlier. He said: 'No bonuses will be paid out to the whole company. There are no bonuses this year'. The announcement will apply to all . M&S employees from the boardroom to the shop floor, where staff received on average £250 last year. Today's poor results means rival Next has overtaken M&S in terms of earnings for the first time, having recently posted full-year profits of £695million. Experts said today that Bolland's decision to invest millions in new clothing lines modelled by stars like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and David Gandy have failed to connect with shoppers. There have also been complaints by customers about a drop in quality but no drop in price. Mr Bolland said today that after three years of trying to change the business the results showed 'solid progress'. This is despite general merchandise . sales - which includes clothing - seeing like-for-like sales fall by 1.4 per cent, although its food sales were up 1.7 per cent. 'We are making solid progress on this journey and are now focused on delivery,' the chief executive said. However he warned warned that its new website launched earlier this year was taking time to 'settle in', and will have a negative effect on sales figures. M&S shares were down 10p each to £4.40p when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Falling sales: A series of expensive high profile campaigns featuring stars like Ellie Goulding and Helen Mirren has still not led to a rise in clothing sales . Total annual group sales were £10.3billion, with UK revenues of £9.16billion and international revenues of £1.15billion. M&S is ramping up global expansion plans and during the year added 22 new stores overseas, focusing on key markets in India and China. Today's poor results mean M&S' whole management team, from store level to the executive board, will miss out altogether on an annual bonus because Britain’s biggest clothing retailer has not reached the minimum threshold required. The last time no bonus was awarded was in the financial year of 2008. Last year the top team at Marks and Spencer received bonuses to the tune of £3million with Bolland pocketing £829,000 in cash and shares. Bolland has attempted to turn the business around after years of under investment in warehousing and computer systems.","Annual profits down to £623m in 2013/14 from £665.2m a year earlier .

"By . Laura Clark . Glenys Stacey, Chief Executive of Ofqual, said there are different views on whether the AS-Level qualification should be kept . Sweeping reforms to school exams could lead to elite A-levels with a tougher grading scale so universities can identify the brightest pupils. The new-style tests would be given a different set of grades to enable tutors and employers to tell them apart from existing exams. The reforms would effectively create a two-tier system; old-style A-levels and new versions with beefed-up content, a greater emphasis on essay-writing and a strict limit on exam resits. The move comes after the headmaster of a leading public school criticised current tests  as ‘mindless “satnav” A-levels’ that did little to inspire pupils and teachers. The new A-levels would be phased in subject by subject over four years, with traditional disciplines likely to be prioritised. By 2018, all old-style  A-levels would be scrapped. One of the biggest changes in the proposals, unveiled by exams watchdog Ofqual yesterday, is  an overhaul of the current six-point A* to E grading scale. Gradual grade inflation has led some universities to complain they struggle to identify the brightest applicants from an increasingly well-qualified field. Alternative grading systems could involve a mixture of  both marks and grades, with students given percentages alongside an overall grade. However, Ofqual admitted its shake-up would need to ensure there was no discrimination against candidates who had completed their A-levels under the old system. Ofqual said: ‘This consultation provides an opportunity to revisit the grading structure of A-levels. It may be that there  are better ways to support university selection and secure appropriate differentiation.’ A spokesman for the watchdog added: ‘We are asking whether there are enough points on the grading scale to offer appropriate differentiation. ‘With some subjects being reformed before others, we are asking whether there should be a way to differentiate between new A-levels and those done  the old way. Would it be right to expect employers to check which year exams were taken? Should this be clear from the way that the exams are recorded?’ AS-Levels could be scrapped under plans to reform exams . He added that the proposals aimed to ‘increase the currency’ of A-levels and improve them ‘so they are fit for purpose and held in high public regard’. Other reforms under consideration include strict rules on the number and mix of essays, multiple-choice questions and  in-depth research A-levels should contain in order to stop teachers ‘playing the system’ by choosing easy exams. Universities – instead of civil servants – would decide the  content of syllabuses and at least 20 would need to endorse each new qualification before it can be ‘signed off’. The future of AS-levels – which are taken after a year of sixth-form studies and contribute 50 per cent to the overall A-level grade – is also in doubt. If A-levels are retained, the opportunities for resitting exams at a later date to inflate final grades would be slashed. January exam sittings would be axed and teenagers would be given just one chance to retake, the following summer. Ofqual warned that ‘students do not always treat exams  seriously if they know they have the opportunity to resit’. Dr Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College in Berkshire, said: ‘The proposals are a step in the right direction, in that it would be a move away from the mindless “satnav” A-level towards a real test of students’ abilities and the exams would be more likely to inspire challenging and thoughtful teaching.’ However, unions warned against rushing the reforms. Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘It needs to be said that the volume of change in schools at the moment is overwhelming. ‘There is a serious risk that avoidable mistakes will slip in and valuable reforms will be implemented badly in the rush and turbulence.’","Exam regulator announces proposals for new system .

"By . Darren Boyle . The distraught mother of one of the two girls gang raped and hanged in India has refused to accept any compensation from the government and demands her daughter's rapists are sentenced to death. The 38-year-old mother said she wants the dignity of her 15-year-old daughter to be restored. She said: 'Money can't bring back my daughter but the hanging of her killers would give peace to her soul.' Scroll down for video . The 38-year-old mother of one of the victims said she wanted her daughter's killers to be executed . The father of one of the victims said local police were not interested in investigating his daughter's murder because he was from the lowest caste and called on the Indian version of the FBI intercede . Indian police bring one victim's mother to the scene of the rape and murder . The devastated mother said her daughter would have been alive had they not belonged to the lower Dalit caste. Dalits, formerly called untouchables, stay at the bottom of India's tenacious caste system, while the Yadav caste, to which the state chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, belongs is the top caste. The two cousins, aged 14 and 15, went missing from their homes on Tuesday night in a village called Katra, in Badaun district about 180 miles from Lucknow, Eastern India. The father of one of the victims holds an item of clothing belonging to his daughter who was brutally raped and murdered . The girls went into the nearby fields to use as a toilet since their house does not have one. The father of one girl went to police that night to report them missing, but he said they refused to help. Some villagers, who had also gone out to relieve themselves in the fields, found their bodies hanging from a mango tree the next morning. Angry villagers protested the police inaction by refusing to allow the bodies to be cut down from the tree. Hundreds of protestors took to the streets of New Delhi calling for justice for the two girls . The villagers only allowed authorities to take down the corpses after the first arrests were made on Wednesday. A post mortem has confirmed that the girls were raped and died from hanging, police has said. Police arrested a fifth suspect on Saturday. Three others arrested, who are in their 20s belong to the extended family. They have been charged with rape and murder. Two police officers, who are alleged to have taken part in the rape have also been arrested. The state government has ordered that the case be handled by a fast-track court. Babu Ram, 55, the father of the 15-year-old girl said nobody listened to their grievances as they belong to a lower caste. He said: ‘At the police station, the first thing they asked is what caste we came from. And when we told them we were Dalits, they didn’t entertain our complaints.’ He added: ‘When a girl was gang raped in Delhi people took to streets across the country so that justice can be done. But in our case, we haven’t heard of any such protests. Our country can’t be selective. Otherwise there is no hope for justice.’ There are 25,000 rapes reported in India a year but activists fear the figure is far higher as women are afraid to come forward because of fear of retribution . The girls were raped and murdered in the village of Katra, in Uttar Pradesh . Official statistics report that 25,000 rapes are committed every year in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. But activists believe it is even more since women are often pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assaults. The father who reported the girls missing, Sohan Lal, has demanded a federal investigation. 'I don't expect justice from the state government as state police officers shielded the suspects.' Villagers hold a protest beside the tree where they discovered the dead girls' bodies . The mother of one of the girls is escorted to the scene of the brutal crime by police officers . The father of one of the victims has urged authorities to fully investigate the crime . Mr Lal was offered 500,000 rupees compensation to compensate for his daughter's death, worth around £5,000. He said he would not accept any money until the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation - the Indian FBI - took over the case. Ashish Gupta, state inspector-general of police in Uttar Pradesh said on average ten rapes a day were reported in his area. He said 60 percent of these attacks happen when women go into fields near the village as they do not have any toilets at home. Meanwhile on Thursday, police arrested three men who viciously assaulted the mother of a teenage girl who complained that her daughter had been raped. Under Indian law rapists can be jailed for up to 20 years. Protestors across India have taken to the streets in support of the two families . Residents in the village where the two girls were raped and murdered have expressed their outrage over the crime .","Victim's mother rejects £5,000 compensation insisting the rapist-killers should be executed .

"By . Chris Pleasance . An eight-year-old girl has been forced to move schools after a dog that alerts others to signs of her epileptic seizures was banned from the classroom. Kellsey McGuire has to have her dog Jasper with her at all times to help the pair bond and to help warn others of her potentially-lethal seizures. However, Kellsey's mother Brandi says complaints by a member of staff at Sherrard Grade School in Illinois have forced the family to move their daughter to Jordan Catholic, a private school. Scroll down for video . Kellsey McGuire, eight (left), claims she has been forced to move school after her epilepsy dog Jasper (right), who is designed to spot signs of seizures, was banned from the classroom . Kellsey was diagnosed with epilepsy aged 18 months and can have up to 90 potentially fatal seizures a day . The family say Gerrard Grade School should have to pay the new fees as they forced Kellsey to move, while denying her access to her service dog under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Speaking to KWQC, Brandi said: 'It's very important that Jasper's there. He's her furry little angel. He's the one who comes and tells us if she's having a seizure.' The family are now suing Sherrard Grade School, who refused to comment on the issue. Kellsey was diagnosed with epilepsy aged 18 months old, and according to her mother, has suffered up to 90 seizures in a single day. Her seizures can be difficult for other . to spot, and usually involve her staring off into middle distance and . smacking her lips, after which she gets very tired. Kellsey's seizures can be difficult to spot as they usually only involve staring into middle distance and smacking her lips. However, they can cause her to turn blue and have to be rushed to hospital . Kellsey has been taking Jasper to class since January, but on three occasions was told not to bring him. Kellsey's mother, Brandi, says she plans to sue the school . Sherrard Grade School has refused to comment on the reasons behind banning the dog from classes . In order to help strangers spot the signs of danger, and to keep Kellsey safe at night when her parents are asleep, the family applied for a seizure dog in 2011. Eventually they were given Jasper, who has been going into school with Kellsey since January, but on three separate occasions a member of school staff has complained. Made to feel harassed and unwelcome, they took the decision to move Kellsey to another school. Ms. McGuire added: 'If there is anxiety and stress, she can have three to five seizures a week. It wasn't a safe place to be for my daughter.'","Kellsey McGuire was diagnosed with epilepsy aged just 18 months .

"By . Martha De Lacey . They may have only been together for a whirlwind eight months, but Sheena and Gethin knew they were meant to be together forever as soon as their eyes met across the crowded dog show. And their owners knew it too. Now Sheena, a six-year-old German Spitz from Kettering, Northants, has married her toyboy sweetheart Gethin, a one-year-old Pomeranian, in a lavish wedding ceremony costing £500 - savings which came out of her owner Sue Doherty's summer holiday fund. Scroll down for video . Here comes the bride: Gethin, left, the one-year-old Pomeranian, with his bride Sheena, a German Spitz, six, on their wedding day . And although Miss Doherty, 55, and her partner Robert Tyler, 56, usually go to Norfolk every year, this summer they decided to spend the money on a wedding for their beloved pet. Sheena met her new husband, who belongs to Sue Wilding, 63, eight months ago at the weekly dog show both families regularly attend - and the furry friends hit it off straight away. Miss Doherty was thrilled with their relationship, saying 'they share toys and food and always play together so we know they're meant to be together', and spent months planning the nuptials, spending hundreds of pounds on designer dresses, a wedding cake, toys, flowers and food, and hiring a venue for the lavish ceremony. Shop assistant Miss Doherty said: 'It was a very emotional day for us - my little girl is all grown up.'

Cake: £75 . Dresses: £80 . Flowers: £50 . Food (mostly dog biscuits): £150 . TOTAL: £505 . Miss Doherty said: 'It meant we can't afford to go on holiday this year. Normally we go to Norfolk every year but we can't because of the wedding. It was definitely worth it though. Every time anyone talks about it I get a smile on my face.' Speaking about the relationship between the two dogs, retired Mrs Wilding - whose Norfolk Terriers  Darcy, six, and Todd, four, were bridesdog and bestdog - said: 'Now we take them to each others houses to play in the garden as well. 'Sometimes Sheena plays hard to get, but she's only teasing. 'It's just a case of lady and the tramp.' Do you take this dog...

The couple walked down the aisle to I Would Walk 500 Miles by The Proclaimers and Puppy Love by Paul Anka. The guests all patiently waited until the happy couple had said their 'bow vows' before wolfing down the dog biscuit buffet. Mrs Clark read the vows for Sheena and Gethin before the exchanging of the ring toys. Gethin's vows read: 'I promise to bark when you bark, to run to the door when you do. I will share all my toys, treats, bones and bed with you.' And both dogs vowed: 'As our eight paws become four, I will love you now and forever.'

The hand-made outfits cost up to £60 and took around three hours each to make. Mrs Clark, 56, said: 'Pet weddings are becoming increasingly popular. I'm doing more every year. The wedding days are lovely and Sheena and Gethin clearly adore each other.' Wedding planner Matthew Oliver said: 'I've never been asked to do a dog wedding before, but it's mostly the same as a human one. I think I'll stick to people in future though.'

"By . Amanda Williams . A Southern Illinois University student who was found dead in woods earlier this year died of a blunt force head trauma and not hypothermia, a second autopsy has revealed. The family of Pravin Varughese, from Morton Grove ordered a second investigation into the death of the 19-year-old, which discovered 'significant injuries' to his face. Independent forensic pathologist Ben Margolis discovered the sophomore criminal justice major suffered four different blows to the face and head. The family of Pravin Varughese, from Morton Grove ordered a second investigation into the death of the 19-year-old, which discovered 'significant injuries' to his face . He said the injuries could not have been caused by a single impact, such as accidentally falling and striking himself on a tree or rock. An earlier autopsy by the Jackson County coroner’s office said that he died of hypothermia with no evidence of foul play. Pravin had been missing for nearly a week before his body was discovered in February. His body was originally discovered on the morning of February 18 in a wooded area near the Carbondale school. He . had been reported missing after he was last seen leaving a party at . 11pm on February 12 - three miles away from where his body was . discovered. Independent forensic pathologist Ben Margolis also discovered the sophomore criminal justice major suffered four different blows to the face and head . An earlier autopsy by the Jackson County coroner's office said that the teenager (pictured her with two unknown females) died of hypothermia with no evidence of foul play . Carbondale police said he had been dressed in just jeans and a shirt on the night and temperatures had dropped into single digits . They . had said he had fled into the woods after a dispute with a 'recent . acquaintance' who had been giving him a lift - but they added that he . had left the car on his own accord. His mother Lovely Varughese told the Chicago Tribune that she 'knew something was wrong', and added: 'But I didn’t expect it to be this big.' His mother Lovely Varughese is now asking questions into how the authorities handled the investigation into her son's death . She added that the new results had given her the feeling that she was not crazy, and said: 'The instinct as a . mother, and the knowledge as a nurse, I think it paid off.' The . second study of the student's body also revealed injuries to his . forearm, left thigh and bruises and scratches below his knee the . pathologist said. But Margolis did not say how Varughese sustained the head injuries. He will now study initial police and coroner records. He told the paper: 'The cause of death is blunt force injury, but the cause of those injuries is pending further investigation.' Ms Varughese is now asking questions into how the authorities handled the investigation into her son's death. Jackson County coroner’s office had earlier said hypothermia was ruled as the preliminary cause of death, and that he had probably got into difficulty trying to find his way out of the woods. Ms Varughese said she will fight until her last breath to find out what happened to her son.","Pravin Varughese, 18, found in woods in February after going missing .

"By . Damien Gayle . Military-style 'boot camps' are a byword for the extreme fitness regimens that celebrities and the public alike flock to in an effort to shed their wobbly bits. But for all their assault courses, quick marches and rigorous fitness standards, it appears that Britain's soldiers are facing the same obesity crisis as the rest of the country. Scores of soldiers have been booted out of the British Army because they are too fat to fight and hundreds more have been branded unfit, raising fears over their ability to defend out country. Not for fatties: Officer recruits make their way around a Sandhurst assault course. At least 50 soldiers have been booted out of the army in a decade for being obese, while hundreds more have failed fitness tests . Tam Fry, a board member of the National Obesity Forum, described the latest findings 'deeply worrying'. Figures gleaned from the Ministry of Defence thanks to Freedom of Information laws show at least 50 extreme cases where soldiers have been discharged because of obesity between the start of 2002 and March 31 last year. There are concerns the true figure could be even higher, after defence chiefs refused to reveal the data for the past 14 months. A spokesman said the latest information on those released on medical grounds would be made public next month. According to the available data, in 2011 alone 13 soldiers were let go after obesity contributed to their poor health. The figures were published just months after it was revealed Scotland's super regiment is blighted by unfit soldiers. Tired: A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it is a condition of service that all solders are healthy and fitter than the general public . Troops serving with the Royal Regiment of Scotland have failed fitness tests 630 times in the past three years. The Royal Highland Fusiliers were the worst, with soldiers failing tests involving timed runs, press-ups and sit-ups, 170 times. The Black Watch were the next worst affected, with soldiers failing the two-minute tests 120 times. The MoD says troops who fail are told to take more physical training. Only in extreme cases does failure result in discharge from the army. Mr Fry said he feared British troops were facing the same problems as the U.S. military. There, nearly half of all soldiers on active duty are overweight - and 19 per cent obese - according to an official report published last year. He said: 'It should be as concerning to the taxpayer as to the military that British personnel are being discharged because of obesity. 'After news earlier this year that troops of the Royal Regiment of Scotland were branded too unfit to fight the latest discharge figures are deeply worrying. 'The forces have every opportunity to keep their men and women in shape - that's what boot camps are for - but they appear no better than civilian governments in maintaining their population's fitness. 'It should be no comfort to us either that, from figures released this month, the same problem confronts the US military. 'In Washington generals are dubbing the crisis a national emergency.' An MoD spokesman said it is a condition of service all solders are healthy and fitter than the general public. She said: 'Overall obesity levels within the army are consistently lower than in civilian life. All individuals are assessed on their ability to carry out military activities rather than on their weight.'","At least 50 soldiers discharged in a decade for being obese .

"By . Sarah Dean . A Kenyan government official has criticised Australia for installing 'fear and panic' in tourists wishing to travel to the African country as hundreds of Western tourists were being evacuated following a terror attack. Kenya's Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho's outburst came the day before two bomb attacks in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, on Friday. At least 13 people are feared to have died in the blast at Gikomba market. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a stern warning on Monday to tourists visiting Kenya. Terror: People scatter in panic as the twin blasts tear through the Gikomba open-air market for second-hand clothes in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Friday . Angry: Kenya's Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho expressed disappointment at Australia and Britain's stern warnings about travelling to Kenya . The advice on the government's Smart Traveller website said: 'We continue to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Nairobi and the Mombasa region, including Diani Beach, due to the high threat of terrorist attack and high level of crime.' And it ruled out travel to border regions with Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan, because of the 'extremely dangerous security situation'. It added: 'Elsewhere in Kenya we advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution.' Mr Kibicho responded to the warning on Thursday, expressing his disappointment with the governments of Britain, Australia, France and the United States who have all issued messages to tourists. Danger: A policeman inspects a damaged van at the scene of the twin explosion at Gikomba market in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Friday . Explosion: Three people were killed and 16 were injured in a bomb attack at a Mombasa bus station earlier this month. Officials have blamed al-Shabab for the incident . 'The challenges arising from acts of terrorism require concerted efforts to fight it and not behaving in a manner that accelerates it by causing fear and panic,' Kibicho said in a statement issued in Nairobi. 'Issuance of such travel advisories only plays to the whims of bad elements in society whose aims is to spread fear and panic among otherwise peace loving people.' However, unlike the British government - who is evacuating its citizens from Kenya - the Australian government is yet to put such strong measures in place. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told MailOnline on Friday: 'The level of the Australian travel advice for the Mombasa region and Nairobi is ""reconsider your need to travel"" (level 3 of 4 levels) and remains under close review.' Fears: British tourists queue at Mombasa Airport in Kenya after a change in Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice prompted travel companies to bring them home . Protection: Armed guards waited as holidaymakers prepared to board a charter flight following recent terror attacks . Meanwhile, a number of UK travel companies suspended holidays to the nation as tourists were watched in airports under armed guard before returning home. British tour operators Thomson and First Choice are now bringing holidaymakers home after a change in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice. The two companies have cancelled all flights to the East African country until the end of October, while long-haul travel company Kuoni is, for the time being, not offering holidays to the Kenyan coast. Earlier this month, a bomb attack at a bus station in the coastal city of Mombasa killed three people and injured around 16. Another explosion also damaged a hotel in the city during rising tensions and a a recent spate of al-Shabab-linked incidents. Around 100,000 Britons travel to Kenya every year, and many have been devastated by the change in circumstances. Andy Coughlan was on 'a dream holiday' after with his wife Irene, 53, who was told she had gone into remission after suffering breast cancer. 'We’re absolutely devastated,' Mr Coughlan, 53, told The Daily Telegraph. 'Ren had been seriously ill for a long time and this was the first time after all the chemo that she was ready to travel. Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have cancelled all flights to Kenya until the end of October as a result of the concerns . 'She said she wanted to wait for her hair to grow back. As soon as it did, we were on our way here.' The couple from Swansea were staying at the luxury Diani beach and had only arrived in Kenya on Tuesday. The FCO advice reads: 'There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. The main threat comes from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group that has carried out attacks in Kenya in response to Kenya's military intervention in Somalia. 'There has been a spate of small-scale grenade, bomb and armed attacks in Nairobi (especially the area of Eastleigh), Mombasa, and North Eastern Province. 'You should take care in public places where people gather, and exercise a heightened level of vigilance.' A spokeswoman for the FCO said: 'We estimate there are 5,000 British nationals resident along the coast and approximately 500 in Mombasa and surrounding area.' Luxury: The coastal city of Mombasa is popular with British tourists, but many have had their dream holidays cut short .","Australians are told to 'exercise a high degree of caution' and in some areas 'reconsider travel' to the African country following attacks .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Appeal: Ahmed Faraz's appeal against his conviction for publishing and distributing extremist texts to terrorists was upheld . A bookseller who was jailed for publishing and distributing extremist texts to terrorists has had his conviction quashed. Birmingham-raised Ahmed Faraz, 33 - who counted high-profile terrorists including July 7 bomb plot leader Mohammed Sidique Khan among his customers - was convicted of 11 counts of possessing and disseminating terrorist publications in 2011. Court of Appeal judges have now ruled the prosecution should not have been allowed to rely on the presence of the books in terrorists' homes, when there was no suggestion the texts had actually encouraged them to carry out acts of extremism. Father-of-five Faraz, who operated . out of the Maktabah Islamic bookshop in Birmingham, had been sentenced . to three years in prison for publishing radical texts and violent DVDs . and distributing them globally in an effort to 'prime people for . terrorism'. At the . time of Faraz's conviction in 2011 Mr Justice Calvert Smith said many . Maktabah publications had found their way onto the bookshelves of . terrorists. Members . of the gang behind the foiled trans-Atlantic airline plot cited Faraz's . texts in their suicide videos, a report in the Daily Telegraph said. Having . worked for car manufacturer Rover, the stock broker Charles Schwab and . British Gas, Faraz had became involved with Maktabah as a 23-year-old, . editing texts and producing DVDs. Bookseller: Ahmed Faraz worked out of the Maktabah bookshop in Birmingham, which was raided by police ahead of his original trial . Customer: July 7 bomb plot leader Mohammed Sidique Khan on the Arab television channel Al-Jazeera in 2005 . While . working at the shop in Sparkhill he wrote a foreward to Milestones, by . Sayyid Qutb, whose works are known to have influenced al-Qaeda. Faraz, who has a degree in Islamic theology from the University of Birmingham, . also circulated books written by Abdullah Azzam, a highly influential . scholar who preached jihad and mentored Osama bin Laden. In . the past the 33-year-old has spoken in defence of Maktabah, which he . insisted was not an extremist bookshop, but a shop which aimed to . present Islam 'as a whole'.

"By . Chris Pleasance . When stay-at-home dad Brian Reda took a picture of himself and his son at the zoo, he decided to jazz it up a little by throwing a devil horn salute in the bottom of the frame. Little did he know that, when he posted the picture on message board Reddit, he would be roundly criticised by users for using the 'offensive' gesture in front of a young boy. However, he has now hit back at his critics by posting a series of 'Dad life' images online - everyday scenes from life with his nine-month-old son Livingston, with each one featuring the rock 'n' roll hand gesture. Photographer Brian, from St Paul Minnesota, said: 'Some people put up quite the stink about the ""metal hand"" in the picture of my son at the zoo.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former mayor has been banned from attending her daughter's graduation after molesting a 14-year-old boy from the same high school. A judge ruled Friday that Linda Lusk, 53, waited too long to appeal the superintendent and school board's denial of her request in March. Lusk was officially barred from school district activities after pleading guilty in 2011 to inappropriately touching Bubba Frank, her daughter Karlie's ex-boyfriend and classmate at Prosser High School in Washington. Lusk was investigated after Frank bragged to friends about his sexual encounters with Lusk, who was the wife of the school principal Kevin Lusk. Lost her appeal: Linda Lusk (right) the former mayor of Prosser in Washington, pictured in Benton County court with her daughter Karlie and attorney Greg Dow on May 30 . The district doesn't allow registered sex offenders to step foot on school property or participate in school activities . Lusk, a former mayor of Prosser, said she sent multiple written requests to the superintendent asking for an injunction to attend the June 7 graduation. However Rocky Johnson, the district’s attorney, told the judge in Benton County Superior Court  that Lusk had ample time to appeal the ban. Lusk has 30 days to appeal a decision or waive her right to challenge it in court. He said Lusk was creating a media frenzy by bringing the issue to court so close to graduation weekend, according to the Yakima Herald. 'We fully believe the 30-day provision would apply and that Ms. Lusk did not exercise that right of appeal,' Johnson said. Registered sex offender: Linda Lusk was convicted of molesting her daughter's then 14-year-old ex-boyfriend in 2011 . Broken family: While Linda Lusk's daughter Karlie Lusk (pictured left and right) has supported her,  Lusk's Mayor's husband Kevin Lusk (right) filed for divorce after the accusations came to light . Lusk's attorney Greg Dow, however, argued the 30-day rule is only for decisions and orders, not school policies. 'Apparently parents have no right to . challenge school board policy unless they appeal within 30 days of . enactment. We are in America, we want the right to appeal everything,' Dow said. Judge Vic VanderSchoor upheld the school's decision, ruling that Lusk waited too long to appeal. The ruling means it will be difficult for Lusk to attend any district events as long as she is a registered sex offender. Lusk has made several requests to attend district events since the initial no-trespass order was issued in August 2012. Every request has been denied. In a sit-down interview with ABC News's 20/20 program last year, Lusk preempted that she would be banned from her daughter's graduation. Victim: Linda Lusk pleaded guilty to molesting then 14-year-old Bubba Frank (pictured), a student at Prosser High School in Washington. Frank chose to identify himself by appearing on ABC News's 20/20 program . In 2011, Lusk pleaded guilty with an Alford plea in which a defendant maintains she did not commit a crime but admits prosecutors have enough information to convict her. The mother-of-five served two months of a 90-day jail sentence with a year of probation and registered as a level-one sex offender. This meant Lusk couldn't attend many of her children's extracurricular activities or even their birthday parties until her probation ended in 2012. 'The fact that I've been denied access to their parent-teacher conferences gives me grave concern that they're going to deny my access to graduation,' Lusk told ABC News's 20/20. Lusk's family supported her throughout the aftermath of the sex scandal, including her husband Kevin Lusk. However he filed for divorce in June 2012, which was finalized in 2013. According to court documents, Lusk's 'relationship' with Frank began in early 2010 and culminated in a sexual encounter at her home in April. Frank reportedly told a group of Prosser High School students about the incident. It wasn't until May 31 that the boy's coach learned about what had happened, prompting detectives to investigate. Benton County sheriff's detectives' investigative reports obtained by the Tri-City Herald claimed Lusk intitated contact and Frank played along with sexts from Lusk. At her home, Lusk was said to have removed Frank's clothing and performed a sex act with him. He said the encounter was interrupted after a few minutes when he received a text message and returned to school. Frank also shared his story and revealed his identity on ABC News's 20/20 program.","Linda Lusk, 53, pleaded guilty in 2011 to molesting then 14-year-old Bubba Frank - a student at Prosser High School .

"By . Ray Massey . Polish planes landing at Heathrow are the loudest the first ever ‘league-table’ of airline noise reveals today. By contrast, British Airways’ short-haul services are the quietest new data released as part of Heathrow’s new ‘Fly Quiet’ programme shows. The worst offender is Polish airline LOT, in last place, just ahead of Israeli carrier national El Al in 49th place and Thai Airways in 48th place. Poland's LOT airline has been ranked worst for noise pollution while coming into Heathrow . The initiative aims to name and shame airlines into putting a wind-sock in it. Virgin Atlantic's Little Red domestic service was in second place behind BA, with Irish airline Aer Lingus in third. Behind it was American Airlines, followed by Qantas, Emirates, American carriers United and Delta, Dutch carrier KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa. BA's short-haul flights had the lowest levels of noise at Britain's busiest international airport . British Airways’ long-haul flights were outside the top-ten -  in twelfth place just behind TAP Portugal. The Fly Quiet league table aims to name and shame loud airlines into cutting noise levels . Those keeping most people awake at night at the bottom of the table were: Turkish Airlines long-haul, South African Airways, European Air transport, Finnair, and Russia’s Aeroflot short-haul. The scores were based on noise levels during the period July to September and are given a ‘traffic light’ style rating for various categories and timings of noise. Of the listed airlines, 80 per cent met Heathrow's minimum requirements on noise, with 94 per cent meeting at least five of the six categories. Heathrow said a combination of  old, nosier planes, and the way in which it is flown are key factors in noise levels. A steep descent to the runway also leaves less of a noise ‘footprint’ than a longer steady descent. Heathrow sustainability director Matt Gorman said: 'We are at the forefront of international efforts to tackle aircraft noise and are committed to continuing to reduce the number of people affected by noise. ‘The launch of the Fly Quiet programme signals our firm commitment to being transparent about aircraft noise and our progress in reducing its impact on local communities whilst still safeguarding the vital connectivity and economic growth that Heathrow provides.’ John Stewart, chairman of the Heathrow anti-noise and extra runway campaign group Hacan, said: ‘We welcome this initiative from Heathrow. It is a constructive move to improve the noise climate.’ BA head of environment Jonathon Counsell said: ‘We are very pleased that our short-haul fleet has proved itself the quietest at Heathrow, and we know we can do more. 'Overall, we have a noise reduction target to reduce the average noise per flight by 15per cent by 2018.’ He added: ‘This autumn we have introduced nine new long-haul aircraft, all of which are significantly quieter than their predecessors, and we will take delivery of more than 30 further aircraft in the next three years.’ The findings come as ‘noise’ remains one . of the biggest factors affecting whether Heathrow will get a . controversial  third – or even a fourth – runway.","Fly Quiet survey tested noise levels of 50 airlines at Heathrow .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cherie Blair declared the bride the most beautiful she had ever seen. The groom, her son Euan, looked similarly ‘amazing’. And filled with ‘breathtaking’ flowers, the church in the quiet Buckinghamshire village of Wotton Underwood was a worthy backdrop. In fact, the wedding of the Blairs’ first-born Euan was pretty near  perfect. Even the rain held off. But one dark cloud hovered over the big day in the form of TV weathergirl Sian Lloyd, the stepmother of the bride, Suzanne Ashman. Happy couple: Euan and Suzanne emerge beaming through the autumn leaves as friends throw confetti . Tying the knot: Euan Blair and Suzanne Ashman emerge from the church in Buckinghamshire . Barred: Stepmother of the bride, TV weather girl Sian Lloyd with husband Jonathan Ashman . The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Miss Lloyd has admitted being ‘flabbergasted’ at the decision to  ban her from the ceremony. Having . been invited some months ago, she discovered last week she was no . longer welcome and was met with a ‘wall of silence’ when she sought an . explanation. He is said to be keen to follow his father Tony’s footsteps into Parliament. But Euan Blair showed that when it comes to preparing for his wedding, he is also keen on the pampering that appeals to his mother, Cherie. The ex-Prime Minister’s son was seen having an executive footcare treatment at Champneys spa in Tring, Hertfordshire, last Thursday. Cherie and his sister, Kathryn, enjoyed luxury manicures alongside him. They were accompanied by a blonde, believed to be a bridesmaid. Dressed in a white robe, Euan sat next to Cherie, also in a white robe. His treatment lasted 25 minutes, cost £35 and involved cutting and filing nails, removing skin and massaging the feet. Euan was laughing and chatting to Cherie as he relaxed in the nail salon, which appeared to have been reserved for them. One guest said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw Cherie and her party. ‘They were relaxed and seemed to have come from the house, where the luxury bedrooms are.’ It is also believed Euan had a facial and a body massage to make him picture-perfect for his nuptials. It is thought he opted for the men’s grooming package – which costs £85 and lasts for one hour and 25 minutes. The party of four are believed to have stayed in four premiere rooms attached to the original house. A two-night break in a premiere room costs £647 per room. ‘She is puzzled . at the reason behind such rudeness,’ a close friend told The Mail on . Sunday yesterday. ‘She is flabbergasted at the “disinvite”.’ Friends . said Miss Lloyd, 55, has made no secret of her staunch opposition to . the war in Iraq and has been strongly critical of Mr Blair’s . ‘warmongering words about Syria’. This, she feels, might lie behind the snub, even if only in part. While her comments were never delivered publicly, it is thought they may have reached the former Prime Minister’s ears. There . was some speculation that Miss Lloyd would attend the ceremony with . husband Jonathan Ashman, regardless of being ‘uninvited’ – but she . insisted that was never the case. ‘No, . no reinvite has followed the disinvite,’ she told a friend in an email. ‘Original invite on table  here, with Sian & Jonathan writ large on . envelope . . . but alas, alack & woe is me.’ In . another message on Friday, she said: ‘Designer dress and posh high . heels returned to wardrobe with a sigh . . . back to weather charts to . try and deliver a sunny day for tomorrow’s newlyweds.’ After . lunching with girlfriends yesterday – and raising ‘a glass of bubbly to . the happy couple’ – Miss Lloyd was planning to ‘curl up on the sofa and . watch a film’. Some in Miss . Lloyd’s circle say her fractious relationship with the first wife of . her husband is probably a more credible explanation for  her exclusion. ‘Sian says it might be due to the ex-wife resenting how happy she is with Jonathan,’ said another source close to Miss Lloyd. At . first, Mr Ashman, a 64-year-old motor-racing entrepreneur, was so . incensed at his wife’s treatment that he threatened to boycott the . wedding. However, Miss Lloyd convinced him to change his mind and give . his daughter away. ‘Sian . said she was pleased she  persuaded him to attend as it was the right . thing to do. She said Jonathan absolutely hated the idea of going . without her,’ said a friend. Yesterday at All Saints, Wotton Underwood, ten minutes’ walk from the Blairs’ mansion, all rancour  was forgotten. As . he watched his 25-year-old daughter, in an oyster cream dress, step . from a chauffeur-driven black taxi, Mr Ashman announced: ‘I am very . proud.’ And after praising . the bride,  Cherie Blair said of her 29-year-old son, who wore a blue . lounge suit with a white carnation: ‘Didn’t my boy look amazing!’ Earlier, at the church door, an emotional Mr Blair held his son’s face . in his hands and kissed him on the cheek. Mr Blair said later: ‘It is a very happy day. We are grateful to have such a wonderful daughter-in-law.’ Well wishers: Euan waves to the cheering guests, showing off the wedding ring on his third finger .

At . the wedding, meanwhile, guests danced the night away in a marquee . squeezed between two tall hedges, a short stroll through ornamental . gardens from the main house. In a romantic detail, either side of the marquee’s entrance was decorated with two entwined hearts. The . Blairs bought 17th-century South Pavilion, worth £5.75 million, in . 2008. Once home to the actor  Sir John Gielgud, it has seven bedrooms . and grounds that include a former farmhouse now used by security staff.

Doting father: Jonathan Ashman looks tearful at his glowing daughter as she gets ready to go. There is no sight or mention of his new wife Sian Lloyd, who was banned from attending . ‘She . [Sian] always felt like she was seen as a bit cheap and on the make,’ said a friend. ‘Sian tried to make an effort with Suzanne but because of . her mother she wouldn’t give an inch. They both looked down on her and . she gained the impression that they thought she was a bit of an . embarrassment. ‘There was . slow-burning animosity, then they had a heated conversation on the phone . about two months ago when Sian asked straight out why she [Sedef] had a . problem with her. It never recovered from there.’ Yesterday, . Sedef, the daughter of the former mayor of the Turkish capital, Ankara, . cut a striking figure in a short blue dress. Her marriage to Mr Ashman . ended 13 years ago and she arrived at the wedding alone in a Bentley, . declining to comment. Parents of the bride: Jonathan Ashman, without Sian Lloyd, arrived to let his daughter go . Uninvited: Sian Lloyd, who married Suzanne Ashman's father Jonathan in 2007, allegedly made a comment about Suzanne's mother . A . Turkish TV crew followed her every move, explaining that there was . delight in Turkey that a former British Prime Minister was now connected . to a distinguished Turkish family. Euan Blair has been dating Suzanne for eight years, having been introduced by former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon. Miss . Ashman read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Trinity College, . Oxford, after leaving the private St Paul’s Girls’ School in South-West . London. She met Euan Blair while on work experience with Mr Hoon and . later worked at Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation. Last year, after working . for American merchant bank Morgan Stanley, Euan became a business . development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access – part . of the Government’s Work Programme – in a move said by some to be a . stepping stone towards following his father into politics.

"By . Alex Greig . A Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) worker has been arrested on child neglect and drug charges after deputies found her six children living in 'deplorable' conditions. Investigators received a tip that DCF investigator Kysa Donawa, 41, and her husband Randy Donawa, 38 were growing marijuana at the family home in Kissimmee and obtained a search warrant for the property. When they got there, they found not only marijuana plants, but counterfeit money and a handgun. In addition, deputies say, the bins were overflowing with trash and there were roaches, flies and spiders infesting the house. Arrested: Kysa and Randy Donawa are facing six charges of child neglect and drug charges . Infested: Deputies say there were flies, spiders and roaches in the children's bedrooms . Unsafe: Chemicals and medications were found open and within reach of the children . According to Click Orlando, there are six children aged six, eight, nine, 12, 15 and 17 living at the house. Both husband and wife are now facing charges of production of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and six counts of child neglect. Deputies said the toilets in the house didn't flush and that the smell of urine made it difficult to breath. Cleaning chemicals were out and open and pill bottles were within reach of the couple's six-year-old. There were 26 marijuana plants growing in the backyard. Squalor: The couple's Kissimmee property looks tidy from the outside, but deputies say the inside is filthy and not safe for children . Filthy: Deputies said the toilets in the home did not flush and that the smell of urine was overpowering . On Monday, a judge determined that the children would stay with their grandmothers, and that the Donawas may have supervised visits.

'The actions of this former employee do not reflect the dedicated employees that represent this agency professionally and positively every day,' DCF said in a statement released to the media. Kysa Donawa told the Sentinel that she knew nothing about the marijuana plants or the harvested pot found in her home.","DCF investigator Kysa Donawa, 41, was arrested on child neglect charges along with her husband Randy Donawa .

"By . James Slack . and Charles Walford . Girls as young as 11 'expect' to have to . perform sex acts on rows of boys for up to two hours at a time in parts . of London, a shocking report has warned. Child abuse is rife across Britain with many of the depraved sex attacks . being carried out by youngsters who have had their minds warped by . online porn, a government expert said yesterday. Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz said there 'isn’t a town, . village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited’. And she said easy access to ‘extreme’ internet porn was to blame as it . ‘affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal’. Horrendous: Thousands of children the country are being sexually exploited, stunned MPs were told today (picture posed by model) They are then ‘enacting’ scenes from porn movies – often as part of gangs which subject young girls to terrible abuse. Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee, Miss Berelowitz told of her . great concern about what internet porn was doing to vulnerable young . minds. She explained: ‘We’ve had boys say to us – some of the boys I’ve spoken . to who’ve been involved in sexual exploitation – “it was like being in a . porn movie”. ‘They have watched things and then they’ve enacted them. It has . definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.’ In one vile case she uncovered, boys aged 14 and 15 were 'summoned' via . BlackBerry Messenger to the gang rape of a 'very, very young girl' which . lasted several days. She told MPs: 'Boys were being called . while some were raping the girl to say ""come, come, come, you can join . in too"" and they were arriving and elbowing each other out of the way to . rape her.' And giving examples from the capital, she added: 'There are parts of . London where certainly children expect to have to perform oral sex on . line-ups of boys, up to two hours at a time from the age of 11. And it was 'quite common' for girls to be lured via internet chat rooms . to meet a friend, only to be met by a group of boys and gang raped in a . park. 'Then another group of boys come, they take her to another part of the . park and she is serially raped again,' Ms Berelowitz told MPs. 'I wish I could say to you that such things are uncommon but I’m afraid they are quite common.' In another case, older men were using young male gang members as a . 'front line' in a wider abuse network, and had even forced two of the . boys to have sex and filmed it on a mobile phone to ensure their . compliance. The deputy commissioner, appointed to look after the best interests of . children, backed the Mail’s campaign for controls to make it harder for . youngsters to access pornographic images on computers. Horror: Children are being targeted on Facebook - and in one instance word of a gang rape was spread by BlackBerry messenger. (Picture posed by model) MPs, charities and this paper want a new . ‘opt-in’ system – where access to porn is normally blocked by the . internet service provider, unless parents specifically request . otherwise. Miss Berelowitz told MPs this move would be the right way to . make a ‘start’. She said parents needed to recognise children could access porn from . home computers and mobiles, and they alone would not be able to control . successfully what young people could see. Ms Berelowitz  said: 'Parents may think they can control what’s going on . because they can have a blockage on the computer but the reality is . children can get anything they like on their mobile phones. 'And they are. It has definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.' Currently, the opt-in system is being resisted by internet companies, . who make millions from adverts for pornographic websites. Ministers, who . have been criticised for their close ties to companies such as Google, . have yet to reach a final decision. Sue Berelowitz's report into the scale of child abuse is due out in September . Her comments will increase the pressure on ministers to take drastic action to protect children from damaging images online. During her evidence she said: 'What I am uncovering is that sexual exploitation of children is happening all over the country. 'As one police officer who was the lead in a very big investigation in a very lovely, leafy, rural part of the country said to me: ""there isn’t a town, village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited"". 'We should start from the assumption that children are being sexually exploited right the way across the country. 'In urban, rural and metropolitan areas, I have hard evidence of children being sexually exploited. That is part of what is going on in some parts of our country. It is very sadistic, it is very violent it is very ugly.' The deputy commissioner told the visibly-stunned MPs that 'what is being done is so terrible that people need to lay aside their denial' or risk victims being disbelieved. Victims numbered in the thousands not the hundreds, she said. She said she was 'extremely concerned' about the role being played by the internet in enabling and fuelling abuse, and ridiculed the idea that parents could prevent access. Young people were acting out scenes they saw in online pornography and even organising abuse via social networking sites and messaging systems, she said. One police force showed her a list of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 14 whom a man in his 40s masquerading as a boy had managed to make his 'friends' on Facebook. 'We have gathered quite a lot of evidence to show that there is no doubt that social networking sites can be a source of real problems for this,' she said. Her report into the scale of child abuse is due out in September. She also talked about recent high-profile cases of groups of men exploiting young white girls for sex. In . one case in Rochdale, nine Muslim men, mainly of Pakistani origin, were . found guilty of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs so . they could use them for sex. But . while it may be true that some Pakistani men saw white girls as 'easy . meat' - as suggested by a number of high-profile politicians - that was . only one pattern among many, she said. 'I . regret to say that there are parts of every single community - white, . Pakistani, Afghan, Gypsy and Romany travellers, you name it - who are . seeing children as easy access in terms of sexual exploitation. And in . terms of victims we are seeing the same sort of profile.' Speaking about the race issue, she . told the committee she had visited a 'racist' estate in the north of . England where there was routine sexual abuse of children within an . all-white community. 'I have been to gang-associated areas in the north of England. 'I am thinking of one particular . estate which is exclusively white, because it is such a racist estate, . where there is a very strong and identified pattern of the white males . on that estate sexually exploiting the white females on that estate. 'So it is really important to hold all of it in mind.' Peter Davies, chief executive of the . Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, has warned that . children are accessing the web at a far younger age, meaning they could . stumble across adult material. His organisation is now distributing . films to schools aimed at children between the ages of five and eight, . to train them how to avoid online dangers. In his evidence to MPs yesterday, Mr . Davies said he would score the public sector only ‘five out of ten’ for . its ability to protect children from abuse. He claimed that, on average, one child in every 20 was the victim of sexual abuse.","'There .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Under then-Secretary Hillary Clinton, the U.S. State Department repeatedly refused to add the Nigerian al-Qaeda affiliate group Boko Haram – the organization responsible for the recent kidnapping of more than 300 young girls – to its official list of terrorist organizations. In November 2013, current Secretary John Kerry did what Clinton wouldn't. Boko Haram is the group that has claimed responsibility for kidnapping hundreds of girls in Nigeria, promising to sell them into slavery. The Daily Beast reported Thursday that in 2011, after the group's mass-murderers bombed the United Nations building in Abuja, Nigeria, Obama administration agencies and more than a dozen members of Congress begged Clinton to add it to its official list of designated terror organizations – but the State Department fought it and did nothing. Former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton offered tepid condemnation of Boko Haram on Wednesday night, hours before it emerged that her State Department refused to designate the group as terrorists . Clinton jumped on the hashtag bandwagon on Sunday but hasn't addressed why the mass-murdering organization wasn't named a terror group on her watch . The urging came from the Justice Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the head of the U.S. military's Africa Command (AFRICOM). Now with Boko Haram in the international spotlight and Clinton positioning herself for a presidential run, she has forcefully demanded U.S. government action to fight against the Islamist group. 'Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls. We must stand up to terrorism,' she tweeted on Sunday. 'Boko Haram' is a loose translation of the Hausa-language phrase 'Western education is sinful.' She said Wednesday night during a Ford Foundation event in New York City that 'the government of Nigeria has been, in my view, somewhat derelict in its responsibility for protecting boys and girls, men and women.' 'They need to make it a priority to do everything they can to try to bring these girls home safely,' Clinton said, 'and that, I believe, requires assistance from others including the United States.' That tepid condemnation, a day after she called the kidnappings 'an abominable ... act of terror,' stands in sharp contrast to those of some who served with her in Congress. 'These kidnappings are barbaric and gutless,' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer told the New York Post. 'Boko Haram is a particularly evil and vicious component of the Islamic terrorist network,' added New York Republican Rep. Peter King. Heartbreak: Members of the All Nigeria Confederation of Principals of Secondary Schools are protesting the Nigerian government's failure to rescue the abducted school girls . 'Hypocrisy': Clinton, now ramping up for a possible White House run, is urging the U.S. government to do what she wouldn't just a few years ago . Sen. James Risch, an Idaho Republican, told The Daily Beast that Clinton missed the opportunity to enable the U.S. government to do more – a possibility that designating Boko Haram as a terror group would have opened up. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Thursday that his government considers the abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls a turning point in his fight against Islamist terror groups . 'For years, Boko Haram has terrorized Nigeria and Western interests in the region with few consequences,” Risch said. 'The U.S. government should have moved more quickly to list them as a terrorist organization and brought U.S. resources to track and disrupt their activities. The failure to act swiftly has had consequences.' The online news outlet quoted an unnamed former senior U.S. official taking the suddenly alarmed Clinton to the woodshed even more strongly. 'The one thing she could have done, the one tool she had at her disposal, she didn’t use,' the official reportedly said. 'And nobody can say she wasn’t urged to do it. It’s gross hypocrisy.' In a March 2012 letter to Clinton, Rep. King and fellow Republican Pat Meehan explained that the group had 'intensified its campaign of terrorism, including detonating a vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) at a Catholic church during Christmas Day mass.' 'The group also conducted a series of attacks in January 2012 throughout Nigeria that killed dozens,' they wrote. 'These attacks follow the August 26, 2011 bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Abuja that killed 23 and injured 100.' 'According to Human Rights Watch, Boko Haram has killed more than 900 people in the last two years. The brazenness and sophistication of these attacks are hallmarks of al Qaeda tradecraft.' Meehan, along with Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, published a scathing report on Boko Haram in November 2011. It found that the vicious organization 'has quickly evolved and poses an emerging threat to U.S. Interests and the U.S. homeland.' 'Boko Haram has the intent and may be developing capability to coordinate on a rhetorical and operational level with al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Al Shabaab,' it reported. This week the group massacred hundreds in a northeast Nigerian town.","CIA, FBI, DOJ and more than a dozen members of Congress begged her to add the group to State's official list of designated terror organizations .
A suddenly alarmed Clinton is now looking hypocritical, voicing her anger at Boko Haram after it kidnapped hundreds of Nigerian girls .
John Kerry, the secretary of state who followed Clinton, did designate Boko Haram as a terror group, but Clinton fought it all the way .

"By . Kirk Maltais . Shocking video shows the moment a 22-year-old American blew himself up in a suicide bombing last week in Syria. College drop out Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, originally from Florida, is believed to be the first U.S. citizen to kill himself in a Syrian terrorist attack, the State Department said Friday. The bombing was organized by an affiliate of al-Qaeda, and the group uploaded a video to YouTube of one of the four bombings that took place on May 25. In the video, men are seen loading a truck full of explosives, before driving off and detonating in a Syrian military compound. Scroll down for video . A tweet from a cleric affiliated with al-Nusra, which shows a man believed to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, the American who was allegedly one of the suicide bombers . Abu-Salha, who was named in postings to social media websites under the alias 'Abu Haraya Al-Amriki', reportedly . arrived in Syria late last year, where he joined militants in the area. Abu-Salha is believed to be involved with carrying out a rash of attacks in Syria's Idlib province. The attacks were carried out on behalf of Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliate attempting to oust the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Abu-Salha is believed to be the first American to commit a suicide bombing in Syria on behalf of Al Qaeda. In a video . posted on YouTube by the propaganda wing of the militant group, . participants were shown loading explosive material into a large truck. The truck is then driven to a building, where a massive explosion is . caught on camera. The terror plot was organized by group Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. They released a video of attack, starting with men loading a truck full of explosives . Men inside the vehicle then carefully stock pile the explosives . The truck drives down the road toward a military center, presumably with abu-Salha inside. The group organized four separate attacks on May 25 . The military center appears peaceful just before the blast . It's unclear how many were killed in the explosion . Abu-Salha is believed to be the first American suicide bomber in Syria . According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, who spoke to Agence France-Presse, . the attacks were meant to cut off roadways in Idlib before the June 3 . presidential elections. The area connects to another area believed to . the 'heartland' for support of President Assad. The New York Times reports that a Moner Abu-Salha, who's Facebook profile picture was reportedly the same face as the picture tweeted by a cleric allied with Jabhat al-Nusra, showed that he was a Floridian that held a keen interest in Islamic topics (The profile could not be found at this time.) In a check of public records performed by New York Times reporters, Moner Abu-Salha had previously lived in Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, Florida. Both areas are approximately 100 miles north of Miami. Moner Abu-Salha attended Sebastian River High School and played on the Indian River Warriors youth basketball team in 2007. He went on to study at Seminole State College of Florida before dropping out. The college confirmed that he was enrolled in the school in August 2011 but never graduated. A family friend who wished not to be identified told WPTV that Moner Abu-Salha left the country unexpectedly last year and had been telling his family that he was living in Jordan and working as a nurse. Neighbors of the family in Florida say his mother Michelle dressed conservatively with a Hijab covering hair. Neighbor Bill Miller told the Washington Post that Moner Abusalha once got suspended from school for fighting with boys who made fun of his mother's clothing. Another neighbor, Cynthia Heinz, says the family faced financial issues and moved twice in their old neighborhood when they lost their first home due to foreclosure a few years ago, . Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, approximately 100 Americans have traveled to Syria, to fight with one of the numerous anti-Assad groups.","Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, originally from Florida, believed to be the American involved with suicide attack in Idlib province of Syria .

"By . Gordon Brown . A knock at the door in the middle of the night. A policeman telling you your teenage daughter has been abducted. They’re trying to find her but she may have already been sold as a sex slave or a child bride. A chance she might be dead. And 270 of her friends have been taken too. Vanished. Inconceivable in this country. Reality in parts of Nigeria. In Britain and the United States we still have the capacity to be stunned when evil descends on our classrooms. Who could forget? Sixteen boys and girls and a teacher murdered at Dunblane Primary, 12 students and one teacher wiped out at Columbine High, 20 children and six staff shot dead at Sandy Hook Elementary. All of them events of such horrific magnitude they will forever be etched in the world’s collective memory. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said he will 'sell' the schoolgirls his terror group kidnapped three weeks ago . These massacres shocked us to our core precisely because they were so out of the ordinary – innocent children gunned down in the supposed safety of their schools. But in Nigeria, where I have been this past week, the bombing, burning and kidnapping of schoolchildren is now almost a regular occurrence. Another day, another outrage. Schools are far from safe havens, and they must be just that. They have almost become instruments of war, and the brutality inside those walls has become so commonplace it is rarely reported. Why in God’s name has it taken three weeks for the world to sit up and care about this atrocity? I once visited a school on the outskirts of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, with Bono. When we asked the children what their ambitions were, we found they were the same as kids all around the world. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the international community had to work together to prevent the spread of groups like Boko Haram . Some wanted to be teachers,  doctors and nurses, others engineers, airline pilots and scientists. None, of course, had ambitions  of being a politician – and to Bono’s surprise, none wanted to be a rock star. What struck me most during our visit were the appalling conditions and the substandard education they were receiving. Lessons were being offered in a dilapidated school with a leaking, corrugated iron roof. Children huddled together, three or four at a rickety desk built for one. What we ultimately learned was deeply disturbing. We found this school was losing pupils to a madrasa only a few miles away – a new, fresh, well-financed institution that offered free education. But the drawback was that they were indoctrinating students by preaching support for terrorism. Gordon Brown had previously traveled to Nigeria with Irish rock singer Bono where he discovered that extremist schools were offering free education to poor children . So it is no surprise to me that extremism, fed by propaganda infiltrated through the education system, is on the rise in Nigeria. And now, thankfully, the international community has finally woken up to the fact that 270 girls were snatched at gunpoint from their school. The murderous terrorist group Boko Haram – the name means ‘Western education is forbidden’ – has claimed responsibility for the abductions, and their twisted leader Abubakar Shekau released a video stating the girls should not have been in school and should be married. A further eight girls were kidnapped last week. These lives now hang in the balance. Kidnapped and carted off in lorries into the jungle territory of Borno state, their parents are unsure whether they will be used as sex slaves, taken over the border and sold as child brides, or killed. It is horrendously late but a search, involving the UK and US and using state-of-the-art equipment, will finally begin. Three weeks ago and within hours of the mass abduction, I asked for international support to rescue them. Thanks to William Hague, our Foreign Secretary, and John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, specialist teams are in place. Last week the world was angry and vocal. Look to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. This week the world will be watching and praying.And the Nigerian government and their people deserve the fullest support in tackling terrorism. Last week in Abuja, Boko Haram bombed and killed dozens. Over the past four years the group’s attacks on Nigerians have taken more than 4,000 lives. We also now know that in a separate incident in the past few weeks, seven teachers were murdered and 27 members of their families were abducted in Borno state. Another day, another outrage. This brings to 171 the number of teachers who have been assassinated in Nigeria since 2009. It makes it all the more important that a Safe Schools Initiative I announced in Abuja on Wednesday – to increase the security available to pupils and teachers in their school grounds – is moved forward as quickly as possible. We simply cannot stand by and see schools shut down, girls cut off from their education and parents in fear of their daughters’ lives. The education system that has  the potential to transform Nigeria  cannot be undermined. Starting with a 500-school pilot programme in northern states, the Safe Schools Initiative will focus on school and community interventions, with special measures for the most at-risk  children. The initiative will build community groups to promote safe zones for education, comprising teachers,  parents, police, community leaders and young people. Ex-Corrie star Julie Hesmondhalgh also gave her support to the international campaign to release the girls . This initiative, which came from the Global Business Coalition For Education led by my wife Sarah, is part of our work to give every girl and boy in Nigeria the opportunity to learn and fulfil their ambitions. Surely in the year 2014, every boy and girl should be at school and no one should be prevented from an education. Sadly there are still 57 million across the world who are denied even basic schooling. There ARE children in Nigeria prepared to stand up to terrorism. Last week 12 young Nigerians, appointed global ambassadors by education  initiative A World At School, made a statement showing that they will not be cowed by terrorist threats. They declared they will continue their work for the right of every child to go to school safely. And Nigeria is not the only country at risk. More than two million out-of-school children are growing up in conflict zones, whether it be the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the fringes of Burma, or in South Sudan, and all of them are vulnerable to extremist influences as we cut global education aid year after year. All the world’s aid put together offers sub-Saharan Africa only $13 per pupil per year – barely enough to buy one school book per child. Faced with a rising school-age population, Nigeria receives just $2 per pupil, but it needs to spend $2 billion a year more if it is  to meet the UN Millennium Development goal that every child be at school by 2015. I also now believe that discrimination against girls has become the civil rights struggle of our times. Thankfully, millions of girls across the world are now prepared to stand up for their rights. A few weeks ago I returned to Pakistan 18 months after a visit I made following the shooting of Malala Yousafzai. Then, there was rage that a young girl could be shot simply for wanting girls to go to school. A whole population almost seemed fearful and cowed by the Taliban. However, on my recent trip, addressing 2,000 girls who had turned out in Islamabad, I found a determination that no girl should ever be forced out of their country by the Taliban again. None of them wanted their country to be defined to the world any more by a shooting. They wanted Pakistan  recognised not by their failure to get girls to school but by their success. These socially aware girls, desperate for education and careers, are globalisation’s children – born in the latest wave of change, aware, through their mobile phone contact with the outside world, of the opportunities girls enjoy elsewhere. Their outrage at the denial of opportunity could threaten over the coming  decade to bring unresponsive  governments to their knees. A generation ago, young  people might have accepted that their rights were what others bestowed on them, their opportunities simply what parents and grandparents handed down, and that a shortage of ability, not a shortage of opportunity, explained their fate. Now not so, and probably never again. They are fighting back but there will be moments of despair on their journey. In Chibok this past week, it has been heartbreaking to see the desolation on faces as they wait for news about the girls. We should be taking even more action. Schools that already have the same legal rights under international law as hospitals should also be the subject of agreements that they never become instruments of war. They should be as safe as the hospitals that have Red Crosses on them and the UN buildings and vehicles that bear the blue UN symbol. Perpetrators of terrorist crimes against children should be aware that murdering or abducting them is a heinous crime that the authorities will punish. Even in the world’s most dangerous places, we must now establish the right of all children to schooling and make a new idea of ‘education without borders’ a reality. And while we cannot end terrorism overnight, we can show determination to stand up to it by making schools safe and defending every child’s right to education… and to life.","Gordon Brown has spent the past week in Nigeria as UN Special Envoy for Global Education .

"By . Leon Watson . A former Miami Beach police officer who took a woman celebrating her bachelorette party on a joy ride either committed crimes or simply used bad judgment, jurors were told today. The jaunt in Derick Kuilan's police ATV ended when he struck and seriously injured two people walking on the beach. Kuilan is on trial for four felonies. A court was told the officer had been . drinking while on duty in the early hours of July 3, 2011, before he . offered the ride to Adalee Martin Jones of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Derick Kulian, the ATV-riding Miami Beach police officer who plowed over two people on the sand of South Beach, has been charged with four felonies . Adalee Martin was the bride-to-be at a party at a South Beach nightclub when she was taken for a ride by the officer . She was the bride-to-be at the party at a South Beach nightclub, Miami-Dade County assistant state attorney Eileen Keeley said. Kuilan and his partner also posed for a photo with the women, some of whom told investigators later they initially thought the officers might be strippers or just part of their entertainment. Keeley told jurors that Kuilan tore down the beach at a high rate of speed with lights off before crashing into Kitzie Nicanor and Luis Almonte, who had gone to the ocean's edge to watch the sunrise. Almonte suffered a broken leg and Nicanor had serious head and other injuries. Five hours after the crash, a blood test showed Kuilan's alcohol level just above Florida's 0.08 legal limit. 'His judgment was gone. His common sense was impaired. His actions that night shattered the lives of Luis Almonte and Kitzie Nicanor,' Keeley told jurors in her opening statement. One of the victims of a crash involving Miami Beach police officer Derrick Kulian being taken away on a stretcher . The other victim of the crash being taken away for treatment with her neck in a brace . Derrick Kulian's Miami Beach police ATV in the aftermath of the crash which seriously injured two people . Kuilan's attorney, Evan Hoffman, said there was no question the officer made mistakes that night. But Hoffman noted that Kuilan is being sued by the accident victims as well as Jones and that a civil lawsuit is the proper way to resolve the case. 'At most, this is a negligence case, and not a criminal one,' Hoffman said. Kuilan is charged with two counts of driving under the influence with serious bodily injury and two counts of reckless driving with bodily injury. Each felony charge carries a potential five-year prison sentence. The first prosecution witness Monday was Jones, who said she did not think Kuilan was drunk or otherwise impaired when she decided to accept the ATV ride. She said she did not see him drinking at The Clevelander, the hotel and nightspot where the women were partying. 'I thought it would be fun. I trusted him because he was a police officer. I felt safe,' Jones testified. Jones said Kuilan occasionally flicked the ATV's lights on and off as he sped down Miami Beach, turning at its southernmost point and then ramming into Nicanor and Almonte. Jones said she flew off the ATV and it rolled over her. She suffered a back and other minor injuries. 'We were going pretty fast. That's when I felt like we hit a brick wall,' she said. Asked to describe the aftermath, she added: 'Chaos. Panic. People screaming and crying.'

"By . James  Nye . In 1986, an 11-year-old girl called Lisa sent a letter to President Ronald Reagan asking him to sponsor her in a charity event to help the homeless. The world's most powerful man personally replied to the San Fernando girl with a handwritten note and attached a check for $50, both of which are to be offered up for sale for $20,000. The Gipper's check - which is the only known one signed by him in existence - was never cashed by the girl after her parents replaced it with cash and told her to keep it and the heartfelt note for posterity. Handwritten: This is the letter sent to Lisa to by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 on a White House letterhead . 'Dear Lisa, I am very proud to sponsor you in the walkathon,' wrote Reagan on a White House letterhead on August 26, 1986. 'Thank you for asking. I know you’ll walk the seven miles and the enclosed is to help the cause you are serving. God bless you. Ronald Reagan.' Lisa, who is now a grown woman and wishes to remain anonymous, was running in an event to help the homeless organized by San Fernando Board of Realtors scheduled for September 27, 1986. The documents are being handled through auction by The Raab Collection and Nathan Raab said that the letter and check from Reagan's own personal Bank of America account will only increase in value. Personal: The check is believed to be the only signed one in existence from Reagan and together with the letter is to be sold for $20,000 . 'This little-known episode in Reagan's life shows the kind of man he was and is a testament to his character,' Raab told FoxNews.com. 'He cared enough that when he received a letter and request from a young child, the president devoted not only his valuable time as president, but also his personal funds to her.' Raab said that a search of public and private records have failed to reveal any other checks signed by the 40th president - making the documents almost unique. 'You almost never seen letters of presidents to children,' said Raab told FoxNews.com. 'The piece is a great rarity, and also evocative of Reagan the man and Reagan the President.' The Gipper: President Reagan personally took the time to write the letter to 11-year-old Lisa showing off his common touch . Presidential bank: Bank of America at . 460 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills, California was the holding branch of Ronald Reagan's personal bank account . At the time that Reagan sent the check and letter he was coming under criticism for being 'indifferent' towards the plight of the homeless. According to records from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library, on the day that he replied to Lisa he was in Los Angeles running errands and spending time with friends. 'Into L.A. for our few days of seeing friends, etc.,' Reagan wrote. 'We left the house at 10:40 a.m. and arrived at the suite at 11:45. Coming down the coast in a helicopter I watched for landmarks I remembered and was a little upset when I could locate them & then couldn’t remember their names, Topanga Canyon for example.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Freya Noble . and Sally Lee . Australian grandmother Deborah Scheithe liked what she saw when her daughter showed off her newly augmented breasts. In fact, the 50-year-old was so impressed that this recently inspired her to go under the knife for breast implants. But Ms Scheithe isn't alone as she's part of a burgeoning market of older women seeking boob jobs in Australia. NSW resident Deborah Schiethe had a boob job at age 50, (pictured to the left before, and right after) and is part of a growing trend of older women going under the knife . The grandmother, from Tumut in NSW, told news.com.au the reason she had the surgery was because she'd 'lost a lot of fullness and wanted some of my womanhood back'. 'My daughter had surgery done the year before and I was so impressed I had mine done,' she said. To keep up with the demand, cosmetic surgeons are trying to combat competitive packages offered in Asian countries by lowering the cost of carrying out the procedure. Some women over the age of 50 - even into their 70s - are claiming it is now cheaper to undergo breast augmentation surgery than they expected and more accessible. Ms Scheithe said she was surprised at the decreased cost, as The Cosmetic Institute in Parramatta, Sydney, charged her $5,990 for the operation. The institute said despite their usual clientele being women in their early 20s or women between the ages of 30 to 45 going under the knife post-baby, the demand for the discounted procedure is increasing. Deborah, pictured with her husband David, decided to undergo the procedure after she saw the results of her daughter's surgery . Recently they had a 70-year-old woman who underwent a boob job and a tummy tuck at their clinic after suddenly finding herself single. The Cosmetic Institute is also set to open a clinic in Bondi due to demand. In a similar vein, discounted boob jobs will be offered on the Gold Coast to compete against the increase in patients heading to Asia for cut-price surgery. In an Australian first, a cosmetic tourism agency based in Queensland's Broadbeach is teaming up with respected plastic surgeons to offer cheaper procedures. CosMediTour, along with Dr Craig Layt and Dr Luke Stradwick, are offering boob job holidays for about $7900. For those who just want the procedure done, it's $6880 - including an anaesthetist and the hospital stay. Through the new Gold Coast Breast Academy, the two doctors will train plastic surgeons for standard breast implants that can be offered at a cheaper price. Breast implants with a plastic surgeon cost $10,000 on average in Australia compared to $4000 in Thailand. Gold Coast girls Natalie Kernke, Anna Thomsen and Noi Aasen have all travelled to Thailand to get their boob jobs through CosMediTour . A Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach boob job holiday includes a nine-night stay, day surgery at Southport’s Pacific Private Hospital and a follow-up appointment six days after the surgery. There is also an option to upgrade to have a nurse monitor patients on the first night. And there is already interest coming from New Zealand and Perth, just days after the package went on offer. ‘There are people who don’t want to go to Thailand or are not comfortable to have surgery off-shore,' CosMediTour managing director Greg Lemon said. 'We don’t send anyone to plastic surgeons in Thailand...and we wanted to offer people the option of using plastic surgeons here. 'You can get cut price boob jobs in Australia, but not with plastic surgeons.' In Australia, a plastic surgeon has to be accepted into the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and study an extra five years to become qualified, where as a cosmetic doctor does not. CosMediTour currently sends about 100 patients every month jet to Bangkok or Phuket, with 80 per cent of them having breast implants. But there is a catch to getting discount breasts. The cheaper price is for implants up to 400ml and patients have to meet certain criteria. Mr Lemon said the procedure would be ideal for women with no sagging breasts or asymmetry because they would need different surgery. Gold Coast resident Anna Thomsen, who had a boob job in Bangkok, welcomed the discounted procedure to Australian shores. 'I think it’s a great idea having it on the Gold Coast because some people would be terrified of the idea of going to Thailand so it makes it a bit more convenient,' she said. According to Phuket International Hospital’s Peter Davison, there is a market for cheaper breast implants in Australia. He said out of 2000 cosmetic surgery cases a year 1600 were Australians, with 30 per cent from Queensland and that trend is growing. Mr Davison said the hospital was seeing a 30 per cent growth in numbers every year. CosMediTour is offering boob job holidays for $7900 in Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The bodies of three women who had been stabbed and had their throats cut were found at a home in Fort Worth, Texas, earlier today. The women - two sisters and an adult daughter - were discovered by the husband of one of the victims when he got home from work after a night shift. When the husband, James Serrano, called 911 just after 8am he yelled: 'They killed my family.' Crime scene: Police tape cordons off a Fort Worth home where the bodies of three women were found Tuesday morning . Shock: Grieving family and friends gather outside the Fort Worth home where three women were killed . The victims were named as Cynthia Serrano, 48, her 21-year-old daughter, April, and 35-year-old sister Cathy de Leon. All of the women appeared to have died from stab wounds, and their throats had been cut. Family and friends of the victims gathered outside the single-storey home in Fort Worth on Tuesday, as detectives and forensic experts gathered evidence. Anthony de Leon, who was Mrs Serrano and Mrs de Leon's brother, was overcome with grief as he said: 'Three innocent women; three innocent women.' 'If there’s anybody, anything they know, please help us ... These three ladies didn’t deserve this,' he told the Fort Worth Star Telegraph. He said that the women were alive and well when family members checked on them at about 10pm on Monday. Calling the triple murder a 'mystery', Mr de Leon said their bodies were discovered by Mrs Serrano's husband when he got back from work. Grief: Relatives and friends of the three victims comfort each other outside the house . Support: Family and friends gather for a moment of reflection as police stand guard outside the house . Investigators believe the women were . attacked at about 6.30am, but they have not released details about . possible suspects or motives. 'Shortly after 8 o’clock this morning, . Fort Worth police received a call about a possible homicide on the 500 . block of W. Felix Street.' Sergeant Raymond Bush, of Fort Worth Police, . told CBS DFW. 'Upon arrival officers found multiple deceased persons inside the residence.' Rosa Guerrero, whose aunt, Cynthia, was one of the victims, said: 'No one was expecting for this to happen to them.' She described her aunt as religious, and said she always attended Mass on a Sunday. The cries of the victims' family alerted neighbors to the tragedy. Lorena Hamilton, who lives a couple of houses away, said she heard police sirens and then a woman screaming. 'As I walked out here, I saw this woman screaming and crying, down on her knees,' Ms Hamilton said. 'She told me, ""They killed her family"".' Investigation: Police tape is used to block off the street around the home where the three victims were found . Mrs Serrano's husband, who alerted police to the murder, is being questioned by police, a family member told AP. Sergeant Bush told MailOnline was unable to confirm the nature of the injuries, or whether anyone was being questioned in the case. He said: 'Homicide has taken lead in the investigation, and there are no new details.' Sergeant Bush added that Tarrant County medical examiner's officer was expected to release details about the cause of death in the coming days.","Bodies were discovered at family home when husband returned from work .

"By . Associated Press . A social media expert who was the subject of a nationwide manhunt after authorities searched his San Francisco apartment has been charged with one count of possessing an illegal destructive device . Documents show that a search of a San Francisco social media expert's apartment turned up ball bearings, screws and components needed to make a homemade bomb. In an affidavit unsealed on Tuesday, FBI Special Agent Michael Eldridge says investigators found the materials inside a bag at the apartment of Ryan Kelly Chamberlain during a search over the weekend. Eldridge says the bag also contained a screw top glass jar with batteries and a wire, a circuit board and a model rocket motor. Search: Agents in hazardous material suits are seen as the FBI searches a building in San Francisco. Police said they captured Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II, 42, on Monday, shortly after announcing that they had found his car near the Golden Gate Bridge . The discovery prompted a nationwide . manhunt for the 42-year-old Chamberlain. He was arrested on Monday and . has been charged with one count of possession of an illegal destructive . device. The FBI has not said what, if any, plans Chamberlain had for the device. Chamberlain was arrested on Monday in his . car near Crissy Field, just south of the Golden Gate Bridge after a . three-day manhunt. He appeared in federal court on Tuesday in the same shirt and shorts he was arrested in. The FBI says authorities discovered materials at his home that could have caused great harm to the public. The 42-year-old Chamberlain was accompanied by a public defender but did not enter a plea. Charged: Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II has been charged with possessing bomb-making materials in his San Francisco apartment had the pieces necessary to build an improvised explosive device, the FBI and police said . It appears he also sent a suicide note to . his friends detailing reasons behind his extreme depression and what . may have led to his having dangerous explosives in his apartment. Chamberlain scheduled the three-page letter to be sent Monday morning using the service Hootsuite. Among . the factors behind his wracked state of mind were his mother's . religious zealotry, a bad break-up with a woman he called 'the one,' and . his failed career. Though it does not specifically say the . social media expert intended to end his life, the implication appears . clear in the letter, which Chamberlain ends by writing: 'Thank you. I'm . sorry. I love you.' A witness filmed Chamberlain being carted off by federal agents Monday afternoon in view of the Golden Gate Bridge (right) Brooke Wentz, his boss at a music rights consultancy group, said Chamberlain last contacted her Friday to remind her to deposit his paycheck in a new bank account. The conversation was uneventful and Wentz said she was 'tremendously dumbfounded' by the news that the contractor she had hired to handle her company's social media accounts was wanted by the FBI. 'He's a nice guy,' Wentz said. She said it didn't seem like Chamberlain was staying in his apartment. When she mailed him his paycheck in April, he told her he would have to go to the apartment to pick it up. She said he seemed to be under financial pressure because he told her that two friends who were leasing his apartment left without telling him and he had to scramble to pay for two rentals. 'I wondered what kind of friends would do something like that,' Wentz said. 'I tried to ask him about the situation, but he was kind of evading my question.' Randy Bramblett, a personal trainer, said he became friends with Chamberlain through Project Sport, a sports marketing company. The company let Chamberlain go when it was sold in November, and he soon lost touch with friends and stopped returning calls and messages, Bramblett said. Search: A hazmat crew searches Chamberlain's home on Saturday as part of a criminal investigation. The chemicals found in the apartment were not revealed as of Monday evening . Probe: Emergency services outside Chamberlain's apartment. Authorities were on the scene all weekend . Discovery: The back patio and sliding glass windows to Ryan Chamberlain's apartment at 1609 Jackson St in Russian Hill. The apartment remained sealed after FBI agents carried out a raid . Chamblerlain, a San Francisco social media maven and former political consultant who was wanted on suspicion of possessing explosives has been taken into custody after a three-day manhunt . 'We all knew that he was a very emotional guy and when he didn't get his . own way he would say, 'Screw you, I'm going to go do my own thing,'' Bramblett said. 'I've never seen him be violent, ever, but I would . definitely say that maybe emotionally and mentally he was a little . unstable.' Chamberlain had worked for years as a political consultant on Democratic campaigns, Bramblett said. It appears he also sent a suicide note to his friends detailing reasons behind his extreme depression and what may have led to his having dangerous explosives in his apartment. Chamberlain scheduled the three-page letter to be sent Monday morning using the service Hootsuite. Among the factors behind his wracked state of mind were his mother's religious zealotry, a bad break-up with a woman he called 'the one,' and his failed career. Though it does not specifically say the social media expert intended to end his life, the implication appears clear in the letter, which Chamberlain ends by writing: 'Thank you. I'm sorry. I love you.' Alex . Clemens, a partner of the San Francisco-based Barbary Coast Consulting, . said Chamberlain is well known the city's political circles and had . been a fixture on the campaign trails for more than a decade. His work . in the field ended several years ago. Clemens, who briefly hired Chamberlain for a project in 2009, said people who know Chamberlain are stunned. 'I . believe there's been a failure in his support system. I'm sad for . that,' Clemens said. 'I hope he will reach out to those who will help . him.' Chamberlain also worked as an independent contractor for The . San Francisco Chronicle during the 2012 NFL season, doing social media . to boost coverage for the San Francisco 49ers Insider iPad app, the . newspaper said. Sports lover: Ryan Chamberlain had also live-tweeted football games for the San Francisco Chronicle . The FBI arrived at Chamberlain's Russian Hill apartment Saturday with a search warrant, only to find him gone . Chamberlain also taught a 'Grass Roots Mobilization' course to graduate students in the public affairs program in 2011, said . Anne-Marie Devine, a spokeswoman for the University of San Francisco. Chamberlain taught for one semester and wasn't invited to teach another . course, she said. She said she didn't know why he was let go because hundreds of adjunct professors come and go at the university. No longer a threat: A picture of Ryan Chamberlain, a man in his 30s, found on his Twitter and Facebook pages.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A soldier who was struggling to raise her child claimed during a military court hearing in Fort Hood today that an army sergeant had enlisted her for a prostitution ring at the Texas base. Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen appeared in court over accusations that he recruited several cash-strapped female soldiers for an escort business. If convicted, the former coordinator for the base's sexual assault and harassment program could face court-martial. Hearing: Sergeant Gregory McQueen appeared before a Fort Hood military court on Tuesday over claims he set up a prostitution ring . The investigation into McQueen began in May last year, and he was charged in March with abusive sexual contact and other alleged misconduct. At his hearing today, a female soldier testified that McQueen had recruited her for a series of sexual encounters with senior officers. The witness claimed that McQueen first approached her for his 'escorting' business when she was 20, and struggling to pay off her student loans while raising a three-year-old child. She said McQueen asked her to send him pictures of herself so he could find clients who would be willing to pay to have sex with her, KWTX reported. The woman, who has not been named, alleged that McQueen visited her home on the Texas base and asked her to 'act out' on him what she would do with clients. She claimed that she had sex with McQueen at her home last year, and that she had lied to the Army Criminal Investigation Division until she had been given immunity. The soldier claimed that McQueen tried to get her to recruit other young servicewomen for the escort service. McQueen is facing charges of pandering, conspiracy, maltreatment of a subordinate, abusive sexual contact, adultery and detrimental conduct. The hearing is expected to last two days. A Fort Hood soldier has already been demoted and reprimanded in the case for conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery.","Sergeant Gregory McQueen faces charges of abusive sexual conduct .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Survivor: Traute Rankin, 74, lived in woodland for nearly a month after vanishing from her home . A 74-year-old woman survived for nearly a month in a Florida wood, by eating granola bars and drinking from discarded soda bottles. Traute Rankin, who was reported missing on May 2, was finally found on Saturday after she collapsed by the side of a road as she tried to get help. The 74-year-old, who is in the early stages of dementia and was suffering from paranoia, was severely dehydrated when she was spotted in bushes. Ms Rankin had created a makeshift camp for herself, with a blanket spread out under a palm tree, and a pillow created from a plastic bag filled with leaves. Granola bar wrappers and empty soda bottles were also found discarded around the section of woodland she had been living in. The elderly woman's daughter, Renee Shelley, told Click Orlando that her mother had survived by drinking the remnants of liquid from soda bottles discarded along a nearby road. 'When she couldn't find anymore of . those, she tried to walk to Walmart, but she was so dehydrated, she . collapsed before she got there,' Ms Shelley said. She added that her mother, who was found on Saturday, suffered from mental health issues that had caused her to become frightened and leave her apartment complex. After spending a couple of days in woodland, which was near her home, it is believed Ms Rankin became too scared to return to her home on a 55 and older estate. Shelter: The 74-year-old was sleeping on a blanket that she had spread underneath a palm tree . Supplies: Discarded soda bottles, which Rankin had collected from a nearby road, were found in her camp . 'She does have some paranoia issues. I'm assuming she was scared that she knew in her mind that someone was looking for her,' Ms Shelley told the Orlando Sentinel. Relief: Renee Shelley had been searching for her mother since May 2 . Her mother told her she had been trying to walk to Walmart when she turned off her usual path and went down an embankment and into the woods. Ms Rankin had left her cell phone at home on the day she disappeared, but did have a few granola bars in her purse. Police had been searching for Ms Rankin since her family reported her missing on May 2, and even used helicopters to try to spot her. Ms Shelley had been in the process of moving home when her mother disappeared. When she was found, she was close to the parking lot of the Walmart she had been trying to reach, so she could get a drink. 'She was a little bit confused when they found her,' police captain Rob HIcks said. He said although there was no evidence of abuse or criminal activity, police were fully investigating Ms Rankin's case. The 74-year-old, who was severely dehydrated and covered in bug bites, is still recovering in hospital.","Traute Rankin was found collapsed by a road as she tried to find water .

"By . Associated Press . and Joshua Gardner . Severe weather packing baseball-size hail, gushing rain and dangerously ferocious winds rolled into Nebraska on Tuesday afternoon as potentially dangerous storms targeted a number of Midwestern states. South Dakota and Iowa, where voters were casting ballots in primary elections, were also in the line of fire Tuesday evening as the National Weather Service said the highest risk for severe weather was centered in parts of northern and eastern Nebraska, Iowa, and northeast Missouri. Officials said there was the potential for a weather event called a derecho, which is a storm of strong straight-line winds spanning at least 240 miles, that could affect some 35 million people across the country's midsection. Gonna be a long one: Meteorologists warned Tuesday that severe weather that had already brought 80MPH winds, tornado warnings and massive hailstones to the Midwest was expected to last well into the night . The sky is falling: Residents of Nebraska, where the storm's fury was focused as evening began Tuesday, reported baseball-sized hail like these . 'This is one of these days we can't let our guard down,' said Bill Bunting, forecast operations chief at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. 'It's unfortunately panning out as we thought it would. This is shaping up as a very dangerous evening.' The weather could pack winds of up to 80 mph, large hail and up to 4 inches of rain. An outbreak of severe thunderstorms is forecast for the afternoon into the early hours of Wednesday. It is expected to also affect parts of Illinois, Kansas and South Dakota. Severe weather has been reported in Omaha, where the Eppley Airfield airport closed as officials wait out the effects of the storm system. Baseball-size hail was also reported in the northeast community of Norfolk, Nebraska. The bad weather has already had an impact on the primary elections in South Dakota. A thunderstorm forced Senate candidate Mike Rounds, who was flying to Rapid City, to land in Pierre. Secretary of State Jason Gant said he hopes the weather doesn't hurt voter turnout, but he wants people to be safe. 'If you're in Nebraska, Iowa, or Missouri, this is going to be a very long night,' said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers . Hailing down: Mindy Rump holds golf ball-sized hail stone (right) following a severe thunderstorm in Blair, Nebraska on Tuesday. at left, Collin O'Connell, a crane operator, holds pieces of hail that pummeled McHugh Metal in Norfolk, Nebraska . Derecho: The storm brought with it the potential for a derecho, a dangerous 240-plus mile long storm with severe winds that can affect millions across a broad area . Bunting said Iowa residents planning to vote Tuesday should be cautious about when they head out to the polls. 'There may be in many areas time to go out and do things before the storms hit. I think the main thing is to listen to the forecast, get some sense of when storms are likely in your area and just make sure you're in a safe place before the storms hit,' he said. The severe weather threat arrives amid an unusually quiet late spring, with far fewer documented tornadoes in May than in many recent years. Destructive: Car windows are blown out at a car dealership following Tuesday's severe thunderstorm in Blair, Nebraska . Looming: The edge of a storm approaches Norfolk, Nebraska on Tuesday as severe weather rolled into Nebraska and Iowa and dangerous storms targeted a broad swath of the Midwest .

Extensive damage was reported in Craig, Nebraska, including this severely warped steel structure and the unfortunate truck parked beside it . CNN meteorologist Chad Myers warned that the severe winds could pose the biggest risk even after the other dangers appear to have passed. 'The derecho is a big wad of storms...that charges ahead very quickly and pushes out a tremendous amount of wind,' Myers said. Myers urged residents in the affected region to stay indoors, perhaps for hours. 'If you're in Nebraska, Iowa, or Missouri, this is going to be a very long night,' Myers said.","Nebraska was directly in the line of fire as huge storm system carried potential to become a derecho, a 240+ mile storm with fierce winds .

"By . Associated Press . President Barack Obama described a surge in unaccompanied immigrant children caught trying to cross the Mexican border as an 'urgent humanitarian situation', on Monday. Obama discussed the issue as the White House asked Congress for an extra $1.4 billion in federal money to cope. The president said the U.S. will temporarily house the children at two military bases. President Barack Obama pictured speaking in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on Monday . Obama appointed the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate, to be in charge of the situation. In . its new estimates, the government said as many as 60,000 children, . mostly from Central America, could be caught this year trying to cross . the Mexican border illegally, costing the U.S. more than $2.28 billion . to house, feed and transport the children to shelters or reunite them . with relatives already living in the United States. The . new estimate is about $1.4 billion more than the government asked for . in Obama's budget request sent to Congress earlier this year. In the last eight months alone, 47,000 children have been apprehended at the Southwest Border. Obama described the growing humanitarian issue at the border in a presidential memorandum on Monday that outlined a government-wide response led by Fugate. Obama's director of domestic policy, Cecilia Munoz, said the number of children traveling alone has been on the rise since 2009, but the increase was larger than last year. Munoz said the group also now includes more girls and larger numbers of children younger than 13. 'All of these things are contributing to the sense of urgency,' Munoz said. 'These are children who have gone through a harrowing experience alone. We're providing for their proper care.' In the last eight months alone, 47,000 children have been apprehended at the Southwest Border . The growth has surpassed the system's capacity to process and house the children. Last month, the federal government opened an emergency operations center at a border headquarters in South Texas to help coordinate the efforts and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Health and Human Services Department, turned to the Defense Department for the second time since 2012 to help house children in barracks at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio. Mark Greenberg, an assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, said about 1,000 children were being housed at the Texas base and as many as 600 others could soon be housed at a U.S. Navy base in Southern California. The number of children found trying to cross the Mexican border without parents has skyrocketed in recent years. The number of children found trying to cross the Mexican border (pictured) without parents has skyrocketed in recent years . Between 2008 and 2011, the number of children landing in the custody of Refugee Resettlement fluctuated between 6,000 and 7,500 per year. In 2012 border agents apprehended 13,625 unaccompanied children and that number surged even more — to over 24,000 — last year. The total is expected to exceed 60,000 this year. More than 90 percent of those sheltered by the government are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, many driven north by pervasive violence and poverty in their home countries. They are held in agency-contracted shelters while a search is conducted for family, a sponsor or a foster parent who can care for them through their immigration court hearings, where many will apply for asylum or other special protective status. Rampant crime and poverty across Central . America and a desire to reunite with parents or other relatives are . thought to be driving many of the young immigrants . Border Patrol agents have said that smugglers are increasingly notifying authorities once they get children across the Rio Grande so that they can be picked up. Rampant crime and poverty across Central America and a desire to reunite with parents or other relatives are thought to be driving many of the young immigrants. Munoz said Monday the administration is aware of false rumors that have circulated that migrant children who get to this country would be automatically allowed to stay here or benefit from some future immigration reform legislation. Migrant kids remain in removal proceedings even after they're reunited with their parents here, though many have been able to win permission from a judge to stay in the U.S. The Office of Management and Budget said in a two-page letter to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, last month that the increase in children trying to cross the border alone could cost the government as much as $2.28 billion. The administration originally asked Congress for $868 million for the Unaccompanied Alien Children program run by Health and Human Services, the same amount Congress approved last year. Brian Deese, deputy director of the budget office, said the Homeland Security Department would also need an extra $166 million to help pay overtime costs for Customs and Border Protection officers and agents, contract services for care of the children and transportation costs. A House appropriations subcommittee voted last week to add $77 million to the original request. Deese sent the letter to Mikulski a day after the House subcommittee vote.","90% of those sheltered by the government after crossing are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador .

"By . David Mccormack . and Dan Bloom . Legendary Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino wants to withdraw from a concussion lawsuit filed against the NFL in federal court last week, claiming he had joined the litigation in error. The Hall of Famer and his lawyers are looking into how his name was joined to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. ‘It was never Marino’s intention to initiate litigation in this case, but to ensure that in the event he had adverse health consequences down the road, he would be covered with health benefits. They are working to correct the error,’ a source told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Legendary Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino wants to withdraw from a concussion lawsuit filed against the NFL in federal court last week, claiming he had joined the litigation in error . Marino has said he sustained two concussions during his 17-year playing career, which ended in 1999. He worked as an NFL analyst for CBS until last year. The Los Angeles Times reported on Monday that the former quarterback had joined 14 other players to sue the league. They joined more than 4,800 others who have alleged the NFL misrepresented the long-term dangers of concussions. The NFL has denied those claims. An original settlement worth $765 million, reached last August, was rejected by a federal judge in January as being insufficient. Miami Herald columnist Armando Salguero has speculated that Marino didn't expect the 'backlash' over the NFL suit . Then and now: Marino with his head bowed in defeat at the Super Bowl of 1985 (left). Right, at an event in 2009 . The lawsuit doesn't specify which medical problems are suffered by the retired players. But it says they have included headaches, dizziness, loss of memory, dementia, depression, impulse control, impulsivity to anger, physical disability, embarrassment, and a 'loss of the pleasures of life'. And it is similar in wording to several previous lawsuits, accusing the NFL of 'carelessness, negligence, intentional misconduct and concealment of information' directly connected with the players' injuries. The 18-page document, seen by MailOnline, says the plaintiffs are seeking damages to be decided by a jury for long-term or chronic injuries, along with funds for medical treatment. 'Despite knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades' Complaint filed with district court in Philadelphia . 'For over 40 years [the NFL] have continuously and fervently denied that it knew, should have known or believed there to be any relationship between NFL players suffering concussions while playing, the NFL policies concerning tackling methodology,' the complaint says. It adds that evidence showing concussion causes the brain condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been readily available 'for more than 100 years'. The complaint notes that the most dangerous tackles - where players used their heads as a 'weapon' - were outlawed in the late 1970s. But it adds that the laws were not well-enforced, saying: 'The NFL wanted to keep its fan base excited by the visual exhilaration witnessing such hazardous techniques. 'Despite the NFL’s knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades.' Later loopholes, it alleged, 'demonstrated Defendant’s selfish desire to keep the fan base entertained and interested in the violence of the sport of football.' Commentators say claims by such a titan of the NFL will add credibility to one side of a long-running dispute which escalated into a series of House of Representatives hearings four years ago. Super Bowl: Dan Marino (right) played a starring role in 1985 in the biggest event of the NFL calendar . Fame: Dan Marino in 1985 (left) and 1988 (right). He amassed several NFL records during his 17-year career .

Bruce Clark (1982-89) Some 4,500 former football players . filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL, claiming the League had . not warned them enough about the dangers of concussion. The NFL agreed on a $765 million settlement with that group of players last August, but it was . rejected by a federal judge in January. The news has come days after President Obama said more research should be carried out on the effects of concussion on young athletes. He hosted a White House summit last week at which he was . introduced by Victoria Bellucci, a high school graduate from . Huntingtown, Maryland, who suffered five concussions during her high . school and club soccer career and said they 'drastically altered' her life. The President said a new attitude is needed where players who have been hit don't feel wimpy for sitting out a game or two. 'We have to change a culture that says you suck it up,' Obama said, adding that he probably suffered mild concussions as a young football player. He added: 'We want our kids participating in sports. As parents, though, we want to keep them safe.' Marino is by far the longest-serving of . the 15 latest players to sue the NFL. The list also includes Dwight . Wheeler, 59, a center for the Los Angeles Raiders and New England . Patriots who played for nine seasons. Elsewhere . on the list is defensive tackle Bruce Clark, now 56, who played for . eight seasons, all but one of them for the New Orleans Saints. Former Chicago Bears player Peter Manning, who is the oldest plaintiff at age 76, is also seeking compensation for his wife. In his prime: Marino playing the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s. He remained with the Dolphins for 17 years . Marino was a quarterback at the University of Pittsburgh when he was picked to join the Miami Dolphins in 1983. He remained with the team for 17 . seasons - the whole of his NFL career - and won several honours and . records, amassing an eye-popping 4,967 of 8,358 passes for 61,361 yards, . 242 games and 420 touchdowns. Just . a year after he joined the team, Marino played with the Dolphins in the . 1984 season Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers. Though . the Dolphins were thrashed 38-16, the match was hyped as a battle of . the quarterbacks between 23-year-old Marino and the 49ers' more . experienced Joe Montana. His passing skills were the stuff of legend, and in 13 games he threw for more than 400 yards. He was inaugurated into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, dedicating his speech to his father. Mystery: The court filings do not specify what injuries the legendary quarterback suffered . That was only after he had passed into legend in popular culture. He . played himself in the 1994 box office hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective . and guest starred in an episode of the Simpsons in which Homer and Bart . visit the Super Bowl.

"By . Leon Watson . A newly-released tape has revealed the incredible moment a pilot realised Somali stowaway Yahya Abdi had been hiding on his plane. The tape runs from about an hour after the 15-year-old was discovered on a Hawaii runway in April. Incredibly, the pilot seems completely nonplussed. He is preparing to depart when he tells air traffic controllers he will be a bit delayed because 'a guy is seeming to have stowed away in the landing gear from San Jose to Maui.' Scroll down for video . Surveillance video provided by the Hawaii Department of Transportation, shows a California teen, left, after hopping from a jet's wheel well in Maui, Hawaii . The pilot was referring to Abdi, a Somali immigrant who ran away from his Santa Clara, California, home. He then claimed to have hopped a fence at Mineta San Jose International Airport and climbed into the wheel well of the closest plane. The jet took off a few hours later for a five-and-a-half-hour flight to Maui on April 20. Abdi improbably survived the flight at 35,000 feet despite low oxygen and freezing temperatures. Video footage from the Maui airport shows him dropping to the tarmac about an hour after the jet landed. But when it was time for that same jet to leave, the pilot, who was a different pilot than the one who had landed the jet there, said security and mechanics were holding him up, according to a 10-minute Federal Aviation Administration audio recording. 'Um, we have a little gate delay here. A guy is seeming to have stowed away in the landing gear from San Jose to Maui, so we have security in there looking for evidence of the guy being up there for more than, you know, ha, five minutes on the ground. Captured on camera: Hawaii transportation officials have released video of a California teen hopping from a jet's wheel (pictured) well after stowing away for a 5 1/2-hour flight to Maui . 'So we'll let you know when we're ready to push,' says the pilot of outbound Hawaiian Airlines Flight 24, heading for Oakland. 'All right, 24, have your roger,' says an air traffic controller, confirming he received and understood the message. 'You need any assistance with that or, er, you guys got it?' 'Nope, plenty of security here, mechanics, it's all good, we just kind of waiting for clearance to go,' says the pilot, explaining that once the crews agree the plane is undamaged, they'll give him the go-ahead. The controller is calm, routine, in his response, telling the pilot he can back away from the ramp when he's ready, because the tower doesn't have jurisdiction over that part of the airport: 'Roger, thanks, well it will be push back at your discretion.' Incredible: Yahya Abdi (pictured left and right) miraculously survived a more than five hour flight from California to . Hawaii hidden in a plane's wheel well .

Pilot: 'Okey doke, thanks.' Hiding place: Yahya Abdi climbed into the plane wheel well of Hawaiian Airlines jet (pictured) and lost consciousness after the plane took off . 'Okey doke, thanks,' says the pilot. The boy was hospitalized in Hawaii for two weeks, then flown back to California where he was placed in custody of Santa Clara County Child Protective Services. A county spokesman said yesterday he cannot disclose the boy's whereabouts. His father did not respond to an interview request. Hawaiian Airlines spokeswoman Alison Croyle said the crew of the departing flight had been told about the stowaway and the activity going on around their aircraft. She said the pilot contacted the controller because once an aircraft has received the en route clearance, there is an expectation from the air traffic control tower that the aircraft is prepared to depart and will push back shortly. 'In this instance, the pilot was advising Air Traffic Control of the delay and providing an explanation to the best of his knowledge,' said Croyle. The FAA planned to provide a public link to the audio today. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tape runs from that about an hour after Yahya Abdi was discovered .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . In the weeks after the Boston Marathon bombings, two small planes were used to spy on Khairullozhon Matanov, a friend of the brothers suspected of carrying out the attack. Residents in Quincy, Massachusetts, reported several sightings of two Cessna-type light aircraft doing loops over their town. A law enforcement source has now confirmed that the aircraft were part of a surveillance operation focusing on Matanov, who knew Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Under watch: Khairullozhon Matanov, a friend of the Boston bombers, was the focus of a year-long investigation . Surveillance: Light aircraft, similar to this Cessna pictured, were spotted looping over Matanov's hometown of Quincy for a month after the bombings . Matanov was charged last week with obstructing a terror investigation and deleting information from a computer. The 23-year-old was friends with the Tsarnaev brothers, who are believed to have carried out the attacks, and even dined with them hours hours after the April 15, 2013 bombings. The FBI had been investigating Matanov since April 19, after the Krygyzstan-born cab driver told police about their friendship. Quincy councilman Brian Palmucci said soon after, two planes were spotted doing figure-of-eight loops over the town. 'My phone was ringing off the hook. People were concerned. It started a couple of weeks after the bombing . and lasted for over a month,' Mr Palmucci told ABC News. Residents took down the tail numbers, and the police contacted the Federal Aviation Authority after reports of the drone-like aircraft. Arrest: Khairullozhon Matanov, second left, appeared in court on Friday on charges of obstructing a terror investigation . But the FAA told Mr Palmucci: 'It's not a drone, we're aware of the flight and it's authorized.' The . councilman said that secrecy surrounding the flights had made his . community - already on edge after the bombings - even more nervous. 'There was no doubt they were looking at . our neighborhood so folks were very uneasy and they started to question . whether there was some imminent public danger,' he said. A source close to the investigation into Matanov confirmed to the Patriot Ledger . that the aircraft were used as part of a surveillance operation into . the young man. Investigators kept him under surveillance for about a . year. Friend: Cab driver Matanov, pictured, knew the brothers suspected of carrying out the bombings, and took them out for dinner just hours after two devices were detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon . When Matanov appeared in court last week, he entered no plea to the charges against him, and was held in detention. He is facing charges of destroying records and making a false statement in a terrorism investigation. Matanov, who was given U.S. residency because of unrest in his home country, also allegedly met the Tsarnaev brothers and spoke to them in the days after the April 15 attack. He is not believed to have had prior knowledge of the attacks, and didn't know the brothers were suspects until after police released their pictures on April 18.","Residents reported seeing two planes for a month after the terror attack .

"By . Dan Bloom . A pioneering scientist hailed as the 'godfather of ecstasy' for creating the dance drug in its modern form has died aged 88. For more than 40 years Alexander Shulgin experimented at his home in Berkley, California, testing his chemical creations on himself, friends and family before they could be outlawed. Last night his wife and research partner, Ann, said he had died peacefully while listening to Buddhist meditation music after being diagnosed with liver cancer. Pioneer: Dr Alexander Shulgin refined the composition of MDMA, which had been created in 1912, and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today. In just a few years it flooded nightclubs . Venerated: Though a controversial figure for many, Dr Shulgin was revered by those in favour of legalisation . Thanking his fans for their support, she wrote: 'Sasha died today, at exactly 5 o'clock in the afternoon. 'He was surrounded by family and caretakers and Buddhist meditation music, and his going was graceful, with almost no struggle at all. Thanks to all of you, and Blessings.' She previously wrote: 'Sasha knows that he's dying, but that doesn't bother him. 'He doesn't know he has cancer of the liver, and there's no need for him to know; that knowledge would give him nothing useful. Peaceful life: Dr Shulgin with his wife and research partner Ann, who announced his death . 'After all, as he has said, ""We all have to die of something!""' Dr Alexander 'Sasha' Shulgin refined the composition of MDMA, which had been created in Germany in 1912, and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today. In just a few years the drug had flooded the nightclubs of the world and was closely associated with the party island of Ibiza. But the early life of Dr Shulgin, the son of a Russian immigrant, was more humble and mainstream. After gaining a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of California, he began working for the giant Dow Chemical Company in the late 1950s. While he developed industrial chemicals in his day job - including the world's first biodegradable pesticide - his time off became increasingly devoted to researching psychoactive compounds. He synthesised and fine-tuned hundreds of drugs, most famously methyl-enedioxy-methylamphetamine (MDMA). Although the drug was more than half a century old, he was the first person to extensively test its effects on the brain. He was astounded by the results - and word of the formula quickly spread around the world. He became celebrated among those campaigning for drugs to be legalised, and wrote several books. Career: The scientist, from California, began his long career at the Dow Chemical Company in the 1950s . The drug shot its way into national headlines after the death of Essex teenager Leah Betts, below, who took just one tablet at her 18th birthday party in 1995. An inquest heard she died of swelling on the brain because she drank too much water to counter the effects of the drug. Toxicologist Professor John Henry told the inquest: 'If Leah had taken the drug alone she might well have survived. If she had drunk the amount of water alone she would have survived.' The verdict - used as ammunition by both sides of the drugs debate - was all too common. Although ecstasy has been mentioned on dozens of death certificates, it is notoriously difficult to determine whether the drug alone is responsible because of other factors. The debate has since shifted to more powerful drugs in the same family, which are often sold as ecstasy with devastating results. In October an inquest heard how Bolton car welder Chris Goodwin, 30, and his friend Emma Johnson, 21, died within minutes of each other after taking up to five times a lethal dose of Para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA) - almost certainly without realising what it was. A spokesman for drug advice service Frank said: 'A big problem with ecstasy is that it’s rarely pure. Sometimes, there is no MDMA at all. Sometimes, it contains other drugs, like PMA, which can be fatal. 'Regardless of what it looks like and what it is called, you can’t be sure what’s in a pill or a powder and you can’t predict how you’ll react.' But he . became a controversial figure after the death of Leah Betts, an Essex . schoolgirl who died after taking a single tablet of ecstasy at her 18th . birthday party. A . 2001 profile in the Mail on Sunday described him as a . grandfather-of-five who walked with a fragile shuffle, drove a battered . VW and had passion for Mozart which included playing the viola. At the time - when fears over the drug in Britain were at their height - he said: 'If they keep it a Class A drug it is sad but I am heartened there has been a debate over lessening controls. 'It demonstrates a slow shifting of attitude. It may take time but Britain will eventually realise there's no danger from ecstasy. He added: 'I think it's very healthy to explore the legalisation of cannabis, to see if it helps or hurts. The real trouble comes from the social damage done by enforcing these unfair laws which break up families when drug users are jailed. 'People are hurt far more by that than by the drugs.' At one time he was venerated by the U.S. establishment, writing the classic reference book Controlled Substances, A Chemical And Legal Guide To Federal Drugs Laws. But when Dr Shulgin pronounced his personal belief in psychedelics and advocated that all drugs should be legalised, officials changed their tune. Federal drugs agents raided his lab, took away most of his equipment and revoked his permit. In 1995, Dr Shulgin expressed regret that the drug - banned in the U.S. in 1986 - had attracted controversy. 'These rave scenes have added kindling to the fire of governmental disapproval,' he said. 'Its very excellent potential for being used as medicine has been badly jeopardised.'","Pioneering scientist died peacefully of cancer at home in Berkley, California .

"The engagements’ diary of a Second World War army general has revealed that he wrote off the week of the D-Day landings by scribbling a line through it. General Sir Miles ‘Bimbo’ Dempsey made notes of top secret meetings he held with Allied commanders in the weeks and months leading up to and after the week beginning June 6, 1944 in the black book.

The engagements' diary of a World War Two army general has revealed that he wrote off the week of the D-Day landings by scribbling a line through it. Sir Miles 'Bimbo' Dempsey made notes of top secret meetings he held with Allied commanders leading up to and after the week beginning June 6, 1944 in the black book . A modest man, Sir Miles was one of the most important wartime generals but is almost completely unknown because of his determination to stay out of the limelight.

Dempsey marked in pencil ‘D+1’, ‘D+2’ and so on and also noted which . divisions of his army had landed. The mysterious gesture comes to light as hundreds of surviving D-Day veterans prepare to revisit the beaches of Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings. Events to commemorate the historic invasion of northern France will take place across the UK and also around the pivotal beaches themselves - code-named Utah, Omaha, Sword, Gold and Juno.

Andrew . Currie, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The Dempsey material offers a . wonderful opportunity to highlight the career of a soldier who in many . ways became the forgotten man of D-Day. 'The . many warm letters of congratulations from Eisenhower and Montgomery . show just how much they valued his calm leadership of the huge 2nd Army . and in particular the way he approached the unglamorous task of pinning . down the German troops and tanks in the immediate aftermath of D-Day. 'Unlike . most of the senior figures involved in D-Day, General Dempsey did not . write his memoires so the tributes from his fellow offices have a . special significance. 'They . speak loudly and impartially for the vitally important contribution he . made both then and during the rest of the war in which he served with . such distinction. 'General .

Photographs showing the German deputation at General Sir Miles Dempsey's tactical headquarters on 3 May 1945 . The landings on June 6, 1944 involved a combination of British, Canadian, American and French forces, including hundreds of units from the Royal Navy. About 132,000 Royal Marines and Allied soldiers were transported by ships and injected onto the beaches of Normandy by landing craft and sea boat. More than 23,000 arriving by air, according to the Ministry of Defence, and the RAF and allied air forces provided air support with 11,000 aircraft. Landings: The D-Day attacks remain the largest seaborne invasion ever. Picture is the scene on Omaha beach in Normandy as U.S. forces poured ashore . D-Day was the largest seaborne invasion ever launched and opened the gateway to victory for the British and allied forces to bring the Second World War to an end. Around 10,000 troops and civilians were killed but the actual figure has never been discovered. To mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day, an international flotilla of ships will sail through the channel to Normandy before an international ceremony on Sword Beach.Services led by the British and the French will be held at Bayeux Cathedral followed by an event at the Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery. It also includes four unofficial photos of the moment the German high command tried to surrender to him at his headquarters in Germany on May 3, 1945. General Demspey sent the German deputation away as, by protocol, they had to surrender to Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery, which they did the following day. And a signed photo of US army supremo Eisenhower in which he described ‘Bimbo’ as ‘brilliant army commander of World War II’ is included. He led the British 2nd Army in the Battle of Normandy, where his men occupied the German forces at Caen, allowing the Americans to push into northern France. His family have decided to sell some of the wartime mementos ahead of the 70th anniversary of D-Day. The archive has a pre-sale estimate of almost £40,000.

"By . Associated Press . Panera says it will remove artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners and preservatives from its food by 2016, a reflection of the growing distaste people are showing for such ingredients. The chain of bakery cafes, which has about 1,800 U.S. locations, is making the pledge as part of a 'Food Policy' it is unveiling Tuesday that outlines its commitment to 'clean' and 'simple' ingredients. The announcement comes at a time when Panera Bread Co. is facing slowing sales growth and working to jumpstart its business through a variety of means, such as revamping the sometimes confusing way people order and get food and switching baking hours to the daytime to create a homier feel in cafes. Change of taste: Panera Bread Co. is making a pledge to remove artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners and preservatives from its menu items by 2016 . The unveiling of Panera's sweeping 'Food Policy' also underscores how positioning foods as natural has become a marketing advantage, regardless of whether it brings any nutritional benefits. Part of the attraction for customers is that they feel better about what they're eating, sometimes because they don't feel as guilty about how many calories they're consuming. Chipotle, for instance, has gained in popularity in part by portraying itself as a more wholesome alternative to traditional fast-food chains like McDonald's. Even Subway recently said it would stop using azodicarbonamide in its breads. The ingredient was dubbed the 'yoga mat' chemical after a petition by Vani Hari, who runs FoodBabe.com, noted it was used to make yoga mats. Healthier options: St. Louis-based Panera said it is about halfway through removing artificial ingredients from its menu, but is still looking for ways to remove artificial colors and preservatives from products such as its bakery icings . Among the additives that will be dumped from these Panera foods: . Still, declaring foods as being natural or free of artificial ingredients has the potential to invite criticism and even legal troubles. A lawsuit filed in November, for instance, alleges that Whole Foods Market uses a 'spectacular array' of artificial ingredients in some of its store-brand products, despite the grocer's promise that the products contain 'nothing artificial.' Panera also isn't swearing off genetically modified ingredients, another issue that is gaining attention in certain circles. Unlike Chipotle, which says its menu will soon be free of GMOs, Panera uses too many different ingredients to be able to make that claim. And neither chain has any plans to stop selling fountain sodas from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, even though the drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. As for the rest of its menu, Panera says it's about halfway through the removal of artificial ingredients. It's still looking for ways to removes the artificial colors used in its bakery icings, for instance, and is testing a smoked ham in select markets that doesn't use artificial preservatives. Growing trend: The latest move comes as several other like-minded chains ¿ including Chipotle and Starbucks ¿ also have pushed to reduce artificial additives . 'We decided it was time to put all this into a clear and concise policy,' Ron Shaich, Panera's founder and CEO, said in an interview. Ten years ago, for instance, Panera announced that it would use chicken raised without antibiotics, a move Shaich said helped significantly drive sales. Panera's new policy also states the chain's commitment to 'transparency,' meaning it will make it easy for people to see the ingredients and nutritional content of its food. It also says it will work to have a 'positive impact' on the food system, such as by supporting North American suppliers whenever possible. Whether the new policy helps attract more customers is yet to be seen. Last year, Panera's sales rose 2.6 percent at company-owned locations open at least a year. That was down from 6.5 percent in 2012 and 4.9 percent in 2011. This year, the St. Louis-based company is forecasting sales growth of 2 to 3.5 percent.","Pledge made to remove artificial colors, .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A charity bookkeeper stole more than $800,000 meant for veterans and spent it on holidays, internet shopping, and gifts for her family, according to police. Cynthia Tanner worked for the National Veterans Services Fund (NVSF) in Darien, Connecticut, taking care of staff payroll and handing out cheques to help veterans in need. But officers allege the 52-year-old used her position to write out cheques totalling $830,000 over five years, which she then cashed herself or gave to relatives. Cynthia Tanner, 52, has been charged with first degree larceny after police say she embezzled $830,000 of charity money and spent it on car loans, shopping and holidays . She was arrested after an audit at NVSF uncovered irregularities in the accounts, and appeared in court yesterday accused of writing 135 cheques totalling $185,000 - which prosecutors say is the amount stolen in 2013 alone. According to the affidavit, Tanner made seven payments for car loans totalling nearly $3,500, wrote 16 cheques to her 23-year-old daughter totaling $42,525, and 17 checks to her 25-year-old son totaling . $19,925. Police say she changed entries in the charity's financial records to make it look as if the payments had gone to veterans, while actually pocketing the money. Tanner was charged with first degree larceny, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail and $15,000 in fines, at Stamford Superior Court. She was remanded in custody on a $500,000 bail to appear again on June 30. Tanner worked at the National Veterans Services Fund (pictured) and was in charge of payroll and handing out cheques to the needy. Police claim she used her position to pocket money for herself . According to NBC Connecticut Tanner had worked for NVSF since 2008, a charity organisation which handed out welfare cheques to retired servicemen and women in need. They money was used to pay for mobility scooters, access ramps, utility bills, snow tyres and vet's bills for veterans' companion animals across the country. The Connecticut Post reported that Tanner claimed she took advances from the charity, but had paid all the money back. She also claimed she was liable to forget things after having brain surgery, but when told the allegations date from before the operation, she went quiet. A statement from the charity said that it is still in operation and reassured donors that any money given will be safe.","Cynthia Tanner worked at National Veterans Services Fund from 2008 .

"By . Ruth Styles . Most of us like to dab on a little perfume in the morning but, for most of us, the fragrance only lasts until lunchtime. Now a jewellery brand has come to the rescue of those who hate carrying clunky bottles around, courtesy of a set of pendants and bracelets that emit fragrance. Although OBO bijoux look like stylishly modern jewels, each pendant is actually a mini perfume bottle that can be detached from the chain and used in the same way as a roll-on scent. Looking good: A model poses in an OBO black and white bracelet which contains a mini perfume bottle . While the perfume inside lasts no longer than a regular scent, around six hours, wearing it around your neck means no more carrying bottles around. 'The simple idea behind OBO is to apply perfume, anytime and anywhere,' explains designer, Julien Cohen, 29, from Paris. 'We wanted to make a beautiful accessory that can perfume your skin.' Mr Cohen, who is currently running an Indiegogo crowd-funding campaign in an attempt to raise the money to put his big idea into production, hopes the product will find favour with busy women hoping to make their life a little bit easier. And to ensure the final design is completely fool-proof, he has been conducting an extensive series of tests to rule out embarrassing spillages. Stylish: A £49 OBO perfumed cuff (left) and the perfumed pendant, which will cost £57, left . 'The . perfume is leak-proof and it has been tested under high . pressures to ensure that our roll-on gives the same results as a classic . pump dispenser,' he reveals. The OBO range, which comes in a choice of black or white bracelets and necklaces, uses magnets to attach the perfume bottles to their chains and will cost between £49 and £57. Once launched, the range will include eight different fragrances, which will be sold in sets of three capsules alongside the jewellery. 'We worked with the perfumers Amélie Bourgeois and Anne-Sophie Behaghel and they created eight unique fragrances,' adds Mr Cohen. 'Each piece of jewellery contains around 3ml of perfume which gives between 20 and 25 applications on the skin.'","Julien Cohen, 29, from Paris, is the designer behind the new OBO range .

"By . Dan Bloom . A rural section of train line was plunged into chaos after high winds derailed two huge freight trains - by blowing one into the other. The accident during a storm near Waynoka, Oklahoma, delayed around 60 trains on an intercontinental track and prompted a full-scale cleanup operation. But investigators had to be cautious - as one of the cars reportedly contained fireworks. Oklahoma! Where the wind comes sweeping up the trains: The intercontinental BNSF line was plunged into chaos after high winds derailed two huge freight trains  by blowing one into the other . Scale: Workers had to remove the huge trains yesterday as the backlog reached a reported 60 services . The trains - each a mile long - crashed just after 11pm during a fierce storm on Sunday night. Residents had been warned winds could reach 70mph. According to FOX 25, one of the carriages contained fireworks which it was feared could have been made unstable after the two trains toppled. Storm chaser Shane Helton, 40, told MailOnline the BNSF Railway Company had issued orders for both trains to slow down just 12 minutes before the accident happened. 'BNSF issued a high wind warning to slow down,' he said. 'The trains were slowing down and the derailment happened at 11.14pm'. When the sun rose, the scene was one of containers toppled over, some of them ripped open with their contents spread across the railway. But despite the chaos, no one was injured. Cleanup: Diggers move the stricken compartments of the freight train derailed in Oklahoma yesterday . Disruption: As the cross-continental backlog increased, engineers worked furiously to remove the trains . As the cross-continental backlog increased, engineers worked furiously to remove the trains and, incredibly, managed to reopen the line in time for this morning. It is thought the crash may have been caused by straight-line winds, a phenomenon created when a thunderstorm creates a downburst of air, forcing out strong blasts in all directions. Mr Helton, who works on an oil field, added: 'I see a lot of things but it's been about 10 years since I saw a derailment like this. 'The trains are over a mile long so you're looking at probably at least 100 containers per train' - Storm chaser Shane Helton, 40 . 'We get between 60 and 80 trains a day and when you get a severe thunderstorm like we did on Sunday these things can happen. 'The trains are over a mile long so you're looking at probably at least 100 containers per train. 'They were unbelievably fast at cleaning it up. They laid track panels like you do on a model railway, several other firms were called to help and the trains were running past my house this morning.' The incident came just a day after another BNSF train carrying a hazardous liquid derailed at a yard in Tulsa, around 200 miles away. The railway yard was evacuated while the leak of xylene, which is highly flammable, was dealt with. The high winds on the Great Plains which sweep through Oklahoma are even immortalised in one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most famous musicals. Great Plains: The location of the crash on Sunday night. Wind warnings had reached a reported 70mph . The title song of Oklahoma! declares it as the land 'where the wind comes sweeping down the plain', a badge worn proudly by some locals. But the area has also had more than its share of train wrecks. A train more than 40 containers long spilt its load of beer all over the railway in August last year - in the exact same spot as Sunday night's incident. And in 2008, a train carrying crude oil and ethanol sent fireballs into the sky when it derailed in Oklahoma City. No one was injured.","Around 60 trains were held up after the crash near Waynoka, Oklahoma .

"By . Associated Press . and Kieran Corcoran . When Vincent van Gogh cut off his own left ear in a moment of madness more than a century ago, he wanted it to make a big impact. However, even the great artist could not have anticipated that his severed organ - wrapped up and delivered to a French brothel - would be grown afresh and put on display a year later. But now, thanks to new technology, a replica has been generated by a 3D-printer from genetic material donated by one of van Gogh's living relatives. Undated picture shows an ear made of human cells grown from samples provided from a distant relative from Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, in the center for art and media in Karlsruhe, Germany, Tuesday, June 3, 2014.  US based artist Diemut Strebe said she wants to combine art and science with the installation. (AP Photo/Diemut Strebe.Sugababe) Lieuwe van Gogh, the . great-great-grandson of Vincent's brother Theo, donated cartilege from . his own ear, which was replicated by the machine into an accurate . re-creation. The Center . for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, grew the ear in a U.S. hospital and are keeping it in a biological preservative. Diemut Strebe, who is behind the project, said: 'I use science basically like a type of brush, like Vincent used paint'. Van Gogh was a Dutch painter who was most active in the 1880s, and had a major influence on 20th Century art. He is best-known for still life paintings - particularly a vibrant painting of sunflowers in a vase - and self-portraits. He was also noted for his tumultuous personal life, and killed himself aged 37. Artist: Vincent Van Gogh, as pictured in a self-portrait. He hacked his own ear off in 1888 . An entry on the museum's website explains: 'The ear is grown from tissue engineered cartilage and is “identical” in shape to van Gogh’s ear by using computer imaging technology. 'It is composed of living cells that contain natural genetic information about him as well as engineered components, replicating in the ear as a “living art-piece”.' According to Ms Strebe, Lieuwe van Gogh 'loved the project right away'. Lieuwe and Vincent van Gogh share about 1/16th of the same genes, including the Y-chromosome that is passed down the male lineage. But hopes of using genetic material that belonged to the post-Impressionist master himself were dashed when DNA extracted from an envelope turned out to belong to someone else. Still, work is underway with a female relative to include mitochondrial DNA - passed down the mother's line - for future installations. The exhibition, at which visitors can speak into the ear through a microphone, lasts until July 6. Strebe said she plans to display the ear in New York next year.","Center .

"By . Katy Winter . Clinically obese Chris Dune, who weighed in at 310lb, or just over 22st, deployed his passion for technology in his quest to lose weight, tracking all aspects of his food intake, activities and excursions. Chris, 45, is an independent consultant based in Denver and works extensively with technology. As part of his job, he is connected up to hundreds of data-tracking tools, leading his nickname as 'the most quantified human on earth'. Chris eventually realised he could use these tools to lose weight: ‘Looking at that data brings up an . amazing array of life hacks that you can use. I like to think of it as . fast-track enlightenment.’ Chris admits he used to smoke, drink and eat too much and felt his job allowed him to continue his bad habits . Chris knew his weight was an issue and . dangerous for his health, but had previously struggled to stick to any . diet that saw him lose significant amounts in the long-term. ‘I never had a good relationship with food even as a child - I was a little bit heavy and you get made fun of you say “OK that’s what this is like"".' Using his own high-tech method, Chris managed to lose over 9st in a year and a half, dropping from 22st (left) to 13st 9lb (right) Then came a moment of enlightenment, when he realised he could use his passion for data and technology to tackle his weight. ‘Everyone needs to understand that the average person touches between 100 to 400 systems a day, whether it’s swiping a credit card or going past a speed camera or using the phone,' he says. ‘When you start to think about what we could do with that information it opens up a world of possibilities . ‘I just put that same paradigm onto everything else, like if I’m tracking my calories I can dig into that data and find out what causes me to eat extra calories. It lets me look at what I did that day, who I saw, how I slept, what I watched, what I listened to.' Chris used his love of data collecting gadgets (left) to help him see where he was going wrong in his diet and began to record (right) and analyse all aspects of his body and eating habits . Chris maintained bad eating habits developed in childhood, and felt his success at his job allowed him to justify his bad habits . Chris says he knew he was overweight and hated to look at pictures of himself . Chris has earned the nickname of the most quantified human in the world through his job which allows him to test apps and gadgets that collect personal data . Chris began by taking pictures of his meals and posting them on Instagram to get a clearer picture of  where and what he was eating as well as activating geo-tagging on his credit card so he could see where he  was splurging on food. Using his various gadgets Chris is still continuing to lose weight . He also tracked his eating, sleeping and activity patterns, and began setting geographic limits on his credit cards, blocking him from spending at his favourite fast food restaurants or places near his home and work. ‘Often if you are overweight like I was, the most profound thing you can do is to look at your life in a quantified way. I think all men like puzzles and the more we can understand about ourselves through having a relationship with our own data the more powerful it becomes. ‘A good example is that I use systems in my home to track the temperatures and the lighting and what I’ve noticed with my own data is that the cooler it is the less I eat. Chris’s realisations saw him shed nearly 9st from his 5ft 11in frame, dropping from 22st 1lb to 13st 9lb in a year and a half. ‘I am still losing weigh pretty fast but I am also going to the gym now. In the beginning I said I didn’t want to do the gym so I used to walk to McDonalds which was 1.1 mile and then it was kind of a fast walk to Subway which is 2.2 miles than it was running and then biking.’ Chris says that his high-tech method of weight loss can work for anyone. ‘Just start with very simple things like being aware of what you are spending on food is often more than enough. ‘A lot of grocery stores will offer you club cards and you can ask for the data. ‘There is no magic that is going to happen. You are probably not going to wake up tomorrow and start this amazing data journey. What you can do is make a choice that you are okay right now. You can help you - you are your best coach, so just be nice to that person.’ Read more about Chris and other amazing losers at Man V Fat a free weight loss magazine available for men online .","Chris tests apps and gadgets that collect personal data .

"By . John Hall . Pope Francis has warned couples not to substitute cats and dogs for children, saying it will only lead to solitude and the 'bitterness of loneliness' in old age. Celebrating daily Mass in the Vatican yesterday, the Pope said owning pets may be 'more comfortable' than raising children, but did not offer the same opportunities for love and godliness. He made his comments during a special service with 15 couples - all of whom have been married between 25 and 60 years - in the chapel at his Santa Marta residence. Words of warning: The Pope said owning pets may be 'more comfortable' than raising children, but did not offer the same opportunities for love and godliness. He also criticised couples who decide not to have children . The Pope criticised couples who decide not to have children during the service, saying they had been seduced by the myth that a life of material comfort is better than raising a family. 'You can go explore the world, go on holiday, you can have a villa in the countryside, you can be carefree,' he said. 'It might be better - more comfortable - to have a dog, two cats, and the love goes to the two cats and the dog. Is this true or not? Have you seen it?', the Pope added. 'Then, in the end this marriage comes to old age in solitude, with the bitterness of loneliness,' he went on to say. The remarks came over the Pope told those gathered that the three most important aspects of a Christian marriage are fidelity, perseverance and 'fruitfulness', according to Vatican Radio. On Sunday the Pope appeared at the Stadio Olimpico football stadium in Rome to tell a rally of 50,000 members of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement that Satan is trying to destroy the domestic family . The pope's remarks come just a week after Italy announced a record low birthrate for 2013, dropping 64,000 over the past five years. With the birth of only 515,000 babies last year, the fall marks a worrying trend as the country's population ages.

He described Faith as 'a little cheeky and always trying to get attention,' whereas Hope was 'happy to just hold your finger and rest.' Mr Young acknowledged the unconditional love Faith and Hope received from their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young.  'Every time Faith and Hope would do something Renee would say: ""Come and have a look at this"", and Simon would bend over and give his daughters a kiss.' Mr Young encouraged his sister to remember the moments she share with Faith and Hope, like: 'the way they just settled in your arms.' 'They were born into a life of love no matter how long they lived. 'In the words of Winnie the Pooh: ""Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart,'"" he said.

"By . Sean Poulter . On sale: Prized Wagyu beef, pictured, originally form Japan and known for its succulence, is to be sold at budget supermarket Aldi . Budget chain Aldi is bringing the world’s most expensive beef to its aisles at £6.99 for a sirloin steak. The company has managed to get supplies of prized Wagyu beef, which originated in Japan and is renowned for its flavour and succulence. Normally, luxury stores, gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo – putting it out of reach for most families. However, Aldi will sell the Wagyu meat for around £25 a kilo, which works out at £6.99 for an eight ounce (227g) rib-eye or sirloin steak. Wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat, which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture. The cattle were initially introduced to Japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century. Beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite, while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in Japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around. Kobe beef is the purest, highest quality of the meat, which is produced from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition. However, the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe, including the UK. The Aldi supplies, which go into stores on June 12, have been imported from New Zealand. Managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, Tony Baines, said: ‘At Aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products, and Wagyu is no exception. This summer, our shoppers are looking to buy the finest fresh meat, so the steaks fill a real gap in the market.’ The move to offer luxury food at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the ‘big four’ – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. The formula is clearly working, for . new industry figures show annual sales at the no-frills German owned . chain are rising at 35.9per cent a year, while rival Lidl is seeing a . 22.7per cent surge in sales. Both are eating in to the market share of Tesco, where sales are down by 3.1per cent, Morrisons, which has seen a fall of 3.9per cent, and Sainsbury’s. Currently only Asda, which offers its own British Wagyu beef at bargain prices and pursues a budget prices strategy, is managing to stem the tide of customers switching to cheaper rivals. The director of corporate buying at Aldi said shoppers at the budget store 'love to try out specialist products'. Annual sales at the no-frills chain are rising at a rate of 35.9 per cent a year, officials say . The boss of Morrisons, Dalton Philips, has described the success of the budget chains as having the most profound effect on food shopping since the 1950s. He has responded by announcing a three year price cutting campaign that will reduce prices by £1billion, which has effectively forced all the other mainstream grocers to follow suit. The fierce price competition is delivering real benefits for families with figures from retail experts Kantar putting grocery basket inflation at just 1.2per cent. Grocery industry expert at Kantar Worldpanel, Edward Garner, said the rise of the budget chains is putting a brake on food price rises across the high street. He said: ‘Lidl achieved a record market share of 3.6per cent, accelerating with its highest ever year-on-year growth of 22.7per cent.  Similarly, Aldi has gained 35.9per cent and retains its record 4.7per cent share.’ ‘Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have all lost market share since this period last year, while Tesco and Morrisons recorded sales drops of 3.1per cent and 3.9per cent respectively.’ The director general of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said food price inflation is at its lowest level since at least December 2006. ‘This is  great news for hard-pressed households as the summer approaches, and confirms that retailers are responding to current conditions by matching attractive offers with those products most in demand at this time of the year,’ she said. Mike Watkins, the head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, said: ‘Food inflation is still low, many supermarkets are price cutting and non-food prices remain deflationary, so the high street continues to generate little inflationary pressure. ‘Little in the way of immediate seasonal or weather related price increases is anticipated so the outlook for the next three months is for relatively stable shop price inflation. Helped by the increases in consumer confidence since the start of the year, this should encourage shoppers to spend more freely over the summer months.’","Budget Aldi has supplies of prized Wagyu beef, originally from Japan .

"By . Alan Roden . Hope: The Prime Minister said he aims to increase devolution after the 2015 General Election . David Cameron has warned left-wing parties they will ‘reap what they sow’ if they punish Scots with higher taxes. Writing exclusively in today’s Scottish Daily Mail, the Prime Minister says he will ‘seek support’ from other parties to deliver the biggest shake-up of devolution after the 2015 General Election. His predecessor Gordon Brown also paved the way for a formal cross-party pact on devolution yesterday as he argued that Westminster is united on the issue. If there is a No vote in September, the . Scottish Conservatives have proposed giving MSPs full control over . income tax, allowing them to raise and lower each rate. The party also wants to give Holyrood a share of the VAT raised in Scotland, the ability to increase welfare payments and control of housing benefit. Labour wants the Scottish Parliament to be in charge of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax, and be able to increase higher bands – but not lower them unless all levels are reduced. The party also believes there should be the power to create a new council tax band, allowing the Scottish Government to introduce a ‘mansion tax’. The SNP favours a ‘progressive’ tax system and could use the new powers – if there is a No vote – to hammer higher earners. But Mr Cameron writes in today’s Mail: 'You can be sure that Scottish Conservatives will be at the forefront of promoting low-tax, pro-enterprise policies within a Scottish Parliament with enhanced responsibilities. 'If the parties of the Left want to argue for higher personal taxes for Scotland compared to the rest of the UK, then let them reap what they sow.' Agreeing to disagree: David Cameron (right) and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond (left) sign the Scottish independence referendum agreement at St Andrews House in Edinburgh . He adds: 'The Strathclyde report [on further devolution] is a clear, coherent and Conservative blueprint for the next stage of Scotland’s devolution journey.  We will take them forward in our 2015 General Election manifesto and seek support to deliver them in the new parliament. 'All the mainstream pro-UK parties believe in further devolution, so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measure and legislation, there is no reason why these changes shouldn’t happen early in the next parliament.' Mr Brown said: 'It is definitely possible now to see an agreement about extra tax powers and extra policy powers for the Scottish Parliament. 'So the argument that the Scottish National Party have been putting across over these last few months that nothing will happen if there is a No vote in September is completely wrong.' I believe in devolution because I’m a Conservative, not despite being one. Two principles that I hold dear are that governments have a responsibility carefully to spend public money; and that where possible decisions should be taken as close to the people affected by them. These two principles are at the heart of the Scottish Conservatives’ proposals for improving Scotland’s devolution settlement, outlined this week by Ruth Davidson and strongly supported by me. The Strathclyde Report is a clear, coherent and Conservative blueprint for the next stage of Scotland’s devolution journey.  We will take them forward in our 2015 General Election Manifesto and seek support to deliver them in the new Parliament. All the mainstream pro-UK parties believe in further devolution, so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measure and legislation, there is no reason why these changes shouldn’t happen early in the next Parliament. The Scottish Parliament already runs schools, hospitals and other vital services and decides how to spend two-thirds of all public expenditure in Scotland. However the Scottish Parliament has to date had little responsibility for raising the money it spends.  We have started to put that right.  In 2012 the Coalition Government passed legislation to give the Scottish Parliament more responsibility for funding Scottish public services. The Strathclyde recommendations go further.  Under these proposals the Scottish Parliament would have the power to decide how to fund up to half of what it spends.  These are real powers with real consequences. For the first time the Scottish Government and MSPs in Holyrood will be accountable for how much of your pay packet stays in your wallet and how much goes to the tax man. And when you buy goods or services in Scotland, the report says a share of that money should stay in Scotland, to make up part of the Scottish Government's budget. It gives the Scottish Parliament a greater stake in supporting a thriving economy.  And you can be sure that Scottish Conservatives will be at the forefront of promoting low-tax, pro-enterprise policies within a Scottish Parliament with enhanced responsibilities. If the parties of the left want to argue for higher personal taxes for Scotland compared to the rest of the UK, then let them reap what they sow. It is the Conservatives who are delivering on devolution. We are at the heart of the constitutional debate. We don’t just talk a good game – we lead and we act. A referendum in Wales to give its assembly new law-making powers - delivered. The recommendations of the Calman Commission – the biggest act of fiscal devolution to Scotland for over 300 years - delivered. First time tax powers to the Welsh Assembly – being delivered.  City deals to enhance local democracy – being delivered. But there’s more to do – and we have a plan for the future. And the people of Scotland understand that the only threat to devolution is Alex Salmond and his separation plans. They know that opportunity to take domestic decisions within Scotland whilst retaining the strength, security and stability of being part of the United Kingdom is the best of both worlds. Ruth has charted a very clear course for the future of the country she loves. She has my wholehearted support as together we seek to build an even stronger Scotland with our UK family of nations.  We delivered on devolution in this Parliament. We will deliver in the next.","Prime Minister aims to increase devolution after 2015 General Election .

"By . Richard Spillett . Former Generation Game star Rosemarie Ford appeared at the Rolf Harris trial today and told jurors the entertainer never acted unprofessionally . Former TV star Rosemarie Ford has told jurors in the Rolf Harris trial that the entertainer was a 'perfect professional'. Ms Ford, famed for appearing alongside Bruce Forsyth on the Generation Game, was one of a host of Harris's former colleagues who vouched for his good character today. She said she worked with the Australian entertainer on the famous game show and on other programmes including Cat Crazy and Rolf's Amazing World Of Animals in the 1990s and he never acted unprofessionally. She told the jury: 'Rolf was a total professional. He was a delight to work with and easy to be with. 'I have obviously been in and around the business a long time and you learn to recognise, in the area I'm from, when people do have a inappropriate manner and I never saw that,' she said. Ms Ford, 52, who the jury heard is married to actor Robert Lindsay, added: 'There was never, ever any indication of anything sinister or inappropriate.' Harris, 84, is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies. Choreographer Dougie Squires, who was made an OBE for services to the arts, also appeared before the jury today to speak about the five decades he has spent working with Harris. Harris arriving at Southwark Crown Court with daughter Bindi (left) and niece Jenny (right) this morning. He denies 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 . He said he . had a group of dancers called the Young Generation who performed each . week on the Rolf Harris show, including girls aged around 16 to 28. Mr Squires said the musician was 'very popular with them as a father figure really'. Despite . the dancers walking around in bras and g-strings backstage, Harris did . not behave inappropriately, the court heard. Mr Squires said: 'He was . one of the gang.' The pair have also supported charities together for the past 25 years, the jury was told. The court then heard from Tina . Fletcher-Hill, a senior executive producer for the BBC, who gave . evidence via videolink from the United States, where she is on holiday. Looking back: Rolf Harris with Rosemarie Ford in 1997. She said she worked with him on programmes including Cat Crazy and Rolf's Amazing World Of Animals in the 1990s . She said she first met Harris in 1999 while working on Animal Hospital, and later collaborated with him on the series Rolf on Art. Mrs Fletcher-Hill said: 'Rolf is a hugger. Rolf is loving, he's kind, he's affectionate. I've never witnessed anybody pulling back or feeling uncomfortable with his tactile nature.' Choreographer Dougie Squires said Harris was very popular with dancers, 'a father figure really' The TV boss told the court Harris would . openly admire strangers, telling them 'my God you're beautiful', but not . in a sexual way. 'He will quite openly comment on the colour of someone's hair or the shape of their nose or on their characteristics or facial expressions. 'He is quite open and outspoken in terms of admiring form. I guess that is an artist thing.' Witnesses from the world of showbusiness  appeared at Southwark Crown Court after one of Harris's daughter's friends, . Joanne Charles, told the court his hugs to his daughter's friend were . paternal rather than sexual. 'It was lovely. It was affectionate,' she said. Harris . is accused of having molested another of his daughter's friends from . the age of 13, but Ms Charles said he had not shown any interest in the . girl, who she described as 'bland'. 'From my recollection, she was quiet and I hate to say it, because it sounds so awful, but she was a bit bland.' Asked . how Harris's behaviour had been towards her when she got older, she said: 'It's . been the same really. He has always been very cuddly, very warm, . tactile. 'I think there were comments like ""goodness, aren't you a curvy girl? You've got such lovely curves"".' But she said she did not find them offensive, adding: 'No, I didn't because it wasn't in a lurid way, it was in a friendly, warm way.' Harris admits having had a consensual sexual affair with the alleged victim from the age of 18. Describing her feelings when she heard of the affair, Ms Charles said: 'I was saddened and shocked. It's . a terribly sad thing, but as far as I saw it that was his private life . and it had nothing to do with me.' Joanne Charles (left), a friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, told the court the entertainer's hugs were paternal rather than sexual and family friend Anne Marie Eve (right) said the artist was 'a totally lovely human being' Another . witness, Anne Marie Eve, told the court that her parents became friends . with the Harrises when they moved to Bray, and the artist was 'a totally . lovely human being'. The physiotherapist told the court that he was affectionate to her and her father. 'He . would envelop you in a hug. He would envelop my father in a hug, which . he found surprising as a physician. They were just two ends of a tactile . spectrum.' Telling the jury that he had never tried to grope her, she added: 'There was never anything hidden about it.' The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He may have left the WAGs behind, but England coach Roy Hodgson has made one concession sure to please his players training in Miami for the World Cup. Tomato ketchup and brown sauce are back on the menu after being banned by former boss Fabio Capello. The World Cup campaign in South Africa four years ago was strictly sauceless as the Italian coach frowned on the high salt and sugar content of the condiments. England coach Roy Hodgson will allow his Brazil 2014 team to eat ketchup and brown sauce - both of which were banned by Fabio Capello in South Africa four years ago . But with the England players losing so much sweat training in the heat and humidity of Florida to prepare for the conditions they will face in Brazil, Hodgson has decided a little extra salt and sugar from the sauces will do no harm. Butter – previously banned for its high salt and fat content – is also back on the menu. Even in the cooler climes of Portugal and Burton-upon-Trent, the England management have tried to recreate Amazonian conditions by making the players wear several layers so they sweat more. And Foster has also revealed that the players have been put through 'brutal' sessions on exercise bikes in saunas to improve their fitness. Due to the high humidity in both the Miami training ground and in Brazil, the coach says high salt and sugar levels in ketchup will not do any harm to his squad . 'When we were in Portugal we wore underarmour, t-shirts, zip up tops and a wet top over that,' the England goalkeeper said. 'When it was 22 degrees (centigrade) the lads were losing 2kg in sweat in every training session. 'We are trying to replicate the heat and humidity (of Brazil) 'Even at St George's Park last week we trained in the morning, lunch, slept for an hour and then did bike sessions in heat chambers to get ready. 'We've been doing half hour sessions in there. It's brutal, really hard work. But no-one's grumbled or moaned about it, just got on with it.' Roy Hodgson has left no stone unturned in his bid to get the players in the best possible condition for the World Cup. The England boss has brought a psychiatrist, sports scientists, fitness coaches and a nutritionist along with him to Miami and they will all stop with the team until they are eliminated from the World Cup. Much to Foster's joy, England will be allowed tomato ketchup and brown sauce - both banned under Fabio Capello - during the tournament. 'We are allowed (ketchup and brown sauce) now,' said the West Brom stopper, who will start against Ecuador on Wednesday. 'The food is amazing. There are seven or eight different stations of everything you could want.'","Capello banned sauces in South Africa due to high sugar and salt content .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If he helps England to an unlikely victory at the World Cup in Brazil, he’ll be hailed a hero. But even then Premiership star Adam Lallana might struggle to mend fences with his neighbours. For the Southampton midfielder has angered locals by illegally building a £40,000 all-weather football court in his back garden. Scroll down for video... Knockabout: England footballer Adam Lallana faces . having to knock down this £40,000 football pitch built in his back garden . because it doesn't have proper planning permission . Complaints: The pitch also doubles as a basketball court but neighbours have complained about the height . The AstroTurf pitch – complete with . high black fencing and basketball hoops – is intended to be used for . ‘knockabouts’ with his young family, he has claimed. The 26-year-old married his long-term partner Emily Jubb in December and they have a son, Arthur, who is almost two years old. But neighbours are worried that it will be used for noisy matches in a designated Area of Special Local Character. The . row began when Lallana – who is in Miami as England prepare for . tonight’s warm-up match against Ecuador – submitted a planning . application in December seeking retrospective permission for a separate . children’s wooden play area in his garden. In this application, his planning agent said he also planned a ‘small AstroTurf pitch’. Family: Lallana, 26, is married his . long-term partner Emily Jubb (pictured). He planned to use the astro . turf pitch for 'kickabouts' with his young family. The pitch cost between £40,000 and £60,000 to build . The footballer is pictured with his young son Arthur. He is currently in Miami with the England squad . Brian . Riley, who lives next door to the £1.5million, five-bedroom house near . Ringwood, Hampshire, said what was built was more like a large council . leisure facility. Mr Riley, . who has lived with his wife Constance at their home for more than 20 . years, said: ‘We didn’t object to the application, why would we? We . understand kids need somewhere to play. ‘But . then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we couldn’t work . out what was going on. We saw this sports pitch being built and we just . couldn’t believe it. ‘The . council enforcement officer told us it was more in keeping with a . council play park than a garden in a Special Character Area, which this . is.’ Neighbour: Brian Riley, who lives next door to Mr . Lallana’s £1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the . prospect of noisy sports matches .

Lallana, . who earns about £50,000 a week but has been linked with a big-money . move to Liverpool this summer, will either have to adjust the dimensions . of the games area or submit a retrospective application for . consideration. Mike Hirsh, a . planning consultant acting for Lallana, said: ‘The area of hard . standing to be used as a knock-about pitch has been agreed by East . Dorset District Council as “permitted development” and does not need . planning permission. ‘Over . the small goal areas, fencing has been raised to support a basketball . hoop.

"By . James Slack . 'Not what was intended': Labour's justice spokesman Sadqid Khan, said the European Courts were having too much influence in the UK . Labour finally admitted  yesterday that its controversial Human Rights Act has left Britain’s courts ‘dancing to the tune of Strasbourg’. After years of doggedly defending the legislation, shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan admitted the need for significant changes. In future, he said, Britain’s own Supreme Court should normally be given the final say in appeals instead of the remote European Court of Human Rights. Mr Khan added that British judges would no longer have to obey every edict although they would still have to consider rulings by the court in Strasbourg. The intervention was seen as a blatant attempt to snatch votes from the Conservatives, who are poised to unveil long-awaited reforms to human rights laws. Tory MPs said Mr Khan’s comments amounted to the first admission by Labour that the Act had caused mayhem. Dominic Raab, who has campaigned for reform, said: ‘After years of denial, Labour admit their Human Rights Act has skewed our justice system. ‘Frankly, they should be on their knees apologising to the British public for the damage done.’ Labour was in power in 1998 when the HRA was passed, enshrining the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. Since then, the measure has been blamed for blocking the deportation of countless illegal immigrants and foreign criminals as judges have slavishly adhered to Strasbourg case law. Mr Khan said this had not been the original intention. He pledged that a future Labour government would issue new guidance to stop ‘the sovereignty of our courts and the will of Parliament’ being called into question. ‘I want British courts to be clear that they don’t have to dance to the tune of Strasbourg,’ he said. ‘That’s not what was intended when the legislation was drafted and debated in Parliament in 1998. ‘It’s not good for our own domestic system of justice to be totally bound by what goes on at the European Court of Human Rights. Too often, rather than “taking into account” Strasbourg rulings and finding their own way, our courts have acted as if these rulings were binding on their decisions.’ Under . the plan, people would still be able to take their appeal cases to . Strasbourg but British courts would be able to disagree with what the . ECHR said . Labour admit its action would do nothing to resolve the thorny issue of Strasbourg’s ruling that prisoners should have the vote. Officials said the case, which dates back to 2005, is ‘too far down the line’. Mr Khan insisted that the party’s plans did not alter ‘Labour’s unswerving support for the Human Rights Act’. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘This is just gesture politics and will do nothing to deliver the real change this country needs.’ Before Mr Khan’s admission in an article in The Daily Telegraph, shadow ministers had repeatedly defended the legislation. In 2011, Mr Khan said: ‘The Act is the most significant defence for ordinary people against state power ever passed into law. ‘When Tory ministers blame the Act, it’s usually an excuse not to sort out the problem or a cover for their own failing policies.’ As Justice Secretary in 2008, Jack Straw said he could understand public concerns but blamed a few ‘nervous’ judges. Yesterday, the Mail reported the latest controversial judgment made under the Act’s Article 8, the right to a family life. Judges ruled a nurse from Ghana who force-fed her baby to death cannot be deported after serving her three-year sentence. Ministers have vowed to appeal. Review: Harriet Harman suggested that licence fee alternatives should be looked at . Alternatives to the licence fee should be examined when the BBC’s charter is renewed in 2016, said  Harriet Harman yesterday. The comments of Labour’s deputy leader are the first sign of possible cross-party support for an end to the £145.50 annual charge. Miss Harman, who is also shadow culture secretary, said: ‘The licence fee is a means to an end, it’s not an end to itself. ‘It’s not easy to see what would be better but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be looked at. ‘What we are not up for is a kind of ideological attack on the BBC because it is a public sector broadcaster.’ In an interview with Total Politics magazine, she also urged Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to appoint a BBC Trust chairman to replace Lord  Patten on an impartial basis. Earlier, writer Armando Iannucci suggested the BBC could become a subscription TV service like Sky.","Justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said Britain should have final say in appeals .

"By . Richard Spillett . Care home manager Patricia Thomas, 48, told an elderly woman she had 'saggy' breasts . A care home manager who joked about an elderly dementia sufferer's breasts has escaped a ban from nursing as long as she takes a training course in 'communication'. Nurse Patricia Thomas, 48, was found to have pointed at the grandmother's chest and told her to 'tuck her breasts into her skirt'. But she will be allowed to keep working in the profession - as long as she takes a course studying 'patient dignity'. A disciplinary hearing was told how Mrs Thomas made the shocking comment in front of her victim's family as they visited her in the private care home. Granddaughter Martine Farrow said: 'Mrs Thomas turned to my grandmother and said: ""Look at those saggy t**s"" while pointing towards her chest area. 'Then she said: ""I say that to her every morning"". 'My nan has large breasts and has always been very conscious of them. I know that comment must have been very upsetting for her.' A disciplinary hearing was told the incident occurred at Ty Gwynno Care Home in Pontypridd, South Wales, where Thomas was the manager. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) misconduct hearing in Cardiff was told the elderly dementia sufferer, in her eighties, refused to wear a bra because it was uncomfortable. Thomas denied making the cruel comments but the NMC panel ruled she had referred to the elderly woman using the phrase 'saggy t**s' and told her 'you need to tuck those t**s into your skirt'. PE teacher Mrs Farrow said her grandmother was a 'well respected lady' who would have been stunned by the language used. She said: 'Mrs Thomas didn't think there was anything wrong with the comment she made. My concern was this was not the first time Mrs Thomas had said this to my nan. 'If a manager behaves this way then staff may think it is acceptable to behave this way. I didn’t challenge her at the time because I was in shock - I was completely gobsmacked.' The incident occurred at Ty Gwynno Care Home in Pontypridd, South Wales, where Thomas was manager . Mrs Farrow . said her family had been 'brought up extremely well' and would never . dream of using bad language in front of their grandmother. She added: 'I would treat my nan with the utmost respect and it was not acceptable to talk around her like that. 'I was completely gobsmacked by what Mrs Thomas said. It was very unprofessional.' The woman's granddaughter Martine Farrow said her grandmother was a 'well respected lady' who would have been horrified by the language used . Thomas was . suspended after Mrs Farrow reported the incident to another manager at . the care home which looks after 50 elderly residents. Thomas did admit saying before this incident: 'If you don't wear a bra in your 20s and 30s, you will have to tuck them in your skirt in your 70s and 80s.' The NMC panel ruled her conduct amounted to gross misconduct and that her fitness to practice was impaired. They gave her a 12 month conditions of practice order meaning she will have to undergo retraining. This will include lessons on ensuring patient dignity and communications skills. She will also have to write a 'reflective piece'. Panel chair Paul Morris said: 'The resident was distressed by the comments about the size of her chest. 'As a manager of this care home you were a role model and you should have led by example. 'You breached fundamental tenants of the nursing profession by displaying a lack of respect towards a vulnerable patient. 'Your conduct was not born out of malice but what you said was a hugely inappropriate error of judgement.'","Patricia Thomas told the elderly woman to 'tuck her breasts into her skirt'

"By . Chris Brooke . The parents of a sixth form student who committed suicide following a split from her boyfriend warned yesterday about the constant pressure on teenagers from social media. Lily Cleal, 18, hanged herself from a tree in the back garden in an ‘act of impulse’ after tearfully calling a friend to say she was ‘feeling down and needed a hug.’ Her loving middle class parents had no idea their only child was in such a tormented state and believe there is a ‘taboo’ amongst young people about admitting to feeling depressed. Lily Cleal, 18, took her own life at her family home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in December last year after calling a friend to say she was 'feeling down and needed a hug' Kate Cleal, 53, an IT manager, said . young people like her daughter were more vulnerable because they could . not escape from the round-the-clock nature of social media that . dominates their lives. She . said: ‘Once you would have an argument with your boyfriend on the phone . in the hallway and then you would have to get back to chatting with your . family where you could think things over. Now with Facebook, Whatsapp, . snapchat and smart phones it is 24/7. 'There . is no let up and no natural break to think. Often people feel down and . don’t vocalise that for fear of being marked as mentally ill.  It means . they can take themselves off in a moment of darkness and do what they . do.’ Lily Cleal took her own life in December last year on an 'act of impulse' after becoming concerned it would be difficult to have the same friends as her ex-boyfriend if either of them was to start dating another person . The teenager (pictured when she was younger with her father Quentin) was a popular schoolgirl with a keen interest in sports . Miss Cleal's parents, Kate and Quentin (pictured left with Lily), are now raising money for the charity PAPYRUS which campaigns to reduce the stigma associated with suicide. Right: Lily as a youngster with her father . Mrs Cleal also called for greater awareness of high suicide rates amongst young people who ‘see things as black and white.’ Between . 600 and 800 people aged under 24 commit suicide every year in England . and Wales. There are also up to 24,000 suicide attempts made annually by . 10 to 19 year olds, according to the charity Papyrus, which is . dedicated to tackling the youth suicide problem. An . inquest heard how the talented A Level student from Leeds had broken up . with fellow pupil Danny Capossela, 18, but felt it wasn’t a ‘clean . break’ as they had the same circle of friends. No one had anticipated her taking such a drastic step. Recording a verdict of suicide, the coroner said: 'Lily was a bit of a free spirit and it would appear that she had a probably got a little upset about something' The teenager (pictured a a child) was an 'independent and free-spirited' girl who was due to take A-level exams at Allerton Grange High School in Leeds . Speaking . after the inquest, Mrs Cleal said: ‘What Lily did was a completely . impulsive act. She was an out-going capable person with good upbringing . and we just didn’t expect this. ‘One . of our neighbours put it aptly “if Lily could do it, then it could . happen to any family.” But sadly, like a lot of young people she took a . temporary problem and gave a permanent solution to it. ‘This . is the nature of her age group who often tend to see things as black . and white when they haven’t got the maturity to deal with things . troubling them. In a moment of darkness they act irrationally.’ She said talking about being suicidal is wrongly a ‘taboo’ topic. ‘Being . able to say you feel down or feeling like you might do something silly . should not have the stigma surrounding it that it currently does. ‘For . Lily, all rational thought had gone. All it might have taken was to . speak to someone about what was bothering her. Something needs to be . done to remove the stigma that says it is odd just to say “I am feeling . down.”’ Lily's mother, Kate Cleal (pictured with her daughter), said: 'What Lily did was a completely impulsive act. She was an out-going capable person with good upbringing and we just didn't expect this' Following Miss Cleal's death (pictured as a youngster), her parents have called for greater awareness about the 'taboo' of teenage suicide after figures showed up to 800 people aged under 24 take their own lives in England and Wales every year . Lily was described . as a ‘free-spirited’ young woman and was due to take A Levels in . History, Psychology, Sociology and English Literature at Allerton Grange . High School in Leeds. She was a keen sportswoman and heavily involved in school drama productions. Lily’s . parents sat side by side with her former boyfriend as the coroner said . he was at a ‘complete loss’ to explain why the teenager had committed . suicide last December. They . had been friends since the age of 12 but became an ‘item’ at 16. After . two years the relationship ended but they remained friends, said coroner . David Hinchliffe. He said . that being part of the same group caused problems. ‘It may be that both . of them found it difficult if one of the other was seeing someone else.’ On the evening prior to her death, the teenager spent time shopping with her mother Kate in Leeds city centre (pictured together above) Miss Cleal (pictured left as a child and right as a teenager) was a keen sportswoman who played girls cricket for the school’s under 18s squad along with netball, hockey and swimming. She also wrote a school production . The inquest was told 20 . minutes after making a tearful phone call to her friend, Lily dialled . 999 and said she was going to kill herself. Paramedics rushed to the . family home only to find her dead when they arrived. Suicide notes were . left for her parents and the paramedics. Recording . a verdict of suicide, coroner David Hinchliffe said Lily’s parents felt . no animosity towards Danny and still regarded him ‘as a very important . person in their life.’ He . said Lily ‘knew her own mind’ and her death may have been the result of . the ‘headstrong impulsive aspect of her personality coming through.’ After . the inquest Lily’s father Quentin Cleal, 53, an NHS finance manager, . said: ‘There is an issue of under recording suicides. Young people who . patently take their own lives are often deemed not to be considered old . enough or responsible enough so they are recorded as accidental death. ‘Before . Lily had done what she had done, I was completely unaware of this - but . the reality is it has never been a comfortable thing for humans to talk . about. It seems people feel so black that they see no options.' Click here to donate to Kate Cleal’s JustGiving page.","Lily Cleal hanged herself after calling a friend to say she was 'feeling down'

"By . Larisa Brown . A 12-year-old boy had to be airlifted to hospital after two school buses crashed head-on during the morning rush hour. Horrified children and witnesses yesterday spoke of how chairs had been ripped from their seats and screaming youngsters were covered in blood with broken fingers and injured heads. Two bus drivers and 28 children had to be taken to hospital from the scene in Stanley, County Durham, after one of the buses had suddenly swerved into the path of the other. Scroll down for video . Crash: Emergency services were called to rescue 50 children and two adults from a crash at 8.20am . Collision: The front of the double decker bus was completely crushed in the head-on collision this morning . Police said there were around 50 children and two adults on board the single-decker and double-decker which appeared to have collided head-on close to a junction on the A393 at around 8.20am. Witnesses said injured children were sprawled on the grass near the crash waiting to be treated, while those still inside the bus were screaming and choking from the smoke from the engines. Maureen Davison, 62, who runs a burger van near the crash site, said she heard a ‘huge bang’ and looked up. Her son, who works with her and was in his car at the time, ran out to help and carried panicked children from the wreckage in fear of the buses catching fire and blowing up. Both said the single white decker, carrying pupils to nearby Tanfield Comprehensive School, swerved into the path of a yellow double decker, carrying pupils to St Bede’s in Lanchester. They were carrying pupils aged between 11 and 18. One 12-year-old boy suffered serious facial injuries and was airlifted to hospital, along with the 54-year-old driver of one of the buses, who also suffered serious injuries. Investigation: Police said there have been no fatalities but a number of injuries as they investigate the crash . Injuries: A 12-year-old boy suffered facial injuries and one of the drivers is being treated for 'serious injuries' Emergency: The boy and driver were flown to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle this morning after the crash . Michael Davison, 38, spoke of how he fought through smoke to reach the screaming and bleeding youngsters. He said: 'There was no way they could avoid a head-on collision. There was a massive bang, I’ve never heard anything like it and after a couple of seconds of silence all you could hear was screaming. ‘I ran over to the buses. There was smoke pouring from the engines, coming from batteries of the vehicles and it was choking everyone. ‘I was really frightened they were going to catch fire and I knew I had to get as many people off as I could.’ He said a woman also came running to help him. He added: ‘When I first jumped on the white bus there were kids piled up on top of each other. ‘The force of the accident had sent them sprawling into heaps. Some had snapped fingers, others had open wounds that you could see fat coming through. It was awful to see. ‘The worst injured was a little lad at the front, he was the one airlifted to hospital. He had a head injury, his face was covered in blood and he was screaming.’ Rescue: After prolonged efforts to free the driver from the bus, he and a boy were carried to the air ambulance . Treatment: The boy was said to be in a stable condition when he was airlifted to Royal Victoria Infirmary . He said some of the children were able to get themselves off the bus but others needed carrying. The driver of the white bus which apparently swerved, a 27-year-old from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, was said to have emerged from the smash, asking: ‘What happened?’. He was later admitted to hospital with minor injuries. Mr Davison said he spoke to the driver. He said: ‘He got himself off and appeared to be confused, he was asking what had happened, he didn’t seem to know how the crash happened.’ Mr Davison added: ‘On the upper deck of the yellow bus the seats were ripped up because as soon as they collided the kids grabbed them and hung on for dear life but the force was so great that the seats were pulled up. ‘The glass lying around was red with blood and some of the kids looked like they had serious injuries.’ St Bede’s pupil Ryan Robson, 14, from nearby Stanley, was on the yellow bus when the crash happened. He said: ‘We were on the road heading to New Kyo and the bus slowed down really fast and everyone was thrown forward. The scene: A fleet of 13 ambulances and four fire engines were called to the scene in Stanley, County Durham . Shock: Passengers aged between 11 and 18 were treated for shock at a nearby public house . ‘One of my friends was sat in the middle seat at the back and she was flung forward. Another friend bust her nose and she was covered in blood. ‘She hit her face on one of the metal bars and it was gushing. I just thought, “I’ve got to try and get everyone off the bus.” I was shouting, “Get off the bus”, and I was trying to get people down the stairs.’ He said his friend was standing at the front of the bus and the driver was trapped. He added: ‘I think he had been knocked out. ‘I told my friend to force the door open and there was a lot of screaming. I wasn’t thinking about being scared, I just thought, “I’ve got to do something”.’ Police said the 12-year-old, who attended Tanfield Comprehensive, was in a stable condition when he was handed over to hospital staff. Ambulances took 16 children to the University Hospital of North Durham and 11 children to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead, all with minor injuries. Other children were treated for shock at the scene . Superintendent Colin Williamson said: ‘As the investigation continues into the collision continues, the roads in the area remain closed and we would like to thank everyone for their patience.’ Both schools issued a joint statement expressing ‘shock’ at the incident and said support was a .","50 children and two adults were on the buses that collided at 8.20am .

"By . Mia De Graaf . An 86-year-old man who shot himself . dead in the toilet of a doctor's surgery was struggling to cope with his wife's . illness, it was claimed today. The pensioner has been named locally as Brian . Poingdestre and is believed to have turned a revolver on himself out of . loneliness since his wife has been ill in hospital. Armed police were scrambled to the scene . following reports of gunfire and a 'sudden death' at the GP practice in . Frimley, Surrey. Tragic: The 86-year-old shot himself dead in Station Road Doctor's Surgery in Frimley, Surrey, yesterday . In . the first clue to Mr Poingdestre's motives, a resident near the scene . said the gunman was 'quite lonely' because his wife Barbara was in . hospital. The woman, who . asked not to be named, said: 'He was quite lonely because his wife is in . Frimley Park Hospital - she is very poorly. 'She wouldn't have a clue what happened yesterday. 'His . car was parked on the double yellows outside the surgery yesterday - . which makes me think he drove in a hurry from the hospital. 'I've no idea if he was a patient there or not though. 'From the sounds of things, he used a hand gun - an old service revolver.' Neighbours paid tribute to Mr Poingdestre, who they described as a 'quiet' man who 'couldn't cope'. Dennis Kinchen, 70, and Georgina Kinchen, 64, live across from the Poingdestre's semi-detached family home of more than 40 years. Mrs Kinchen, from Frimley, said: 'I don't think Brian could cope with Barbara getting ill. 'He seemed quite nice and always said hello and stopped to talk about the garden, but he was quite quiet recently. 'I know she hasn't been well. Scene: The man, named locally as Brian Poingdestre, is thought to have parked his car outside beforehand . 'Back in January an ambulance was at the house after she fell over in the garden and banged her head quite badly. 'Her head was covered in blood and they took her away but it was a while before the paramedics came. 'I haven't seen Barbara for a while - I know she's ill but she may or may not be in hospital.' Mr . Poingdestre used to park his car on the grass outside the end-of-road . property, which has a white wooden gate by the front path. The front garden is large and the back has a bird table and washing line, visible from the road. Mr Kinchen said he thought Mr Poingdestre had been 'lonely' and 'couldn't cope' with his wife's ill health. Mr Kinchen said: 'He was a nice guy but pretty quiet. We've lived here about 20 years so you'd think we'd know more about him. 'We didn't even know he had kids but he does have a son called Guy who's about 60-odd. 'We've never seen him come to the house though in all the time we've been here. 'I do think he was just lonely and couldn't cope.' The Poingdestres had one son who was believed to be heading up from the Weymouth area of Dorset today. 'He was a nice guy but quite quiet recently. I think he just couldn't cope when Barbara got ill' Gavin Laming, who runs Gavin's Hair Studio, barely 200 yards from the couple's home, has been doing Barbara Poingdestre's hair every week for the last 10 years. He said of yesterday's events: 'It's horrendous. I can't get over it. I don't know what's happened, if it's got too much for him. I can't believe he went to the doctor's surgery and did this.' He said Mrs Poingdestre was 'a lovely, lovely lady' but again that she and her husband were private people. He too had heard she had fallen over a concrete slab in her garden, resulting in being hospitalised. Jas Dhaliwal, who runs JR Wines general store next door, said: 'He was a nice bloke. I think he just couldn't cope. 'He did say he was a bit upset with his wife being in hospital but there was nothing to suggest this would happen.' Mr Poingdestre was a regular customer of his, he said. 'He came and got his veg, a banana, whether he needed a potato or a couple of carrots. 'When I opened the shop the was quite happy because he said: ""We couldn't get our veg here in the past"", because he only ever needed a couple of bits.' He said Mr Poingdestre was just a nice, normal old man, who was friendly and respectable, up early in the morning 'like any other pensioner'. Like others in the area, however, he knew very little about the tragic couple. The Poingdestres' immediate neighbours said they have been living next to Brian and Barbara for years. Investigation: Armed police were scrambled to the scene following reports of gunfire at the GP practice . A car with number plates covered parked very close to Station Road Surgery, where a man shot himself dead . The victim in his 80s was believed to have driven the car to the surgery, walked in and shot himself dead . A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'They were just a normal couple really. 'We weren't exactly close neighbours - passed the time of day when we saw them but that wasn't often. 'Barbara hasn't been well for a long time - she didn't want to tell us much about it which I understand. 'I think it's age related problems - you know, the problems that come as you get older. 'I saw him last week and he looked OK but I didn't get a chance to speak to him. 'They have a son but he hasn't lived here for a long time - we wouldn't know the reason why.' A . practice manager at Station Road Surgery declined to comment on the . incident or say whether he shot himself after an appointment. Mr Poingdestre is believed to be a patient at the surgery. Other patients claimed only someone who knew their way around the building would find the toilets. A worker at The Mane Street barbers opposite the surgery said the community was in a 'sombre mood' today. Patients . have been flocking to the surgery after it re-opened today - all . appointments were cancelled due to the incident at about 11am yesterday. The . woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police have moved off the . scene now and patients have been filing into the doctor's all morning. 'People are in a very sombre mood this morning - I certainly feel terribly sad thinking about the poor man who died. 'There's been no word on who he is yet so we're hoping he's not one of our customers.' Surrey Police, who investigated the shooting, said they have passed a file to the coroner. The Ford Focus, parked on a double yellow line with its number plate covered up, has now been removed . Officers were stationed outside the surgery all day yesterday and all appointments were cancelled . A . spokeswoman confirmed an 86-year-old man, from Frimley, Surrey, had . died but said his death was not being treated as suspicious. His next-of-kin have been informed and a post mortem is due to be carried out later this week. A . statement said: 'Officers and other emergency services attended the . location after receiving reports, just before 11am, that a firearm had . been discharged within the building. 'The local man was pronounced dead at the scene. 'The death is not being treated as suspicious. 'The next of kin have been informed.' Surrey Coroner's office are expected to open and adjourn an inquest into the death in the next few days. Staff at the surgery, which re-opened today, are being offered support from NHS England. A . spokesperson for NHS England said: 'We are supporting staff at the . Station Road Surgery, Frimley, following the sudden death on the . premises. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who died. 'Surrey Police are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death. 'The surgery is open to patients as normal.' Police were called to the surgery in Station Road, Frimley, Surrey, at about 10.30am yesterday morning . Shocked residents near the Station Road Surgery said they heard 'gunshots' from inside . Yesterday, a police officer stood guard at the entrance to the sealed-off surgery and a cordon was set up around its car park. Another police officer was stationed by a silver Ford Focus ST parked just 25 yards from the surgery entrance, believed to be Mr Poingdestre's car. Witness Ed Tse, 25, said he heard 'a bang like a gunshot' while working in his father's Chinese takeaway which backs onto the surgery. He described the aftermath at the scene as 'chaotic'. Mr Tse, from Frimley, said: 'I heard a bang around 10.30am and at first I thought it sounded like the bins being collected. 'The surgery is always throwing stuff out so hearing the bang of a bin is quite common but this was louder. 'I went around the corner and there were lots of people and police cars around - it was chaotic. 'I did think the noise was much louder than the usual bin noise and it sounded like a gunshot. 'I've not heard much since but I saw people coming in and out as I came on to Station Road and staff were having to show IDs to police on the door. 'Police were not letting anyone in or out and were taking statements and telling people the surgery was close. I haven't spoken to police myself yet.'","Brian Poingdestre, 86, reportedly 'couldn't cope' with wife Barbara's illness .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Tory councils minister Brandon Lewis admitted this morning that he had 'mixed memory' over what he could and could not recycle at home . Minister for local councils Brandon Lewis was forced to admit this morning that even he is so baffled by recycling rules he did not know what he could put in his green waste bin. The Tory MP - who is responsible for the English and Welsh local authorities which set the complicated recycling rules  - said the key to helping people recycle was to 'keep things simple'. Mr Lewis, the MP for Great Yarmouth, said his local council in Norfolk was 'pretty clear about what you can and can't recycle' - but then had to admit he did not know the rules himself. He told BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt that he was allowed to throw yoghurt pots in the recycling in Great Yarmouth. The top Tory, who was a council leader for five years, said he was 'sure' he was allowed to recycle yoghurt pots and butter contrainers. But he was later forced to admit this was wrong and that his wife had had to correct him. Mr Lewis said he had a 'mixed memory'. It came after the Mr Stayt asked him on TV this morning: 'Where you live, can you put yoghurt pots in your recycling? Mr Lewis said: 'Yes we can actually.' But the presenter responded: 'Do you know that for sure, I’m not trying to catch you out, it is just, the practicalities are the things that trouble people most, and you know that for sure do you, you know absolutely you can put yoghurt pots, butter containers for example, the different types of plastic, you know which one you can and which one you can’t for your own area.' The Tory minister said: 'Yes and to be fair my council which is Great Yarmouth are pretty good at educating people and making people very clear about what they can and can’t recycle.' Mr Lewis then went on Twitter, to say that he had been on BBC Breakfast talking 'about waste collection'. He said: 'Need to be easy and regular for residents.' He then tweeted a link to the Great Yarmouth recycling rules 'for clarity'. But the rules state: 'No plastics other than bottles (yogurt pots, food containers, film/bags etc need to go in your grey bin).' BBC Breakfast then wrote on Twitter: 'Seems recycling IS confusing. Minister @BrandonLewis said he could recycle yogurt pots, but has since admitted he got it wrong.' 'Great Yarmouth Council says you can't recycle yogurt pots etc.' Mr Lewis then responded to say he had got confused - and had been ticked off by his wife for getting it wrong. He claimed he had a 'mixed memory'. He said: 'Yep, wife already corrected me too, mixed memory re yogurt vs plastic bottles which are ok, confirms point re #keepitsimple.' Families are often left baffled by which bins to use for their rubbish. In Stoke,  pictured here, people had to cope with nine different recycling bins . Mr Lewis later said his confusion proved why councils needed to keep things simple. He said the councils needed to make things 'really easy' for people. Mr Lewis said: 'My experience is the best way to get recycling up is to make it really easy for people to do it.' 'We spend about £122 a month on council tax and the main thing for them is to collect our rubbish and we expect a really good service. 'Over the last 10 or 15 years councils have moved away from weekly collections and tried to force people to recycle by having less than a weekly collection and it doesn’t work. 'People need to understand and we need to make it easier for people to recycle. 'Councils can choose how they provide their services - that is an important part of localism - but they should go for the easiest ways of recycling.' Mr Lewis appeared on the show over claims more than 100,000 tonnes of 'contaminated' recycling ended up in landfill last year, despite families carefully sorting their rubbish at home. A Labour source said: 'It’s important to recycle our waste properly but it appears the Minister responsible has no idea what he’s doing himself.' But Mr Lewis said: 'As you saw this morning recycling yogurt pots and other household waste can be a complicated and confusing matter. This Government is working with councils to make it as easy and accessible as possible. 'All the evidence suggests that when recycling is simple, more people do it, which is better for the environment and reduces long term pressure on landfill sites.'","Tory said he was 'sure' he could recycle yoghurt pots at home in Yarmouth .

The mother is overjoyed about being reunited with her child and will never forgive herself for the psychotic snap despite having absolutely no recollection of the horrifying incident . The father, David, told 3rd Degree his concerns for his wife began the night before the incident when she passed out at their home. The mother spent the Saturday night at Southland Hospital on a drip and was diagnosed with post-natal depression. She was discharged the following morning and advised to visit her GP on the Monday. But this advice would prove far too late. The couple woke at 5am the next day after a restless night and the mother took the baby to the living room to feed. David walked in to find his wife attempting to take their three-week-old baby's life - as well as her own. 'She was hearing things and seeing things that didn't exist and was saving the baby by killing it,' he said. 'The baby's throat was cut and [she] was cutting her [own] wrists.' The family is back together again but only under the condition that the mother not be alone with her daughter who is now ten-months-old . Evidence to the court later revealed the mother had suffered abuse as a child at the hands of an older relative who then became a prominent figure in her hallucination. Their daughter was flown to Starship hospital in Auckland for life-saving surgery. Her trachea was severed, an artery cut and a nerve on one side of the voice box also cut. The mother was kept at Southland Hospital's mental health unit. The woman's husband had to break the shocking news to her slowly . David had to break the news in parts to his wife, who had no recollection of the horrifying event, starting with a picture of the tube in their daughter's throat and then explaining how it got there. ‘She will never forgive herself,’ he said. David spoke of the difficulties with Child Youth and Family over custody, claiming the agency told him he would have to choose between living with his wife or daughter. Post-natal psychosis is a rare condition with only one or two in 1,000 who suffer from it . ‘It's a choice no one in this world should have to make,’ he said. The staff were cleared in an inquiry into Southern District Health Board's handling of the case because said it was deemed an unforeseeable 'landmine.' Before finding the mother not guilty of attempted murder in late March, Justice Graham Panckhurst told her ‘your baby was cherished and well-loved’. Women who suffer from bipolar are believed to be more susceptible to the condition . He imposed a court order requiring her to undergo community-based mental health care. Court reports from psychiatrists were conflicted other whether she knew the severity of her attack. Otago University associate professor Phillip Brinded, a forensic psychiatrist, told the court in a February report ‘her psychotic mental state would ... have rendered her unable of knowing that the act was morally wrong’.","The New Zealand mother cut her three-week-old daughter's throat with a vegetable knife in September last year .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . John Mayor was made aware of an alleged plot by Muslim extremists to infiltrate a number of schools in the Birmingham area, reports today suggest . Fears over an alleged extremist plot to infiltrate a number of Birmingham schools were raised to then Prime Minister John Major 20 years ago, reports suggest. The leaders of three schools in Birmingham, West Midlands, are said to have written to education ministers and Mr Major over their concerns regarding extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir in the 1990s. John Ray, a former governor at Golden Hillock School, even had a Westminster meeting with the education minister Emily Blatch, it is claimed. Mr Ray today told Sky News: '(The Trojan Horse plot) reveals something, something that is true. 'It reveals a mess that the city council has not been able to check - the development of this whole infiltration of this ceding in of governors of one particular ideology. 'They are not people who have the welfare of these children at heart.' Mr Ray resigned from his role at the school after 25 years in 2013 when it was taken over by the Park View Educational Trust - which is headed by Tahir Alam. Mr Alam is accused of attempting to convert secular, state-funded schools to Islam. However, Mr Rays's claims have been questioned by other senior members of staff at the school . Mohammed . Shafique, another former governor, said: 'John Ray never expressed any . concerns, never asked ""why have you joined the governing body?"" 'I'm . quite concerned that he can actually say there was a mass movement to . go into governing bodies. I certainly haven't experienced it at Golden . Hillock School, or another school I was governor at.' A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'There is absolutely no place for extremism in schools. 'Since 2010 we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our capability to deal with extremism in schools, including setting up a dedicated counter extremism unit within the Department for Education. 'We have also worked with Ofsted to strengthen inspectors' capacity to identify and report on extremism in schools. 'Ofsted has inspected a number of schools in the light of recent allegations and will report to the Secretary of State shortly. Retired senior police officer Peter Clarke has been asked by the Secretary of State to make a full enquiry into Birmingham schools and will report back this summer.' The claims come as three schools inspected over the alleged Trojan Horse plot by hard-line Muslims have been given a clean bill of health by Ofsted. Ninestiles School, an Academy in Acocks Green, Small Heath School, and Washwood Heath Academy, were all given good or outstanding ratings by the education watchdog. The schools then published their results letters today - which concluded children-safeguarding standards were being met by the all of the institutions. John Ray, a former governor at Golden Hillock School, claims he and officials from two other schools wrote to education ministers in the 90s raising their concerns over extremist group Hizbut-Tahrir . The schools are the first to publish the results of their inspections after the Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations. In all, 21 schools have been inspected after the so-called letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation Trojan Horse. Meanwhile today, Park View Educational Trust (PVET) which has been the focus of the most damning allegations, issued a statement criticising 'leaks' of other unpublished Ofsteds being reported in the media, stating it was causing 'unwarranted and unnecessary concern' for children and parents. For its part, Park View, which runs three other city schools, has denied any wrong-doing, with trust chairman Tahir Alam calling the allegations 'a witch-hunt'. Whatever the truth of the original letter, alleging the existence of a five-point plan to seize control of school governing boards by seeding them with hard-line Muslim governors, the fall-out caused Mr Gove in April to appoint as education commissioner Peter Clarke, the former head of the Met’s counter-terror unit. A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is now expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned. The Labour MP for Hodge Hill Liam Byrne, where many of the schools being probed are located, said the volume of leaks from those reports meant the entire investigation risked a descent into 'complete shambles', calling on the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted to publish their findings immediately. The man accused of masterminding the Trojan Horse plot, Tahir Alam. Mr Ray says he left Golden Hillock School after it was taken over by Park View Educational Trust, which is headed by Mr Alam . Inspectors wrote to the three schools which today published their results on May 12. At Ninestiles School in Acocks Green inspectors sent in by Mr Gove found children safeguarding requirements were being met, praising leadership and governance under executive principal Christine Quinn as 'outstanding'. Headteacher of Small Heath School, Peter Slough, was told there were 'effective safeguarding procedures' in his classrooms, while leadership and governance was also 'outstanding'. John Ray, former governor at Golden Hillock School . At Washwood Heath Academy, inspectors found governance and leadership to be 'good' adding students were 'well informed' both about other cultures and the risks of extremism and bullying, concluding pupils at the academy were well-rounded and believed it was 'acceptable to be different'. At Small Heath, inspectors praised the high level of tolerance, stating in their letter to the head: 'A major strength of the school is that students value the differences between people of different beliefs, race and backgrounds. 'This has been achieved through a balanced curriculum for religious education and wide-ranging opportunities for personal development.' Inspectors thought the school so good it went on to criticise local education authority Birmingham City Council because 'it has not done enough to help the school share its good practice with other schools in the city'. At nearby Washwood Heath, students were found to be tolerant and well-behaved while there was consistently “strong leadership” from headteacher Beverley Mabey. Inspectors concluded: 'They (students) know about risks related to religious extremism, sexual health, drug misuse, use of the internet and social media and different forms of bullying. 'Students are taught to respect the things that make people different such as sexual orientation, appearance, ability and race. The Park View School in Birmingham - which is alleged to have been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school. It has received the most scrutiny of the 21 schools alleged to be involved . 'Students say that it is acceptable to be different at the academy.' Ofsted added the 'executive headteacher, and key members of the board of governors, have provided a strong lead on issues of religious extremism'. Numerous media reports, quoting anonymous sources, have claimed Ofsted is poised to place several Birmingham schools into special measures after inspections sparked by an unsigned letter purporting to contain details of the alleged takeover plot. Claims have also emerged that concerns about the management of a school embroiled in the row were first raised with council officials as early as 2008. The Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council and West Midlands Police. Meanwhile, PVET which runs Park View Academy, Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock School, said it would not comment on speculative and 'highly irresponsible' reports in the media based on Ofsted reports which had not yet been published. Highlighting the academic success of Park View’s students, the trust said: 'If the inspectors who carried out both inspections at Park View Academy have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an Ofsted inspection.' The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year. Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered. It allegedly outlined a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. Whistleblowers at Park View have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school. The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. Police, the Government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in March. The DfE has also appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation. Yesterday, six schools at the centre of an alleged Islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even  closure after being officially judged as failing, it emerged last night. A three-month inquiry has found the Birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated. One of the six, Golden Hillock, was rated ‘inadequate’ in every criteria. A leaked copy of its Ofsted report says ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly. However, three were today given 'outstanding' or 'good' results by the education watchdog.","Fears over plot to infiltrate Birmingham schools raised in 90s, it is claimed .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Organiser: Ruthanne Reid, 57, (pictured at another event) was caught on camera at a hairdressing awards ceremony apparently headbutting one guest and striking another with her handbag . A hairdressing awards ceremony descended into a brawl after the organiser was caught on camera apparently headbutting one guest and striking another with her handbag. The INAA Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards in Glasgow had billed itself as a 'showcase' for the beauty industry, while guests included actress Michelle Keegan and Miss Scotland Ellie McKeating. But the event turned sour when organiser Ruthanne Reid, 57, allegedly became caught up in an on-stage catfight and ended with police being called to luxury venue the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow. Grainy video footage from the event . shows Ms Reid march down a catwalk set up on the stage towards the . audience and apparently hit someone with her handbag. It is then alleged . she headbutted one of the event attendees in a scuffle. Police were eventually called to the event, although no arrests were made. Ms Reid has since apologised for her behavior at the event and announced she had resigned from software company, and sponsors INAA. She . says the scuffle was down to a presenter announcing the wrong name for . one award, and a fellow guest exposing her bottom, but denies the . headbutt. More than 800 . guests had attended the £105-a-ticket event on Sunday evening, among . them former Coronation Street actress Keegan and her fiance, ex-The Only . Way Is Essex star Mark Wright, Miss McKeating and the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Sadie Docherty. Another attendee, Ashley Hutton, 37, who . owns a salon in Dundee, claimed Ms Reid appeared to be drunk and as the . event neared its close had come on stage, taken hold of the microphone . and yelled at the audience. Mrs Hutton told Stv: . 'Ruthanne was very drunk and ended up screaming at everyone in the . crowd for no reason. Before that even happened you would tell people . were getting annoyed and agitated. Scroll down for video . Scuffle: Hairdressing awards show organiser Ruthanne Reid, 57 (pictured dressed in black) was filmed apparently headbutting a guest and striking another attendee with her handbag. She denies the headbutt . Farce: Guests at the event said that Ms Reid had been drunk, and that the ceremony had descended into farce . She added: 'Then all of a . sudden she stormed off stage and started swinging her bag at people and . then ended up headbutting a guest. Security got involved, it was just a . farce.' Mrs Hutton said . Miss Scotland's crown had been knocked off in the fracas, and said she . was embarrassed to have attended the event. 'People put a lot of time and effort into the awards and paid over £100 for a tickets, but it was just a disaster,' she said. Gayle Leggatt, 30, who owns Cruz Hair and Beauty in Glasgow, winners of the hair salon of the year at the awards, said that when her salon was announced as the winner, Ms Reid stormed the stage. 'Just as I was about to speak, Ruthanne snatched the mic away,' she told the Daily Record. Storm: Video footage from the event shows Ms Reid march down a catwalk set up on the stage towards the audience. She said this was due to the fact that the wrong winner had been announced . 'She started bawling about how it wasn’t the right salon that had won.' Ms Reid, who lives in Paisley, said . she had spent four months planning the event with her daughter Joanne, . only for the evening to be overshadowed by allegations of assault, and . that she was left in tears as security guards dragged her from the . venue. 'I was really looking forward to the night, like I do every year, . and people had paid good money to go and enjoy themselves, but it just . turned out ridiculous,' she said today. Overshadowed: Ms Reid, who lives in Paisley, said she had spent four months planning the event with her daughter Joanne, only for the evening to be overshadowed by allegations of assault . 'When that awards started everything seemed to be going well, but during one of the sessions things started to go pear-shaped. 'We . had Nimrod from Russia Today and he picked up the award cards from . earlier that had been left on the podium rather than taking the card . that came with the award. 'He called out the wrong name, and on the . projector screen was the Esteem Beauty and instead he called out Cruz, . who had already received their award earlier. Not willing to allow the award to be . given unjustly, Ms Reid said she took to the stage to point out the . mistake and make amends. 'I shouldn't have done it, I don't know why I did it but I just . felt it was unfair as the right person hadn't been called out,' she said. 'So I . went on stage and said ""I'm really really sorry, there's been a mistake, . could Cruz go off as you have not won, the rightful winners are Esteem . Beauty"". 'There was a bit of booing, as the audience by that . point were a bit rankled, to say the least, but the girl from Esteem . came up and took the award so it was fine.' However, female guest Kerry Campbell, 26, then ran up on stage, swore and exposed her rear. Ms Reid said: 'I went on stage again to say that we hadn't completed the raffle . but the mics went dead, and just at the moment a girl from Dundee came . up on stage and put her fingers in my face. 'Then she did a moonie directed at me and I said ""well that's very lady like"", to which she ran back and tried to attack me. 'I . tried to signal to the team to put the mics back on so I could complete . the raffle, but people in the audience thought that I was going after . the girl. Venue: Around 800 guests attended the £105-a-ticket awards ceremony at the Thistle hotel .

Glammed up: 26-year-old Ms Campbell (pictured left and right) exposed her rear at Ms Reid during the event . 'They all came on stage and tried to hold me, they were all my friends, they misinterpreted the situation.' Ms Reid said the crowd then became rowdy. 'There was all this pushing and shoving and people were all around about me. I don't know,' she said. 'They said I head-butted somebody but I wouldn't. 'I was swaying, because I was being held from behind and I was pushed into her. 'It was never a head-butt. The woman is a good friend of my daughter, why on earth would I try and do that to her?' Apology: Ms Reid sent this apology to attendees of the event, saying she had resigned from sponsors INAA . In the video clip Ms Reid is seen being restrained by a security guard and seemingly forced into . another woman's face. She said: 'I started to resist as they were all . pulling and shoving at me, and the next thing I know I'm being carried . by security guards outside. 'To this moment I still haven't got any idea why that happened, and it must have looked so bad to everybody.' Guests: Former Coronation Street star Michell Keegan was in the audience for the prestigious awards ceremony . She denied she had been drunk, and explained she was not wearing shoes because she had broken her toes. 'I was running about in my bare feet all night . because I'd broken my toes while moving boxes at home, and I couldn't . get my shoes on,' she said. 'When I went up and did my speech I actually . apologised and said to everyone why I was barefoot, as the only shoes I . could get into were tennis shoes. 'I did have a drink that . night. I'd had two half glasses of wine at most, that was all. I . certainly wasn't drunk like they're making out. I didn't have the time . to get drunk. 'The next day I felt as though I'd had a nervous . breakdown. I have been on stress medication for some time and I feel . that the night was just the final tip for it.' Ms . Reid today sent an apology to those who attended the event for her . behaviour, which she put down to the wrong name being called out by . presenters. 'I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for my insensitive actions and behaviour on Sunday evening,' she wrote. 'Having . spent four months on the planning and preparation it was highly . embarrassing for the wrong name to be called out on stage. 'I can only imagine the distress caused to Cruz for which I apologise most profusely. I will of course accpet that I have caused irreparable damage and have therefore resigned from INAA.' A spokesman from Police Scotland told MailOnline: 'We were called at around 11.45pm on Sunday June 1 to a report of a disturbance but on arrival there was no evidence that any crime had been committed and no allegations of assault were made.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . When vicar's secretary Claire Sandys spotted a bird stuck to roof netting, she called the RSPCA to see if they could help. What followed, however, was the sort of full-scale emergency response you might expect for a serious road accident. Two police cars, a rapid response vehicle, and two fire engines, one of which had a cherry picker, were dispatched to the scene in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and the road was closed for an hour as emergency crew worked to free the troubled rook. Emergency! The rook got its leg caught in anti-seagull netting on top of a building in Cheltenham . Drama: The street was closed while emergency crews in high visibility jackets carried out the rescue . A spokesman for the fire service said if more urgent calls had come in, the crews would have been diverted . Ms Sandys, personal assistant to the vicar at Trinity Church, in Winchcombe Street, saw the rook caught by its leg in netting which had been put on a nearby roof to stop birds roosting. She said: 'It wasn’t nice watching this poor bird suffer on the rooftop over the road from our window.  It kept just lying down, like it had died, then trying to get free again when a seagull came over. 'It was a sorrowful sight, and it seemed so sad to leave him there - after all, it is one of God’s creatures, so I just called the RSPCA to let them know.' Then followed the hour-long rescue operation, estimated to have cost around £1,600, based on an approximate cost of £320 per emergency crew, per hour, before the bird was taken to a nearby wildlife centre. It is estimated the rescue cost around £1,600 - approximately £320 per crew per hour. Today local residents criticised the money being spent on rescuing one bird. Writing on Twitter, Tom Wheatly said: 'So it takes two fire engines and two police cars to rescue one bird from the roof of a three-storey building in the middle of Cheltenham. 'Two fire engines and two police cars, when human beings die from ambulances not getting there in time.' Ellie Rose, 18, a waitress at Spencers cafe in the street said: 'We were watching the whole thing and thought it was ridiculous, and pretty over the top. Firefighters worked in tandem to rescue the bird, which was caught in netting designed to deter seagulls . Urgent rescue operation: Two fire engines, one with cherry picker, were sent to rescue the stricken rook . 'Initially we thought it was a cat that was stuck up there, but then we got the information from the fire fighters that it was bird. We had a little giggle in the cafe.' A Gloucestershire Police said he didn't know how many officers attended or how much the call-out would have cost. He said: 'They [the fire service] only asked us to close the road. 'The fire engine they were using, it would have blocked it [the road].' When asked for the average cost of a call out of this nature, he said: 'There are so many variables, it is impossible to say.' Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman, Dave Hornibrook, said: 'When undertaking a rescue of this nature, we can redirect crews to a more serious incident.' Staff at Vale Wildlife Rescue centre, in Beckford, Gloucestershire, said the bird was recovering and 'in good spirits'.","Church secretary Claire Sandys called RSPCA when she saw trapped bird .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A group of Morris dancers have been forced to end a 900-year-old procession as they struggle to cope with the magnitude of paperwork involved. The Dolphin Morris Men revived the 12th century event, dating back to 1109, in 1981 and have carried it out every year since. But this Saturday will be the last time they dance 20 miles from Nottingham to Southwell as organisers 'can no longer keep up with the 21st century'. Tradition: The Dolphin Morris Men have danced across 20 miles from Nottingham to Southwell every year in a 900-year-old tradition but can no longer afford to close roads and cope with the magnitude of paperwork . End: The procession, started in 1109, cost £500 this year and took weeks to organise, co-ordinators say . To hold the procession, which snakes through pubs and village greens along the route, the committee have to apply for road closures and buy signs. Added to the remaining costs, they have finally decided it is untenable. Co-ordinator Chris Gigg said: 'What started as a simple procession has become very complicated. The cost associated with this year’s event has been about £500. 'Because of the procession, we have to close off some of the roads, which obviously takes a lot of planning. 'If you’re having road closures, you also have to hire road signs and things like that. The administration and costs involved in organising the event is out of all proportion. 'We’re really disappointed as it has been a fantastic tradition, with people coming together from all over the region. 'Unfortunately the 21st century has caught up with us.' Support: The parade started as a way to raise money to support the church and build the Southwell Minster . Route: 160 Morris dancers will leave Nottingham at 8.30am this Saturday after the Lord Mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence - the amount Nottingham gave to Southwell in 1109 . The Dolphin Morris Men’s Bagman Martin . Morley, 60, said: 'I’ve really enjoyed being part of this ancient . tradition, especially as people from all over come along to take part. 'Unfortunately, increased regulation with road closures and costs has made it very difficult, so we’ve decided to stop doing it this year. 'It’s a shame, but it has just become a bit too much for us.' The Gate to Southwell tradition celebrated the 12th century procession of parishioners to Southwell Minster in order to pay for the upkeep of the cathedral. As the Dolphin Morris Men’s website explains: 'It all started in 1109 when it was decided to build a 'Mother Church' at Southwell - what is now known as Southwell Minster. 'Churches don’t come cheap, so they hit . on a ruse to invite people from all over the Diocese to walk to . Southwell and bring money with them. The walking made it a nice day out, . and the transport costs thus saved could be given to the church. The . perfect plan! Lamenting the magnitude of red tape, co-ordinator Chris Gigg said: 'The 21st century has caught up with us' 'The amount given by each parish varied, according to the wealth and generosity of the parishioners. Nottingham, for example, gave 13 shillings and four pence (about 66p), whereas lowly Stanton gave only 5d (about 2p). The whole lot came to 15 pounds, 18 shillings, seven pence and one farthing. 'In today’s money, just under £16 - the cost of a CD - but in those days, enough to buy a whole steeple, or a good sized nave.' History books show that Morris dancers have been involved in the event from as far back as 1530. On Saturday, more than 160 dancers will process between Nottingham and Southwell. The ceremony begins at 8.30am when Nottingham’s Lord Mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence. Some dancers walking the entire 20 miles and others using cars or minibuses to get between the various meeting points. It ends with a rendezvous at Southwell Minster where the purse containing the ‘Southwell Pence’ is handed over to the clerk. Dolphin Morris Men member Bob Hine, 70, was responsible for re-starting the event 33 years ago and has been part of the procession ever since. He said: 'I’m trying to think of it in a more positive way. 'It’s amazing we’ve kept this going as long as we have. 'It started off as a one-off event so to have carried it on for more than 30 years is fantastic.' Peter Goode, Nottinghamshire County Council's traffic manager, said: 'It will be disappointing to see the loss of a 900 year-old tradition, but there is also a need to recognise the complexity of managing old events safely on today's roads which carry high volumes of fast-moving traffic. 'The County Council has supported this event by waiving charges for making legal orders and approving traffic management, but we do have to ensure that event organisers make their own proper arrangements to ensure the safety of participants and the general public and to minimise disruption. 'The standards for the management of traffic are set by the Department for Transport and apply across all local authority areas and to all similar events nationwide. 'We are happy to work with the event organisers and propose other routes which may reduce their costs by being less dependent on road closures, diversions and traffic restrictions.'","Dolphin Morris Men revived 1109 traditional 20-mile parade in 1981 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Laura Mitchell, 25, stormed into a cafe in Ossett, West Yorkshire, and hurled racist abuse at Martha Kolleh-McBurrough, a court heard . A cafe owner who posted signs in her window ‘warning’ customers she was black was later called a 'black b****' by an angry woman who stormed into her restaurant, a court heard. Martha Kolleh-McBurrough caused controversy last summer when she put up the notice in her Yeanon cafe in Ossett, West Yorkshire, saying it was to ward off racist customers. Three months later, however, a woman rushed into her cafe, accusing Ms Kolleh-McBurrough of damaging her parked car and hurling racist abuse at her. Wakefield Magistrates' Court heard that care worker Laura Mitchell, 25, was told by a neighbour that they'd seen Ms Kolleh-McBurrough bump her car, which was parked outside the cafe. Mitchell, who was seven months pregnant at the time and holding her three year-old daughter, called her ‘every name in the book, including black ‘b***’, the court heard. Magistrates were also told that Mitchell, from Ossett, threatened to slap the cafe owner. Ms Kolleh-McBurrough said: 'She was calling me all the names in the book. She was really, really angry.' Mitchell wept yesterday as she was convicted of making racially aggravated threats. She said she had only gone into the cafe to exchange insurance details with Ms Kolleh-McBurrough, whom she said told her 'You’re accusing me because of the colour of my skin'. Mitchell claimed that the owner stood there: 'Right in my face, yelling and waving a spatula about in a threatening manner. 'She seemed very irate'. Andrew Morris, who was eating in the cafe at the time, said Mitchell was aggressive and bigoted behaviour and he eventually told her: 'There’s no need for racism'. Prosecutor Martin Sleight said: 'The complainant came across as an honest and truthful witness who hadn’t come to court to make a malicious allegation against the defendant.' Referring to the cafe owner’s controversial sign, he added: 'She felt that people were racist towards her. I do not believe that people of Ossett are generally racist.' Ben Tighe, for Mitchell, said she was of previous good character but added: 'Racism cannot and must not be tolerated in our society.' Mitchell was fined £485 and ordered to pay a £300 victim surcharge.

"By . Bianca London . A young Scottish author whose inspirational book has helped children deal with their parents’ cancer diagnosis is to receive an award set up in memory of Princess Diana. Teenager Emma Sutherland, 14, beat off youngsters from across the country to scoop a Diana Award in the active campaigner category for her debut book ‘Eek! My Mummy Has Breast Cancer’. The book is Emma’s personal story about coming to terms with her mother Rosie’s illness. Young author: Emma Sutherland's book, Eek! My Mummy has Breast Cancer, which she wrote after her mother Rosie, right, was diagnosed with the disease, has scooped a top award . The Diana Awards were established in 1999 - two years after her death - to celebrate children who help their community. Emma, from Fairmilehead in south Edinburgh, said she had no idea about the award until organisers told her she had won. The Boroughmuir High School pupil yesterday said: 'I didn’t even know I had been nominated so I was a bit confused. It took a few minutes to sink in. 'I’m too young to remember Princess Diana but I’ve heard about her and what she did. I was just telling my mum that One Direction’s song Diana was inspired by the princess. 'It’s great to have an award in Diana’s memory.' Emma penned her story after struggling to find advice for children her age while her mother was battling illness. Honoured: Emma, 14, beat off  youngsters from across the country to scoop a Diana Award in the active campaigner category for her debut book 'Eek! My Mummy Has Breast Cancer' When the internet failed to give her any answers she decided to create her own book, which was published last year after a family fundraising drive for printing costs. And it has proved to be popular, with a second print run already ordered. Emma - a big One Direction fan - said: 'It’s nearly two years since I wrote the book and really weird to see where they have all ended up. 'There’s people from all over the world that have been looking at the Facebook page so it’s good to know we’re raising awareness.' Her mother, who has now been given the all-clear, said her daughter had taken the praise in her stride. Rosie, who works as a child minder, said: 'I’m really proud of her. 'Emma’s enjoying it and is certainly going to be a true campaigner in her young adult years.' Fundraising and helping others is clearly in the Sutherland family’s DNA as they have spent years raising money for the special care babies unit at Edinburgh’s Royal Infirmary. Emma herself was born prematurely at just 3lb 7oz and spent her first three weeks in the unit. She decided to pay back staff in the Simpsons unit by donating the proceeds from cake bakes and yard sales. Emma was nominated for the Diana Award by charity boss John Macaulay of Fight Against Cancer Edinburgh, who also took her to Lapland last Christmas. He said: 'It’s just great what she’s doing and I thought she deserved the recognition for it.  It is brilliant that she has won a top award which will be signed by the Prime Minister.' A spokesman for Maggie’s Cancer Care, which provided counselling for Emma, said the award was a 'significant measure' of the importance of her book for other children. All of the proceeds from Emma’s books go to Maggie’s Cancer Care and every Maggie’s Centre in the UK has a copy along with every Edinburgh Library. Last month Emma also scooped A Young Scot Award for her writing. A total of 40,000 Diana Awards have been handed out to inspirational youngsters so far. Award winner: The book is Emma's personal story about coming to terms with her mum Rosie's illness.

"By . Richard Spillett . He may be able to fly - but this Scottish Superman appears to have trouble finding the shops. Joker Kevin Hannaway was filmed apparently flying along outside the window of a workman's moving van in the stunted-up video shot on a country road outside Cambuslang near Glasgow. The film - which shows the 'superhero' asking for directions - has been viewed thousands of times around the world after it was posted online earlier this week. Scroll down for video . Kevin Hannaway appears to fly alongside a workman's van in a video posted on YouTube . The video shows a van driver motoring along a country road and commenting: 'We've finished our shift. We're quite happy. It's a wee Friday.' The camera then pans to the driver's left to show Mr Hannaway, 24, in a Superman-pose outside the passenger-side window. As bushes and trees hurtle past, he manages to stiffle his giggles as he calmly chats to the driver. He says: 'Excuse me, how do I get to the shops from here, boys?' to which the laughing driver replies 'stick to the left'. Blacksmith Mr Hannaway then says 'All right buddy, is that me then' and 'Cheerio' before appearing to fly off away from the van. The video has since been sent around the world by internet users, attracting scores of comments. Cameron . Church tweeted 'Scottish Humour at its best.... #OneToWatch', Neville . Foster wrote 'Great, just flipping great..Good on you guys..﻿' and Simon . Gilbert added 'hilarious'. Mr . Hannaway has said the van slowed down and he was cycling alongside, but . a frame of the video appears to show the van's side door open and his . hand holding onto the passenger seat's head-rest. Mr Hannaway chats to the driver as the van heads along a country road in near Cambuslang, Scotland. After getting directions to the shops, he bids the driver 'Cheerio' before turning and appearing to fly off . He told the Daily Record: 'We used to make a lot of videos so we just did it for a bit of a laugh. The idea just popped into my head one day and I thought I’d try it out.' But motoring groups have criticised the move, with AA president Edmund King saying: 'Superman should stick to the big screen rather than doing dangerous stunts on rural roads. 'Whether he is going along on a bike or hanging out of the side door, the van would only have to hit a pothole and his super strength would be severely tested.' Following the commments, Mr Hannaway urged others not to copy his act, adding: 'They should leave it to the real Clark Kent.' After the stunt was criticised by safety groups, Mr Hannaway said flying should be left to the real Clark Kent, played here by Christopher Reeve in the 1978 film .","Prankster's film appears to show him flying beside van like superhero .

The pensioner who led . fellow night train passengers in a sing-a-long has been identified as a . strawberry farmer whose spirits had been raised by a few glasses of . champagne. Martin Clews, . 66, from Sevenoaks, Kent, broke the silence aboard the 12.07am from . London Victoria to Ashford International by standing up and starting a . call-and-response chant. Despite being met with an awkward hush, he persisted until dozens of his fellow passengers began singing along in chorus. Mr Clews yesterday admitted he had had ‘a couple of glasses’ of champagne before he launched into his singsong. 'It seemed to me that like-minded bon viveurs in my carriage might enjoy a jolly song on their way home,' he told Mason's News. 'So . I chose a lively number called Beastie, which has become somewhat of a . favourite in my rugby club and this went down well with the passengers. 'It emanated many years ago when a mate of mine went out to volunteer helping kids on the west coast of America. 'It’s a spiritual song, I don’t know what the Beastie is, but I suppose it goes back to Africa in a way.' Mr Clews said the song was popular at his rugby club at Old Whitgiftians in South Croydon and Twickenham.

Audience: The grey-haired man in a beige suit attracted awkward stares when he stood up and launched into a rendition of the standard Side by Side . Audience: Around 50 passengers on the service between London Victoria and Ashford International were treated to the impromptu concert . Attire: After the first song, he then found a hat and began a rendition of Side by Side . Dance: His first song was a collection of random words which he got passengers on the Southeastern Train service to repeat . Mr .

Their son Dan Clews, 34, is a popular . singer/songwriter who has performed on stage with comedian Tim Minchin. Dan's . music career was the reason Mr Clews had been on the train at all. 'I’d . been celebrating the release of Dan’s new single, That’s Enough For Me, . over a glass or two of champagne with friends in London,' he said. Mr . Clews left London on the 12.10am train and led the chorus until he got . off at Kemsing. Beginning with Beastie, he moved on to the old old . favourite Side By Side until the carriage resembled a scene from a . musical. 'It probably lasted about half an hour. I was persuaded to take it to another part of the train,' he said. 'After a group got off at Bromley South people from Maidstone asked could I do it again.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . One of Germany's most famous fortune tellers is fighting for her life in intensive care after being stabbed repeatedly by a man unhappy with her advice. The fortune teller Zagorka Jovanovic, 68, who advertises on white magic websites as Esmeralda aus Bilk, charged hundreds of euros for a sitting in which she claimed to use the spiritual world to settle relationship disputes. But she was stabbed outside her flat in Dusseldorf, a city in western Germany, by Turkish man Metin Kolkilic, after advising his lover to leave him. Zagorka Jovanovic, 68, who goes by the name of Esmeralda aus Bilk, is fighting for her life in hospital after being repeatedly stabbed on her doorstep by a man unhappy with one of her readings . According to police 43-year-old Kolkilic had started a relationship with a local woman after she had walked out on her previous partner. Police are hunting for 43-year-old Metin Kolkilic, who is believed to have attacked Jovanovic after she told his lover to leave him . Knowing that she was superstitious, her ex persuaded the woman to visit Esmeralda. She advised the pair to get back together if the young woman wanted to have a happy future. As a result she walked out on Kolkilic and returned to her previous lover. Kolkilic flew into a rage when his lover told him she was leaving him because of the psychic. He went to see the fortune teller himself, and after she opened the door he stabbed her repeatedly before running off. The fortune teller's husband, who heard her screaming from the hallway, said she was already lying on the floor in a pool of blood with no sign of her attacker by the time he found her. He called an ambulance and medics say it was only thanks to a speedy emergency operation that she is alive. Kolkilic has gone on the run. Police officers are still looking for him and believe he may have fled back to Turkey. The fortune teller became famous in Dusseldorf after she signed up a number of prominent clients including the local mayor Joachim Erwin.","Zagorka Jovanovic, 68, repeatedly stabbed on her doorstep in Dusseldorf .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Universities minister David Willetts said all universities can do is ask students if they have booked a flight home . Universities cannot be expected to march foreign students to the airport when their course ends, senior Tory minister David Willetts has warned. The universities minister told MailOnline lecturers could ‘ask in a friendly way’ when graduates were planning to return home. But he insisted they cannot be forced to track them once their course ends or ‘escort’ them to the airport. It puts him at odds with Home Secretary Theresa May who wants new rules to force colleges to make sure students from overseas do not stay on once their visas run out. Official figures suggest that around 100,000 foreign students stay on in Britain illegally each year. According to the Office for National Statistics, 145,000 non-EU students arrived here in 2012. Yet last year, only 50,000 non-EU students returned to their home countries. Mrs May wants the Tory manifesto to include a pledge to force colleges and universities to take responsibility for making sure foreign students go home. But universities say they cannot be held responsible for what ex-students do after they leave their course. Now their opposition has been backed by Mr Willetts, who warned the most universities could do was ask if students from overseas were planning their return. He pointed to the University of Portsmouth which runs a scheme where they ‘monitor and ask’ overseas students who are coming to the end of their course if they are preparing to return to their home country. Mr Willetts said they ask: ‘Have you booked your flight, when are you planning to go home, all that kind of thing, asked in a friendly way.’ He told MailOnline: ‘At the moment universities don't have a legal responsibility for escorting students to the airport. ‘My view is overseas students come here to study and after that they either have to go back home or they've got a suitable level of job to stay on to do post-study work. ‘Universities can help us ensure that students go home.’ Last year 177,000 people came to the UK for formal study, according to the Office for National Statistics said . He played down the suggestion of a ‘massive dispute’ between the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Home Office. ‘But there are limits to what they have got legal powers to do. They can ask them but if you have finished your degree at the end of June but your visa expires at the end of August, the university hasn't currently got the legal powers to track its recent graduates up until the end of August. ‘But what they can do - and I encourage them to do this - what they can do when the students have finished their exams is say “so you are planning to go back home at the end of August? You know, what are going to do?” ‘They can ask that information, then voluntarily the student can provide it.’ Home Secretary Theresa May wants the next Conservative manifesto to include a pledge to force universities to take responsibility for making sure foreign students go home . The Home Office has been stung by criticism over its failure to reduce immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’. David Cameron and Mrs May have repeated the Tory pledge many times since the coalition was formed, but the latest figures show net migration hit 201,000 in 2013. Some have argued for students to be removed from the headline net migration figures, over fears it risked deterring people from choosing British universities. Instead the Home Office has proposed curbs on students bringing in dependants and sanctions against institutions which allow students to break the rules.","EXCLUSIVE: Senior minister says universities cannot track ex-students .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . The man who led Netherlands to the World Cup final four years ago has questioned why Louis van Gaal has changed the team’s formation so close to the tournament starting in Brazil. Bert van Marwijk said the decision to go from 4-3-3 to 5-3-2 left players little time to adapt to a ‘significant transition’ with their opening group game against Spain less than a fortnight away. Van Gaal, who takes over at Manchester United once the World Cup is over, implemented the new system, which relies on energetic wing-backs, in Holland’s 1-0 friendly victory over Ghana last Saturday and will continue with it for the match against Wales tonight at the Amsterdam Arena. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch van Gaal taking Dutch training . Tinkerman: Louis van Gaal (C) has changed Holland's formation shortly before the start of the World Cup . The change was made to tighten up the Dutch defence and has so far been seen as a success but Van Marwijk cautioned against such a large shift away from the style that brought him success in 2010. ‘It is his right to opt for a 5-3-2 system, but this is not my system,’ Van Marwijk told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. ‘This is not just an adaptation, but a significant transition, which calls for a lot from players . Last time round: Bert van Marwijk (C) took Holland to the final at the 2010 World Cup - losing 1-0 to Spain . ‘As a coach I indicated as soon as possible how I wanted to play and then worked for two years. The players would grow accustomed. That needs to be faster.’ Van Gaal has already given short shrift to doubts from others over his selection, which has Daley Blind of Ajax and Daryl Janmaat of Feyenoord in the wing-back positions and Wesley Sneijder operating behind Robin Van Persie and Arjen Robben in attack. And he is unlikely to care too much about Van Marwijk’s observations. More relevant to the incoming United boss is where Holland finish and the ‘large expectations’ of the Dutch federation. It is something he will undoubtedly have at Old Trafford too. Setting targets: The purpose is to win the World Cup, insists next Manchester United manager Van Gaal . ‘The purpose is to win the World Cup – but that's only for one,’ said Van Gaal. ‘The purpose of the board is the semi-finals. That is maybe too big an expectation. ‘I think this team can beat all. But we can also lose. That’s sport and we accept that but it’s difficult for the Dutch people to accept. ‘I give myself more pressure than anyone else. I will always win.’","Louis van Gaal will manage Holland at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Andy Murray knows exactly what kind of welcome to expect from the French crowd when he walks out to face Gael Monfils today. And it is unlikely to be: ‘Bienvenue mon ami’. In these parts they have an enveloping passion for tennis rarely found across the Channel, at least outside Wimbledon fortnight, and the charismatic Monfils is their last standard bearer at the national Grand Slam. The attraction of this quarter-final is such that they have put the match on Roland Garros’s main Court Philippe Chatrier, thus bumping the repeat of last year’s final between Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer across to the Suzanne Lenglen arena. Hot recption: Andy Murray knows he will be cast as the villain when he meets Gael Monfils in the French Open . Patriot games: Gael Monfils is the last Frenchman left in the draw at Roland Garros . Drop shot: Andy Murray . Murray and Monfils have met here before, in a far less high-profile first-round clash in 2006, which the Frenchman won in five sets. The only other marquee French name Murray has played at Roland Garros is Richard Gasquet in 2012. The Scot was roundly jeered as he walked on to court, and again when he lost the first set, before recovering to hammer a notoriously brittle opponent. Murray has described the crowd here as ‘ferocious’. His game is respected in France but he is not remotely adored in the same way as, for example, the francophone Roger Federer. It will help that he has played three away Davis Cup ties in the past nine months. ‘I’m not expecting the crowd to be for me and I look forward to that because it doesn’t often happen where the whole crowd is against you,’ he said. ‘Even in Davis Cup in Italy (last month), we had some great support there, so it’s going to be a good experience for me.’ Some shrivel in this situation while others grow. Murray is in the latter category, as oppression brings out his belligerent side. It is heartening that the back surgery he underwent is finally beginning to pay a dividend, with the extra rotation gained on his backhand a particular bonus. After beating Fernando Verdasco he was the most upbeat he has been about his physical condition this year. Hot Scot: Murray smiles after beating Frenchman Richard Gasquet at the 2012 French Open in Paris . ‘The way I’m hitting my backhand now is 10 times better than it was last year,’ he said. ‘Moving to that side as well is so much better than it was. ‘There were periods this year when I had some problems, but that is to be expected with surgery. It’s starting to get better slowly and I’m close to being back to 100 per cent. ‘That’s exciting for me especially at this stage of the year with a big few weeks around the corner. ‘That was what I was hoping, what I was planning for. The  Australian Open was always going to be tough for me to be 100 per cent in terms of match fitness but I did OK there and hopefully between now and the end of the year I can play like this.’ Crazy legs! Gael Monfil's elastic movement will make him a difficult proposition for Andy Murray . Monfils, an adversary of Murray’s from the age of 10, has a strong record at Roland Garros but his good run here has been rather unexpected; his last tournament was back in late April, after which he struggled with ankle problems. In a bizarre third round against Fabio Fognini he cramped badly in the fourth set before storming back to win the fifth. One thing that is for sure is that his legs, which contort themselves in the most remarkable way to retrieve the ball, will be made to work phenomenally hard by the Scot. They have met five times and Murray leads 3-2. Monfils will be the third successive high-class opponent ranked in the 20s that Murray has come across this fortnight. If he plays today like he did on Monday against Verdasco he will extend his head-to-head lead to 4-2. On a roll: Andy Murray celebrates after beating Fernando Verdasco in the previous round . The pugnacious Ferrer goes into his battle with a win already this year over Nadal on clay. The champion’s opposition thus far has been gentle, and his compatriot will give him a far greater test than he has been through to date.

"By . Leon Watson . The family of a millionaire . businessman shot dead in Spain have been refused permission to bring his . body home and been forced to bury him there. Andy Bush, 48, was allegedly killed by ex-girlfriend Mayka Kukucova shortly after arriving at his villa in Estapona in April. It is claimed she had been laying in wait for the gold dealer who arrived with his latest love interest Maria Korotaeva, 21. Scroll down for video . Questioning: Mayka Kukucova, left, is being interrogated over the death of ex-boyfriend Andy Bush, right . Extradited: The model has been transported from her native Slovakia to Madrid for questioning . He . was then shot three times before Kukucova fled the scene in Andy's . Hummer and re-appeared in her home country - almost 2,000 miles away, . three days later. A Spanish . judge has insisted his body has to stay in the country for up to five . years for post-mortem examinations during the murder inquiry and court . trials. His devastated . family said the judge ordered his body should be buried on Friday - but . they managed to persuade him to wait until today to allow . them time to fly out to Spain. Mr . Bush's sister Rachel Bush, 42, who led the campaign to get his body . released, said: 'I was told at 5pm on Wednesday that they planned to . bury him on Friday. 'I . pleaded with the judge to give us more time so we could go over, which . is how it should be. I felt absolutely stunned and shocked and numb when . they told me. 'Until we can bury him we can't grieve. Grief: Relatives of Mr Bush pictured at the site of his killing in Estepona, on the Costa del Sol . Arrest: Kukucova pictured after she handed herself in to the authorities in Slovakia . 'My . dad has died and my mum is struggling. I'm the one fighting for it, . trying to get him home. I don't know how many times they need to check . his body.' Mr Bush's daughter Ellie, 19, flew out with Rachel for the burial yesterday morning. Despite . the setback, the family has vowed to continue with the campaign, which . has already collected more than 1,980 signatures, supported by Bristol . MP Chris Skidmore. Mr . Skidmore said: 'I am determined to do all I can to ensure that his body . is laid to rest in the UK in accordance with his family's wishes. 'I . am encouraged by the fact that, from contact we have had with the . Embassy in Malaga through the Consular Directorate, the Spanish . authorities are sympathetic to the wishes of the family and that the . family have the opportunity to speak to the presiding judge in the case . on Monday. 'I will continue . to do all I can to help the Bush family achieve their goal of laying . Andy to rest in the UK and look forward to meeting with Rachel Bush in . the near future. 'My thoughts are with Rachel, Ellie and the rest of the Bush family at this difficult time.' Miss Korotaeva, has told Spanish detectives Kukucova was waiting inside his rented villa and opened the door to them after they flew to the Costa del Sol to celebrate their five-month anniversary together. The 21-year-old student at the University of the West of England said she heard shots and a row after leaving the ex-lovers inside the house to argue - and saw his ex flee moments later with the keys to his 4x4 which was later found abandoned nearby. She found his body on the living room floor after firefighters forced their way in following her desperate emergency call. Investigators say Mr Bush was shot twice with an Italian-made .38 special revolver. Couple: At the time of his death, Mr Bush had started a relationship with student Maria Korotaeva . Witness: Miss Korotaeva said she left the room shortly before Mr Bush was shot dead in April . Claims: Mr Bush's new girlfriend said that his ex was madly jealous and described her as a 'snake' Russian-born Miss Korotaeva has described Kukucova as being madly jealous, and said her boyfriend had to change all the locks at his house in Bristol after splitting with her last year. She claimed in an interview shortly after the killing: 'Andy hated her with a passion. She was like a poisonous snake.' Kukucova, who has not yet been charged with any crime, is expected to claim that she shot Mr Bush in self-defence during an argument. Her lawyer in Slovakia said yesterday: 'I haven't been officially informed about her extradition yet by anybody. 'Due to this situation I cannot provide you with any details of the handover. 'She will be represented by one of my colleagues who is recognised as one of the best criminal lawyers in Spain.' However, sources close to the case in Spain confirmed she had been extradited.","Andy Bush, 48, was allegedly killed by his ex-girlfriend in April .

"By . Richard Spillett . Families are going hungry while supermarkets are paid public money to turn tonnes of surplus food in biofuel, a new report has revealed. Only two per cent of the estimated 400,000 tonnes of extra food produced by shops and restaurants each year is sent to charities, according to a government inquiry. The other 98% is either dumped in landfill or turned into biogas using government subsidies of up to £70 per tonne. An inquiry has found too much edible food is being sent to landfill or biofuel plants rather than given to charity . The Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger and Food Poverty was told millions of pounds of public money is subsidising 'anaerobic digestion plants' which convert food into biogas, while charities miss out. Labour MP Frank Field, who co-chaired the inquiry, has criticised the use of taxpayer's cash to destroy edible food, branding the scheme 'madness on stilts'. His inquiry's report stated: 'The food industry should set itself a target of reducing the amount of surplus food disposed of in landfill, and turned into compost or energy, by 100,000 tonnes each year by the end of the next parliament. 'This should be achieved by preventing waste in retail and supply chains, and by redistributing surplus food through the voluntary sector.' Currently, an estimated 3.4 million tonnes of food is wasted every year by the food industry in the UK, before it reaches shops or restaurants. At least 10% of that waste is fit for human consumption, enough for 800 million meals. Tesco revealed last year that 68 per cent of its bagged salads, 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste. British households also throw away around 4.2 million tonnes of food a year. Since 2003, the cost of food has increased at a greater rate than earnings, with the cost of a weekly shop increasing by 46%, while the average wage went up by only 27.9%. FareShare, an organisation that resdistributes food to charities, says it has to charge supermarkets around £100 a tonne for food that is given to them to cover storage and transport costs. Meanwhile, biogas companies were handed nearly £30million in subsidies from the Department of Energy and Climate change. FareShare director Mark Varney told the Times: 'I'm up against that economic obstacle when I talk to the food industry and they say; ""Well, actually, we have got an arrangement with this operator who comes and picks up the food"".' Mr Field has now called for the system to be changed to make given food to charity the cheapest option for the food industry. He said: 'We're calling for a real focus on the millions of tonnes of surplus food that goes to waste each year in the food retail sector. Our proposals would save charities money, put downward pressure on food prices and provide healthier options to families relying on voluntary support.' The inquiry found doubling the number of food given to charities could save . them around £160million over the next parliamentary term. Around . 1.6million tonnes of food waste is used in Britain's 82 biogas plants . every year as part of the Government's commitment to get at least 15% of . its energy from renewable sources by 2020. But the agency helping to set up the plants has admitted some of the food used is edible. Food charity FareShare says that, when it comes to asking supermarkets to hand over their surplus food, it is struggling to compete with government-subsidised biogas producers . Tesco has revealed that in the first six months of 2013 it generated 30,000 tonnes of food waste, of which 21 per cent was fruit and vegetables. The supermarket donates around 2,300 tonnes of food to charity, much of which is past its sell-by date but still deemed safe. Last month, a survey of executives of all major supermarket chains revealed top bosses ignore use-by and sell-by dates on their own food, with one manager branding the dates 'ridiculous'. Waitrose announced earlier this week that it would start selling 'blemished' fruit and veg after strict EU rules on misshapen produce were relaxed. Coffee chain Pret A Manger is one of many companies who do give large amounts of food to charity. The company has a fleet of vans that deliver over 12,000 fresh meals to numerous shelters for the homeless every week, with other charities collecting directly from cafes at the end of the day. In total, the company estimates it donates around 2.5 million products to UK homeless charities every year, which it says prevents up to 250 tonnes of food from ending up in landfill. However, some of the shops have no regular collection, meaning the company is appealing for more charities to come forward. Any organisations interested should ring 020 7932 5425 for more details. Meanwhile, Asda has signed a deal with FareShare that sees food from the supermarket's depots delivered to around 900 charities in the UK. The supermarket says it hands over enough food for more than 8million meals a year, saving the charity £4.5million. Last year, the Asda Foundation also donated £100,000 to FareShare to increase their depot space and buy new vans.","Supermarkets sending 100,000 tonnes of surplus food to be turned into fuel .

The departing captain had a year remaining on his deal at Craven Cottage but had his contract ripped up following relegation to the Premier League. And Hangeland claims the west Londoners gave him no warning before cutting their ties short after six-and-a-half years of service while he was enjoying an off-season holiday in the Indian Ocean. On his way: Brede Hangeland has been released by Fulham . ‘Today I received the news that Fulham has chosen to cancel my contract with the club with immediate effect,’ he said, via adviser Jon Morland. ‘I was notified of the decision via email, without anyone from the club meeting with me beforehand to discuss my contract or future at the club. ‘After six-and-a-half years of loyal and hard work, the last years as captain, I am immensely disappointed by how this was handled.’ However, Fulham say the 32-year-old knew his fate before they made their announcement. Hangeland is also understood to have . ignored requests to get in touch with manager Felix Magath and was . reluctant to commit to a future in the Championship in meetings held . last month. Head and shoulders above the rest: Stalwart Hangeland made 272 appearances for Fulham .

"By . Steph Cockroft . It is widely credited as kick-starting the demise of Nazi Germany in one of the most bloody wars witnessed in history. Now a reenactment group is bringing back to life the tide-turning moment that more than 150,000 troops landed on the beaches in Normandy, in the largest amphibious invasion in history. The historic day is being recreated to mark the 70th anniversary of when troops waded or parachuted onto French soil, as part of the famous Second World War D-Day landings. These French teenagers are part of a Second World War reenactment group . which has headed to 'Gold Beach' - one of the five sections of coasts in the D-Day landings - to mark the 70th Anniversary of the historic landings . Members of the Second World War reenactment group arrived at Arromanches-les-bains earlier today, ahead of the reenactment which will take place on Friday - the 70th anniversary of D-Day . Normandy veterans attended a ceremony at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard earlier today as part of the anniversary ceremonies, before they prepared to embark for France . It is part of a series of events planned all over the area for the anniversary, as many head of states and veterans make their way to the Normandy beaches. The landings saw nearly 160,000 troops from the allied countries - including the United Kingdom and the United States - join forces to launch an audacious attack on the beaches of Normandy. These assaults historically mark the start of the eventual defeat of the regime in Nazi Germany with General Dwight Eisenhower - who led the assault - afterwards declaring that the 'tide had turned'. And every effort has been made to ensure this year's ceremonies are a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives during the assault. On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied . troops died, while another 9,000 were wounded or declared missing. Total German . casualties are estimated at being between 4,000 and 9,000. The reenactment group has already arrived in Arromanche next to 'Gold . Beach' and near to 'Omaha Beach' - two of the five sectors in which the coast was divided - ready for the demonstration on Friday. The reenactment is just one of several events taking place along the D-Day beaches to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the assault . On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died and a further 9,000 were wounded or declared missing . The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, . Sword, Omaha, Utah and Gold. The reenactment will take place along the coast . The men have been driving jeeps along the . sand, loading up military trucks and carrying their vital weapons - all of . which will be recreated on the anniversary. The D-Day landings took place on June 6, 1944, when allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, France. The landings, codenamed . Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory. The landings, codenamed Operation Nepture, were a turning point in the war, as it lead to the liberation of occupied Europe . Some of the reenactors - these from Spain - have been practising scaling a . seawall on the Avenue de la Liberation, which runs parallel to Omaha Beach . June in Vierville, France, as part of the planned display . The history enthusiasts will wear replica uniforms - these one being US American Airborne . uniforms - to ensure the historic day is properly brought back to life . The mission involved around 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians. There was an initial airborne assault with more than 23,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn. The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah. A young boy, who is  part of the reenactment group, is seen walking along 'Gold . Beach' and lookimg at part of a Mulberry pontoon which will feature in the reenactment . The men practised loading their military trucks on . Omaha Beach for the event on Friday . After the assault - which was the largest amphibious assault in history - General Dwight Eisenhower declared that 'the tide had turned' The landings were a turning point in . the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing . on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied . Europe. After the invasion, Eisenhower said: 'The tide has . turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' To mark the 70th anniversary an . international flotilla of ships will sail through the channel to . Normandy before an international ceremony on Sword Beach.

"By . John Drayton . Giuseppe Rossi was left out of Italy’s World Cup squad because taking him to Brazil so shortly after an injury would have been too risky, coach Cesare Prandelli said Tuesday. Prandelli said he was surprised by the amount of controversy the decision had generated and insisted that the U.S. born Fiorentina striker knew from the start that he was unlikely to make the final 23. 'I didn’t expect such a big controversy, it has caused some difficulties and I would like to clear up what has happened,' Prandelli told reporters ahead of Wednesday’s warm-up friendly against Luxembourg. Axed: Giuseppe Rossi has missed out on Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's final 23-man squad for the World Cup . 'I feel a great responsibility towards my squad, to the supporters, to Fiorentina, and taking him to Brazil was a risk that did not make sense to me, although it would have been easier to have picked him. 'I told him that he had not completed the healing process.' Rossi, who only returned to action in early May after suffering his latest knee injury in January, was included in Italy’s provisional 30-man squad and played for more than one hour against Ireland in Saturday’s friendly. 'I met Rossi at Covericano (Italy’s training camp) before announcing the (provisional) list of 30. I came to talk to him, to warn him that he had only played a few minutes since he had recovered from his injury. Final call: Manager Prandelli said it would be too risky taking the Fiorentina frontman to Brazill . 'I intended to tell him he wasn’t among the 30, but I thought he could give an example to everyone else, a beautiful story to tell. At that moment, I told him he wasn’t among the 23, I repeated it twice.' Prandelli added: 'Before the last game, I called him and told him that from a physical point of view, some of the test results were good and others less good. 'I told him I wanted to see a striker who played as a striker, and I wanted to see that something extra, but I didn’t see what I wanted to see.' Rossi’s unlucky run began when the frontman just missed out on being selected for the 2010 World Cup by coach Marcello Lippi. Past mistakes: Marcello Lippi said last week he regretted leaving Rossi out of his 2010 World Cup side . The following year, he suffered an . anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing for Villarreal in a . Spanish league match against Real Madrid in 2011. He fought desperately to be fit again in time Euro 2012 only to re-injure the knee in training the following April, causing him to miss the tournament. He made an excellent comeback with Fiorentina this season, scoring 14 goals by early January to make him Serie A’s leading scorer. However, he then suffered a less serious injury, a second degree sprain to the medial collateral ligament, in the same knee which sidelined him until the start of last month.","Rossi has been left out of Italy's World Cup squad .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Back in the 1990s, Michael J Garcia enjoyed stealing a moment behind the desk of the then US Attorney Mary Jo White. ‘The office felt pretty good,’ joked Garcia, then a young prosecutor. ‘I liked the chair.’ In 2005, that chair in arguably the most prestigious prosecutor’s office in America - Southern District of New York, with responsibility for eight counties including Manhattan - was his. After being sworn in, this son of a shipping company worker and a housewife from Valley Stream, Long Island, ‘shut the door for a few minutes, just to absorb it’. The law man: Michael Garcia¿s investigation into alleged corruption has ruffled feathers among the FIFA membership . Now Garcia’s fame extends much further than the lower tip of New York. On Monday he was in Oman - temperature 37°C - as part of his inquiry into alleged corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The globe’s biggest sport awaits his findings. But we need not wait as long as was expected after the Sunday Times this week published further claims about the scale of secret payments Qatar made to host the 2022 World Cup. His need to evaluate new evidence might have delayed his inquiry by months. But after meeting Qatar officials in neutral Oman, he said he would close the investigation on Monday and submit his dossier of evidence to FIFA’s ethics committee in mid-July. ‘The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process,’ he said. FIFA appointed Garcia, now 53, two years ago. His c.v. was impressive. He was an assistant in the US attorney’s office from 1992 to 2001, prosecuting Al Qaeda terrorists who bombed US embassies in Africa in 1998 and four defendants in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case. He was under-secretary at Homeland Security, in charge of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, before President George W Bush appointed him a US attorney. In charge of 230 staff, he led the US government’s  criminal investigations into terrorism while tackling the staples of the Southern District job, white-collar and organised crime. But his spell in New York was not without controversy. He was viewed by his detractors as a politicised figure - too close to the Bush regime. He was meant to be the Sheriff of Wall Street, responsible for the financial heart of the city, but failed to lead any aggressive investigation into those arguably responsible for the biggest crash since the 1929 Depression. In contrast, he pursued the Democratic governor, Eliot Spitzer who, according to Scott Horton, contributing editor at the liberal-leaning Harper’s Magazine, was ‘on the verge of destroying the Republican Party in New York’. Talk: Garcia speaks to the media during the 63rd FIFA Congress press Conference in May last year . ‘Garcia’s colleagues had a generally positive impression of him but they (also) thought he had cultivated his rise by serving political masters,’ said Horton. ‘That is what appeared to be happening with Spitzer. So if you hire him for an investigation it would probably go along a predictable path: it would not embarrass those who hired him or be adverse in any way.’ Garcia, who refused to comment on Monday night, has always insisted that he did everything by the book with Spitzer, who paid money to a prostitution ring and resigned. Someone else with knowledge of Garcia said he was ‘thorough and forensic, absolutely clear and calm, and in command of his brief’. After 16 years as a public servant, Garcia went into lucrative private practice at Chicago-based Kirkland Ellis, where he could earn an estimated £2m-£3m a year. The move was reportedly brought about by Jay Lefkowitz, a neo-con who wrote Bush’s cell research policy. It was while at Kirkland that Garcia was appointed by FIFA to investigate the World Cup votes in 2010, and the presidential vote a year later. FIFA’s ethics committee banned Mohamed bin Hammam, the central figure in the Sunday Times revelations, from football after Garcia cited a ‘conflict of interest’ in the Arab’s roles as president of the Asian Football Confederation and as a FIFA executive member. The Sunday Times said Garcia has not interviewed Bin Hammam about the World Cup bidding process because he was not officially linked to the Qatar bid. That would seem a bizarre oversight, given the  millions of dollars he is alleged to have handed out as bribes. U-turn? It is thought FIFA president Sepp Blatter is against Qatar hosting the World Cup despite his public backing . Not that the scope of Garcia’s inquiry has failed to create unrest among some FIFA members. Despite having been backed by 97 per cent of the governing body’s membership only a year ago, there was a plot to oust him this March during an executive meeting in Zurich, where he had arrived unannounced to question delegates. That revolt failed, but he was told to hurry up and finish his report before the start of the World Cup, now nine days away. Another intriguing question is what Sepp Blatter, the FIFA president who is universally expected to stand for re-election next year, wants from Garcia. It is thought that despite his public backing for Qatar, Blatter is opposed to their hosting the World Cup. He did not vote for them, unlike his nemesis, UEFA president Michel Platini, whose son Laurent is a leading figure at Qatar-backed French club PSG. Blatter would, therefore, wound Platini if Qatar were stripped of the World Cup. Other aspects of Qatar are believed to irk him: the fact the tournament cannot be held in  summer, which necessitates a switch to winter. That in turn upsets the order of world football and jeopardises FIFA’s £1billion TV rights deal with Fox and Telemundo, a Spanish subsidiary of NBC, to show the football at a time of year when the NFL is not in full swing. The death of a thousand migrant workers in the building of the stadiums is another reason for Qatar to be stripped of host status. But before FIFA’s ethics committee and the executive make their next move, they will study the findings of Garcia, the father of three who holds the football world in his hands.","Garcia said he would close the investigation into Qatar's bid for the 2022 World Cup on Monday .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Ben Foster was informed by Roy Hodgson last week that he will start against Ecuador on Wednesday and has applauded the man-management style of the England manager. Hodgson’s inclusive approach is in contrast to the World Cup four years ago when Fabio Capello’s three goalkeepers did not know who would start the opening group game, against the United States, until shortly before the kick-off. It was Robert Green who got the nod but made an awful mistake which allowed Clint Dempsey to equalise and became the enduring image of a miserable campaign. Chance to impress: Ben Foster will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Ecuador . Established: Foster is the regular back-up to first-choice England goalkeeper Joe Hart . 'I knew that last week that I’d be playing this game, so I could tailor my week to get ready for it,' said Foster, the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, who will start his first England game for nearly four years. 'It’s different for an outfield player because they do all their work separately,' he added. 'For a goalkeeper, it’s important you know you’re playing, not only for how you tailor your training and gym work, but also mentally. 'It’s the same with your clubs, if you know you are playing week in week out, you can tailor everything around. 'Roy is very good with that, very open, a very personable person. He’s more than happy to pull people and have a chat with things and explain things in a very reasonable way.' Foster was watching on television when Green allowed Dempsey’s low shot to slither through his hands in Rustenburg, South Africa, four years ago. 'I was gutted for him,' said the Albion keeper. 'He’s a fantastic guy, a really nice man. It’s a real shame. I don’t know if it was being sprung at the last minute on him. 'A World Cup is a big deal, with a lot of pressure but he dealt with it and has bounced back, promoted with QPR.'

Manager Uwe Rosler said: ‘I’m very, very happy to get a player of Andrew’s stature and experience to our football club. ‘He was the captain of Malky Mackay’s promotion-winning team, he is a very experienced and reliable player who is at the best stage of his career and I’m looking forward to working with him. ‘He has all the qualities in his position that we are looking for; physically, technically he’s very good and tactically he has developed as a player well. ‘He’s willing to go forward, participating in our play offensively and he’s another cornerstone in our team for next season. ‘The quality he’s shown as a player for Middlesbrough and Cardiff is good but in particularly at Cardiff where he was captain of their promotion-winning team; I think that will do us very well as a team in next season’s campaign, especially when we’re bringing in younger players who need experienced players on the side to develop in the best way.’ Dependable: Wigan boss Uwe Rosler signed Taylor for his experience in getting Cardiff promoted . Taylor was a Youth Cup winner at Middlesbrough where he came through the club’s academy alongside the likes of Adam Johnson, Chris Brunt and James Morrison before joining Cardiff in 2011. He said: ‘Wigan Athletic are a big club, with Premier League experience and big aspirations. ‘The manager seems really good and I think his record when he came to the club last season speaks volumes. ‘It’s a fresh challenge for me and one I’m very excited about; I had three good years at Cardiff but everything has to come to an end and I’m looking forward to getting started at the DW Stadium.’ Promise: Taylor was a Youth Cup winner at Middlesbrough alongside Adam Johnson and Chris Brunt .","Andrew Taylor captained Cardiff when they were promoted .

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Everton winger Aiden McGeady is keen to make the most of every minute remaining of his summer football in order to give him the best possible start to next season. The 28-year-old arrived at Goodison Park from Spartak Moscow in January short of fitness due to the winter break of the Russian league. He made five starts and 13 substitute appearances and has set his sights on being in manager Roberto Martinez's first-choice XI on the opening day of next season. To be ready: Aiden McGeady is keen to make the most of every minute remaining of his summer football . To do that he wants to maximise his playing time in the Republic of Ireland's two friendlies against Costa Rica and Portugal in the United States over the next week. 'I haven't played all that much at the club so far but I'm just looking to play as many games as I can before the end of the season and hopefully have a good summer, keep myself in good shape and come back to hit the ground running in pre-season,' he told evertontv. 'It's getting into that rhythm of playing 90 minutes every week and getting up to the tempo of the Premier League. 'Hopefully that's what I'll do next season. The aim for me is to be in the starting XI in the first game. 'I spoke to the manager (Martinez) before we left and I said I wanted to carry on through the summer. 'I had a break at Christmas and he said I still need to give myself a rest from playing and running for a couple of weeks.' Carrying on: The Everton winger impressed for Ireland against Italy at Craven Cottage over the weekend . Planning ahead: Manager Roberto Martinez has said the club's recruitment drive is key this pre-season . With a Europa League campaign to contend with Martinez is going to need all his players fully fit in addition to the reinforcements he has to bring in this summer. 'Recruitment is vital. The recruitment department have been working tirelessly to get the reports and highlight the targets and players that are going to fit in our football club,' said the Spaniard. 'We've identified the players and now it's about making sure we can get them to join. 'It's very much an important period, but it's not one where we need to panic. We don't have to make decisions just to bring numbers into the club. 'Everything has to be measured and everything needs to be taken on the understanding that bringing the wrong player into this special group of players that we have could have a very negative effect. 'It's a key period to make the right calls and the right adjustments, but recruitment is going to be vitally important because of the demands of European football. It's something we want to embrace. 'We don't want to feel that we have to blame European football as the reason we cannot keep the standards in our domestic league.'","Ireland winger has made just five starts for the Toffees .

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Adam Lallana: £30million. This is the fee being demanded for a 26-year-old who was playing in League One just three years ago. Southampton are playing hardball in Liverpool’s pursuit of their star player, but is he really worth that much money? Andrei Shevchenko went to Chelsea from AC Milan for £30m. Ronaldo, the original one, went to Real Madrid from Inter for £30m. Rio Ferdinand went from Leeds to Manchester United for £30m. Strength to strength: Liverpool are tracking Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana, but may have to pay £30m . £30m men: Manchester United and Chelsea respectively spent big on Rio Ferdinand and Andrei Shevchenko . At the time – the fees of course being relative to the economic climate when the transfers were made – these players were at the pinnacle of their respective positions. Does Lallana deserve to follow at such a high price? Well, yes, actually. I was handed the assignment of following Southampton when they won promotion to the Barclays Premier League back in 2012 and have bore witness to a player who has gasped the opportunity presented to him in the top flight and torn it to shreds. The truly remarkable thing is how the club managed to keep hold of him all this time. I once covered a Southampton game when they visited Dagenham and Redbridge in January 2011, on their way to winning promotion from League One. A certain Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 17 at the time, was almost on his way to Arsenal and would join them that summer, but Lallana was also lighting up the league. He scored that game. Jinking and weaving: Lallana is set to become a real asset for Roy Hodgson's England at the World Cup . Pitch-side after the match, I asked then-manager Nigel Adkins if he was confident he could realistically keep hold of Lallana as well. He looked at me like it was the most ridiculous suggestion he had heard all season and insisted his star central midfielder was going nowhere. I didn’t believe him at the time, but somehow, for so long, they managed to keep Lallana on the south coast. The player has undoubted technical ability which only the top percentile of professional footballers possess, but what Lallana has developed over years of encouragement at Southampton is a positivity in his play to run opposition players ragged. He is strongest through the middle, but roams freely on either flank, and plays with utter selflessness.Take his assist for Rickie Lambert against Tottenham at St Mary’s last December as an example. Lallana had broken free on the right inside the box and had just the on-rushing Hugo Lloris to beat.With a seemingly supernatural sensory perception he took one touch before cutting the ball back behind him to Lambert, leaving the goalkeeper stranded, for a tap-in. He did it without even looking, so aware of his surroundings that he knew Lambert was running in behind. True grit: Former Saints boss Nigel Adkins managed to keep hold of his star man for longer than expected . Redefining: Lallana has reinvented the legendary Cruyff turn, the brainchild of Holland great Johan . Many players would claim to be able to play with equal strength on either foot, but very few actually can. Lallana is one who actually can. He scores with his left foot, his right foot, from inside the area, outside the area, with neat finishes from tight angles to pile drivers from distance. Lallana has reinvented the Cruyff Turn. It is a skill which has become so common it is used ineffectively by any average Joe in Sunday League games up and down the country every weekend. But Lallana does a proper Cruyff Turn. One which leaves one or two defenders for dead, thus providing Southampton with an extra man going on the attack. And he does this several times a game. Following the big man? Lallana could move to Anfield after Rickie Lambert completed his deal at the weekend . It isn’t flash, it’s not showing off, it is expertly unlocking opposition sides. His ability to dribble past opposition players, to swerve and shimmy and shift the ball from right to left like it is magnetised to his feet is mesmeric. The goal he scored against Hull last November, when he slalomed past four players, carrying the ball into the box on the left before accurately finding the far right corner from the tightest angle, was one of the goals last season. Liverpool will only hope they can get the negotiations finished before the World Cup starts, when Lallana will have the opportunity to showcase his talents on the biggest stage of all. He is more than ready for the step up.","Lallana is a genius at picking holes in defences .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . They have taken very different routes to get there but Ernests Gulbis and Novak Djokovic will meet in the semi-finals of the French Open. Gulbis followed up his victory over Roger Federer by thumping sixth seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 while Djokovic saw off Milos Raonic 7-5 7-6 (7/5) 6-4. The pair have known each other for more than a decade dating back to their days at Niki Pilic’s academy in Munich. Meeting: Ernests Gulbis will meet Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals of the French Open . Defeat: Gulbis beat sixth seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 . Both had obvious talent but, while this will be Djokovic’s 15th semi-final from the last 16 grand slams, Gulbis will be playing in his first. Had the 25-year-old Latvian followed his friend’s advice, it might have been a very different story. 'He was really professional already at that time,' Gulbis recalled of their time together in Germany. 'I remember we had a friend, a Croatian guy, who was all about the girls at that age already. He was dressing up. He was looking good, putting on perfume, sunglasses, going to talk to the girls. 'I see Novak, he’s going to stretch. And Novak told me that, ‘Yeah, you can have anybody, you can have all the girls in the world. But to be really successful in tennis, you need to (be professional)’. 'I remember it still. That’s a kid who is 15 years old. I didn’t forget. But I didn’t listen.' Memories: Novak Djokovic remembers Gulbis fondly from their time at Niki Pilic's academy in Munich . Djokovic grinned as he remembered Gulbis as a teenager. He said: 'He was always somebody that was very enthusiastic about everything in life and you could see he wanted to enjoy it with open arms, if I can say that (being) politically correct. 'He was always very talented. I remember he came out in the practices swinging fully through the ball. He didn’t really care too much. He respected his coach. He respected the players that he liked. 'The others, he just crushed on the court in practice and the tournaments as well. He always had this confidence about him that you could say that, even though he was 14, 15 at the time, he was going to become something big.' Gulbis made the quarter-finals of the French Open in 2008 as a teenager and was already ranked in the top 100. But until this tournament he had made it past the second round at a grand slam just once since and in 2012 he dropped back out of the top 100. Exit; Djokovic beat Canadian Milos Raonic 7-5 7-6 6-4 . That was the nadir and over the past 18 months he has climbed rapidly, reaching a career-high of 17th in the rankings, which could well become single figures after this tournament. Gulbis’ resurgence has come under Austrian coach Gunter Bresnik, who also looks after 20-year-old rising star Dominic Thiem. Gulbis said of Bresnik: 'He didn’t deal with those kind of problems which my other coaches were dealing with three or four years ago. 'I missed a practice once with Gunter because I had a long night. I called him at 7am, and I said, ""Gun, I cannot come to practice"". He understood it. It was once. 'With other coaches, the first time when Hernan Gumy came to Latvia to prepare for Davis Cup; eight days of preparation, I missed five days of practice. 'And then you evolve, you start to understand, Okay, first, make one step. Don’t miss five days of practice. Just miss three days of practice and then two days and then one and then nothing. It’s a process.' Impressive: No 18 seed Gulbis has already beaten Roger Federer and will be looking for another big scalp . Many players have a let down after a big win such as the Federer one, but Gulbis came out and played even better against Berdych. He said: 'Today everything was good. I felt physically so good. I felt that I can run forever. I felt that he cannot make a winner. If I feel so confident from the baseline, then everything just comes together.' Djokovic had a tougher time against Raonic, who took a set off him in Rome last month, and was delighted to complete the victory in straight sets. 'It’s never smooth against Milos or against any server of his calibre,” he said. “There are few guys that are serving this well. 'When he’s on, it’s very difficult to do anything except be mentally strong and consistent and try to wait for the opportunities. When they are presented, you better use them.'","Gulbis and Djokovic will meet in the semi-finals .

"By . Martyn Ziegler . Technology company Hawkeye is in talks with the International Rugby Board (IRB) about providing a replacement to the controversial television match official (TMO) system ahead of the 2015 World Cup, it can be revealed. Hawkeye, which already operates goal-line systems in football and video technology in Australian rules football, believes it can significantly increase the speed of decision-making. It is also in talks with Premiership Rugby. The discussions come at a key time for the sport after Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths labelled TMO 'a shambles' following the Aviva Premiership final - it took four minutes to award Northampton's winning try and there were also two disallowed tries. Controversy: The existing TMO system was criticised in deciding the Aviva Premiership final . The IRB is conducting a global trial of TMO which comes to an end in August. If Hawkeye can convince the organisation that their system is worth the extra money then it would be in place for the 2015 World Cup in England. Hawkeye, which was acquired by Sony two years ago, believes it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles. Computer tracking will also provide information about whether the ball has crossed the line though it would still be able to video replays to judge whether the ball had been grounded. Paul Hawkins, founder of Hawkeye, confirmed that talks were in progress. He told Press Association Sport: 'Our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents. In Aussie rules, we have halved the average time for decisions to be made. 'We are in conversation with Premiership Rugby and the IRB and they are aware of our products. 'We hope of course they will be there for next season and it would be great if we were there for the World Cup.' You cannot be serious! Hawk-Eye has been successfully used at the Wimbledon tennis championships . The IRB would not confirm or deny whether talks with Hawkeye were on-going. But an IRB spokesperson said: 'As with any global trial, the TMO is under a process of continual evaluation to promote clear, consistent and accurate decision-making while keeping game-time impact minimal.' The big issue is likely to be over cost, especially for Premiership Rugby, as the Hawkeye system would be more expensive that the current TMO system which just uses the existing TV feeds. The league is also adamant that the decisions made via the TMO at the final on Saturday were proved to be correct. Wait for it: The referee consults TMO during the Heineken Cup semi-final between Saracens and Clermont . 'Aviva Premiership Rugby became the first league in the world - at considerable cost - to introduce the Television Match Official into every match, not just those that are televised live,' said a Premiership Rugby spokesman. 'We are therefore committed to doing everything in our power - with other stakeholders, including the IRB and RFU (Rugby Football Union) - to make sure we help the match officials get every decision right. 'We are constantly looking at ways to improve the TMO process to help our match officials and although we have spoken to Hawkeye we have no plans to use it at the moment.","Hawkeye are in talks with the International Rugby Board about replacing the controversial Television Match Official system .

The nine-month-old female was only allowed on the sleeper because it had been registered for travel by it owner as a 'domestic cat'. But when Lyudmila Kosovskaya, 24, let the beast out of its cage she lost control of it. The cub then ran amok in the carriages scaring passengers and staff. A lion cub ran amok in a train travelling through Russia after its owner pretended she was carrying a 'domestic cat' One woman was clawed when she tried to calm it down but only made it more angry. Kosovskaya then managed to shut it in her sleeper car and call for help. When the train supervisor arrived he could hear the animal's growl from behind the door. 'It did not sound like a cat's meow', said one account. Staff alerted the next station at Yekaterinburg, 870 miles east of Moscow, . and police were awaiting the train's arrival with veterinarians and . local circus staff. The long distance train was travelling from Moscow to Novy Urengoy in northern Siberia. It's believed Kosovshaya was en route to the city of Surgut. The nine-month-old cat, worth around £40,000, was being taken from the Russian capital to the city of Surgut by Kosovskaya. The train, travelling from Moscow, was stopped at Yekaterinburg, 870 miles east of Moscow . It is believed she was being transported as a 'model', to use in a promotion at a local mall. Police in Yekaterinburg said the owner 'could not cope with the situation and it was necessary to urgently isolate the animal which was running wild'. A spokesman told the Siberian Times: 'The lion cub had first been kept in a cage but then the woman accompanying it for some reason let the animal out. 'When the animal, which was being transported without a muzzle, started behaving wildly, the woman couldn't control it. She shut it in her sleeper car and asked the train staff for help.' An eyewitnesses said: 'When the coupe was opened, we saw the lioness. She was not aggressive, but rather frightened with what happened. There was a cage, but the lioness was sitting on the bottom bunk.' Yekaterinburg Circus spokeswoman Natalia Kazantseva said: 'Our trainer was on the scene. He helped to take the animal away from the train. 'How could such a big animal be transported in such conditions? Nobody put her to sleep, she was given just a sedative medicine. 'She adamantly refused to leave the coupe. It was obvious that the lioness had been tamed, as she made contact with pleasure and ate meat from the hands.' The owner fled the train and is now being sought by police. It is believed the lion was later put down.","Nine-month-old female registered for travel as a 'domestic cat'

Lewis Hamilton has come under fire from his hometown council following 'derogatory' and 'unfair' comments he made about Stevenage in the build up to last week's Monaco Grand Prix. Speaking ahead of the race, Hamilton, who was raised in the Hertfordshire town, claimed he was hungrier than his rival for the Formula One title Nico Rosberg because of his humble beginnings. The Briton, who finished second in Sunday’s race, said: ‘I come from a not-so-great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad’s apartment – and Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats and all these kinds of things – so the hunger is different.’ Under fire: Lewis Hamilton has been criticised by Stevenage MPs for making comments about the town . Humble beginnings: Hamilton grew up in Stevenage with his dad before forging a career in Formula One . But in response to Hamilton’s comments, Stevenage Councillor Philip Bibby said: ‘I can’t see how he can say such things about the place where he grew up. He needs to remember his roots. ‘The council runs numerous schemes with the aim of providing opportunities for all our young people – from the academic through to the athletic and artistic types. His comments are unfair.’ Howard Burrell, Stevenage’s representative for young people, culture, sport, and leisure, added: ‘I think Stevenage is a great place to grow up and there was no need for Lewis to be so derogatory in his comments. It’s where he came from, after all. ‘I would prefer it if he chose to highlight some of the benefits of coming from our town as he is, without question, the most successful sportsperson we have ever produced. There is no need to say such things about his home town.’ Hamilton trails Rosberg by four points after the German secured victory around the streets of Monte Carlo in this most intense of championship battles.

Best of enemies: Hamilton (left) admitted he and team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) are no longer friends . A seething Hamilton admitted after the race that he is no longer friends with Rosberg, but Mercedes Toto Wolff believes the intensity between his two drivers is to be expected. ‘It’s an intense relationship but this intensity is normal,’ said Wolff. ‘The racing philosophy of Mercedes is to allow our drivers to compete; we let the boys play with their toys unless they break them.

Only the lure of a grandstand farewell performance in the star-spangled fight capital of the world is likely to dissuade the conqueror of Wembley from bowing out after ‘the greatest night of my boxing life'. At coming up 37 and having finished his aggravated business with George Grove in the most conclusive manner possible - with one of the most spectacular knock-out punches in the annals of the prize-ring – he needs an irresistible reason to go back to the well of world championship punishment yet again. Looking ahead: Carl Froch, snapped by our man Graham Chadwick in the aftermath of his stunning victory over George Groves at Wembley, would like to end his glittering career in Las Vegas . Game over: Carl Froch's monster right hand knocked out George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley . Brutal: Groves was poleaxed in the eighth round to leave his world title hopes in tatters on Saturday night . Party time: Froch celebrates his victory over Groves in their rematch as he retained his two world titles . Julio . Cesar Chavez Jnr – colourful namesake son of the Mexican legend – on . that Strip of temptation to the rich tune of pay-per-view in America as . well as Britain could provide the incentive. Or maybe a rematch with Andre Ward, the only super-middleweight in the world Froch has not defeated. ‘How is Eddie Hearn going to pull off anything to top what I’ve just done?’, Froch asked of his Matchroom promoter after he had illuminated an historic Saturday night at Wembley Stadium by exacting retribution against George Groves in a manner which not only sent his young challenger into a coma but stunned a record 80,000 crowd. Froch provided the answer himself: ‘It has always been a dream of mine to fight in Las Vegas. That box remains to be ticked. I will enjoy the summer with my family before I even think about what to do after this incredible night. ‘This could be the perfect way to hang up the gloves. But a signature fight in the MGM Grand Garden...’ The more he thought about it the more appealing that notion became: ‘After all, I feel 36 years young.’ Next up? Froch fancies a crack at Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) in the fight capital of the world, Las Vegas . Another bristling young Englishman, former Olympic gold medallist James DeGale, reinforced his claim as No 1 contender for Froch’s IBF belt with an impressive victory of his own, over American Brandon Gonzalez. But the silencing of another noisy neighbour like Groves is low on Froch’s priorities and Gale expects he will have to wait for his moment. Not least because after two successive mandatory fights against Groves, Froch is now entitled to at least one voluntary defence of his IBF and WBA titles. So while it might be convenient again for Hearn to bring together two of his stable of fighters, he concedes: ‘I have to find something to put before Carl which floats his boat. Otherwise who knows if he will box again?’ Still, even as he took his late-night leave of the fabulous scene of his concussive glory, the Nevada seed was beginning to take root in his warrior mind. Froch recalled how a low-key first trip to Vegas filled him with the ambition to return there as a show-topping champion. Making a scene: Groves had planned his entrance to the final detail as he wowed the Wembley crowd . Pretty in pink: Froch's walk-on was less complicated but the champion still made his presence felt . Taking a trip: Groves entered the cavernous Wembley stadium on a red double decker bus . He travelled  to watch Prince Naseem Hamed take on Marco Antonio Barrera there 13 years ago, taking his partner Rachael with him. ‘Back then we didn’t have much money,’ he said. ‘We couldn’t afford the MGM so we stayed down at Circus-Circus. ‘We’d saved up to go so arrived skint. I knew nothing about gambling but couldn’t resist trying. I threw our last few dollars cash on the craps table and lost. ‘So I thought I  could get it back by putting the biggest bet I could extract from the ATM machine on Naz to win.  Just our luck, he lost his world title. ‘But now I had the dream of going back there with my name up in lights.’ Hearn will try to make that happen, preferably against Chavez. Not because Froch lost to Ward but because, as he puts it: ‘Andre is a great fighter but has such an awkward style  that he can’t draw enough fans to fill his own front room.’ Chavez was quick to respond. ‘I welcome a fight with Froch,’ he said. ‘The fight would be huge; Mexico and England have always had a great rivalry in sports. Also, the fight would give me the opportunity to become the first fighter from Mexico to win the  super-middleweight world title.’ Hearn calculates, also: ‘After this performance against Groves, Carl is where the big money is in the super-middleweight division. So there is an orderly queue forming to fight him, if he decides to go again.’ Third time? Froch could complete his trilogy with Mikkel Kessler with both men having won one fight each . Unification: WBC super-middleweight champion Sakio Bika (right) wants to fight Froch . Other options include a rubber match against his old Danish warrior foe Mikkel Kessler, with whom he stands at one win apiece and who has just decided to make a comeback. WBC champion, tough-nut Sakio Bika, turned up at Wembley carrying his belt and offering a title unifying match. Bika will also be a target for Groves once he has ‘gone back to the drawing board'. Shrewdly, Saint George had taken out insurance against a second loss to Froch by signing in advance a big-money contract with his new German promoters, Sauerland. But exactly where he goes from here depends on how he reacts to being heavily knocked out in the eighth round of a fight which he had trumpeted Froch had ‘no chance of winning’. Froch said: ‘A defeat like this can either finish a boxer’s career or give him the motivation to come back all the stronger.  It depends on his character. There are one or two other belt-holders out there against whom he might win a world title. ‘But to be honest he lacks the essential element of real hardness to trouble the elite. I doubt he can ever beat Ward. And deep down he knows now I would beat him ten times out of ten.’ Options: James DeGale is now the mandatory challenger for Froch's IBF super-middleweight title .

Many of the players were in tears at the final whistle as a second successive loss left them up against it to make the semi-finals already. Despite dominating, enjoying nearly two-thirds possession in their opponents' half and more than twice the number of circle penetrations, England paid the price for a lack of sharpness in front of goal. Setback: Laura Unsworth walks off after England suffered a 3-0 World Cup defeat to China in Pool B . The closest they came was when Lily Owsley's narrow-angle shot hit both posts in the first half and a failure to convert seven penalty corners contributed to their shortcomings as, after a goalless first half, China twice scored against the run of play through Yang Peng and Melyu Lang. Having lost their opener to the United States, coach Jason Lee threw caution to the wind and pulled goalkeeper Maddie Hinch for the final six minutes to add an extra outfield player but a loss of possession in side their own half allowed Peng to score her second with an angled reverse-stick shot. England effectively have to win their remaining three matches - two of which are against title holders Argentina and European champions Germany - if they are to stand a chance of finishing in the top two in Group B and progressing to the semis.

It caused yellow flags to be waved, preventing Hamilton from finishing his final lap and leaving Rosberg in pole position. Rosberg went on to win the race, with Hamilton insinuating afterwards that data he saw showed his Mercedes team-mate had acted deliberately. Not happy: Lewis Hamilton (left) was unimpressed by the behaviour of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) during qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix . Leading the way: Rosberg (right) pulls away from Hamilton (left) in Monte Carlo on Sunday . But Warwick, who is president of the British Racing Drivers’ Club, Silverstone’s owners, and a veteran of 146 Formula One races, said: ‘I understand that Lewis was upset. Possibly he would have gone faster than Nico on that lap. Arguably the incident cost him the Grand Prix. ‘I don’t want to give him advice really — he has won umpteen races and a world championship — but if I were to say anything it would be to man up and concentrate on the next race in Canada.’ Speaking about the stewards’ decision for the first time, Warwick told Sportsmail: ‘You could argue that as president of the BRDC I would have a reason to come to a decision that would have favoured the British driver, but obviously that is not how I would approach it. I am there to be independent. ‘It is a big decision to make when you are deciding to move a driver to the back of the grid. It was doubly important to get it right because it could affect many things — probably the outcome of the race and possibly of the world championship. ‘We had all Mercedes’s data, including Lewis’s data to overlay on Nico’s. We had the FIA data. We had onboard shots, overhead shots, circuit shots. We had throttle traces, braking traces, everything we needed to make, hopefully, the right decision. Time to move on: Hamilton has been urged to concentrate on this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix by steward Derek Warwick . No regrets: Rosberg was cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA's team of stewards . ‘It was not black and white. It took a long time. We wanted to be sure and thorough. ‘The driver is a massive component in what we end up deciding. So Nico was in the stewards’ room for a long time with the team manager (Ron Meadows). I wouldn’t say I interrogated him; I interviewed him. I made sure I asked him all the right questions. ‘I have been around a long time and seen people try to pull the wool over my eyes. Did I I have doubts in my mind, of course I did. But he gave me the answers I needed. ‘I know there are conspiracy  theories but you will not find a more honest driver in grand prix racing than Nico. He said himself that he made a mistake, came in too fast, braked too late and locked up his rear tyres.’ The FIA brought in former drivers as stewards — of whom Warwick is one of the most respected for his sense of fairness — to help the panel make informed decisions. There was unanimity among the four stewards in this case.

"By . Bianca London . From hot flushes to hormone-induced breakouts, the menopause can play havoc on your skin as well as your temper. But although there's an abundance of advice on what food to eat and which herbal remedies to take, little attention has been paid to looking good - until now. Celebrity make-up artist Lisa Eldridge, who has worked with Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet among others, has come to the rescue with a beauty tutorial that reveals how to hide those hot flushes - and look in tip-top shape at the same time. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Lisa Eldridge, a celebrity make-up artist who has worked with Cara Delevingne, has treated her friend suffering from the menopause to a makeover and shared her top tips for combating the signs . 'While chatting with a friend who’s been having menopausal make-up issues, I realised there isn’t a lot of discussion or advice around this subject,' explains Eldridge. 'This film hopefully breaks that taboo with some useful tips, warm friendly advice and a good sprinkling of humour.' The perfect menopausal make-up look begins with a good base, in Eldridge's case, Embryolisse Lait Creme Concentre and Laura Mercier Foundation Primer. Next comes a layer of BB cream - Eldridge likes Estée Lauder Double Wear All Day Glow BB Moisture Make-up - which, Eldridge says, will give mature skin plenty of nourishment while staying in place all day. 'If you happen to have a hot flush, this really will stay on,' adds Eldridge. 'Although it has a setting feeling, you can feel it's long-lasting and it leaves a dewy finish.' Tips and tricks: Lisa says that the right coverage is important for ladies who get hot flushes and perspire a lot, she recommends a BB cream and concealer stick for on the go . For those dealing with greasy skin, Eldridge has this advice: 'If you're having a greasy reaction to the menopause and your skin is oily because your hormones are going out of whack, then something like Estée Lauder's Double Wear Light is good because it will cover rosacea and blemishes.' Harder to tackle are hot flushes and perspiration, both of which can prove deadly for foundation's staying power. To beat the sweats, she suggests skipping the BB cream and instead opting for . Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation Skin, dabbed on in certain areas so that, if . your make-up does sweat off, you'll only have a few areas to . touch up. Next up is concealer, which for Eldridge, means Dior's Hydra Life BB Eye Creme, explaining: 'This is really moisturising so it's fantastic if you're experiencing very dry skin,' she reveals. 'It really lifts shadows without emphasising any fine lines and has some really nice brightening pigments in there. 'Add more to the inner corners of your eyes if you're not sleeping well,' she suggests. 'Also note that pink hued concealers help to counteract blueness and beware that too much highlighter is ageing.' Lift the face with a dab of blusher, and make it one that contains anti-ageing ingredients such as By Terry's Hyaluronic Blush. That's a good trick! For lips, she uses a Chanel lipliner and dabs some of the eyeshadow primer above the lips to avoid any smudging or lipstick bleeding . 'If you're experiencing the redness that comes with the menopause, skip this step,' advises Eldridge. 'But if you have even-toned skin then a little bit of colour in the face is really beautiful.' For eyes, Eldridge smooths Urban Decay Anti-Ageing primer all over the lids, which she says is brilliant if you're having a hard time getting shadow to stay put. Beauty guru: Lisa's handiwork can be seen regularly on runways, red carpets and glossy covers, with a client list that reads like a who's who of Hollywood's most glamorous . She also recommends using waterproof eye make-up, citing Lancôme Kohl Hypnose Waterproof eyeliner as her favourite. 'Smudge it on,' she recommends. 'The messier you put [it on], the better but make sure you get to the roots of the lashes and massage the pencil in there'. If your lashes are falling out, she says a coat of Urban Decay Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara on the top lashes can help. She also loves Stila eyebrow pencils, which, she says, just won't budge, even if you're wiping your face all day due to perspiration. On the lips, Eldridge uses a Chanel lipliner and dabs some eyeshadow primer above the lips to avoid any smudging or lipstick bleeding. Finish off the look with a slick of Rimmel Moisture Renew Lipstick, which, Eldridge says, helps lips look plumper. 'If you want to amp this make-up up, it's better to amp up the eyes,' she says of making the look work for evening. 'The eyes are easier to maintain than skin.' 1. Invest in a really good magnifying mirror. No less than 10x -15x . magnification. You can buy ones that attach easily to your bathroom . mirror and smaller travel ones for your handbag. 2. If you are experiencing a lot of hot . flushes, apply as little base make-up as you feel comfortable . with. That way there will be less touching up and patching to do. Carry a . stick foundation or compact concealer with you for selective touch ups. 3. If you are perspiring a lot, avoid too much powder as water and powder do not mix well. 4. If you are experiencing dry eyes, apply moisturising eye drops at least 10 minutes before starting your make-up. 5. Waterproof eye make-up products are . technically light years ahead of where they were even a couple of years . ago. It’s worth investing in the most up to date formulations for . mascara and eye liner. 6. Keep a cold, clean chamois leather in . the fridge to cool your face down. You can also keep a small version of . something like this in your bag to absorb sweat without disturbing your . make-up.","Make-up artist Lisa Eldridge is a favourite with Kate Winslet among others .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Victim: Stephanie Atha, 23, suffered horrendous facial injuries when she was punched and kicked for several minutes by two men who tried to steal her iPhone . A nursing assistant suffered horrendous facial injuries after she was punched and kicked for several minutes by two men who tried to steal her iPhone. Stephanie Atha, 23, was walking home . alone from her hospital job when she was approached by two men who went to snatch her mobile . before punching her in the face. Police were today hunting the attempted robbery suspects who struck as the nursing assistant took a cut through route to her home in Guisborough, North Yorkshire. 'One went to grab my phone in my hand and I thought he was joking at first,' said Miss Atha. She said that the two men had tried to grab the phone and when she moved it out of reach one of them hit her in the face, knocking her to the ground. 'It was on a slope and muddy and I . slipped somehow and landed on the floor,' said Miss Atha, who works at . West Lane Hospital in Middlesbrough. As she lay on the ground the men continued to try to take the phone, kicking her and punching her as they hurled abuse at Miss Atha and called her offensive names in the attack . that lasted several minutes. Miss Atha had finished her evening shift at the hospital and had caught the bus to Guisborough from Middlesbrough, arriving back shortly before 11pm on Saturday, May 24 when she commenced her walk home. 'I’ve walked that same route hundreds of times,' said Miss Atha, who still has painful bruising to her ribs, legs and face. 'It’s badly lit but it never bothered me walking anywhere. 'I didn’t expect it to happen, it’s only five or ten minutes from home.' Miss Atha, who lives with her mother and sister Aimee, 22, says she owes her work training for helping her to get away from her attackers. 'With my job in children’s mental health you learn restraints and how to defend yourself,' she said. 'So I curled up in a ball. Injuries: Miss Atha suffered serious facial injuries in the attack, after the two men stuck as she walked home from her hospital job . 'I managed to defend myself. I managed to shove one of them. I did fight back. I’m glad I got out of it. I ran all the way home.' Miss Atha's mother Angela, who is terminally ill, said: 'It was awful. I was in the hospice when it happened and I got a phone call off her sobbing down the phone. 'I felt so helpless. I managed to calm her down and I told her to phone the police as soon as she got off the phone to me.' Miss Atha said police arrived within 15 minutes, and that her sister had dashed home to look after her. Target: Miss Atha said two men had tried to grab her iPhone and when she moved it out of reach one of them hit her in the face, knocking her to the ground . She says she is terrified to leave the house and has only ventured out to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough with her boyfriend, Callum Terry, 18, and to see her GP. 'I just feel very anxious when I’m out of the house and that’s not me at all,' she said. 'I hope I can get justice and I hope the police find them and they get jailed and realise how far they’ve taken it.' Miss Atha, who is on sick leave while she recovers from her ordeal at home, added she wouldn’t be walking the same route again. Police said the first suspect was white, around 5ft 3ins, in his early 20s, of slim build and had short dark hair with stubble. He was wearing a dark tracksuit top and trousers. The second man was also wearing a dark tracksuit top and trousers.

Of course, these transport options aren’t real, but you can now virtually see how long these journeys would take on Google Maps. These Google Easter Eggs were added to celebrate the launch of public transport routes on the service across the UK.

Other hidden journey options include punting between the colleges of Cambridge and Oxford University, as well as riding a Royal carriage between Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. According to the tongue-in-cheek directions, travelling from the Brecon Beacons to Snowdon in Wales takes 21 minutes by dragon - the country’s national symbol. Meanwhile, riding the mythical Nessie between Fort Augustus and Urquhart Castle, which sit on Loch Ness in Inverness, Scotland, takes 28 minutes - four minutes faster than taking the bus. On the other hand, punting between Magdalene College and Mathematical Bridge in Cambridge is a much slower mode of transport and takes45 minutes, versus 18 minutes on the UNI4 bus. This is still quicker than punting between the colleges of Oxford, however.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . An artist has fashioned an elaborate wedding gown using nothing but 11 rolls of toilet paper, 100 ft of tape and a hefty quantity of glue. Olivia Mears, an art student based in Asheville, North Carolina, built her creation for the annual Cheap Chic Toilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest, sponsored, naturally, by Charmin. 'I learned about the contest with only a few weeks to prepare the dress', she tells MailOnline, estimating that she probably spent around 20 hours working on it. Elaborate: Artist Olivia Mears (pictured in her design) created this wedding gown using only 11 rolls of Charmin toilet paper, 100 ft of tape, and some glue . Ms Mears, who says she creates a lot of Victorian and fantasy inspired pieces as part of her artworks, wanted to incorporate the same magical theme into the dress. 'Based on Victorian ball gowns I decided on a tiered train, embroidered corset style bodice, and the layers of roses and ruffles', she explains. 'But to make it more contemporary I dropped the sleeves, let the bottom drape down naturally, and opened the front of the dress. Ruffles: Ms Mears entered the dress into last year's annual Cheap Chic Toilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest, sponsored by Charmin, and says it took around 20 hours of work to create . Intricate: It looks incredibly ornate, but this gold trimming is just tape, and the amount of toilet paper used amounts to less than six dollars worth . The resulting gown is certainly a spectacle to behold; an eruption of frothy frills, built around a sturdy bodice and finished with intricate weavings of gold tape. Fragile as it may appear, Ms Mears says that the inside of the dress was reinforced with packaging tape, so it wasn't too much at risk of ripping, although it did require 'a lot of wiggling' to get into it for the photographs. Her sharp-clawed feline friend, on the other hand, posed obvious risks. 'I sacrificed a roll of toilet paper to my cat before starting on the dress, and he took another while I wasn't looking. He was occupied with that for a while', she says. Hazard: This looks like a dress-shredding disaster waiting to happen, but Ms Mears cunningly supplied her cat with a decoy roll of toilet paper to keep his claws otherwise occupied (pictured) Detail: Ms Mears hopes one day to be a professional costume designer in Los Angeles, but for now she refers to her unusual work as simply a 'hobby' The dress didn't win last year's Charmin contest but it came 15th out of more than 1,400 entries, and Ms Mears plans to re-enter this year, with a lot more preparation time to play with. Currently, she is a student at Western Carolina University for Art Education and considers fashion and design as more of a 'hobby' for now. 'At the moment, I'm just enjoying teaching art to young students and inspiring them to create their own unique pieces after seeing what I do', she states. Still, she dreams of one day going to Los Angeles to become a costume designer, and making a career out of her nifty skills. One she'd be do very well in, if her unique take on a Chic Cheap wedding dress is anything to go by.","Olivia Mears used only 11 rolls of Charmin toilet paper, 100 ft of tape and some glue ."
"By . Amanda Williams . A boy who was born with his skull fused together has had an operation to break his head apart and then pieced back together - just like a jigsaw. While most babies are born with gaps in the skull which allow the brain to grow - Archie Outlaw, four, from Haverhill, Suffolk, was born with Craniosynostosis, which fuses the skull together before birth. The little boy underwent a gruelling five hour life-threatening operation - which could have also caused brain damage - to reshape his skull and piece it back together. Archie Outlaw, who was born with his skull fused together, has had a pioneering operation to break his head apart and then pieced back together - just like a jigsaw . Mother Kelly, 32, said: 'When me and my husband, Stephen, realised that Archie would need such a serious operation we were petrified. 'But with his skull fused together, his brain wouldn't have been able to grow and he was already experiencing some problems with his hearing and speech, it could have also have affected his mobility and eye-sight. 'He has a big zig-zag scar across his scalp, but that's now covered in hair. He's such a little fighter. 'People would often stare and point at his head when we were out in public which was really hurtful. 'I started dressing him in hats, in a bid to hide the shape of his head. 'Looking back I wish I hadn't, I'm proud of my brave boy and his rare condition.' Ms Outlaw said that it was not until her son was five months old that she realised there was something 'not quite right'. She said: 'I was a first time mum, I had no idea what was ""normal."" Archie, 4, from Haverhill, Suffolk, was born with Craniosynostosis - a condition which fuses the skull together before birth . The little boy underwent a gruelling five hour life-threatening operation - which could have also caused brain damage - to reshape his skull and piece it back together . Ms Outlaw said that it was not until her son was five months old that she realised there was something 'not quite right' 'I was just told he had a 'flat head' but with some time on his tummy it should change back so I trusted the experts. 'Archie had been suffering from a few breathing difficulties too and it wasn't until a hospital admission when he was seven months old that we found out what was actually wrong with him. 'A doctor there asked us what type of Craniosynostosis Archie had. We didn't have a clue what she was talking about. 'We were then referred to Great Ormond hospital in London when Archie was a year old and he was given a CT scan as well as hearing, eye sight and development tests when we finally got the answers we'd been desperately searching for.' Archie was also diagnosed with Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia which only affects approximately 35 people worldwide. The genetic syndrome causes abnormalities in skeleton development as well kidneys and bladder heart defects and problems with breathing. Archie in hospital with his father Stephen.

Archie was also diagnosed with Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia which only affects approximately 35 people worldwide . Archie had to wait until he was three-and-a-half before he underwent the operation at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to correct his skull. Kelly added: 'Some doctors view Craniosynostosis as cosmetic because some children don't need to operation but in reality it can be fatal. 'Archie finally had the surgery when doctors realised his breathing was worsening, they had to do surgery to stabilise his airway with a tracheostomy then he had his cranio surgery. 'He is finally discovering what a four year old is all about. 'Archie is constantly smiling and such a happy sweet caring boy. Archie had to wait until he was three-and-a-half before he underwent the operation at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to correct his skull . The family said Archie has made a remarkable recovery from his operation and his hair has since grown over his zig-zag scars . 'Since Archie's skull surgery and windpipe surgery life has become physical easier for us and are now spending more time together as a family. There is a risk that Archie's skull may re fuse again. If this was to happen it would mean more surgery. Gill Ruff, the group administrator for Headlines, the craniofacial support group said: 'Normally when a child is born the skull is made of individual plates. If the plates have prematurely fused, the brain will grow but may make the skull shape different. 'The child could have brain damage or pressure on the brain if left untreated.' After the end of the year old single suture children will not normally face anymore surgery. If the child has a syndrome they will receive treatment at various times up to their teenage years.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It may not be the most fashion-forward footwear you've seen, but these bizarre sandals could help save an astronaut body from deteriorating. Developed by Nasa, a pair was today sent to the International Space Station in the hope of better understanding of how heavy loads can damage an astronauts' bones. The ForceShoe sandals act as a high tech measurement system working in tandem with the ISS’s Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (Ared). Scroll down for video . Dubbed the ForceShoe, the sandals act as a high tech measurement system and working in tandem with the ISS’s Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (Ared). Developed by Nasa, a pair was today sent to the International Space Station in the hope of gaining a better understanding of how heavy loads damage an astronauts' bones . Andrea Hanson, an ISS exercise hardware specialist, demonstrates the use of the ForceShoe on the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device . Ared helps the astronauts perform weight-bearing exercise to maintain bone and muscle mass while in microgravity. ‘Ared is a sophisticated exercise device,’ said Andrea Hanson, ISS exercise hardware specialist. ‘Although it has helped Nasa provide better health outcomes for crew members, there is still progress to be made in understanding the effects of exercise on bone and muscle health, and the ForceShoe will help us do that.’ Using the ForceShoe, researchers will measure exercise loads and ground reaction forces on an astronaut. These are the forces supplied by the ground to a body in contact with it. The device measures force in three axes: up and down, side-to-side and front-to-back. It also captures the torque, or twisting force, applied under foot during an Ared exercise. ‘We are eager to understand how joint forces may be different between exercise performed on the ground and in space, and force shoe technology might help us do this in future investigations,’ said Mr Hanson. Improving researchers’ understanding of exercise performance in microgravity will help create better space workouts that improve bone and muscle strength. Researchers will ask two to four crew members to collect static load and dynamic exercise data while wearing the shoes, which look like high-tech sandals. During the static load test, crew members will be asked to set the Ared to provide specific loads in the same way they would set loads on a weightlifting machine at the gym. The effects of zero gravity on our muscles, bones and joints have been extensively studied. But while living in space is known to weaken our immune system, no one is sure how our cells are affected in the long-term by prolonged exposure to a weightless environment. Now a new ISS experiment will seek to answer that very question, and it could provide us with important information on the risk of spaceflight to astronauts. Known as the Cellbox Mission, the experiment was carried to the International Space Station (ISS) by SpaceX’s Dragon capsule.The experiment contains a cargo of immune cells. In zero gravity, various immune system functions are known to be impaired. In particular phagocytes, cells that protect our body from harmful foreign bodies, are unable to work properly. A research team is currently studying the structure and metabolism of these phagocytes while they are on the ISS. They will then lift the exercise bar and stand still on Ared while the shoes collect data. They will also perform dynamic exercises included squats, deadlifts and bicep curls. As crew members perform these exercises, the ForceShoe, which acts like an enhanced bathroom scale that measures loads applied downward as well as during front-to-back and side-to-side movements. Data will be transmitted via Bluetooth technology to computers on the space station and researchers on Earth will receive this data a couple of days later. ‘As we prepare for future missions to asteroids, Mars and beyond, we need to think about minimising and miniaturising equipment because spacecraft will be smaller,’ said Mr Hanson. ‘The ForceShoe is a great example of the way we can shrink some of our research tools for future missions.’ Lessons learned from exercise performed during long duration missions in microgravity can also be directly applied to populations here on Earth. For instance, the results could be used to help people who have restricted movement due to injury, ageing, busy lifestyles, or confined work and living spaces. During the static load test, crew members will be asked to set the Ared to provide specific loads in the same way they would set loads on a weightlifting machine at the gym.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Dogs have been man’s best friend for thousands of years and now new research has hinted that they helped early modern man hunt woolly mammoths. Domestication of dogs could explain mammoth kill sites and why cavemen thrived in a hostile environment full of threats, according to a new study. The sudden appearance of dwellings built from mammoth bones could be due to humans hunting alongside the earliest domesticated dogs, scientists explained. Man's best friend: Domestication of dogs could explain mammoth kill sites and why cavemen thrived in a hostile environment full of threats. A piece of large bone - probably from a mammoth - was placed in this dog's mouth shortly after death. This finding suggests the animal was according special mortuary treatment, perhaps acknowledging its role in mammoth hunting, Professor Shipman said . Speaking at the Natural History Museum's opening of its latest prehistoric exhibition, Professor Adrian Lister, a mammoth researcher, explained that humans and mammoths shared Earth for around half a million years. The very last mammoths died out on remote islands around 4,000 years ago, although the species disappeared from the mainland at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago. ‘Humans used their skins, fur and bones for huts and ivory for carving,’ he said. Some 15,000 years ago, the climate began to gradually warm up and the forest spread out replacing grassland. The mammoths lost their natural habitat and experts think that global warming played a big part in their extinction. ‘Right at the end, when the mammoth was effectively endangered, people were hunting the animals and dealt the final blow,’ Professor Lister said. If they were using a more effective hunting technique by using domesticated dogs, it is possible that this sped up the species’ extinction. Professor Lister said that modern elephants are facing the same threats today. Pat Shipman of Penn State University has taken a fresh look at European archaeological sites containing large numbers of dead mammoths and dwellings built with mammoth bones. Her research comes at a time when many archaeologists agree that the vast animals became extinct because of a combination of climate change and hunting by humans. Archaeological sites, some of which contain hundreds of dead mammoths have been discovered. It became relatively common between 45,000 and 15,000 years ago to build settlements primarily composed of bones and some of them revealed huts built of mammoth bones in complex, geometric patterns as well as piles of butchered mammoth bones, Professor Shipman explained. ‘One of the greatest puzzles about these sites is how such large numbers of mammoths could have been killed with the weapons available during that time.' Earlier studies have concluded that the age distribution of the mammoths at these sites are similar to modern elephants killed by hunting or natural disasters. But Professor Shipman found that ‘few of the mortality patterns from these mammoth deaths matched either those from natural deaths among modern elephants killed by droughts or by culling operations with modern weapons that kill entire family herds of modern elephants at once.’ The expert believes that a successful new technique off using dogs to help kill large animals such as the woolly mammoth (illustrated) was developed and its repeated use over time could explain the mysterious, massive collections of mammoth bones in Europe that were used in settlements . She believes that a successful new technique for killing such large animals had been developed and its repeated use over time could explain the mysterious, massive collections of mammoth bones in Europe. In a study published in the journal Quaternary International, she said that early modern humans worked with the earliest domestic dogs to kill the mammoth. Her claim is based upon recent work by Mietje Germonpré of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, who uncovered evidence that some of the large carnivores at these sites were early domesticated dogs, not wolves as generally had been assumed. Professor Shipman used information about how humans hunt with dogs to formulate a series of testable predictions about these mammoth sites. ‘Dogs help hunters find prey faster and more often and dogs also can surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters move in. Both of these effects would increase hunting success,’ she said. ‘Large dogs like those identified by Germonpré either can help carry the prey home or, by guarding the carcass from other carnivores, can make it possible for the hunters to camp at the kill sites.’ Another unusual feature of these large mammoth kill sites is the presence of extraordinary numbers of other predators, particularly wolves and foxes. The archaeologist believes that dogs helped hunters find prey faster and more often and could surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters moved in. 'Both of these effects would increase hunting success,' she said. This etching from 1896 shows ancient man using bows and arrows to bring down a mammoth and it is not hard to image that large fierce dogs would have made the exercise easier . ‘Both dogs and wolves are very alert to the presence of other related carnivores - the canids - and they defend their territories and food fiercely,’ Shipman explained. ‘If humans were working and living with domesticated dogs or even semi-domesticated wolves at these archaeological sites, we would expect to find the new focus on killing the wild wolves that we see there.’ A previous study by the University of Tubingen in Germany used isotopic analysis of dogs from the Czech site of Predmostí to show that the animals had different diets to wolves at the site, possibly indicating that humans fed the dogs. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA by the University of Turku in Finland showed that the individuals identified as dogs have a distinctive genetic signature that is not known from any other canid. ‘Since mitochondrial DNA is carried only by females, this finding may indicate that these odd canids did not give rise to modern domesticated dogs and were simply a peculiar, extinct group of wolves,’ Professor Shipman said. ‘Alternatively, it may indicate that early humans did domesticate wolves into dogs or a doglike group, but the female canids interbred with wild wolf males and so the distinctive female mitochondrial DNA lineage was lost.’","Mammoths died out on the mainland 10,000 years ago because of climate change and hunting by humans - perhaps with a deadly new technique .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You might think that a firm handshake, sparkling CV and a can-do attitude are the key ingredients to getting the job of your dreams. But a new study has found having a deep voice could be a barrier for women. Recruiters view women with husky voices as less educated and competent, which means they are less likely to be hired. While females applying for jobs could be highly accomplished, recruiters view those with husky voices as less educated and competent, among other undesirable traits, according to a new study . Researchers at the University of Miami looked at women with 'croaky' voices and how they were perceived, for their study which was published in the journal Plos One. Previous research has suggested that a low vocal range, known as ‘vocal fry’ indicates education and power, but the new research found that recruiters view the women as less attractive, competent, educated and trustworthy. ‘Our results show that the vocal fry fad is a hindrance to young women who are trying to find work,’ said Casey Klofstad from the university. It was reported that in 2011 young women were speaking in a croaky, rough and guttural way to emulate the speech patterns of certain celebrities like Britney Spears. ‘Lack of experience due to their younger age, a historically poor economic environment and sex discrimination are all barriers to labour market success for this demographic. ‘Given this context, our findings suggest that young women would be best advised to avoid using vocal fry when trying to secure employment.’ Scarlett Johansson (pictured) may never be out of work, but scinetists found that people with husky voices like her were only hired 30 per cent of the time compared to normal sounding voices . The researchers recorded seven women between the ages of 19 and 27 and seven men aged 20 to 30 talking in their normal voice and then talking with a deliberately croaky voice. They were asked to say the phrase: ‘Thank you for considering me for this opportunity’. Then 800 people were asked to pose as recruiters and listen to each recording. They had to choose whether the ‘normal’ voice was from a more educated, competent, trustworthy or attractive person. They were also asked which people they would hire based on their voices. It was revealed that people with croaky voices were only hired 20 per cent of the time compared to the normal sounding voices. The recruiters also assumed that people speaking in croaky voices were less likely to be educated, competent, trustworthy or attractive. Researchers discovered that women were more likely to be perceived negatively if they had croaky voices than men. ‘Humans prefer vocal characteristics that are typical of population norms,’ said Professor Klofstad. ‘While strange sounding voices might be more memorable because they are novel, humans find “average” sounding voices to be more attractive. ‘It is possible that speakers of vocal fry are generally perceived less favourably because vocal fry is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in voice pitch relative to normal speech. ‘Previous studies show that when women try to lower the pitch of their voice they are perceived as less attractive,’ he added. ‘You could view the results we found as an extension of this to an economic context, whereby deliberate lowering of voice pitch in a sex-atypical manner by women through vocal fry results in negative perceptions by potential employers.’","Researchers at the University of Miami found that recruiters view women with husky voices as less educated and competent .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple has confirmed it is buying Beats Electronics, the headphone and music streaming service set up by rapper Dr. Dre and recording impresario Jimmy Iovine. The $3bn acquisition by far the most expensive in Apple's 38-year history, and comes three weeks after the deal was first rumoured - although the initial price was believed to be $3.2bn. Apple Boss Tim Cook revealed the deal, saying 'We have known these guys forever, we've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married.' Scroll down for video . Beats by Apple, from left to right, music entrepreneur and Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Beats co-founder Dr. Dre, and Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue pose together at Apple headquarters in Cupertino as Cook revealed Apple's $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics . Beats was founded in 2008 by Dr. Dre, now a hip-hop producer, and Iovine, a longtime recording industry executive who is currently chairman of Universal Music Group's Interscope Geffen A&M Records. It now dominates the luxury headphone market. Its equipment also has been a big seller in Apple's stores. Operating from its Culver City, California, headquarters, Beats commands 62 percent of the $1 billion U.S. market for headphones priced above $100, according to NPD Group. The gear, which emphasizes bass, also has been endorsed by several star athletes, including San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and New Jersey Nets forward Kevin Garnett. Beats Music, the music streaming subsidiary of the electronics maker, has more than 250,000 subscribers, according to Cook. 'I’ve always known in my heart that Beats belonged with Apple,' said Jimmy Iovine. As part of the acquisition, Beats co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will join Apple. 'The idea when we started the company was inspired by Apple’s unmatched ability to marry culture and technology. Apple’s deep commitment to music fans, artists, songwriters and the music industry is something special.' The price consists of $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in Apple stock that will vest over an unspecified time period. The deal is expected to close before the end of September. It is believed Apple is also interested in Beats expertise in developing wearable products and it edges closer to a much anticipated iWatch launch, . With $1.1 billion in revenue last year, Beats is already making money and will boost Apple's earnings once the new fiscal year begins in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview. 'This relationship started a decade ago, so we know there is an incredible cultural fit. 'These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare.' Iovine, 61, and Dre, 49, will both become key executives in Apple's music divisions, though Cook said their roles haven't been determined yet. Cook said Beats' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal. Beats headphones are sold along side iPods in an Apple store -Apple plans to roll them out across the world . The growing popularity of music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify has been reducing sales of songs and albums, a business that iTunes has dominated for the past decade. U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Although Apple broke into streaming with the launch of iTunes Radio last September, the service has not been as popular or as lucrative as the company expected, according to two people familiar with the matter. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Apple is counting on the Beats acquisition to boost its cachet with teenagers and younger adults while trying to remain a leader in digital music — an industry that looks much different than when Apple reshaped the scene with the 2001 debut of the iPod. Dr. Dre, who founded Beats electronics with record producer music producer Jimmy Iovine. The firm could now be sold to Apple. The purchase marks Apple CEO Tim Cook's biggest strategic break from the way the Cupertino, California, company was led under co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011. Jobs favored smaller acquisitions and didn't believe subscription music plans would be popular. Before Beats, Apple's biggest acquisition had been its $400 million purchase of NeXt Computer, a company that Jobs founded after being ousted from Apple in the 1980s. Cook said he never considered what Jobs would have thought about the Beats' acquisition. Jobs 'told me to do what was right,' Cook said. 'And I am 100 percent certain this is what is right. 'This is one of those things that we will look back upon and say it was meant to be.' Sony Music CEO Doug Morris, who considers Iovine to be his best friend, believes Cook is making a smart move that will give Apple even more credibility in the music industry. 'It's a game changer because Jimmy is that kind of guy who can change a game,' Morris said. 'I am not saying he is Steve Jobs, but he is a guy with new ideas and he really knows how to build the bridge between music and technology.' But some analysts question whether Beats will be a good fit for Apple, which makes most of its money selling hardware such as iPhones and iPads. Beats has also partnered with a host of celebrities, including Lady Gaga, to create endorsed  earphones. Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett says Apple would have been better off developing its own headphones in-house and expanding into music subscriptions through iTunes. 'It's hard to understand why Apple would have to spend $3 billion on a nascent streaming service and a line of bass-heavy headphones,' Gillett says. Yukari Iwatani Kane, the author of 'Haunted Empire,' an inside look at Apple since co-founder Jobs' death, also sees a disconnect. 'Culturally, Beats is the complete opposite of Apple,' Kane says. 'It's known for being loud and bold and in your face. It doesn't fit with Apple's understated, discerning brand.' The Beats deal also aligns Apple with the push toward higher-quality music, reversing a decline in fidelity as people abandoned vinyl records for CDs and then switched from CDs to MP3s. The Beats move follows a string of high-priced deals in Silicon Valley, after Google acquired smart home developer Nest Labs for $3.2bn and Facebook offered an initial $19bn for WhatsApp Messenger, and then bought VR firm Oculus for $2bn. Apple executives Tim Cook and Eddy Cue have previously met with Iovine to discuss streaming music services and Apple and Beats have partnered up to sell Beats earphone products in Apple Retail stores.","Gives Apple access to Beats streaming music service and allows it take on Spotify .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . On Christmas Eve in 1968 Nasa provoked outrage among atheists when the Apollo 8 astronauts read from the Book of Genesis as they orbited the moon. So if any people of a similar disposition are reading, look away now - a team based in Israel are planning to send the Torah to the moon. The sacred Jewish scroll would be sent along with other iconic Earth artefacts as part of the Google Lunar XPrize, a competition amongst private companies to send vehicles to the moon, with the goal of maintaining Earth’s culture in the event of an apocalypse. An Israeli-based team is hoping to send a handwritten version of the Torah (stock image shown) to the surface of the moon. Their goal is to hitch a ride with a mission currently competing in the Google Lunar XPrize, which should see private companies landing on the moon starting at the end of 2015 . The project is known as Torah on the Moon and is based in Tel Aviv. The . Google Lunar XPrize, the largest international incentive based prize of . all time, is tasking private organisations with . safely landing on the surface of the moon. 'More . than half of the world’s population has never had the opportunity to . view a live transmission from the lunar surface,' say the organisers. The . Google Lunar XPRIZE aims to create a new 'Apollo' moment for this . generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $40 Million in . incentive based prizes. In . order to win this money, a private company must land safely on the . surface of the moon, travel 500 meters above, below, or on the Lunar . surface, and send back two 'Mooncasts' to Earth . The team are hoping to send a handwritten Jewish scroll, the Sefer Torah, to the lunar surface reports New Scientist, and later the Vedas (Hindu scriptures) and the I-Ching (an ancient Chinese philosophical work). They would each be transported in capsules that would enable them to survive on the moon for more than 10,000 years. ‘This is an incredible, beautiful project,’ said group founder Paul Aouizerate. ‘These three texts are among Earth’s most ancient documents, created over 3,000 years ago. ‘They are significant to billions of people.’ To fund the mission Aouizerate and his team are hoping to raise up to £12.1m ($20.5m) by having scribes write each of the 304,805 characters contained in the Torah. These writers would be funded by believers. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure a significant part of Earth’s culture would remain on the moon far into the future. Thus, if Earth were to suffer an apocalypse-type event, be it a nuclear war or an asteroid impact, part of humanity’s legacy would live on. The endeavour has been considered before on varying scales, with other agencies and organisations saying humanity should create ‘time capsules’ that will preserve Earth’s cultures and societies. In fact Nasa’s two Voyager spacecraft, currently on their way into interstellar space, each contain something called the Golden Record. This vinyl is a collection of various snippets of Earth life and culture, from the sounds of nature to images of humans. It is intended, if it is ever found, to be a lasting legacy of humanity’s place in the universe. The Torah on the Moon project had previously hoped to ride to the moon with a lander designed by Tel Aviv University Laboratory called SpaceIL (artist's illustration shown), but the partnership has since been cancelled. This vehicle is designed to 'hop' across the lunar surface using rockets . The prospect of creating a 'time capsule' of Earth life has been considered before, in order to preserve humanity's legacy in the event of a global catastrophe. Pictured is an 'Earthrise' as our planet came into view while Apollo 11 orbited the moon . This particular project, meanwhile, would be hitching a ride on one of several Google Lunar XPrize missions. As yet, though, the team haven’t booked a place on any particular flight. It had initially been intended to join a lander that is being built by Israeli-based SpaceIL, but that partnership failed to materialise. They are now sounding out the Spain-based Barcelona Moon Team to see if they would be willing to take the artefacts, but there has been no confirmation of an agreement yet. Another obstacle is to actually create a capsule that can survive the extreme environment on the moon. In sunlight the lunar surface can reach a scorching 123°C (253°F), but at night it plunges to a frigid -173°C (-279°F). An attempt by Esa to make the capsule that would keep the Torah safe on the moon failed to withstand this vast temperature swing. This would not be the first time religion and space have combined. As mentioned earlier, the Apollo 8 astronauts infamously read from the Book of Genesis as they orbited the moon. Buzz Aldrin, meanwhile, took communion on the moon before stepping onto the surface in July 1969.And the Apollo 15 astronauts left a bible on their lunar rover when they left the moon in July 1971. In 1971 the Apollo 15 astronauts left a Bible on their lunar rover (pictured in the red circle) when they left the surface of the moon. This is one of a handful of instances where religion and space have combined, including Buzz Aldrin taking communion on the moon in July 1969 .","An Israeli-based team is hoping to send the Torah to the moon's surface .

The rover is still able to send data back to Earth using the Chang'e 3 probe that delivered it, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing Li Bengzheng, deputy commander-in-chief of China's lunar programme. But the rover's wheels and the solar panel designed for thermal insulation during the frozen lunar nights no longer work, Li said. The craft's functionality is progressively deteriorating 'with each lunar night,' he added. China has been moving to develop its space programme for military, commercial and scientific purposes but it is still playing catch-up to established space powers the United States and Russia. The Jade Rabbit and the Chang'e 3 probe marked the first 'soft landing' on the moon since 1976. Beforehand, both the United States and the Soviet Union accomplished the feat.

"By . Emily Crane . Prison guards have taken to wearing lapel-mounted cameras to capture violent outbursts from prisoners in New Zealand's toughest jails. The disturbing video footage shows prisoners threatening guards and staff responding to fights in maximum and high-security areas of Rimutaka and Auckland prisons. The smartphone-sized on-body cameras are part of a new six-month trial to increase guard and prisoner safety and help in gathering evidence. Scroll down for video . The smartphone-sized on-body cameras being used in Rimutaka and Auckland prisons captured the moment a man, who is known for assaulting staff, refused to hang up the phone after lock up . Footage collected from inside the prisons was shown for the first time on Wednesday to New Zealand politicians, stuff.co.nz reports. Two prisoners were filmed yelling abuse at guards after they were told to stop using prison phones. One was told to hang up because he became abusive to his partner on the other end. The other man, who is known for assaulting staff, refused to hang up after lock up. 'You're f****** lucky you're wearing that camera,' he yelled to guard as he returned to his cell. The cameras are also being used to collect evidence and in one case the guards found a sharp weapon in the drain of a shower after an inmate was stabbed . Soon after, prison guards recorded footage of scratches on the ground showing the weapon had been sharpened in another cell . In another incident, guards were captured running to break up a prisoner fight in a maximum security unit. They restrained one prisoner as he lashed out yelling 'Give me arm and I'll f*** you up'. The cameras are also being used to collect evidence and in one case the guards found a sharp weapon in the drain of a shower after an inmate was stabbed. Footage of scratches on the ground showed evidence of the weapon being sharpened in another cell. This inmate was told to hang up the prison phone because he became abusive to his partner on the other end . Prison guards said the camera had a clear impact on the inmate's behaviour. Ending phone calls can often end in violent outbursts and assaults, according to staff . Corrections Minister Anne Tolley said in most cases the camera acted as a deterrent for escalated, violent behaviour. 'I'm not sure anyone's ever made public film taken from inside a prison, but we thought it was interesting enough to show how technology can be used to protect our staff and also improve behaviour,' she said. 'If we can improve behaviour and management of prisoners… it keeps staff safe and keeps (prisoners) safe. 'I've been in and out of prisons and talked with prisoners, but not normally in those sorts of circumstances.' In one incident the cameras captured guards running to break up a prisoner fight in a maximum security unit.

"By . Michael Zennie . and Lydia Warren . FBI agents have arrested a music writer and public relations consultant after a nationwide manhunt following the discovery of explosives in his San Francisco apartment. Ryan Kelly Chamberlain III, 42, was taken into custody without incident Monday at Chrissy Field, a park just south of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cell phone video obtained by WGO-TV shows several heavily armed officers handcuffing Chamberlain near his white 2008 Nissan Altima and then leading him away. The arrest capped off a three-day search for him and fears that he was armed and dangerous and had rigged his car with explosives. Scroll down for video . Ryan Kelly Chamberlain is arrested after a three-day manhunt and fears that he was 'armed and dangerous' A witness filmed Chamberlain being carted off by federal agents Monday afternoon in view of the Golden Gate Bridge (right) In the end, the FBI says, he did not prove to be an immediate threat to the public, as authorities feared. The arrest comes on the same day Chamberlain appeared to post a lengthy screed online detailing his history of heartbreak, professional failure and struggle with depression. Questions have emerged whether it was meant to be a suicide note. 'You're reading this. That means we probably don't know each other anymore, and I oweeveryone an explanation,' he writes to an unidentified subject. 'I've timed this note on a Hootsuite delay, and now it's live, which means I wasn't around to stopit from posting.' He makes no mention of violence, but only says: 'I got dark. I got real dark. I explored myriad ways I could put an end to what I was going through. I binged-watched dark TV, sometimes didn't get off the couch for days.' Chamberlain also took to Twitter to deny the allegations against him: 'A panicked update to my letter that should have posted by now. Nothing they're reporting is true. No ""stashes."" Not ""armed and...' The tweet trails off. Chamberlain is a self-proclaimed 'political junkie' who had worked as a music writer before switching to public relations - although one friend said he had 'got weird' after losing a job last year. 'Armed and dangerous': Ryan Kelly Chamberlain, II, is being sought by the FBI after explosive materials were found in his San Francisco apartment during a raid. They warned that he could be dangerous until announcing Monday that he's no longer a public threat . The . nationwide alert was issued after the FBI showed up to Chamerlain's apartment, . located in the Russian Hill neighborhood, at 9am Saturday, with a search . warrant. Chamberlain did not answer the door. Authorities remained at the scene, and a hazmat team arrived to enter . the one-bedroom apartment. They remained on the scene well into the . evening, returning again on Sunday. According to ABC7, . who was on scene throughout the day, the hazmat team extracted a . toolbox from the apartment. Equipment such as x-rays and a bomb disposal . robot were used. Later in the evening, a loud bang was heard at the scene. Despite this, authorities did not evacuate residents from the surrounding apartments. 'There is no risk to public safety,' the FBI told ABC7. 'The protective equipment that you see is for agent safety.' Search: A hazmat crew searches Chamberlain's home on Saturday as part of a criminal investigation. The chemicals found in the apartment were not revealed as of Monday evening . Probe: Emergency services outside Chamberlain's apartment. Authorities were on the scene all weekend . Discovery: The back patio and sliding glass windows to Ryan Chamberlain's apartment at 1609 Jackson St in Russian Hill. The apartment remained sealed after FBI agents carried out a raid . Chamberlain may have bought the chemical off the Internet, the FBI told NBC Bay Area. Residents inside of the apartment complex also told the station that FBI agents took at least two computers from Chamberlain's apartment. More than a dozen bags of evidence were reportedly taken from the apartment. Chamberlain was described by a neighbor as 'a quiet guy, nice enough.' His boss at a music rights consultancy group said he last contacted her Friday to remind her to deposit his paycheck at a new bank account. Brooke . Wentz said the conversation was uneventful and that she was . 'tremendously dumbfounded' that the contractor she hired to handle her . company's social media accounts was a wanted man. 'He's a nice guy,' Wentz told The Associated Press. She . said it didn't seem like Chamberlain was staying in the apartment on . Jackson Street because when she mailed him his paycheck in April, he . told her he would have to go and collect it. She . said he seemed under financial pressure because he told her that two . friends who were leasing his apartment left without telling him and he . had to scramble to pay for two rentals. 'I . wondered what kind of friends would do something like that? I tried to . ask him about the situation but he was kind of evading my question,' Wentz said. Alex Clemens, founder of San Francisco's Barbary Coast Consulting, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Chamberlain had worked on numerous political campaigns. 'I'm . worried about the guy,' he said. 'I'm hoping this ends without anybody . getting hurt. I'm flabbergasted that this seems to be taking place.' No longer a threat: A picture of Ryan Chamberlain, a man in his 30s, found on his Twitter and Facebook pages. Chamberlain was the subject of an FBI manhunt after authorities found explosives in his home, but he's no longer considered a public threat . Wanted: Chamberlain, pictured with friends, worked as a music and sports writer before getting into PR . Questions: Another image shows him laying on top of a friend. His boss told reporters that he had said a couple of friends had just moved out of his apartment, leaving him to cover their rent . But . acquaintances also said that Chamerlain struggled after losing his job . at Project Sport, a marketing company where he worked with professional . athletes, last November. Friend Randy Bramblett . Randy . Bramblett, a professional cyclist and personal trainer who met . Chamberlain through his work at the company, said that he 'got weird' after losing his job. 'The . thing is, there was a lot of strange behavior since November,' Bramblett said. 'He stopped answering his phone. I think he became an . extreme introvert.' He added: 'I've never seen him be violent, ever, but I would definitely say that maybe emotionally and mentally he was a little unstable.' Authorities . have been quiet on the exact nature of the investigation, although they . have said that Chamberlain is wanted for possessing explosives in his . home and that he acted alone. But they would not say what type of explosives were found at the apartment, nor how he came into possession of it. Chamberlain has a large social media presence, with his 'about me' page showing several different online initiatives. Sports lover: Ryan Chamberlain had also live-tweeted football games for the San Francisco Chronicle . The FBI arrived at Chamberlain's Russian Hill apartment Saturday with a search warrant, only to find him gone . According to a biography posted on The Rights Network, . Chamberlain began his professional career as a music reporter with the . Des Moines Register, in Des Moines, Iowa, before moving to San Francisco . to pursue a career as a public relations professional. According to the biography, Chamberlain became involved working with 10 'social media properties'. In his about.me biography, Chamberlain described himself as a 'SF political junkie and oft-times operative.' A spokeswoman for the University of San Francisco said Chamberlain taught a 'Grass Roots Mobilization' course to graduate students in the Public Affairs program in 2011. Anne-Marie Devine said Chamberlain taught for one semester, and wasn't invited to teach another course. She said she didn't know why because hundreds of adjunct professors come and go. According to the FBI, Chamberlain has a criminal history containing only minor infractions. The . FBI has not said what they were originally looking for with the search . warrant, and says that Chamberlain's warrant and affidavit are currently . sealed.","Ryan Chamberlain posted a possible suicide note that was set to go live on a timer .

"By . Mark Duell . Updated: . 16:51 EST, 27 January 2012 . The mother of one of three Cub Scouts killed two decades ago in the West Memphis Three case today pushed for the long-running investigation to be reopened because of crucial new evidence. Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley spent 18 years in jail accused of killing eight-year-old boys Steven Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore in West Memphis, Arkansas. Police labelled the 1993 murders ‘satanic’ because the children's naked bodies had been bound and mutilated. The three men were released in August after they were allowed to change their pleas. Boy scouts: The bodies of Christopher Byers, left, James Michael Moore, centre, and Steven Branch, right, were found tied up and mutilated in 1993 after the 'satanic' murders in West Memphis, Arkansas . The well-known case that attracted the attention of actor Johnny Depp is now the subject of the documentary ‘Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory’, which was nominated for an Academy Award this week. The children's naked bodies had been bound and mutilated in the ‘satanic’ crime. But DNA tests did not link the men to the scene. It even showed others were there, who have never been identified. The three men were released in August after a bargain in which they could continue to claim their innocence but pleaded guilty in exchange for an 18-year sentence and credit for time served. ‘I am content in my heart that Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley did not murder my son,’ Steven’s mother Pam Hobbs said. She wants investigators to look at new evidence. Ms Hobbs wants them to look at Terry Hobbs, her ex-husband and the stepfather of Steven. Last week, lawyers for the West Memphis Three released polygraph tests from three new witnesses. Original mugshots: (Left-to-right) Jason Baldwin, Damien Echols and Jessie Misskelley served 18 years . Freed: Damien Echols, left, Jessie Misskelley, centre and Jason Baldwin, right, at a news conference in August . They say Terry Hobbs's nephew, Michael Hobbs Jr, told friends his uncle murdered the three boys. Echols's lawyers say this new information suggests Terry Hobbs’s relatives may have more details. 'I am content in my heart that Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley did not murder my son' Pam Hobbs, Steven Branch’s mother . ‘These three young witnesses are very willing to co-operate,’ Echols’s spokesman Lonnie Soury said. Neither Terry Hobbs nor Michael Hobbs Jr. have yet commented. But Terry Hobbs said in August: ‘At every turn of the case there has never been one speck of evidence in me as a suspect.’ Scott Ellington, a prosecutor in Jonesboro, Arkansas, said in August that if new credible evidence was produced that he would be willing to re-examine the case, which now dates back 19 years. He said on Tuesday that he had just received a packet from Echols's attorneys containing the new information. ‘I haven't had a chance to read through it all and digest it but I will,’ Mr Ellington said. New probe: Steven's mother Pam Hobbs, pictured, said that she wants investigators to look at new evidence regarding Terry Hobbs, her ex-husband and the stepfather of Steven . Some parents of the three murdered children just want the case to go away. Todd and Diana Moore, parents of Michael, claim that the ‘Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory’ film glorifies the West Memphis Three. 'These three young witnesses are very willing to cooperate' Lonnie Soury, Damien Echols’s spokesman . They asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to exclude the film, which is the third in an HBO series about the murders, from nomination consideration. ‘This film should be exposed as a fraud, not rewarded with an Academy Award nomination,’ Mr and Mrs Moore wrote in a letter to the Academy on Tuesday. The case is also the subject of a second documentary, ‘West of Memphis.’ That film from ‘Lord of the Rings’ director Peter Jackson screened last week at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Film: The well-known case that attracted the attention of actor Johnny Depp is now the subject of the documentary 'Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory', which was nominated for an Academy Award this week . When Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley were . released from jail in August, they celebrated their first night of . freedom in 18 years like 'five-year old kids at their first Christmas', . one of their lawyers said. 'I was up all morning and most of the night trying to figure out how to use those iPhone things' Damien Echols, speaking in August . For Echols, who spent half his life on death row, the release came almost out of the blue. He once came within three weeks of execution and has been relearning to live outside prison. 'I was up all morning and most of the night trying to figure out how to use those iPhone things,’ he said in August in the lobby of a posh Memphis hotel, just across the river from West Memphis. Echols’s lawyer Steven Braga said his client celebrated with Baldwin and supporters in Memphis. ‘It was as if you could see two little five-year-old kids at their first Christmas,' he told CBS in August.","Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley released in August .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It might be time to throw away your old pen and paper - Esquoia claims to offer a 'revolutionary' approach to writing with an innovative design. The reusable notebook allows you to jot down notes and then wipe pages clean without residual smudging or ink. And what’s more, it is water resistant and you can also transfer entire pages between books. Scroll down for video . A group of past and present Bradford University students are hoping to revolutionise the stationery world with an invention named Esquoia. The reusable notebook has pages similar to a whiteboard that can be wiped clean and written on again after they are used . Esquoia is the work of a team of Bradford University students. Reusable - Write, dry-erase and rewrite things many times. Effective - Erase unnecessary things instantly and re-draw. Durable - Strong materials - use the same notebook for many years. Customizable - Reposition pages fast; change rings and covers. Printer-friendly - Make copies of a single sheet. Environmentally friendly - Consume less paper for lengthy note-making. To enable a proper launch of their project they are currently seeking funds on Kickstarter. And having now reached their target, money is continuing to flock in as they prepare to bring Esquoia to market. The product is inspired by whiteboard designs, bringing ‘flexible whiteboard features to a single desk notebook,’ says the company. The specially designed paper is similar to laminated paper with a smooth surface. When written on the pages can easily be scrubbed clean with a pencil eraser, a napkin or even a wet cloth. And the unique binder design also enables pages to be taken out of one notebook and placed in another. The paper is inspired by whiteboards. It is similar to laminated paper and, with special dry-erase ink pens, it can be written on and then wiped clean with ease. The design lets writers and illustrators reuse the same page over and over again without any markings or ink staying on the page after the ink has been erased . The ink on each page of the notebook can be rubbed off the page using anything from a standard eraser to a wet cloth. Here Chemistry student Anna Jaskova from the University of Bradford is seen demonstrating how the reusable notebook works . ‘The first prototypes were single sheets of basic laminated paper,’ the company writes. ‘It was far from a beautiful notebook, but the start was already there. ‘The very first prototype was just a plain sheet of laminated paper. It was not user-friendly enough for comfortable everyday use. ‘We went further and had fun trying out mountains of different special types of paper. ‘We continued the trial-and-error process with another bunch of paper arranged with a local printing shop on campus, as well as many other producers of paper. ‘Finally, we came up with a smooth, high-quality surface. It provided an exciting and different writing experience. ‘Our collection of mini whiteboards was thus created.’ The notebooks will come in a variety of colours. They also have a unique binder design that allows the reusable pages to be easily transferred between notebooks, even if the pages are different sizes . With funding the team plans to upgrade the next-generation notebook even further. Amongst several novel ideas, they plan to produce sheets of paper with lines or grids for other uses. They also want to create larger pages that will include a ‘folding line’ where they could be torn. ‘We believe In our notebooks and we are committed to the idea by developing it on a daily basis,’ the team says. ‘We want to make people start sketching and/or making notes in a way they never did before.’ The Esquoia notebooks were designed and made by a team of students from the University of Bradford, who now hope to bring the product to market with sufficient funding.

"By . Mark Prigg . Mobile phones that can be charged in minutes could soon be possible thanks to a radical new battery technology. Called supercapacitors, the material, in the form of a wafer, can turn phone casings, car chassis and even walls into quick charging batteries. Researchers at Vanderbilt say they have created the first working prototypes of the technology. The tiny wafer that could mean you can charge all your gadgets in seconds: Superconducting material can take a full charge in a matter of seconds - and is smaller than traditional batteries . The wafers consist of electrodes made from silicon that have been chemically treated so they have nanoscale pores on their inner surfaces and then coated with a protective ultrathin graphene-like layer of carbon. Sandwiched between the two electrodes is a polymer film that acts as a reservoir of charged ions, similar to the role of the electrolyte paste in a battery. When the electrodes are pressed together, the polymer oozes into the tiny pores in much the same way that melted cheese soaks into the nooks and crannies of artisan bread in a panini. When the polymer cools and solidifies, it forms an extremely strong mechanical bond. 'These devices demonstrate -for the first time as far as we can tell - that it is possible to create materials that can store and discharge significant amounts of electricity while they are subject to realistic static loads and dynamic forces, such as vibrations or impacts,' said Cary Pint, one of the researchers. The new device that Pint and Westover has developed is a supercapacitor that stores electricity by assembling electrically charged ions on the surface of a porous material, instead of storing it in chemical reactions the way batteries do. As a result, supercaps can charge and discharge in minutes, instead of hours, and operate for millions of cycles, instead of thousands of cycles like batteries. 'When you can integrate energy into the components used to build systems, it opens the door to a whole new world of technological possibilities. 'All of a sudden, the ability to design technologies at the basis of health, entertainment, travel and social communication will not be limited by plugs and external power sources,' Pint said. A side view of the structural supercapacitor shows the blue polymer electrolyte that glues the silicon electrodes together. It stores electricity by assembling electrically charged ions on the surface of a porous material, instead of storing it in chemical reactions the way batteries do. Supercapacitors store ten times less energy than current lithium-ion batteries, but they can last a thousand times longer - meaning they can be built into walls and chassis. 'Battery performance metrics change when you’re putting energy storage into heavy materials that are already needed for structural integrity,' said Pint. 'Supercapacitors store ten times less energy than current lithium-ion batteries, but they can last a thousand times longer. 'That means they are better suited for structural applications. 'It doesn’t make sense to develop materials to build a home, car chassis, or aerospace vehicle if you have to replace them every few years because they go dead.' Andrew Westover, left, John Tian and Cary Pint admiring one of their supercapacitors. The team say they have created the first working prototypes of the battery technology. The engineers suspended a heavy laptop from the supercapacitor to demonstrate its strength . In a paper appearing online May 19 in the journal Nano Letters, Pint and Westover report that their new structural supercapacitor operates flawlessly in storing and releasing electrical charge while subject to stresses or pressures up to 44 psi and vibrational accelerations over 80 g (significantly greater than those acting on turbine blades in a jet engine). Furthermore, the mechanical robustness of the device doesn’t compromise its energy storage capability. 'In an unpackaged, structurally integrated state our supercapacitor can store more energy and operate at higher voltages than a packaged, off-the-shelf commercial supercapacitor, even under intense dynamic and static forces,' Pint said.","Material can turn phone casings, car chassis and even walls into quick charging batteries .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Pervert: Michael Atherton, 42, from Scarborough, was jailed for seven years at York Crown Court today for online sexual offences against women and children . An internet troll who prowled . Facebook for women and young girls so he could subject them to bouts of . online ‘flashing’ has been jailed for seven years. Michael . Atherton, 42, contacted his victims on the social media network via . video call app FaceTime, and by email using false profiles before exposing himself to . them over the web. Police were called in after a string of victims across Yorkshire and Humberside including a girl aged eight said they had been targeted by Atherton. One woman said she had been pestered on Facebook for years. Inquiries revealed Atherton had been convicted of similar offences in 2012 after being caught in undercover police sting by an officer posing online as a schoolgirl. But he escaped jail after claiming his sex drive had been ‘heightened’ as a result of him taking medication for a depressive condition. Today, Atherton from Scarborough, North Yorks, who is also known as Michael Alderton was labelled a ‘sexual deviant’ by detectives after admitting 17 offences at York Crown Court. They included six charges of indecent exposure, attempted sexual actity with a child, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, three charges of breaching of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and two offences under the Crime and Disorder Act. He was ordered to remain the Sex Offender Register for life. After the case WDC Michelle Neighbour, of North Yorkshire Police said Atherton’s behaviour highlights the importance of not accepting friend requests via the internet from unknown people. She added: ‘Michael Atherton persistently engaged in sexual acts using various internet applications. ‘He harassed his victims to satisfy his own sexual gratification. He befriended children and women on Facebook by using false profiles and then contacted them via FaceTime and exposed himself. Online predator: Atherton used FaceTime, Apple's video call app, to expose himself to women and girls . ‘Michael Atherton is a sexual deviant who will now have a number of years in prison to reflect on his behaviour. ‘He can spend his days thinking about the impact his behaviour has had on his victims and participate in a sex offenders treatment programme, which in turn should teach him how to deal with his sexual desires within the private confines of his own home.’ Atherton was once called a ‘high risk’ to children in 2012 after going onto an internet chatroom and carrying out sexual acts via a webcam, as well as other activity, with a person he believed to be a 12-year-old girl called Lilly. Unknown to him at the other end of the line was a policewoman posing as a youngster in order to monitor chat-room sites and catch paedophiles abusing it. During that incident Atherton engaged in a sexual conversation with ‘Lilly’ online, asking her to get friends to also watch him committing a sexual act upon himself and sending her a pornographic photograph involving an eight-year-old girl. Later when he was arrested the following day, Atherton’s computer equipment was seized and examined, eight further child pornographic images, along with 200 legal adult pornographic pictures, were found. In September 2012 Atherton admitted child pornography charges but was given a three-year community order with supervision – on condition he get treatment to assist him in controlling his sexual urges involving children. He was also placed indefinitely under a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, restricting his use of the internet and contact with youngsters under the age of 18, and ordered to be on the Sex Offenders register for five years . But he was arrested again after a woman from the Keighley area of West Yorks went to police saying Atherton had hounded her for 10 years. She said in a statement: ‘I am glad that I came forward and reported this man to the police. I identified Michael Atherton which assisted the police in linking him to other victims. I believe one of the victims was as young eight-years-old. ‘I am pleased that the investigation is now over and a good sentence was given. ‘Michael Atherton started harassing me from the age of 14 and did not stop for 10 years. He is a pest that never went away and I am glad that I will finally be left alone.’ Another of his victims, a woman from North Lincolnshire whose eight-year-old daughter was also targeted by Atherton, told how monitoring her child’s internet use helped to catch him. She said: ‘I feel so relieved that justice has been done and he has been put into prison. ‘This shows how the internet should be monitored at all times where your children are involved. Thankfully I do monitor my daughter’s internet activity.’","Michael Atherton from Scarborough, N Yorks, faced similar charges in 2012 .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Abuse: School children are using social media to bombard their teachers with vile abuse . School children of primary school age are using social media to bombard their teachers with vile homophobic and racist abuse, according to a teacher's union. The alarming trend, uncovered by the NASUWT teaching union, revealed that a growing number of children, some as young as four to seven years old, are targeting staff with offensive language and comments about their race, sexuality and appearance. In a survey of 7,500 members, NASUWT found that the problem is widespread, with 21 per cent of teachers polled revealing that they had been the victim of abuse. A further 26 per cent said that videos or photos of them had been uploaded online without their consent. One worried teacher said that a . student had set up a Facebook page with the sole intent of telling her . that he intended to kill her. She said: 'Facebook page set up by a pupil who claimed he wanted to kill me.' Another teacher admitted that a student took to social media site Twitter and wrote: 'You are a paedo, and your daughter is a whore.' In other encounters, of pupils bullying . those in charge, teachers told how they received comments about their . sexuality and racial abuse, with one saying 'they referred to me as a . monkey.' The . overwhelming majority of comments are posted on Facebook by secondary school pupils. However, of those teachers receiving comments by pupils, 47 . per cent said they had received insulting comments and 50 per cent had read a comment about their performance as a teacher. Angry parents: At least 27 per cent of abuse came from parents but teachers say nothing is being done . The high level of disrespect from children towards their teachers has led the NASUWT to call for the government to do more to tackle the problem - before it gets completely out of control. At its conference in Birmingham, it said the the government is caught up in bureaucracy and is failing to do enough to ensure that teachers can work in a safe environment, free from harassment. Additionally, the teachers union said that it wasn't just children who needed to be reined in from being abusive online - their parents were joining in too. According to the poll, at least 27 per cent of abuse came from angry parents, 64 per cent were sent by pupils and 9 per cent were sent by both. Abuse by secondary school students is most prolific, however, infant school students aged from four to seven were also using the internet to send hate-filled messages. Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'Technology has transformed the working and social lives of many teachers and enhanced the learning experiences of pupils. 'However, it is clear that steps need to be taken to protect teachers from the abuse of social media by pupils and parents. Stop the abuse: Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT is calling on the government to do more to stop teachers being bullied by students . 'Teachers are often devastated by the vile nature of the abuse they are suffering. 'Teachers are often traumatised by the attacks made on them through social media. 'Some have lost their confidence to teach once they see foul and personal remarks made by pupils in their classes and have left the profession. However, many do not want to report the abuse to their school or to the police, with at least 58 per cent polled saying that they refused to report the vicious attacks on them. Another 68 per cent feared that nothing would be done to prevent the terrible abuse. And if they did report the abuse to their headteacher, 40 per cent said nothing was done and no action had been taken against pupils. Ms Keates added: 'Others have been so disturbed by the comments that their health has been affected. 'Great strides had been made by the previous government, working in partnership with the NASUWT and other teacher unions and social media providers, in seeking to address this problem. However, a further 77 per cent said nothing was . done when the police became involved and 76 per cent said nothing was done to . stop the parents who sent the messages to them. She said: 'Comprehensive guidance had been produced about social media and internet safety which promoted good practice for schools on how to protect staff, and indeed pupils, from abuse. 'One of the Coalition Government’s first acts was to remove the guidance on the grounds that it was unnecessary bureaucracy. 'Schools need policies which prevent abuse and identify sanctions which will be taken against parents and pupils who abuse staff in this way. 'Schools should also be supporting staff in securing the removal of the offensive material from social media sites and encouraging the staff concerned to go to the police.'","Primary school age children are bullying their teachers online with vile abuse .

"By . Adam Duggan . Gallipoli tour operators have been accused of misleading travellers by both the Australian and Turkish governments, ahead of next year's 100th anniversary of the Anzac landings. To mark the anniversary, the entire Gallipoli historical national park will be closed to everyone but 10,500 Australian and New Zealand ballot winners and official guests - with the Department of Veterans' Affairs claiming they had been advising tourism operators of the fact since as early as 2010. Despite the warnings, some cruise operators are misleading potential tourists by saying they are still waiting for authorities to 'finalise arrangements' for their docking points on the peninsula. Deceptive marketing: Several Australian tour operators have come under fire for misleading potential customers about their proximity to next year's 100th anniversary of the Anzac landing in Gallipoli . Missing out: One tour operator has gone as far as charging a surcharge to guests which were lucky enough to win ballot tickets to the Anzac Cove site . Brisbane-based tourism operator Inner Faith Travel is claiming on its website that travellers 'will be in Anzac Cove to view the dawn service through the eyes of the Anzac's [sic] landing'. In an online brochure for the tour, which costs a minimum of AU$5,985 per person, the operator said they were still waiting for authorities to 'finalise arrangements' for the tour. However, in an advisory posted on its official Gallipoli 2015 website, the Department of Veterans' Affairs advises: 'The government of Turkey has also advised that no non-official ­activities will be allowed to occur on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 24-25 April 2015.' On their '100th Anniversary Anzac Tour To Turkey & Greece', which charges a minimum a AU$5,985.00 per person, those who were lucky enough to win ballot tickets will be charged a surcharge for actually attending the Dawn Service and official memorial services. Inner Faith Travel passengers who missed out on tickets as part of the official ballot will be left to watch the events on large screens set-up on the ship's pool and theatre areas. Not quite Anzac Cove adjacent: Inner Faith travel has come under fire for telling potential customers that they are awaiting final approval from authorities - despite knowing since at least 2012 that their ship would not be docking anywhere near the site . Another company under fire for misleading advertising is Military History Tours, who have a deal arranged for readers of News Corp newspapers, and promises to 'be ashore at Dawn on ANZAC Day with all onboard attending a 100th Anniversary Service.' However, Military History Tours director Colonel Paul Murphy (ret) denies any wrongdoing on the part of his company. 'Our cruise ships are merely a hotel from the 21st to 25th of April,' Colonel Murphy told MailOnline. He said that the ship will be docked at the International Wharf at the Dardanelles and that his company never advised potential customers that they will be near the cove. 'The only ships that will be seen from Anzac Cove will be visiting war ships, not cruise vessels,' he added. MailOnline has sought comment from Inner Faith Travel.","Some operators telling guests they are waiting to 'finalise arrangements' with Turkish Government on their docking points .

"By . Sara Malm . A Romanian man killed himself and his young son after a computer virus led him to believe he was going to jail. Marcel Datcu took his own life and that of his four-year-old son Nicusor after his computer became infested with a ransomware demanding that he pay £13,000 or he would go to prison. The 36-year-old, from  Movila Miresii, Brăila County in east Romania, left behind a note where he said he could not stand going to prison and did not want his son to suffer for his actions. Tragedy: Mr Datcu is said to have been a victim of a malware scam, believed to have been the one pictured, where a computer virus poses as a local law enforcement, threatening to send a person to jail unless they pay a large rum of money . Local police believe the ransomware entered Mr Datcu's computer after he visited an adult entertainment website. One of his sons found the bodies in their home, along with a note addressed to Mr Datcu's wife. 'I received a warning [on my computer] that said I have to pay 70.000 lei [€16,000] or go to prison for 11 years,' it read according to IBTimes. 'I don't think it's normal what I've done...I apologise to all of you...I don't want Nicusor to suffer because of me...I can't stand going to prison. I can't.'

"By . Louise Eccles . Perhaps Royal Ascot’s fashion police were snoozing on the beat. Showing her black lace bra in a backless, thigh-skimming dress, Zoe Neilson made it into the exclusive royal enclosure – which is supposed to have the strictest dress requirements of all. The tattooed 23-year-old dismissed the tough new sartorial regulations as ‘pretentious’ as she evaded the dress code assistants patrolling the turnstiles yesterday. Dismissive: Zoe Neilson, 23, said the new regulations at Royal Ascot were 'pretentious' She was in breach of two rules – giving a glimpse of her underwear and wearing a dress not of ‘modest length’, both strictly prohibited in the prestigious enclosure. But it was the former private schoolgirl’s nose ring and heavily tattooed arm which were more likely to provoke controversy. Getting away with it: Zoe Neilson showed her black lace bra in a backless, thigh-skimming dress . While not against the regulations, they could cause a stir among the well-heeled guests at the genteel race meet. And one can only wonder what the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who were in attendance for the second day, made of the less than distinguished attire chosen by some racegoers. Organisers have introduced a tough new dress code this year after increasing numbers of visitors were accused of falling on the wrong side of propriety. The revised regulations demand hats in the royal enclosure and fascinators in the grandstand. Bottom-skimming skirts, strapless tops, halternecks and spaghetti straps are banned. Fashion officers patrol the gates to hand out free pashminas, ties and fascinators to anyone who breaks the rules – while those who require a hat must pay a £50 cash deposit to encourage them to return it. Yesterday, arts graduate Miss Neilson, who attended St Mary’s boarding school in Wantage, Oxfordshire, now part of £29,000-a-year Heathfield School in Ascot, said: ‘I knew my dress was too short so I tugged it down just before I went through the gates. ‘I saw the stewards as I went into the enclosure, but I just thought “Whatever, I’m having a good time, you have a good time”. ‘I feel a bit bad about showing my bra at the back – but not really actually because you can’t please everyone. ‘I like that everyone gets dressed up for Ascot but I think it’s a little bit pretentious. ‘Then again, you don’t want everyone running around in here in mini-skirts and crop tops.’ When . asked about her tattoos, which feature heavily down her left arm and . include roses, ivy  and a pocket watch, Miss Neilson, of Wandsworth, . south London, said: ‘I didn’t even think twice about my tattoos. I don’t . think it’s an issue these days at all and I think they are nice.’ The . portrait artist shares her passion for inking with fellow racegoer . Joanna Southgate, 34, who attracted attention at Ascot on Tuesday after . removing her leather jacket to reveal heavily tattooed arms beneath a . classy red dress and cherry-shaped headpiece. Enjoying the day: The Queen wore pink while the Duke of Edinburgh opted for a traditional grey top hat . Competitor: The Queen's horse Carlton House ran on day two of the race meet . Yesterday, the office worker,  of Brixton, south London, insisted her tattoos – which include  two naked ladies and an octopus – were ‘tasteful’. She said: ‘It is interesting that it has caused a stir. I had a really good day at Ascot and no one made any untoward comments to me about my tattoos. Everyone was really accepting. ‘My tattoos were done by an amazing artist and I think mine are very tasteful, very artistic. They are a work of art. ‘If I had badly done tattoos or offensive tattoos then I would certainly cover them up for the races.’ She described her tattoos as  ‘art nouveau’, saying they included a ‘naked woman lying on her side’ and the top half of a ‘naked Japanese lady’. How the Mail revealed on Wednesday that Ascot's rules were being flouted . Both of the women were, she said, ‘covering up their extremities’. While . the body art on show may have raised some eyebrows, plenty of racegoers . passed the dress code test with flying colours  yesterday – no doubt . helped by the fact that many appeared to have followed in the . immaculately shod footsteps of the Duchess of Cambridge. The . grandstand was packed with women in knee-length shift dresses, skirt . suits and nude court shoes that were similar to Kate’s favourite LK . Bennett Sledge heels. It . came days after the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of  Cornwall and . the Countess of Wessex all wore nude court shoes to the Order of the . Garter service at Windsor Castle. Nurse . Fiona Webb, 29, of Wokingham, Berkshire, wore a pair of nude sling-back . patent shoes with a blue and orange dress and nude-coloured hat for her . visit to the races. She said: ‘This is the first time I have worn nude heels but it went with my dress and there were so many in the shops. ‘I . didn’t consciously choose them because Kate Middleton wears them but I . suppose she has had  an influence on women’s fashion. She is certainly . always very  well dressed.’ And . as always, the Queen showed racegoers how it should be done, wearing a . powder pink hat and matching coat and dress to the event yesterday. Her . choice was welcomed by radiotherapist Lauren Evans, 23, who remains on . track to win £25,000 on a £5 bet with Ladbrokes if she guesses the . colour of the Queen’s hat every day of Ascot. She correctly predicted . that the Queen would wear blue on Tuesday. Miss . Evans, of Kensington, said: ‘I’m in shock to be honest. It’s crazy that . she’s actually wearing pink. I don’t want to get carried away because . there’s still three days to go.’ Glamorous: Prince Harry's erstwhile paramour Florence Brudenell Bruce (left) looked chic . in a Missoni dress at Ascot, while Viscountess Serena . Linley (right) was neat in white wool skirt suit . Too short! The new regulations mean that high hemlines are banned in the Grandstand and Royal enclosure .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Approval: Damien Hirst has won permission from planners to build an entire village near his childhood home . Damien Hirst has won approval from planners to build an entire village near his childhood home. Controversial Hirst submitted a proposal last year to create 750 homes, a school, shops, health centre and offices on the edge of the seaside town of Ilfracombe, Devon. The monster development - dubbed Hirst-on-Sea - sparked caused concern among residents who say it will swamp local services and ruin the countryside. But Ilfracombe Town Council has given Hirst's vision the green light saying it will expand the town and breathe new life into the pretty coastal resort. The 187-acre ""Souther Extension"" site covers much of Winsham Farm, a wildlife haven which the Turner Prize-winning artist bought for £900,000 ten years ago. Hirst has already left his imprint on the town after lending it Verity, his 67ft bronze artwork of a pregnant woman carrying a sword. Anne Thomas, who sits on Ilfracombe Town Council's planning committee, said local people would be thrilled to have a new school and better local amenities. Hirst - best known for his sheep in formaldehyde - is also promising sports pitches, parkland, woodland, allotments and 250 new jobs. Ms Thomas said: 'The town's population needs to increase to make the high street sustainable. Green light: Ilfracombe Town Council gave the go ahead for the development saying it will breathe new life into the seaside resort . 'There will be industrial units and shops - hopefully it will bring more jobs to the town.' Hirst's development will now go to North Devon District Council for a final decision on whether it can begin.","Artist plans to create village with schools, shops, health centre and offices .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Attacker: Ajit Sekhon, pictured, beat his own son and wife with a cereal bowl and heavy ornaments, leaving them seriously hurt . An abusive father attacked his own son - and almost killer his wheelchair user wife - in a row over watching Emmerdale. Ajit Sekhon, 59, was watching the soap over breakfast with his wife Manjit and son Paul, 32, but flew into a violent rage when the picture cut out. He battered his son, who had been adjusting the aerial to fix the television, with a metal cereal bowl before trying to strangle him. Mrs Sekhon managed to escape the attack to raise the alarm, but when she came back her husband turned on her, beating her with a heavy ornament, pouring burning liquid on her and even biting her fingers. He used a heavy ornament to attack her head, causing significant injuries to her scalp. Sekhon was found standing over his unconscious wife - whom he had beaten and abused for years - in his blood-spattered home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. He was jailed for sixteen and a half years after admitting two counts of grievous bodily harm against his family members at Sheffield Crown Court. Sentencing him at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Julian Goose said: 'It was a sustained attack on both of them with repeated blows when they were defenceless.' Kirstie Watson, prosecuting, explained that Mrs Sekhon, who had been married to her Sikh husband for 38 years, had missed an episode of Emmerdale and wanted to catch up over breakfast. She was watching the show with her son Paul when her husband came into the lounge and got two breakfast bowls for them. 'There was a problem with the reception and Paul tried to improve the picture,' said Miss Watson. 'Suddenly and without any warning the defendant jumped up and with his metal cereal bowl began to hit Paul about the head,' she said. The prosecutor described how he fell onto his mother, who has mobility problems and uses a wheelchair, as she sat on the sofa. Sekhon repeatedly hit his son with the bowl on the head and arms as his mother screamed 'you are going to kill him, you are going to kill him.' Sekhon then began strangling Paul, who nearly passed out. He then picked up a sharp-edged bracelet and began hitting his blood-soaked son with it on his arms and body before Mrs Sekhon escape through the a patio doors and raised the alarm. When she returned shortly afterwards her husband was still brutally attacking her son on his legs. But he managed to escape, leading his father to turn on Mrs Sekhon. Sentenced: Sekhon was given a sixteen-and-a-half-year prison term . He turned to his wife, grabbed her by the hair, pinned her face down on the floor and said: 'I’m going to kill you now you have let that bastard go.' He struck her repeatedly about the head with a heavy ornament and sat on her as she was face down. Miss Watson said at one point she pretended to be dead but when she moved her husband began beating her again. He bit one of her fingers and she felt he was trying to burn her as some liquid was poured over her. When the police arrived Sekhon was stood over his unconscious wife who was still on the floor and he then stopped the attack and went to wash his hands. Officers said Sekhon could only stare at them when they arrived - and they had to use a Taser to restrain him. Miss Watson said: 'The police and paramedics found a scene of complete devastation. There was blood all over the room, on the walls, on the floor and on the sofa.' Mrs Sekhon was rushed to hospital where she needed emergency treatment to survive. She has been left scarred for life and has had three operations on her badly damaged scalp and suffered injuries to her head, arms and hands and had broken fingers. Her son had cuts to his head, arms and hands as well as broken fingers. The court heard Sekhon had been controlling and abusive to his wife from the start of their marriage, both verbally and physically. He broke her arm only a week after she had a caesarean birth and was also violent towards his children, one of whom ran away from home in fear of him. A recent scene from the ITV soap Emmerdale as one of its characters, Marlon Dingle, pictured holding a Champagne glass in his right hand, celebrates his 40th birthday . A sign at the Emmerdale set near Leeds. Ajit Sekhon was watching the soap over breakfast with his wife Manjit and son Paul, but flew into a violent rage when the picture cut out . Sekhon was effectively his wife’s carer on October 18 last year when the attack took place. She said in a victim impact statement that she still bears the mental scars, is scared to be alone and her road to recovery 'will be a long one.' She said: 'I consider the arrival of the officers saved my life.' Her son Paul had to take time off from his work as a carer and was now his mother’s main support. 'I don’t understand why my father acted as he did,' he said. In mitigation Nawaz Hussain said the attack was not pre-meditated. He said: 'It was a normal family gathering and what came afterwards was all the more horrifying. It was a horrific loss of temper and self-control.' He had clearly failed in his role as a 'husband and father' and when accounts of the incident were given to him he was 'sickened' as he remembered little of it. 'He will have no family on his release from prison and will not seek to contact them', said Mr Hussain. 'He may well see his final days in prison. 'He will have to live with the horror he has inflicted on his family to his last days.' Judge Goose said: 'An argument developed, the cause is irrelevant but you lost your temper and began to attack Paul in a sustained and violent attack whilst your wife begged you to stop.' He said Paul was defenceless as he was repeatedly struck with the bowl and then he was nearly strangled. The judge went on: 'You knew your wife was vulnerable and had mobility problems and required a wheelchair yet still you struck her repeatedly on the head. 'You threatened to kill her and carried on a sustained attack with a heavy object. It was feared she might not survive due to the amount of blood she lost.'","Ajit Sekhon was watching soap over breakfast when the picture cut out .

"By . Mia De Graaf . The mastermind of a multi-million pound car theft scheme has been jailed after he was caught taunting police with a personalised number plate that read S20LUN. Shanwaz Khan, 30, led a ring of carjackers who stole vehicles and sold the parts abroad. But he was tracked down after brazenly driving around in his £55,000 Audi RS4 with the bragging registration plate designed to resemble the word 'stolen'. Officers who followed his car across Birmingham in March 2012 found it was one of a convoy of stolen cars. Taunting: Police uncovered Khan's £1.1million scheme after spotting his 'stolen' number plate and following him . Launching a six-month investigation into his dealings, they discovered he was linked to more than 80 thefts and violent carjackings - valued at £1.1million. Finally, on October 15, 2012, they raided his home and lock-ups across Birmingham and found an 'Aladdin's cave' of chopped up car parts. A court heard Khan, his brother Wajid, 24, and cousin Seyed, 32, sold more than 3,000 parts stripped from the cars to unwitting buyers on the auction site eBay. The trio worked with fellow conspirators Ross and Matthew Dunham to steal vehicles from driveways and car-jack other victims. Khan admitted conspiracy to commit . burglary and handle stolen goods and at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday . and was jailed for seven years. Jailed: Shanwaz Khan, 30, led a ring of carjackers who stole vehicles and sold the parts abroad . Wajid Khan and Seyed Khan, both from Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to handle stolen goods and were both sentenced to 30 months behind bars. Ross, 21, and Matthew Dunham, 24, from Coventry, West Midlands, were jailed for five years and 39 months respectively. After the case Detective Constable Mo Azir, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We meticulously pieced together their network of premises and, when officers raided one unit in Aston, we found an Aladdin’s cave of stolen cars and parts. 'Many of these were high-value luxury cars that had been brutishly ‘chopped’ up, whilst another premises in the city centre was used exclusively to store engines ripped from the stolen cars. 'The scale of their criminal operation was vast and they showed a complete disregard to the trail of destruction and misery left behind to victims of these offences. 'The brazen attitude of Shanwaz Khan was typified by his personalised number plate; this was a clear jibe at the authorities and he believed his underground theft racket was going unnoticed. 'The joke is on him now, though, as he starts a long prison term.' The gang were linked to 82 vehicle thefts during 2012 all but 17 in the West Midlands with Audis and BMWs their favoured marques. They included a petrol station car-jacking at a Total garage when a man was dragged from behind the wheel of his £25,000 Ford Focus ST. And in the early hours of April 27 they stole two Mercedes C-Class from a driveway in having grabbed keys during a break-in, . Late on June 11 they drove off in a Seat Leon from outside a house in Coventry’s Standard Avenue. However, . the owner spotted her car being driven around Coventry on false plates . the next day and later picked Matthew Dunham out as the driver during an . ID procedure.

Wajid Khan (left) and Seyed Khan (right), both from Birmingham, were both sentenced to 30 months in jail . Matthew Dunham (left) was jailed for 39 months, and Ross Dunham (right) was handed a five-year sentence . The court heard Shanwaz Khan was responsible for stripping down cars and storing parts at industrial units across the West Midlands. He also rented space at City Self Storage, in Digbeth, Birmingham, to stash stolen engines before shipping many of them abroad. Det Con Azir added: 'The premises were leased by the Khans using false names and documentation of the cars were stolen to order for engines which the Khans shipped out to the continent. 'All five are subject of on-going Proceeds of Crime Act investigations and we’ll look to seize any assets obtained through criminal activities.'","Shanwaz Khan led a ring that stole cars and shipped parts abroad .

"By . Ray Massey . Driving to Europe on holiday? Well watch out. British motorists face heavy fines if caught on camera committing driving offences on the Continent under a new crackdown by Brussels. The plans could see police across Europe being given the right to access British drivers’ details from the Government’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency for the first time. British motorists face heavy fines if caught on camera committing driving offences on the Continent under a new crackdown by Brussels . This will allow them to chase motorists with GB plates across the Channel for motoring penalties accrued anywhere in the EU. Offences covered include speeding, running a red light and driving while using a mobile phone. Demands for fines would be sent out and, if necessary, pursued through the courts. British drivers can currently be fined for motoring offences in Europe only if stopped by an officer who can issue an on-the-spot penalty or march them to a cashpoint. But anyone driving a car with GB plates which is caught by roadside camera gets off scot-free. Last night, the Department for Transport admitted the crackdown could even extend to transferring penalty points between countries which, in some cases, may lead to a driving ban. The AA said there was already evidence that French police were targeting UK drivers with a disproportionate number of speed cameras on roads to Channel ports . But ministers pledged to ‘resist any changes’ that penalise motorists in Britain, which has the best road safety record in Europe. Motoring groups condemned the move as a ‘nightmare’ that takes no account of differing rules across Europe. The AA . said there was already evidence that French police were targeting UK . drivers with a disproportionate number of speed cameras on roads to . Channel ports. The . clampdown – due to come into force by next May – followed a ruling by . the European Court of Justice, which has overturned a UK opt-out against . such measures. It is subject to a majority vote in the European Parliament and . approval by a majority of the Council of Ministers, which represents . member states. Britain cannot veto the proposals, but only lobby other . members to oppose them. The DfT confirmed the ruling had scuppered the UK opt-out but insisted everything was now ‘subject to renegotiation’. AA . president Edmund King said: ‘Our Government should indeed oppose this . at all costs. It’s a nightmare. It opens up a hornets’ nest. 'There is not a level playing field across Europe in terms of penalties and regulations and levels of enforcement. ‘Here . in Britain we have speed awareness courses for first-time speeders. Other countries don’t. The European Commission, which is drawing up the . new law, said: ‘The measure will also mean UK police forces can collect . fines due from drivers from other parts of Europe.’","British motorists will face heavy fines if caught on camera .

"By . Tom Kelly . The BBC’s chief cricket commentator . has revealed how he offered to take his wife’s terminally ill former . husband abroad to an assisted suicide clinic. Test . Match Special presenter Jonathan Agnew said he would accompany Brian . Dodds to Dignitas in Switzerland after he was diagnosed with motor . neurone disease. Mr Agnew, . 53, said assisted suicide was an ‘extremely sensitive and complex’ moral . issue but believed individuals should be able to choose to die if they . wanted. Life or death decision: Jonathan Agnew, 52, with his wife whose former husband Brian Dodds was seriously ill. Mr Agnew offered to accompany him to the Dignitas Clinic in Switzerland . ‘It was a very short conversation with Brian,’ he said. ‘He just gave me a look and a nod of appreciation that I had made the offer. That was all. Jonathan Agnew with second wife Emma.  He offered to accompany her ex- husband to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland . ‘I did it because I wanted to give him the choice and because I hope that one day, if I am ever in that situation, somebody will make the same offer to me. ‘No pressure, just knowing the possibility is there if I wanted it.’ Mr Agnew had enjoyed a good relationship with Leicester solicitor Mr Dodds, who lost his two-year battle with motor neurone disease in December 2005. The commentator’s second wife Emma had two children with Mr Dodds – Charlotte, 23, and 19-year-old Thomas. But the youngsters were able to remain close to their father thanks to efforts by the Agnews to include Mr Dodds in regular Sunday lunches and even family holidays. Mr Agnew said his wife, a BBC journalist he married in 1996, may not have known about his conversation about assisted suicide with her former husband, but he believed she would have ‘felt the same way’ about it. The former England and Leicestershire cricketer added: ‘I have no idea how I would respond. ‘Like anyone, while I am fit and healthy I will fight to my last breath for life. But if I was suffering with a terminal illness, who knows how I would feel or what I would want? ‘It’s something that is unimaginable until it happens to you and that is why I believe it has to be for that individual to decide what he or she wants to do. ‘If someone you love and care about, . and who is clearly ill and suffering as Brian was, and he knew it was . only going to get worse, I felt it was the right thing that he at least . knew I would help him. 'It’s so hard for people who have to frame legislation and make laws on this subject. It’s a minefield. ‘But until you’re in that situation yourself I think your views are irrelevant.’ More than 200 Britons have died at Dignitas since it was set up  in 1998. The cricket commentator said he had  good relationship with Mr . Dodds who died in December 2005 after a two-year battle with motor neurone disease . Under . guidelines issued by the Crown Prosecution Service in 2010, a person . accompanying someone abroad to commit assisted suicide is unlikely to . face the courts. But the . guidance says a prosecution is ‘more likely to be required’ if the . victim lacked the capacity ‘to reach an informed decision to commit . suicide’. In deciding . whether to take action, police must investigate whether a person was . able to give their consent. A mainstay of Test Match Special on BBC . Radio 4 Live, Mr Agnew last month encouraged his 240,000 Twitter . followers to donate cash to his stepson’s money-raising climb of Mount . Kilimanjaro for the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Earlier . this year he said he wanted to stand up for fathers in broken families . after revealing how the end of his marriage to first wife Beverley . affected his relationship with  his daughters.

Didier Deschamps has filed a civil law suit against Samir Nasri's girlfriend after her foul-mouthed rant about the France boss for his decision to omit the Manchester City midfielder from his World Cup squad. Anara Atanes caused a twitter-storm after tweeting 'F*** France and F*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager'. But, even though she later apologised, Deschamps will be taking legal action against Atanes. VIDEO: Scroll down for Up close and personal with Samir Nasri's girlfriend Anara Atanes . Trouble: Anara Atanes is facing legal action after criticising France coach Didier Deschamps . Apology: The model said she hadn't intended to offend French people, only the football management . Retiring? Nasri is considering his international future after being left out of the squad . French radio station RMC is reporting that Deschamps and the French Football Federation (FFF) have both opened legal proceedings against Atanes, who is an English-born singer from the pop group Fanfare. 'FFF condemns insulting remarks against Didier Deschamps and fully supports his coach in his approach,' read a statement released on Friday. 'The unanimous feedback confirmed that the entire France condemned such remarks. FFF believes that the unanimous indignation is enough to condemn such behaviour.' Atanes had tweeted: 'I apologize if i offended anyone from france, My tweets were not aimed at the nation as a whole,' tweeted the Brighton-born model.

And the 26-year-old, who was also left out of the 2010 World Cup by then-coach Raymond Domenech, told Sky Sports News: 'It's a little bit hard to accept. 'I need to take some time now to think about the national team because it's been twice now that they take away a World Cup from me.

'Sometimes you have the feeling, when you call to speak to the manager and he doesn't want to speak to you, you know you're not going to go to the World Cup. 'It was a shock but I was prepared mentally. I'm okay. 'I respect his choice. He wanted to not pick me... good on him. I wish good luck to the French national team.'

'Samir is an important player for Manchester City but he has not performed that well with France,' he said. 'He is a starter at City, which is not the case with France, and he has made it clear that he is not happy when he is a substitute - and I can tell you it can be felt in the squad.'

"By . Freya Noble . In his latest venture, a serial conman has told young women he could get them weather presenting roles on Channel Nine. Brenton Robert Jarrett, 42, has a long history of pulling similar stunts, and on Monday he pleaded guilty to breaching his bail conditions in an Albury court. It is said his new scam targeted young models aged 17 to 25, and he admitted he had failed to comply with his bail obligations. Jarrett was awaiting a mental health evaluation before he could be sentenced on other charges he also plead guilty to in March. Brenton Robert Jarrett has a history of scams, and has most recently been found to have been contacting young models telling them he could land them weathergirl jobs . The conman, from Howlong NSW, has previously claimed to be the brother and manager of Hollywood star Johnny Depp, actor Skeet Ulrich, and director Alfred Hitchcock's grandson. This time, Jarrett set up a company called DM Productions and said he was part owner in the Nine Network under the fake name of Robert Caine. On the company's website he used images from US photographers to try and prove his credibility. According to The Border Mail, Jarrett advised Albury police on May 10 of his new contact details at DM Productions. Just four days later, officers at Albury were contacted by a concerned member of the modelling industry reporting a man by the name of Robert Caine. 'Caine' had been contacting models over social media and trying to arrange meetings with the women. The industry worker recognised Jarrett from previous exploits, but when confronted the conman said he was 'Jarrett's twin brother', according to ninemsn. He also said 'his brother' committed suicide after he received media attention for previous crimes. Jarrett suffers from bipolar disorder, and his sentencing was adjourned until July 22. Previously, Jarrett told young women he owned a modelling agency - claiming to be Josh Kells from modelling agency Vexus. In March he pleaded guilty to nine counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception and one count of failing to comply with reporting obligations.","Brenton Robert Jarrett has a history of such scams .

Mr Taylor said: 'It all happened so quickly. I braced myself waiting for the safety line to kick in but the next thing I knew I hit the rudder. 'I didn’t know if anyone was looking for me or not - I didn’t know if they’d seen me. I heard nothing. 'I could see someone up the mast. 'Initially I thought it was a good thing because I knew they were looking for me but then I realised it might be a bad thing because it might mean they didn’t know where I was. 'I tried to turn myself so I could see the boat. I kept moving myself round, swimming round so I could see the boat, thinking it would be back really quickly.

It is only the fourth time in the Clipper Race’s 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard. All were recovered. Justin Taylor, the director of the race, praised the efforts of the crew, led by professional skipper Sean McCarter, in recovering Mr Taylor. He said: 'In these conditions a man overboard is swept away from the boat very quickly and visual contact can be lost in the swell. 'We have a well-rehearsed procedure to mark the position, stop racing and engaged the engine to search for and recover the crew member as quickly as possible. 'An hour and a half is a very long time to be in the water in these conditions but a combination of his sea survival training and seven months at sea as well as wearing a life jacket and dry suit will have contributed enormously to his survival.'

"By . Leon Watson . Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, of Rochester, faced accusations in court that he illegally bought guns to shoot and kill members of the U.S. military returning from Iraq . A New York food market owner has been accused of plotting to kill U.S. soldiers returning from action overseas and Muslims from a rival sect over Syria's civil war. Yemeni-born businessman Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, allegedly bought two handguns and two silencers to launch vengeance attacks against U.S. armed forces and Shiites. Elfgeeh, from Rochester, was arrested on Saturday when he tried to buy the firearms from an FBI informant, federal authorities said. He faces two counts of receiving and possessing an unregistered firearm silencer. No plea was entered during a court appearance Monday. Public defender Mark Hosken, who was appointed to handle the case, was not available for comment. The investigation included linking Elfgeeh's home computer to tweets from alias Twitter accounts expressing support for Al Qaida, violent holy war and Sunni insurgent groups in Syria, according to court papers. The FBI gave an informant a Walther PPK .32-caliber handgun and a Glock 26, 9 mm handgun, both with functional silencers affixed to the barrels, two boxes of .32-caliber ammunition, and two boxes of 9-millimeter ammunition, according to the affidavit. Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen who operates Halal Mojo and Food Mart in Rochester, paid the informant $1,050 in the transaction completed on Saturday afternoon and was immediately arrested for possession of the silencers not registered in his name. U.S. Attorney William Hochul said yesterday that Elfgeeh faces 10 years in prison for each silencer and the possibility of a $250,000 fine. Elfgeeh frequently used Twitter to tweet and retweet messages expressing support for various terrorist groups and holy war, seeking donations to assist fighters in Syria, and praising Al Qaida as 'our only savior,' authorities said. According to an FBI affidavit, a government informant taped a December conversation with Elfgeeh in which he stated: 'I'm thinking about doing something here to be honest with you. 'I'm thinking about just go buy a big automatic gun from off the street or something and a lot of bullets and just put on a vest or whatever and just go around and start shooting.' US Marshalls lead Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Yemen, out of Federal Court following a hearing in Rochester, New York . Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen, operates Halal Mojo and Food Mart in Rochester, New York . Authorities said Elfgeeh changed his plans in March to killing returning soldiers, and he said in a taped conversation with an informant that he planned to act alone: 'It could be right now in the daytime, and I could be ... like this guy here or something ... I could just go back and wait for him to when he leave to go to his garage, and just walk up slowly, boom, boom, boom, inside his garage.' When an informant asked him whether he was going to release a video message of his attacks, Elfgeeh responded: 'Once we do five or ten already, 15, something like that ... then we gonna say something,' according to the affidavit. Even though Elfgeeh used the word 'we,' most of his comments indicated he intended to act alone and not immediately. The FBI said it had been investigating Elfgeeh since early last year. In an appearance Monday before a federal magistrate, Elfgeeh was appointed a lawyer from the Federal Public Defender's Office and was sent to Monroe County Jail. A bail hearing has been scheduled for June 16. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, allegedly bought two guns and two silencers .

"By . Sarah Harris . Experts warn children are becoming less able to pick up traditional motor skills as they spend so much time using iPads and other modern technology . Toddlers these days are barely out of nappies before they are playing with touch-screen toys and fiddling with iPads. And now, it seems, they are paying the price – because when they arrive at nursery they are apparently struggling to pick up basic fine-motor skills such as holding pencils, pens and crayons. Some nurseries have installed interactive ‘smartboards’, digital cameras and touch-screen computers to try to expose children to gadgets at an early age. One of the learning goals in the . revised Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) is that ‘children recognise . that a range of technology is used in places such as homes and school’. Under a section on Understanding the World, youngsters must also find . out about and ‘identify the uses of everyday technology and use . information and communication technology (ICT) and programmable toys to . support their learning’. Some nurseries have prioritised ICT as a result and ploughed resources into improving their facilities. Jeff Stanford from Asquith Day Nurseries – which has invested £4million in digital technology – defended the move, saying: ‘It makes children comfortable and familiar with the technology and that is extremely useful when they start school.’ But literacy expert Sue Palmer said: ‘I think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in real space and real time, which means three-dimensional experiences. ‘We already have problems with children not being able to hold a pen or pencil. 'But we are giving our kids instant gratification all the time with ICT and it makes it harder for them to persevere with something that takes a while to learn. ‘There is a real fear that too much engagement with this quick-fix technology is making it more difficult for some children to learn how to read and write.’ June O’Sullivan, chief executive of the London Early Years Foundation, . said she is not planning to buy iPads for its 24 nurseries. While some schools and nurseries plough millions into having the latest technologies, some experts suggest children could do with less exposure to modern gadgets . She said: ‘I know some nurseries are investing in iPads for the children . but we are not doing that here at the LEYF. 'iPads are the big thing at . the moment and yet nobody seems to have done much research into them. ‘We know art, music and drama works so why bother with something we don’t know enough about yet?’ And Felicity Marrian, from Iverna Gardens Montessori in London, said: ‘If our children are in fact the most sedentary generation ever, according to the medical authorities, and already spend more time watching television than they do in school, do we really need to add computers and other screen-based devices to the nursery environment?’ A survey of 806 parents and early years staff carried out by website daynurseries.co.uk found that only 26 per cent believed that being exposed to technology actually benefits children in nurseries. Davina Ludlow, director of daynurseries.co.uk, added: ‘Children are increasingly exposed to an overwhelming amount of technology at an early age. ‘The use of iPads in nurseries, which are displacing the traditional methods of learning and playing activities is concerning. ‘This poll shows that the majority of people clearly want to see early education and childhood play protected from this technological creep.’ Ms Palmer who is also the author of Toxic Childhood added:‘I . think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in . real space and real time, which means three dimensional experiences.","More children are struggling to use pencils, pens and crayons .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A 7-year-old California boy's fight for survival against a cancer rarely seen in children faces even worse odds than most thanks to his mixed Asian and European heritage. Baylor Fredrickson's family is desperately seeking a needle in a haystack donor whose bone marrow matches their ailing son's, something his mother says is 'worse than a 70,000 to 1 shot.' Now the boy's family is in a race against time as they scramble to get all the eligible half Japanese/half German individuals tested for their suitably to be donors that they possibly can before time runs out.

Searching: Baylor faces unusually rough odds in his battle because bone marrow donation is far more complicated than blood donation, especially for mixed race people like him . Baylor suffers from acute myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer that's rarely seen in people under 45. He is now in his second round of chemotherapy to buy him time as family and friends set up bone marrow registry drives across the Bay Area in hopes they'll find a match. 'Since Baylor is Japanese & German mixed race, he will most likely need a donor who is also mixed race, Asian & Caucasian. #HAPA,' reads one of the flyers on Facebook advertising the many donor events. Still, the Fredricksons face an uphill battle. Baylor's . mother Nihei Fredrickson explained to the Contra Costa Times: 'Finding a . donor is nothing like matching blood types. bone marrow is EXTREMELY . complex. it has to do with antigens/proteins which are located on the . surface of the blood cell (also known as ""markers""). a 10/10 marker . match is a perfect match.' Unfortunately . for people like Baylor, nonprofits like the Asian American Donor . Program have had to fight for years to try and increase awareness of . organ and tissue donation for and within minority groups. According to Fredrickson, the test for potential donors is easy and pain free. Hopefully . for her son, Mrs. Fredrickson's message will continue to help get half . Japanese, half German donors to testing drives. 'It's a long road,' Fredrickson told the Contra Costa Times. 'A road a second-grader should not have to go through.'

"Officials at a Utah high school who digitally added sleeves to students' tank tops and erased one girl's tattoo in yearbook photos they deemed to be too sexy have apologized. Wasatch High School administrators in recent days offered at least one student the chance to return her yearbook for a refund. But some say they want to keep the memento of their stance against a policy they say singled out some students. Others say they're eager to move past the ordeal and on with summer vacation, which began Friday. Altered: Wasatch High School sophomore Shelby Baum, 16, points to yearbook proof, left, and her altered school yearbook photo, right . Tattoo: Baum points to her tattoo, which was edited out of the yearbook photo . District officials declined to comment Tuesday, pointing to their statement last week acknowledging error in doctoring pictures of some students but not others who were similarly dressed. Wasatch High School is in Heber City, about 40 miles outside Salt Lake City. The faculty came under fire last week when students cracked their yearbooks to find Photoshop had been used to censor photos deemed too sexy. The school altered the images of certain students to show less skin without them knowing about it. When the students received the much anticipated yearbook, they were shocked to see they appear to be wearing a different outfit. Some complained, and said they felt upset that the decision to alter the photos were not made consistently. Angry: Wasatch High School sophomore Kimberly Montoya, left, and Rachel Russell, right, both had sleeves added to their tank tops . Refund: Wasatch High School administrators in recent days offered at least one student the chance to return her yearbook for a refund . 'I feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who,' Sophomore Rachel Russel told KSTU-TV last week. 'There were plenty of girls (who) were wearing thicker tank tops and half of them got edited and half of them didn't.' Russel's original picture showed her wearing a sleeveless top. But the version seen in the yearbook has black sleeves added on. Sophomore . Kimberly Montoya added: 'My shirt was a cream color, and the color of . the cover-up was completely white. It looked like white-out on my skin.' The apparently random editing process is what angered the girls the most. In . one case, according to the TV station, two different girls were wearing . nearly identical tops but only one was altered to add sleeves while the . other was printed as it was. A Utah high school has used Photoshop to censor its yearbook photos because it deemed some female students' pictures too sexy .

School administrators said the yearbook couldn't be changed after printing. Wasatch County School District Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker later defended the decision to edit images for modesty. He claimed students knew the dress code and there was a sign warning them that their pictures may be altered. However, Shoemaker admits the school should have taken a more consistent approach. 'We only apologize in the sense that we want to be more consistent with what we're trying to do in that sense we can help kids better prepare for their future by knowing how to dress appropriately for things,' Shoemaker said. The school district dress code's ban on 'extreme clothing' lists 'revealing shorts, skirts, dresses, tank shirts, halter or crop tops, spaghetti straps, etc.'","Wasatch High School in Utah altered the images of certain female students to show less skin without them knowing about it .

'Many human activities reached take-off points sometime in the mid-20th Century and sharply accelerated towards the end of the century.  These shots are a tool to raise awareness - I think we have a duty to remain optimistic in our hearts,' says Pharand, a director of environmental group Globaia.

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's attempts at maintaining a friendly rivalry are well and truly over after the German's controversial victory at the Monaco Grand Prix resulted in a podium ceremony laced with barely-disguised contempt. Hamilton believes Rosberg was guilty of underhand tactis in order to beat him in Monte Carlo, but if so he is only following in the footsteps of many of F1's all-time legends. But as the pair's boss at Mercedes - the great Niki Lauda, no less - said: ‘You have to be a b****** if you want to win in Formula One.' Here, we remember F1's ultimate b******* (who also happen to be hugely successful). Just look at his face: Lewis Hamilton (left) was clearly furious at Nico Rosberg (centre) in Monte Carlo . MICHAEL SCHUMACHER . Formula One’s ultimate anti-hero, with his thin-lipped smile. The most significant black marks against his reputation were his crashes with title rivals Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve in the deciding races of the 1994 and 1997 seasons. But perhaps his lowest act of skulduggery was parking on the racing line at Rascasse to deny Fernando Alonso pole position at Monaco in 2006. He had ice in his veins, never more so that putting the car on pole at San Marino in the spring of 2003. He went back to see his seriously ill mother Elisabeth that evening in Germany and returned back to race. By the time he started, she had died – but he still won. Always controversial: Michael Schumacher reacts before and after qualifying in Monaco in 2006 . Underhand: Schumacher and Damon Hill crash in Melbourne in 1994 as the German sealed his first world title . NELSON PIQUET . For sheer rudeness nobody, surely, can match Piquet. He called Nigel Mansell, his 1986 and 1987 Williams team-mate, ‘an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife.’ He dismissed Enzo Ferrari as ‘senile’ and asked whether he or Ayrton Senna (whom he had previously insinuated was gay) was a better driver, replied: ‘I’m still alive.’ Rude and crafty: Nelson Piquet (right), with Frank Williams and Nigel Mansell at Brands Hatch in 1986 . He could also be crafty. He kept secret from Mansell the fact he was using a new differential, which helped him win the 1986 Hungarian Grand Prix. Years later, he was involved in disclosing Renault’s part in Crashgate – the fixed race in Singapore – involving his son Nelson Jnr, who hardly lacked confidence himself. FERNANDO ALONSO . Alonso is synonymous with ruthlessness in modern Formula One. The ‘most complete driver’ is a kinder way of putting it. Even in his championship-winning years at Renault he was tetchy if Giancarlo Fisichella, an ideal No 2, was ever perceived to be given even half-favourable treatment. This trait continued at McLaren, where he joined the rookie Lewis Hamilton. There must be some sympathy for Alonso, for Hamilton was a product of the team’s development programme and the darling of the sport. But there was no excuse for snitching to the FIA about McLaren’s role in Spygate because he was denied outright No 1 status. And what about Crashgate, the Singapore race he won after his team-mate Nelson Piquet Jnr crashed? He knew nothing about the team orders... or so he said. 'Crashgate': Nelson Piquet Jnr deliberately wrecked his Renault under team orders in Singapore in 2008 . Butter wouldn't melt: Fernando Alonso (centre) was the chief beneficiary, winning the race after a safety car . NIKI LAUDA . The rat-featured Austrian was a clever and meticulous driver. He said of his relations with Alain Prost at McLaren: ‘I hated the guy. Honestly. He’s a difficult character. 'Let’s put it that way. When he started to blow me off all the time in practice, because he was better at handling this 1200hp thing than I was, I changed my strategy. But I never told him any more what I was doing to the car. If I was more clever setting up my car why should I give him the advantage of it?’ And who was in charge of Mercedes when they sneaked in an extra tyre test last year? The old calculating Niki Lauda. All for show: Niki Lauda and Alain Prost appeared united on the podium at Estoril in 1984, but all was not well . JAMES HUNT . A different kind of b******. ‘Master James’ was the usually debonair, sometimes boorish British icon. But he cannot be left off the list: the sheer scale of his hedonism is too great to ignore. At times it was amazing that he could even drive straight such was the cocktail of excess he had taken the night before. Sometimes he could not, and his spin at Brands Hatch during the British Grand Prix was one such occasion. Hash, cocaine, acid or alcohol may have had something to do with it. At other moments he had a queue of British Airways stewardesses outside his door. He was ruthless and brave, characteristics that made him drive through the rain to win the 1976 title. Ladies' man: James Hunt with his first wife, Suzy Miller, in 1974 (left) and partying with Barry Sheene (right) AYRTON SENNA . When Lewis Hamilton threatened to 'take a leaf out of Senna's book' ahead of Sunday's race, he could have been referring to a number of incidents involving the ruthless and calculated three-times World Champion. Indeed, for all his brilliance behind the wheel of a Formula One car, Senna could be quite callous in the cockpit, displaying a win-at-all-costs mentality which the sport had never seen before. The most damning came at Suzuka in 1990 when Senna, aggrieved with starting from pole on the dirty side of the track, rammed his great rival Alain Prost off at the very first corner in order to win the title. Senna explaining away his behaviour replied simply: 'I am Senna'. Ruthless: Ayrton Senna takes out Prost at the Japanese Grand Prix in 1990 to clinch the world championship . LEWIS HAMILTON . There is an air of entitlement to Lewis. That was clear in the concocted evidence he gave to the stewards in Australia in the incident known as 'Lie-gate', even if the team told him what lines to say. But his most gross act of bad behaviour was tweeting confidential McLaren telemetry. A firmer boss than Martin Whitmarsh would have severely reprimanded him or even sacked him. As well as this, he complained bitterly about McLaren's strategy at Monaco in 2007, his rookie year, saying: 'I'm not a No 2.' Fast forward seven years and we learned that he ignored team orders not to put on the overtaking mode during the closing stages of the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this month. Naughty boy. Painted smiles: Alonso and Hamilton were team-mates at McLaren in 2007 but soon fell out . SEBASTIAN VETTEL . The German became a pantomime villain last season after he was jeered and taunted en route to his record-breaking fourth consecutive title. The ill-feeling surrounded his conduct at the Malaysian Grand Prix - a race in which he ruthlessly ignored an order from his team - that of 'Multi 21' - to hold station behind Mark Webber. Despite the outpouring of negativity towards him, Vettel said he would be prepared to ignore team orders again: 'I'm not sure I can give a proper answer because in the moment it might be different but I would probably do the same.' Civil war: Sebastian Vettel (left) didn't play fair with former Red Bull team-mate Mark Webber (right) NICO ROSBERG . The more cerebral type of b******? With his Germanic iciness, five languages and engineering background, he is the sort of villain who strokes a white cat on his lap. The only problem with his inclusion is that we don't know for sure that he meant deliberately to disrupt Hamilton's flying lap at Monaco last weekend. If it was planned, it was the perfect crime, for the stewards cleared him and he drove on to win. Either way, he is working hard to find an engineering edge over Hamilton. That is ruffling Hamilton; Rosberg is unperturbed. Did he mean it? Rosberg took pole position in Monaco last weekend after a controversial aborted lap . ALAIN PROST . The pint-sized professor had sights on winning world titles, not friends. Paranoid with fear that his own McLaren team were conspiring against him to win the 1989 title, he appeared to cause a deliberate collision with rival Senna at the decisive race in Japan. Prost jumped out of his car only to watch Senna win the race and the championship. Prost paid a visit to see his countryman, ally and FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre and Senna was later stripped of the victory, a loophole in the regulations deemed Senna had re-joined the track illegally. Prost was subsequently crowned champion.

"By . Kirk Maltais . and Lydia Warren . The FBI has announced a nationwide manhunt for a San Francisco man after a raid on his apartment allegedly produced a cache of explosive materials and chemicals. Authorities have released a photo of Ryan Chamberlain, 42 - who they say is considered armed and dangerous - as part of their search, but they have not elaborated on the nature of the investigation. Chamberlain is a self-proclaimed 'political junkie' who had worked as a music writer before switching to public relations - although one friend said he had 'got weird' after losing a job last year. The FBI say there is a chance Chamberlain may have rigged his car - a white 2008 Nissan Altima  with Texas or California license plate numbers 7FQY085 or BX9M042 - with explosive devices. Scroll down for video . 'Armed and dangerous': Ryan Kelly Chamberlain, II, is being sought by the FBI after explosive materials were found in his San Francisco apartment during a raid. They warned that he could be dangerous until announcing Monday that he's no longer a public threat . He was last . seen driving in south San Francisco wearing a navy hoodie and is . described as being 6 feet 3 inches, weighing approximately 225 pounds, . with blue eyes and brown hair. Authorities said anyone who sees Chamberlain should call 911 rather than approach him. 'We believe he is alone in the vehicle but we just don't know, again, where his ties or his network is so we ask that any members of the public be on the lookout for anyone that matches this man's description,' FB spokesman Peter Lee said outside the FBI headquarters on Sunday. The . alert was issued after the FBI showed up to Chamerlain's apartment, . located in the Russian Hill neighborhood, at 9am Saturday, with a search . warrant. Chamberlain did not answer the door. Authorities remained at the scene, and a hazmat team arrived to enter . the one-bedroom apartment. They remained on the scene well into the . evening, returning again on Sunday. Search: A hazmat crew searches Chamberlain's home on Saturday as part of a criminal investigation. The chemicals found in the apartment were not revealed as of Monday evening . Probe: Emergency services outside Chamberlain's apartment. Authorities were on the scene all weekend . Discovery: The back patio and sliding glass windows to Ryan Chamberlain's apartment at 1609 Jackson St in Russian Hill. The apartment remained sealed after FBI agents carried out a raid . According to ABC7, . who was on scene throughout the day, the hazmat team extracted a . toolbox from the apartment. Equipment such as x-rays and a bomb disposal . robot were used. Later in the evening, a loud bang was heard at the scene. Despite this, authorities did not evacuate residents from the surrounding apartments. 'There is no risk to public safety,' the FBI told ABC7. 'The protective equipment that you see is for agent safety.' Chamberlain may have bought the chemical off the Internet, the FBI told NBC Bay Area. Residents inside of the apartment complex also told the station that FBI agents took at least two computers from Chamberlain's apartment. More than a dozen bags of evidence were reportedly taken from the apartment. Chamberlain was described by a neighbor as 'a quiet guy, nice enough.' His boss at a music rights consultancy group said he last contacted her Friday to remind her to deposit his paycheck at a new bank account. Brooke . Wentz said the conversation was uneventful and that she was . 'tremendously dumbfounded' that the contractor she hired to handle her . company's social media accounts was a wanted man. 'He's a nice guy,' Wentz told The Associated Press. She . said it didn't seem like Chamberlain was staying in the apartment on . Jackson Street because when she mailed him his paycheck in April, he . told her he would have to go and collect it. She . said he seemed under financial pressure because he told her that two . friends who were leasing his apartment left without telling him and he . had to scramble to pay for two rentals. 'I . wondered what kind of friends would do something like that? I tried to . ask him about the situation but he was kind of evading my question,' Wentz said. Alex Clemens, founder of San Francisco's Barbary Coast Consulting, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Chamberlain had worked on numerous political campaigns. 'I'm . worried about the guy,' he said. 'I'm hoping this ends without anybody . getting hurt. I'm flabbergasted that this seems to be taking place.' No longer a threat: A picture of Ryan Chamberlain, a man in his 30s, found on his Twitter and Facebook pages. Chamberlain was the subject of an FBI manhunt after authorities found explosives in his home, but he's no longer considered a public threat . Wanted: Chamberlain, pictured with friends, worked as a music and sports writer before getting into PR . Questions: Another image shows him laying on top of a friend. His boss told reporters that he had said a couple of friends had just moved out of his apartment, leaving him to cover their rent . But . acquaintances also said that Chamerlain struggled after losing his job . at Project Sport, a marketing company where he worked with professional . athletes, last November. Friend Randy Bramblett . Randy . Bramblett, a professional cyclist and personal trainer who met . Chamberlain through his work at the company, said that he 'got weird' after losing his job. 'The . thing is, there was a lot of strange behavior since November,' Bramblett said. 'He stopped answering his phone. I think he became an . extreme introvert.' He added: 'I've never seen him be violent, ever, but I would definitely say that maybe emotionally and mentally he was a little unstable.' Authorities . have been quiet on the exact nature of the investigation, although they . have said that Chamberlain is wanted for possessing explosives in his . home and that he acted alone. But they would not say what type of explosives were found at the apartment, nor how he came into possession of it.

"By . Kirk Maltais . Parents and children in Monroe, Michigan are protesting as a eight-grade teacher remains suspended from his job following a history lesson which included the subject of the use of blackface in entertainment during the 1800s. Alan Barron, 59, was placed on paid administrative leave two weeks ago after an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School sat in on Barron's lesson about Jim Crow racial segregation laws. As part of the lesson, Barron showed the class a video about the use of blackface by white performers of the time to imitate African Americans. The administrator objected to the video, and Barron, a teacher for 36 years in Monroe, was suspended. He is currently two weeks shy of his planned retirement. Alan Barron, 59, was suspended two weeks ago for showing his class a video about the use of blackface in the entertainment of the 1800s. Parents and students are protesting the decision of the school district, and are seeking for him to be allowed to return . Parents and students are speaking out about Barron's suspension, many defending his character as well as his choice of lesson plan. 'She was more offended that they stopped the video,' Adrienne Aaron, mother to one of the students in the classroom, told The Monroe News about her daughter's reaction to seeing the video. 'It had nothing to do with racism.' said Aaron, whose husband is African American. 'History is history. We need to educate our kids to see how far we’ve come in America. How is that racism?' Many other students and parents took to Facebook to voice their dissatisfaction over Barron's suspension. Commenting on the local news' post about the issue, the outcry was nearly unanimous in it's support for Barron. 'We want you back Mr. Barron' wrote Cody Leach, a student of Barron's . that posted with the hashtag '#freemrbarron'. He also posted a picture . of a t-shirt made with the hashtag printed on it.

So now it's offensive to teach the truth?' wrote Rita Page Thompson, a resident of Ann Arbor, Michigan, in another comment. 'Would the administration have preferred that the subject matter be totally ignored?' Some residents of Monroe have move forward with voicing their displeasure with Barron's suspension, organizing an event called 'Reinstate Mr. Barron immediately!' The event currently has over 200 people RSVP'd to attend. 'As a parent of past students of Mr. Barron's, I am appalled with the . Monroe County school district.' wrote Angela Neill, another resident of Monroe, on the event's page. 'They should be ashamed of themselves. It . is a sad day when you blemish the record of one of the best teachers . Monroe has to offer, just before his retirement.' As a result of his suspension, Barron is barred from attending district functions, which includes a banquet to honor retiring teachers. The school district would not comment on the issue, a spokesman for the district refusing to confirm that Barron had been suspended and instead saying that he was 'on leave.'","Alan Barron, 59, was placed on administrative leave after showing students video about the use of blackface by white entertainers during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation .

"By . David Mccormack . A man wrongfully convicted of killing a New Orleans woman in 1979 has been released from prison after prosecutors acknowledged serious police misconduct. Reginald Adams has spent the past 34 . years in jail after being convicted of killing Cathy Ulfers, the wife of . a New Orleans police officer. He claims he only confessed to the crime because police had given him drugs and alcohol and then subjected him to a four-hour interrogation. Free man: Reginald Adams, 61, stands on the steps of New Orleans' Criminal District Court on Monday after a judge reversed his conviction on a charge of second-degree murder in the 1979 death of a policeman's wife . ‘I'm just ready to go. Trying to build me a life. After 34 years, I don't even know how to use a cell phone,’ Reginald Adams told WWLTV following his release on Monday. Prosecutors have now acknowledged that his confession was inconsistent with the physical evidence. The Innocence Project New Orleans reached out to the district attorney's office last week after discovering a supplemental police report linking two other suspects, a weapon and stolen jewelry to the murder. On Monday, District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro dropped the murder case, apologizing to Adams both personally and for the misconduct of police and prosecutors who oversaw the case. District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro dropped the murder case on Monday and then apologized to Adams both personally and for the misconduct of police and prosecutors who oversaw the case . ‘If he had been in possession of the supplemental report that was concealed from his attorneys, he would have likely been acquitted,’ said Cannizzaro. Assistant District Attorneys Ronald Bodenheimer and Harold Gilbert prosecuted the case based entirely on the confession and claimed that the murder weapon was never recovered. Cannizzaro said, Bodenheimer and Gilbert ‘were fully aware of the additional suspects as well as the recovery of the murder weapon and other physical evidence and that their handling of this case amounts to intentional prosecutorial misconduct.’ The cases against the two suspects linked to the murder were dropped by the district attorney at the time.

"By . David Mccormack . Scroll down for video . A retired LAPD detective, who has claimed for years that his father was responsible for the infamous Black Dahlia murder, has unveiled fresh new evidence which he says links his dad to as many as ten other unsolved Hollywood murders from the 1940s. Since retiring as a cop, Steve Hodel has written about unsolved crimes and it was in his 2003 book Black Dahlia Avenger, that he first made the claims that his father George Hodel, a doctor, was the killer. In November 2012, Hodel was able to visit his childhood home in L.A. with a cadaver dog who picked up faint traces of human remains in four locations in the basement. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Retired LAPD detective Steve Hodel, who has claimed for years that his father was responsible for the infamous Black Dahlia murder, has unveiled fresh evidence which he says links his dad to as many as ten other unsolved Hollywood murders from the 1940s . Now chemical analysis of soil taken from the home has added further support to Hodel’s suspicions about his late father. ‘I see him as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,’ Hodel told NBCLA. ‘Unfortunately, the monster, Mr. Hyde, was stronger and over-ruled the good.’ He believes his father may well have been a serial killer responsible for as many as 10 long-unsolved slayings of young women in Los Angeles in the 1940s. Since retiring, Hodel has devoted his time to researching unsolved crimes in which he believes his father may have been involved. Sowden House, the potential murder scene and Dr George Hodel, who was a suspect in the original investigation and who Steve Hodel believes is responsible for the murder of the Black Dahlia and others . After his father’s death in 1991, Hodel came across evidence that he believe implicated his dad in the . infamous 1947 dismemberment murder of Elizabeth . Short - aka the Black Dahlia. George . Hodel was one of countless suspects in the high profile . murder case. The police even planted a listening bug at the distinctive Sowden House in the . Hollywood foothills, where the family lived. Transcripts reveal that . detectives heard Hodel discussing the Dahlia case at one point, while another . time they picked up noises from the basement which sounded like a woman being . attacked. Hodel’s father fled to Asia in the late 1940s, leaving his family behind. Steve . Hodel had long believed that his father committed murders in or . near the house, and in some cases buried the remains nearby. While Elizabeth . Short’s remains were all accounted for, Hodel has a list of unsolved murder victims that he believes his father could have killed. Black Dahlia: The body of Elizabeth Short had been severed at the waist and completely drained of blood, her face had also been slashed from the corners of her mouth toward her ears . Steve Hodel believes actress Jean Spangler, left, may have been a victim of his 'serial killer' father, while forensic anthropologist Arpad Vass, says the samples taken from the Hodel residence could be from the same time period . Top of his list is the actress Jean Spangler, then 26, who vanished in 1949. Her body was never found, although her purse was discovered not far from the Hodel home. A note inside hinted that she . was considering having an abortion, then illegal. Dr. Hodel was one of the . few physicians who then performed abortions in Los Angeles. In his research, Steve Hodel discovered that Spangler and his father had a . mutual friend. In November 2012, Hodel, together with retired police Sgt. Paul Dostie and Buster, a Labrador retriever trained to detect the . unique smell of human composition, visited his childhood home. Once . let loose, Buster quickly established four locations in the basement . where he could pick up a faint trace of human remains. Steve Hodel, right, with cadaver dog handler Paul Dostie, and Buster, searched the Sowden/Franklin House at 5121 Franklin Ave., Hollywood for evidence in November 2012 . The basement had never been finished and since the floor was still dirt, soil samples were taken. According . to forensic anthropologist Arpad Vass, PhD, a pioneer in chemical . analysis of human decomposition, those samples are 'consistent' with . Steve Hodel's theory of homicide victims buried in shallow graves 70-80 . years ago. 'The soil . came up positive for human remains because there are a number of human . specific markers,' said Vass from his laboratory in Oak Ridge, . Tennessee. Hodel would like . to search further for the human remains, but has been unable to get . permission to go onto the privately owned hillside. The shocking murder of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, is one of the oldest unsolved murder cases in Los Angeles history. On Jan. 15, 1947, Short's severely mutilated body was discovered in a vacant lot near the intersection of 39th Street and Norton Avenue in South Los Angeles. The body had been severed at the waist and completely drained of blood. Her face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth toward her ears, creating an effect known as a ‘Glasgow smile’. Not long before her death, Short was arrested in Santa Barbara for underage drinking and this police mugshot was taken . Short, 22, also had multiple cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been removed. The body had been washed and cleaned and had been ‘posed’ with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread. The gruesome murder generated masses of media interest at the time. The newspapers of the day, which had a habit of nicknaming colorful crimes, started referring to Short as the Black Dahlia after the then popular film The Blue Dahlia. To add to the case’s sense of mystery and intrigue, both LAPD officials and newspaper editors received taunting notes believed to be from Short's killer. The Los Angeles District Attorney office drew up a list of 25 people it considered viable suspects, although as many as 60 people have confessed to the murder at one time or another. Elizabeth Short's mutilated body was found in a vacant lot near a busy intersection on the southwest section of L.A. in 1947 . In his 2003 book ‘Black Dahlia Avenger,’ Steve Hodel first made the claim that his father, a doctor, was responsible for the murder. George Hodel had been a suspect in the original case and investigators had even planted a bug in the house to listen for incriminating admissions. But before authorities brought charges, Dr. Hodel abruptly abandoned his family and relocated to Asia. He died in 1991. Steve Hodel believes his father killed the Black Dahlia at the family’s then home, the distinctive Sowden House in Hollywood, which is largely unchanged and looks the same as it did at the time of the murder. Hodel was also able to establish that he and his siblings had been away with their mother at that time.","Steve Hodel believes his father was responsible for as many as ten unsolved Hollywood murders from the 1940s .

"By . Anthony Bond . For more than a decade, families with young children have swam in the disused quarry known as the Blue Lagoon, attracted by its tropical-looking water. But despite its appearance, the water held a dangerous secret - it is almost as toxic as bleach. Now, in a bid to prevent people from bathing in  the disused quarry at Harpur Hill, near Buxton, Derbyshire, the council has taken the incredible step of dying it black. Dangerous: This disused quarry in Derbyshire - known as the Blue Lagoon - has been dyed black to prevent people from swimming in it . Damaging: Parents and children have swam in the waters of the Blue Lagoon for more than a decade. But the water is almost as toxic as bleach . Tropical: This picture shows how the Blue Lagoon looked before it was turned black . The water, which has a pH level of 11.3, is so dangerous it could cause fungal infection such as thrush, skin complaints and severe stomach problems. Signs also warn swimmers that the water contains car wrecks, dead animals, excrement and rubbish. However, when the weather warms up, swimmers largely ignore the warnings - prompting the drastic action to transform its colour. Local business owner Rachel Thomas said she thought changing the colour of the quarry water has already made a difference. Grim: The water also contains car wrecks, dead animals, excrement and rubbish . Mess: Rubbish bottles are pictured surrounding the waters of The Blue Lagoon . Hazardous: This warning sign was placed near the Blue Lagoon, but some swimmers still decided to take to the dangerous water . Ms . Thomas said: 'It’s not pretty any more. They don’t think they’re on . holiday in the Bahamas any more, they know they’re in Harpur Hill. 'It was absolutely beautiful to look at but was horrendously dangerous.' The incredible blue colouring of the . water is caused by the surrounding limestone rocks which leach calcite . crystals into the water, turning it turquoise. Worrying: Many signs warn people against entering the water. But despite this swimmers often ignore the advice during warmer weather . Unpleasant: This sign also details some of the nasty health problems which people can pick-up from swimming in the water . The . alkalinity comes from calcium oxide, a white powder which would have . originally been left around the site as a by-product of the quarrying . process.

A High Peak Borough Council spokeswoman said the pool contained vehicle parts, 'all sorts of rubbish' and warned that the water temperature was 'extremely cold'.","Families have been swimming in the Blue Lagoon for decades .

"By . Mark Ellen . There were three main bands at Oxford in 1974. There was Bluebird, who were studious types, and two vaguely political units known as Flying Wedge and Frothy Green Stools. Attend any Left-leaning party or banner-filled occupation of a university building and it would be announced that the Wedge or the Stools were about to entertain. All of them had a few numbers they’d written themselves, so I had a crack at this caper and discovered it was harder than I’d imagined. In a fortnight my song catalogue had only three entries — a weak, twinkly thing called The Invisible Girl, a challenging rant called Sombrero Fallout and a fey and ineffectual dirge called I’m Flying (And You Are The Sky). Rockin' politico: Tony Blair (left) and his friend Alan Collenette outside the Vineyard in Richmond in 1972. Mr Blair is showiong his bohemian side by eschewing shoes . For one sparkling moment I thought they were classics and saw myself performing them in a halo of soft lighting, but when I tried one out on the Chilswell Road commune they suggested I stick to the bass. But the best possible thing happened: an old school friend called Adam dropped by to say he’d formed a band that wanted to play covers and they hadn’t got a bass guitarist. He had a beard and a mop of blond, shaggy hair and something shy and shrugging about him. ‘What are you called?’ I wondered. ‘Ugly Rumours,’ he shrugged. ‘Why?’ ‘Because . . .’ and he gave me a quizzical look as if my knowledge of rock’s outer reaches fell shamefully short of the mark ‘. . . because if you hold the cover of the Grateful Dead’s From The Mars Hotel album upside-down in a mirror, the shapes in the stars spell the words “Ugly Rumors”. So we’re Ugly Rumors,’ he shrugged, ‘but in English.’ Loose band rehearsals took place in somebody’s flat. Adam played rhythm guitar and brought some Harp lager. Jim played the drums and had a fur coat and a chipped front tooth and never surfaced till ‘Cool O’clock’. Al was the frontman, a proper lead guitarist with a knotted scarf, studded biker jacket and a flailing curtain of hennaed hair. He lived in Alma Place, off Cowley Road, which he referred to as Astral Space. They never lose it: Tony Blair plays the guitar with pupil Andrew Cragg (right), 15, on saxophone on a visit to Hartlepool . We all had Cuban-heeled cowboy boots and spent a rackety afternoon trying to master Long Train Running by Californian weed-enthusiasts the Doobie Brothers and Live With Me by the Rolling Stones. Within a month we’d cobbled together a set and played a couple of parties but nobody fancied singing. We took it in turns but this demanding activity interfered with the main point of being in any group which was posing expansively, waving at girls and wedging lighted ciggies under the top of your guitar strings like Keith Richards. Ugly Rumours needed someone out front. My friend Anji had an old mate at St John’s College called Tony Blair, who’d managed a band and appeared in revue shows, so we asked him to audition. ‘Audition’ was pitching it a bit high and the moment he arrived, wearing the same boots as we had, he’d effectively got the job. He had a folk-rock look — long hair with a fringe — and was keen, organised, quite posh, very funny and started a lot of sentences with the word ‘guys’. We’d sent him the set-list so he’d been up half the night with his ear pressed to a speaker transcribing the words and breezed in waving sheaves of handwritten lyrics. ‘Guys,’ he said, ‘great selection! Where’s the name from, Ugly Rumours?’ Docked four points: imagine not knowing that. There was some tutting and Adam had to fill him in. ‘Any chance of doing I Don’t Want To Talk About It by Crazy Horse?’ Tony wondered. This was impressive: only the most insanely confident singer of a college rock band would dare suggest a ballad, let alone an obscure one. The audition got under way, two acoustic guitars, an unamplified bass, an upturned wastepaper basket and Tony emoting into a microphone that wasn’t plugged in. He sang in high, fruity tones with the odd Jagger move thrown in. We signed him up and charged off to The Bear pub in Alfred Street to drink to our glorious future. The five-piece Ugly Rumours began appearing on the party circuit, Al perfecting his gale-force solos and Tony adopting a courageous hoop-necked top that revealed several square inches of bare torso. The only tensions were the do-you-tuck-your-flares-into-your-cowboy-boots debates seconds before showtime, and the irritating sight of pretty girls gathered round the central mike-stand. ‘Guys, guys.’ Tony called us together after one show. ‘We’re OK and everything but we could be so much better if we rehearsed!’ His level of enthusiasm was high even by my standards, and this was exceptionally keen. We played at a ball organised for the satirical Strumpet student magazine. Nobody threw anything, radical folk in suede shoes and military jackets clapped quite loudly and this whole ball business clearly got to Tony. ‘Listen, guys, you know these college balls that are 20 guineas a pop and have funfairs and slightly second-rate groups like Caravan, right? Why don’t we do an alternative one? Pints of beer, quid to get in, Ugly Rumours top of the bill?’ The Corpus Christi Alternative College Ball was held on a cloudless June evening. Anji (Hunter who went on to become Blair’s office ‘gatekeeper’ in Downing Street) wore a billowy blue frock and a felt hat. Blair's gatekeeper: Anji Hunter. She had an old mate at St John¿s College called Tony Blair, who¿d managed a band and appeared in revue shows, so he was asked him to audition . The ticket included three bands, tins of lager, wine from bottles with plastic stoppers and saucers of Twiglets and Smarties. In an attempt to be ‘far out’ we’d booked a string quartet to open the show — long-haired girls in flowing dresses — then a trad jazz band of old duffers in their 40s wearing straw hats and striped blazers. The idea was you could watch this cheesy, toe-tapping fare from the terrace while gearing up for the white heat of Ugly Rumours. The crowd thought differently. Two minutes’ exposure to these brass-edged stompers and they were hurling themselves about in riotous abandon, blokes in Indian shirts jiving uncontrollably and girls cantering down the little paths among the flower-beds. They were going to be a hard act to follow. Musical mates: Tony Blair and Boomtown Rats lead singer Bob Geldof . My heart was pounding as we stood and watched. I looked at the five of us, a great heap of split-ends and fag ash in our skinny T-shirts and giant trousers. Apart from Jim, we all had bare feet. We padded out nervously into the setting sun, squashing burning Marlboros into our guitar necks and placing bottles of warm Blue Nun on the top of our amps. The cowbell started up for Honky Tonk Women. We cranked up the riff and gave Tony the nod and he burst from behind a hedge doing his now fairly polished Jagger impression — low-slung flares, bare midriff, one hand on a hip, the other wagging a cautionary finger, elbows flapping like a chicken. A couple of camp handclaps above his head and he pulled the microphone from its stand.‘Well awwwrright Corpus Christi Alternative College Ball, how are ya?’ They were fine, thanks, but a bit danced-out by the jazz band. ‘Are you ready for some rock ’n’ roll?’ Possibly, but they had to get their breath back first. And that beer wasn’t going to drink itself. We gave it our best shot but the moment had passed. No matter how much Al threw his hair about, or Tony said ‘Awwwrright!’, or Jim whacked his cowbell while looking cool and distant, or Adam grinned bashfully and stamped on his effects pedals, we couldn’t fill the lawn like the boater-sporting jazzers. Tony knew it, too, and made an announcement I don’t remember discussing in the pre-gig huddle.‘Guys, we’re going to try something different, OK?’ The crowd lowered their lager cans. ‘We’re going to bring on the string quartet for a jam . . .’ Scattered applause. ‘. . . and let’s have a big hand for our brilliant jazz band, too. Come on back up, guys!’ Mass jubilant shrieks of delight. What the hell was this? In the interests of creating an ‘alternative happening’, we were now lumbered with six pensionable goons in cricket blazers who were far better musicians than we were. It’s after events like that, in the long sleepless hours of dawn, that even the most deluded would-be rock god in a college covers act tends to take a long, hard look at himself and ask some tough but quite reasonable questions. Such as this: if I was the least talented member of the fourth- best covers group at a university, how was I ever going to make it as a musician? Whatever uncertain paths lay ahead of the five of us, they wouldn’t involve being in rock bands.","The real truth behind Ugly Rumours, Blair's university band .

"By . Associated Press . The home of the Minnesota Vikings has been demolished using controlled explosives. A series of dynamite charges were set off at the Metrodome Stadium on Sunday. Within seconds, the roof ring fell and several walls collapsed in a cloud of dust at the stadium, long considered one of the worst  sporting venues. The 32-year-old facility in downtown Minneapolis was being demolished last week but officials halted work after one part of the ring beam fell out of sequence. The 32-year-old facility was being demolished last week but a ring beam fell out of sequence - forcing the use of explosives . Parts of the Metrodome stadium fall on Sunday in Minneapolis. Crews are planning to use controlled explosive charges as they continue to demolish the roof structure . After consulting with structural and . demolition experts, the Minnesota Sports Facility Authority recommended . bringing down the remaining portion of the ring beam with controlled . explosives. Contractors did so using 84 charges of dynamite in 24 columns of the upper concourse. The public were kept 250 feet from the site, and the nearby light-rail station was closed during the demolition. The explosion went off without a hitch and no one was injured during the controlled event. Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome is still on schedule. It is expected to be completely torn down by the end of April 2014. The stadium opened in 1982 and was home to the NFL team Minnesota Vikings until the end of the last season. The top tier of the southeast side of the Metrodome collapsed unexpectedly earlier this month . The decades-old Metrodome stadium was home to the Minnesota Vikings football team . Teams moved in to demolish the Metrodome the day after the Vikings last game on December 29, 2013. The . Vikings new stadium, which is being built nearby, will be ready by the . 2016 season. They are temporarily being housed at TCF Bank Stadium - . home to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers. The Metrodome was the ninth-oldest stadium in the NFL and known locally as 'The Dome' and 'The Thunderdome'. The Metrodome cost $55 million to build - coming in under budget. It is the only venue in the world which has hosted a MLB All-Star Game (1985), a Super Bowl (1992), an NCAA Final Four (1992 & 2001) and a World Series (1987 & 1991). One major criticism of the stadium was that it was incredibly loud to watch a game due to the fabric-domed roof which amplified the sound. A torn section of the roof sags inside the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome on December 13, 2010 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Metrodome's roof collapsed under the weight of snow after a powerful blizzard hit the area . The . Metrodome's air-supported roof collapsed under the weight of snow from a . severe winter storm in early December 2010 when more than 17 inches . fell. Many games in the . sports calendar were forced to be canceled until the roof was finally . replaced in August 2011 at a cost of $18million. The MLB's Minnesota Twins played at the Metrodome between 1982 - 2009 before moving to Target Field. It was considered one of the worst venues for baseball in an ESPN survey of fans in 2001 because the shape of the stadium made it near impossible to see the pitcher's mound and home plate from some seats.

"By . Ian Birrell In Cairo . Victims of last year’s military coup in Egypt have accused Tony Blair and his former spin doctor Alastair Campbell of assisting a brutal regime responsible for mass killings, torture and the jailing of thousands of innocent people. As the coup leader – a former army spy chief – was crowned President in a controversial election last week, they condemned the pair for helping a military strongman trying to win international approval  after overthrowing an elected government. ‘I still have a bullet in my chest,’ said Mohamed Tareq, a biology lecturer shot three times while helping victims of a massacre that killed hundreds of protesters. ‘Is this the democracy these people are promoting to the West?’ Former spin doctor Alistair Campbell apparently visited Egypt for lengthy talks with senior aides and politicians on how to defend the coup and its bloody aftermath, pictured above, in the international media . Their anger came as new evidence emerged of Campbell’s reported role offering advice to the regime of Egypt’s ruler Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Campbell, forced to resign from Downing Street in 2003 after his role in the Iraq War ‘dodgy dossier’ scandal, had visited the country for talks with Sisi’s team. Campbell refused to say if he was being paid. In February, he spoke at a conference in the United Arab Emirates, one of the Gulf states providing financial support to Egypt since the coup. However, this newspaper can reveal new details of Campbell’s secretive Cairo mission to discuss ‘spinning’ the Sisi regime to the rest of the world. Diplomatic sources in Cairo say Campbell had lengthy talks with senior aides and politicians on how to defend the coup and its bloody aftermath in the international media. ‘They have been very bad at getting their message across,’ said one source. In recent weeks, Sisi advisers have visited the US and Brussels to push the line that a shattered Egypt needs stability to survive and seek foreign investment. Insiders say the aim is to play down ‘regrettable’ outrages of the post-coup regime and play up abuses by Mohamed Morsi’s deposed Muslim Brotherhood government, while defending press curbs and clampdowns on protests as politically necessary. Mr Campbell, left, and former Prime Minister Tony Blair, right, pictured in 2001, are accused by victims of last year's military coup of offering advice to the regime of Egypt's ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi . Rasha Gafaar, a freelance journalist accused of sending footage to Arab television station al-Jazeera, yesterday became  the latest reporter seized for supposedly aiding the banned Muslim Brotherhood. One ex-BBC journalist is among those on trial accused of similar collusion. Former journalist Campbell has admitted discussing ‘perceptions in the international media about Egypt’ – and one senior official who met him complained the West did not understand events  in his nation. ‘Our political discourse is not very strong and we are not trained to speak to the Western mentality,’ said the official. ‘Democracy is an issue that is relative.’ Supporters say new president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who mounted his coup in July last year, will provide stability . On Thursday, Sisi won a landslide victory; his only rival came third behind spoiled ballots. Apathy and boycotts led to school and shopping mall closures, a hasty public holiday and polling extended a day to boost turnout. His triumph – still with far fewer votes than he had demanded – was greeted with fireworks and flag-waving in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, scene of the Arab Spring protests three years ago that ousted the corrupt dictator Hosni Mubarak. But the square was far from filled; street vendors selling T-shirts with Sisi’s image on them told me trade was terrible. Sisi mounted his military coup last July after massive street protests against Morsi. Since then, an estimated 1,600 dissidents have been killed, 16,000 stuffed into overcrowded jails and up to 40,000 arrested. Despite this, Blair praised the army intervention for the ‘rescue’ of Egypt, saying it was the ‘will of the people… to take the country to the next stage of its development, which should be democratic’. Amr Moussa, an adviser to Sisi, said they welcomed the help of anyone who understood the deep challenges facing Egyptians. ‘Tony is an intelligent man,’ he said. ‘He has been here several times. He knows what is needed.’ Most of the Mubarak old guard and business elite back the new regime. Days after Morsi’s fall last July, the telecoms billionaire Naguib Sawiris hosted Blair on his new super-yacht in St Tropez, where they discussed the restoration of order in Egypt. Sisi’s supporters argue Morsi lost legitimacy by turning most of the country against him with his incompetence and sectarianism. ‘Why should we have to suffer for another three years to have the trimmings of democracy in order to please the West?’ asked Mohamed Salmawy, a celebrated author who helped create a new constitution and has met with Cathy Ashton, EU foreign affairs chief. A soldier and voters pictured last week. Mr Blair praised the army intervention for 'rescuing' Egypt, saying it was in line with the 'will of the people',  who wanted the country to be taken into democracy . ‘If the army had not responded, there would have been civil war.’ But human rights groups, journalists and activists allege that repression is now the worst in recent Egyptian history. ‘This is worse than Mubarak,’ said a Human Rights Watch spokesman. ‘The scale of mass protester killings is unprecedented.’ The most savage massacre was last August, when almost 1,000 people were slaughtered and many more injured. Soldiers – who claim to have come under fire first – surrounded a Cairo protest camp in support of Morsi, then fired into it for several hours. Lecturer Tareq, 34, was among those caught in the carnage, shot three times. Tareq was sacked by his university and still remains in severe pain – but he believes he escaped lightly compared to  those he saw with faces blown apart and innards spilling out. ‘It felt like we were watching genocide,’ he said. Haitham Ghonim, a call centre training supervisor set off to buy a new car earlier this year. Arriving at the area where drivers come to sell their cars, he passed an anti-coup protest of 150 people. Then, as he looked at the vehicles, armoured cars blocked off the street at either end and security forces began blasting away with birdshot. Gas canisters were also fired and, amid the chaos, an officer was heard telling his troops to fire live rounds, but they refused. The car owners, desperate to protect their vehicles, hurled back stones, prompting the officer himself to start shooting. ‘There were two men in front of me,’ said Haitham, 29. ‘One was shot in the leg, then a second man was hit in the abdomen and while we tried to help he was dying in front of us. I could not believe it – these guys were just selling cars.’ Haitham was picked up by police, kicked and beaten with a rifle butt, then thrown in a military bus. Inside was an injured young man slipping out of consciousness. ‘I begged them to open the door to let in air for this man. But they just kept telling us we were not human beings, we were sheep, that we must die.’ The brutal assaults continued as they were taken to a police station and questioned over links to the Muslim Brotherhood. Haitham had not voted for Morsi, yet was singled out for the most vicious abuse since he shared his last name with a prominent figure in the original pro-democracy protests. ‘Officers came and told me that if I was his brother they would rape me, then kill me.’ Eventually this bruised and battered man was thrown in a tiny, stinking cell crammed with 70 other people. He was held for 26 days without trial. So what did Haitham think of prominent figures telling the world Egypt was on the path to progress? ‘These people should come and live with us if they think this is democracy,’ he said. ‘They are helping destroy our revolution. ‘Those who are promoting a regime that is killing, torturing and locking up so many Egyptians have blood on their hands also.’","Victims of last year's military coup accused duo of offering advice to regime .

"By . Associated Press . Tragic accident: Maddox Derkosh, two, was killed after falling 10 feet into the dog pit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium in November 2012 . The parents of a 2-year-old boy who was fatally mauled after falling into a wild African dogs exhibit have settled their lawsuit against the Pittsburgh zoo. Attorneys for the boy's parents, Jason and Elizabeth Derkosh, issued a joint statement Monday with the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. 'Details of the settlement will remain confidential. The Derkosh family and the zoo request that the privacy of all parties involved be respected,' the statement said. The couple's son, Maddox, lunged from . his mother's grasp and fell some 10 feet from the top of a wooden . railing into an enclosed exhibit below in 2012. He . had bounced off a net meant to catch falling debris and trash, then . into the exhibit, where several dogs fatally attacked him. The bespectacled boy, who had vision problems, became the only visitor in the zoo's 116-year history to die. The Derkoshes sued in May 2013, and the . zoo countered in September by arguing his mother was to blame for his . death, because she lifted him atop the 4-foot-tall wooden railing that . surrounded the raised observation platform so he could get a better look . into the exhibit. Blame: The zoo claims mom Elizabeth Derkosh, center, was at fault for her son's death and that she shouldn't be allowed to sue them . Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two-year-old (file image) 'The injuries and damages sustained by Maddox Derkosh, including Maddox Derkosh's death, were caused solely by the carelessness, negligence, and/or recklessness of Elizabeth Derkosh,' the zoo's attorney wrote in the court filing. She 'knew or should have known he could fall into the exhibit' and failed 'to maintain a proper grasp of Maddox Derkosh after lifting him over the railing.' The parents' attorney, Robert Mongeluzzi, said then that the zoo 'failed miserably in their solemn responsibility to prevent the attack' and 'shamelessly attacked Maddox's grieving mother.' At rest: At Maddox's funeral his parents asked friends, relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy's name, to be given to a children's charity . No hope: The wild dogs attacked the child so quickly at the zoo exhibit that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers had arrived it would have been futile to try to rescue the boy . The African wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The dog's Latin name Lycaon pictus means 'painted wolf' because of the animal's patchy colored coat of red, black, brown, white and yellow fur, each with their own unique pattern. These dogs are very social, and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members. In fact after a successful hunt, the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. They hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests. They kill the larger prey by disemboweling, a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative, ferocious reputation. They are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals. Its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - BFQ, the strength of bite relative to the animal's mass -  measured at 142, the highest of any carnivore, except for the Tasmanian devil. They are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent. There were once approximately 500,000 African wild dogs in 39 countries, and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon. Now there are only about 3,000-5,500 in fewer than 25 countries. In October, Mongeluzzi filed a . counterclaim on behalf of Elizabeth Derkosh, which included excerpts . from the minutes of several of the zoo's safety committee meetings since . August 2006. The first . excerpt says, 'Wild dog exhibit has one side of the exhibit that is open . and a visitor was seen dangling a child over the exhibit through the . opening.' According to the court filing, similar observations were brought to the safety committee's attention on four more occasions by July 2007 — including one that said, 'Guest are dangling children over the railing at the Wild Dogs exhibit' — but Mongeluzzi contends the exhibit still was not changed until after Maddox was killed. Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. investigated the boy's death and deemed it a 'tragic accident,' deciding not to prosecute his mother or zoo officials. But the standard of proof for criminal charges is greater than that needed to prove negligence or recklessness in a civil lawsuit, in which a jury could have decided that both sides share some responsibility. Zoo spokeswoman Tracy Gray has said the zoo has met safety standards of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and that the U.S. Department of Agriculture found no problems with the exhibit in 35 inspections since 2006. The dogs have been relocated to other zoos, and the Pittsburgh exhibit now houses cheetahs. Mongeluzzi and zoo officials said they had no comment beyond the brief joint statement.","Maddox Derkosh died in November 2012 after falling over a four-foot railing into the exhibit after his mom had lifted him up to get a better look .

"By . Lydia Warren . A 10-year-old girl has died after being pinned beneath a branch that fell on her family's tent while they camped during a thunderstorm. Allison Spahr, from Cary, Illinois, had urged her father to let them stay at the Ice Age Campground at Devils Lake State Park in Wisconsin despite the impending bad weather. He agreed and settled down to sleep beneath some trees with his daughter and his son, 13-year-old Kyle Spahr, on Saturday night. But just before 4am on Sunday, Mr Spahr said he awoke to the sound of creaking. Scroll down for video . Loss: Allison Spahr, 10, was killed on Sunday morning when a branch landed on her chest as she slept in a tent with her father and brother during a storm in Wisconsin. The other two escaped . 'I can hear that sound over and over - that creaking, cracking sound,' Spahr told NBC5. Within 30 seconds, it was chaos. 'This loud crash, boom on the . ground,' he told CBS. 'My legs were immediately pinned and it hurt. I had this shooting . pain in my legs. And my tent was flattened across my face.' But as he cried out in pain, Allison was silent. 'It landed across my . daughter's chest,' he said. 'The coroner doesn't think she even woke up.' His daughter was pronounced dead at the scene. Family: Allison is pictured (second left) with her siblings, from left, Lauren, 18, Bryan, 21, Eric, 16, and Kyle, 13. Kyle was also in the tent at the time of the tragedy but managed to escape from beneath the tree . Adventurous: Allison, pictured bottom, often went on camping trips with her large family . Kyle was able to wriggle to safety and Mr Spahr had to be cut free with a chainsaw. The father and son were taken to St. Clare Hospital and have now returned home to Illinois, where they are nursing cuts and bruises. Park officials said that the tree appeared to be healthy during routine checks but that it might have been weakened by the passing thunderstorm. Spahr said he believed that the ground had been saturated by rain, which he thinks caused the tree to completely uproot. In a statement released Sunday, the Department of Natural Resources passed on their condolences. 'Visitor safety is the number one priority on all properties the department manages, and we do our very best to provide a safe environment for our visitors,' the statement said. Sadness: Her father said that his faith was comforting him as he struggled to deal with the loss of Allison . Injuries: He showed off the scrapes on his legs, which were inflicted when the branches fell on their tent . Scene: Park officials said the trees were regularly inspected but they think they fell in the bad weather . 'Campgrounds are inspected regularly, and action is taken to eliminate potential hazards whenever possible. Unfortunately, not all possible events can be foreseen.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . A Turkish man caught stuffing a beheaded swan into a backpack has apologised and said he did not know what type of bird it was - but that it had 'tasted nice'. Hasan Fidan was arrested after an angler saw him bundle the dead bird into his bag at Bennett's Lake in Hildenbough, Kent, and handed a photograph of him doing so to police. The 46-year-old has now been fined £110 by magistrates and ordered to pay a further £85 in costs and a £20 victim surcharge after he admitted killing the swan on March 18 this year. Caught on camera: Hasan Fidan has apologised after he was caught stuffing a beheaded swan into a backpack, and says he did not realise what type of bird it was . According to a law dating back to the 12th century when they were considered a delicacy, the Queen owns all of Britain's mute swans. Unemployed Fidan said he had not realised that killing a swan was against the law. 'I did not know what type of bird it was. For me it was any type of bird. I didn’t know the Queen owned them,' he told the Evening Standard. 'I like the Queen very much. The moment the police told me what I did was wrong, I said I was sorry.' Fidan, who has lived in Britain since 2006, was spotted by fisherman Bob Morris, 64, as he leapt over a fence at the lake before snatching the bird and hacking off its head. When officers managed to track him down to his home in Tonbridge, Kent, they discovered the remains of the butchered swan in his freezer. Police confirmed that the photo taken by Mr Morris was used to identify Fidan when he was spotted at another lake on March 28. Scene: Fidan was spotted bundling the dead bird into his bag at Bennett's Lake in Hildenbough, Kent . Catch of the day: Fidan, who has lived in Britain since 2006, was spotted by fisherman Bob Morris, 64, (pictured) as he leapt over a fence at the lake before snatching the bird and hacking off its head . The Crown claimed ownership of all mute swans in the 12th century - when they were regarded as a delicacy and often served at banquets and feasts. Today the Queen retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but she only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries. This ownership is shared with the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Worshipful Company of Dyers, who were granted rights of ownership by the Crown in the fifteenth century. Every July an annual census of the swan population, known as Swan Upping, takes place along the Thames in Middlesex, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. As part of the ceremony, The Queen's Swan Marker, the Royal Swan Uppers and the Swan Uppers of the Vintners' and Dyers' livery companies use six traditional Thames rowing skiffs during a five-day journey up-river. On passing Windsor Castle, the rowers stand to attention in their boat with oars raised and salute 'Her Majesty The Queen, Seigneur of the Swans'. Until 1998 it was considered treason to kill a swan. He was sentenced by magistrates in Sevenoaks last week, having been charged under the Wildlife and . Countryside Act. Under the act, killing a wild bird can carry a sentence of six months in . prison or a maximum fine of £20,000. 'I . took it home, I took out the feathers, I cut it up and ate some of it. I . wanted to see what it tasted like. It tasted nice. I put the rest in . the freezer,' Fidan said. He added that he had killed the swan because he was struggling to buy food. Mr Morris, who runs a rod-making firm in Dartford, Kent, described the moment he saw Fidan kill the bird. 'I was about 200 feet away when I saw this man in a red jacket jump over a fence and grab a swan and sit down on it,' he said. 'He . then took a knife off and cut it's head off at the bottom of the neck - . I was stunned - I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 'Swans have a fierce reputation, but they are relatively easy to catch - you just need to beware of their feet which have very sharp claws on them. 'This guy knew what he was doing.' Mr Morris, whose book Carping Aside was published last year, said he had run over to Fidan and shouted at him. 'He had dropped the knife he used to kill the swan and he just looked at me and started swearing,' he said. 'I picked up his knife because I was worried he might go for me, but then he started shouting at me ""Are you going to stab me?"" and I realised I could get in a bit of bother, so I put the knife down. 'It was a very unpleasant incident and left me quite shaken, but I managed to get the photo which helped get him caught.' Mr Morris said he was 'disgusted' by the £110 fine doled out to Fidan. 'There is no deterrent effect in this sentence and it sends out all the wrong messages - it basically says killing a swan is no big deal,' he said. 'All swans are the property of The Queen, so it should be seen as a big deal and dealt with accordingly otherwise we are just going to see more and more swans going missing and ending up on the dinner table.' He added: 'It's horrific really - swans and carp need to be protected, as they are being caught and eaten more and more these days.'","Angler spotted Hasan Fidan, 46, killing the bird and bundling it into bag .

"By . Wills Robinson . Egypt's former military chief has won a crushing victory in the country's presidential elections with more than 92 per cent of the votes. Early indications suggest field marshal Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi has received 23.38million votes, with left-wing politician Hamdeen Sabahi, his sole opponent, taking 735,285. But the victory was undermined by a low turnout of only 44 per cent, even though voting was extended . for a third day in a bid to avoid a political embarrassment. It is well below the 52 per cent who turned out for the election won by Mohammed Morsi in 2012. Scroll down for video . Jubilant: Supporters of Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi celebrate at Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt . Al-Sisi's . win was never in doubt, but the career infantry officer, also 59, had . hoped for a strong turnout to restore legitimacy after he ousted Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, last July. After polls closed, his supporters . held all-night celebrations in Cairo, with several thousands gathered at . the central Tahrir Square, the focal point of the 2011 uprising that toppled . longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. They . waved Egyptian flags, posters and danced. There were similar . celebrations in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and a string of . other cities north of the capital. In his final campaign TV interview . last week, el-Sissi had set the bar even higher, saying he wanted more . than 40 million voters - there are nearly 54 million registered - . to cast ballots to 'show the world' the extent of his support. Decisive victory: The former army chief is believed to have won 92 per cent of the ballots cast (around 23.38million votes) Critics . said the lack of enthusiasm at the polls was partly due to apathy . among even el-Sissi supporters, knowing that his victory was a foregone . conclusion. Others said . it showed discontent with el-Sissi, not just among his Islamist foes . but also among a broader section of the public that believes he has no . concrete plans and will return to the . autocratic ways of Mubarak. The tepid turnout was particularly . embarrassing because the government and media had been whipping up support for al-Sisi over the past 10 months. He has been depicted as a . warrior against terrorism and the only person able to tackle Egypt's . economic problems, high unemployment, inflation and instability. Al-Sisi's supporters in the Egyptian . media have been in a panic the past two days. Political talk show hosts . and newscasters urged people to vote, warning that a surprise result could see the Muslim Brotherhood step up its challenge to the new . government. Prominent TV . talk show host Amr Adeeb angrily said that by not voting, Egyptians . might as well 'go directly to the prison and return Mohammed Morsi to . power.' Display: Fireworks are set off over Tahrir Square, the focal point of the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak . The . abrupt decision by the election commission to add another day of voting . Wednesday raised complaints that authorities were tipping the playing . field in el-Sissi's favor. US-based . Democracy International, which had been observing the vote, said the . extension 'raises more questions about the independence of the election . commission, the impartiality of the government, and the integrity of . Egypt's electoral process.' It . said its observer teams outside of Cairo had ended their mission as . scheduled on Tuesday. Some other international monitoring teams also . left the country, since they had only planned for two days of voting, . though EU monitors stayed on. Sabahi, al-Sisi's only opponent in the race, protested the extension, saying it aimed to 'distort' the will of the people. His . campaign pulled its representatives from polling stations Wednesday in . protest against what it called a campaign of intimidation and arrests of . its campaign workers. He, however, refused to bow to pressure from his . camp to withdraw in protest, arguing that staying in the race qualifies . him to 'fight future battles.' Celebration: Supporters wave flags and hold up posters with early results showing a landslide victory for the former army chief . Relief: A supporter of al-Sisi celebrates in Tahrir Square. The election follows a year of turmoil in Egyptian politics . Sabahi's spokesman, Hossam Moenis, told ONTV network that a member of the campaign has been referred to a military tribunal. 'We . are digging a channel for democracy ... in the face of an undemocratic . project,' he said. 'The same mentality that we thought we managed to . topple on Jan. 25, is back and ruling,' - a reference to the start of . the 18-day, anti-Mubarak uprising in 2011. Only . a handful of voters, or none at all, were at polling centers in . multiple districts toured by Associated Press reporters Wednesday. At some, music played and kids painted . Egyptian flags or el-Sissi's name on their faces as the occasional . voter drifted in. TV images beamed from more than a dozen locations . across Egypt showed similar scenes. 'People . are lazy, depressed or frustrated. They knew what the result will be . even before the vote,' said Amani Fikry, a manager in a privately-owned . company. 'They are exhausted from three years of constant troubles.' Victory: More of el-Sissis's faithful gather in the square. Voting was extended to a third day in a bid to avoid an embarrassing turnout . In Cairo's Sayeda Zeinab district, loudspeakers played patriotic songs at an empty polling center. Two al-Sisi backers scribbled words of support on posters of the candidate that had been defaced with insulting graffiti. 'El-Sissi doesn't need a program,' said one, Mohammed Hussein. 'We just want security.' Morsi's Brotherhood supporters and other Islamists boycotted the vote and scattered protests by Morsi supporters were quickly dispersed by security forces. In Fayoum, the province southwest of Cairo, riot police fired tear gas after protesters hurled stones and fire cracks while marching and chanting slogans against elections. Along with Islamists, some of the youths who took part in the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak either stayed away from the polls or supported Sabahi.","Field marshal Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is said to have received 92% of the votes .

"By . Dan Bloom . Pro football legend Dan Marino has become one of the most famous retired players yet to file a concussion suit against the National Football League. The 52-year-old former Miami Dolphins star is one of 15 former players who filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Philadelphia last week. They join more than 4,800 others who have alleged the NFL misled players about the long-term dangers of concussion. The NFL has denied those claims. NFL great: Dan Marino, pictured in 1999 shortly before the end of his 16-year career with the Miami Dolphins. He has been revealed as one of 15 players filing a concussion-related lawsuit against the League . Then and now: Marino with his head bowed in defeat at the Super Bowl of 1985 (left). Right, at an event in 2009 . The lawsuit doesn't specify which medical problems are suffered by the retired players, including Marino, who left the NFL in 1999. But it says they have included headaches, dizziness, loss of memory, dementia, depression, impulse control, impulsivity to anger, physical disability, embarrassment, and a 'loss of the pleasures of life'. And it is similar in wording to several previous lawsuits, accusing the NFL of 'carelessness, negligence, intentional misconduct and concealment of information' directly connected with the players' injuries. The 18-page document, seen by MailOnline, says the plaintiffs are seeking damages to be decided by a jury for long-term or chronic injuries, along with funds for medical treatment. 'Despite knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades' Complaint filed with district court in Philadelphia . 'For over 40 years [the NFL] have continuously and fervently denied that it knew, should have known or believed there to be any relationship between NFL players suffering concussions while playing, the NFL policies concerning tackling methodology,' the complaint says. It adds that evidence showing concussion causes the brain condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been readily available 'for more than 100 years'. The complaint notes that the most dangerous tackles - where players used their heads as a 'weapon' - were outlawed in the late 1970s. But it adds that the laws were not well-enforced, saying: 'The NFL wanted to keep its fan base excited by the visual exhilaration witnessing such hazardous techniques. 'Despite the NFL’s knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades.' Later loopholes, it alleged, 'demonstrated Defendant’s selfish desire to keep the fan base entertained and interested in the violence of the sport of football.' Commentators say claims by such a titan of the NFL will add credibility to one side of a long-running dispute which escalated into a series of House of Representatives hearings four years ago. Super Bowl: Dan Marino (right) played a starring role in 1985 in the biggest event of the NFL calendar . Fame: Dan Marino in 1985 (left) and 1988 (right). He amassed several NFL records during his 17-year career . Richard Bishop (played 1976-83) Ethan Johnson (2012-13) Chris Dugan (1991-93) Anthony Grant (1987) Mark Green (1989-92) LaCurtis Jones (1996) John Huddleston (1978-79) Erik Affholter (1991) Toddrick McIntosh (1994-95) Dwight Wheeler (1978-88) Jackie Wallace (1974-79) Dan Marino (1983-99) Moses Moreno (1998-2000) Peter Manning (1960-61) and wife Susie . Bruce Clark (1982-89) Some 4,500 former football players . filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL, claiming the League had . not warned them enough about the dangers of concussion. The NFL agreed on a $765 million settlement with that group of players last August, but it was . rejected by a federal judge in January. The news has come days after President Obama said more research should be carried out on the effects of concussion on young athletes. He hosted a White House summit last week at which he was . introduced by Victoria Bellucci, a high school graduate from . Huntingtown, Maryland, who suffered five concussions during her high . school and club soccer career and said they 'drastically altered' her life. The President said a new attitude is needed where players who have been hit don't feel wimpy for sitting out a game or two. 'We have to change a culture that says you suck it up,' Obama said, adding that he probably suffered mild concussions as a young football player. He added: 'We want our kids participating in sports. As parents, though, we want to keep them safe.' Marino is by far the longest-serving of . the 15 latest players to sue the NFL. The list also includes Dwight . Wheeler, 59, a center for the Los Angeles Raiders and New England . Patriots who played for nine seasons. Elsewhere . on the list is defensive tackle Bruce Clark, now 56, who played for . eight seasons, all but one of them for the New Orleans Saints. Former Chicago Bears player Peter Manning, who is the oldest plaintiff at age 76, is also seeking compensation for his wife. In his prime: Marino playing the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s. He remained with the Dolphins for 17 years . Marino was a quarterback at the University of Pittsburgh when he was picked to join the Miami Dolphins in 1983. He remained with the team for 17 . seasons - the whole of his NFL career - and won several honours and . records, amassing an eye-popping 4,967 of 8,358 passes for 61,361 yards, . 242 games and 420 touchdowns. Just . a year after he joined the team, Marino played with the Dolphins in the . 1984 season Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers. Though . the Dolphins were thrashed 38-16, the match was hyped as a battle of . the quarterbacks between 23-year-old Marino and the 49ers' more . experienced Joe Montana. His passing skills were the stuff of legend, and in 13 games he threw for more than 400 yards. He was inaugurated into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, dedicating his speech to his father. Mystery: The court filings do not specify what injuries the legendary quarterback suffered . That was only after he had passed into legend in popular culture. He . played himself in the 1994 box office hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective . and guest starred in an episode of the Simpsons in which Homer and Bart . visit the Super Bowl. The star has had no major documented concussions, but tore an Achilles' tendon in 1993 and suffered a neck injury late in his career. After retirement he worked as a CBS analyst for more than a decade before leaving the network a few months ago. The NFL declined to comment.","Former Miami Dolphins star, 52, is among 15 retired players filing case .

"By . Emma Reynolds . A man whose brother died during the Falklands war is to retrace his footsteps almost 30 years on from the conflict. In 1982, Royal Marine Gordon MacPherson was killed during the battle for Two Sisters, and now his brother David plans to make an arduous 75-mile journey past the spot in tribute. Mr MacPherson was 19 when he lost his brother, who was 20 and had been a Royal Marine for just a year. Loving memory: Left, Gordon and David MacPherson at their home in Argyll in March 1982, shortly before the Marine left for the Falklands. Right, David training for his Falklands challenge this year . Gordon MacPherson, from Oban, Argyll, died alongside comrade Corporal Frank Spencer during the battle. Both served with Zulu Company, 45 Commando, Royal Marines, which is based in Arbroath. David MacPherson and Mike Cole, who was the company commander in 1982, are now about to travel the original 120km (75 mile) route across East Falkland and will pay their respects at Two Sisters. The men will be laden with heavy kit for the long journey - a Marine practice known as a 'yomp' - and will cover 17 miles each day in wintry conditions. When Mr MacPherson and Mr Cole reach Two Sisters, on their way from Port San Carlos to Stanley, they will stop for a ceremony in honour of the fallen Marines. A piper from The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 SCOTS), is expected to play Nam Anna Le Mo Smaointe, a Gaelic song which means 'Alone With My Thoughts' and was written for Gordon after he died by family friends Erik Spence and the Reverend John MacLeod. Tragic death: Gordon MacPherson with 9 Troop, Zulu Company, on HMS Intrepid, two days before the landing at San Carlos Water in May 1982 . It will be the first time Mr MacPherson has visited the Falklands and the second time Mr Cole has returned to the battlefield since the night of June 11, 1982. The idea for the yomp came from Cpl . Spencer's son Simon, but he and his brother, Gareth, are no longer able . to take part for family reasons. The pair, who will be joined by Colour Sergeant Trevor Law, a Royal Marine serving in the Falklands, are now gearing up for the challenge, which starts on May 13. They will be carrying equipment weighing about 20kg and raising money for the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund during the challenge. They have had a royal seal of approval from the Duke of Edinburgh, who sent them a letter of support last week. Fallen comrades: Frank Spencer, left, and MacPherson, right, on HMS Intrepid in May 1982 just before both were killed during the battle fro Two Sisters . Mr MacPherson, a painter and decorator from Oban, said: 'I'm a 49-year-old civilian, so it's all new to me. 'I'd . like to think I was already reasonably fit but I've had to try and get . much fitter for this as it is going to be very difficult. 'My . wife and her friends are running the Glasgow 10k on May 13, the same . day that we start the yomp, and they're raising money for the same . charity. 'I never . thought I would get the opportunity to do anything like this. It's the . first and probably the only time I will go to the Falklands.' Mr . Cole, 64, from Dorset, said he is taking part in the trip in memory of . his two fallen comrades but that the most important thing for him is to . support Mr MacPherson. Then and now: Left, Mike Cole with the officers of 45 Commando Group at Ajax Bay, San Carlos Water, in May 1982, two days before the start of the yomp. Right, training in Dorset in February . Mr Cole, who now works at RNAS Yeovilton for the Ministry of Defence, recalled his last memory of Gordon MacPherson. He said: 'Gordon wasn't very big physically but he was very determined. 'I remember just before we moved out of the patrol base after receiving orders for the attack, we were getting our kit ready and he was putting on a huge pack. 'I jokingly asked if he was going to be okay with it. 'He gave me one of those looks, and I knew of course that there was never going to be any problem there. That's the last time I remember seeing him.' He added: 'We were delighted to receive a letter from HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, as Captain General Royal Marines, commending us and wishing us luck on our expedition, which he indicated was a unique and fitting tribute to Corporal Spencer and Marine MacPherson.'","David MacPherson will make the arduous trip alongside his brother's former commander on 30th anniversary of the conflict .

Drew Katz issued a statement of his own as well, praising his father. 'My father was my best friend. He . taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he . worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were . seen and unseen,' Drew Katz said in a statement. 'He loved his native . city of Camden and his adopted home of Philadelphia.

'But his greatest . accomplishment by far was being the most amazing father to my sister and . me, and grandparent to his four grandchildren.' Mr Leeds told the Press of Atlantic City that his wife, Anne, had been invited last minute to attend a fundraiser with Katz in Concord, Saturday afternoon. Horror: A Twitter user shared this horrifying image of the flames after the crash at Hanscom Field. Witnesses reported smelling rubber for miles . Update: NTSB Senior Air Safety Investigator Luke Schiada speaks during a news conference at Hanscom Field in Bedford on Monday . The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin. Mr . Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the .

Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash. Ms . Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ . Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012. Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell – was another victim. Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake. The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years. 'We know more than anybody how difficult this business is,' Katz told employees Tuesday afternoon at the company's headquarters. 'We're going to give it our best. We're going to try to bring in the best. And, hopefully, we'll have a wonderful result.' His tragic death 'won't derail the sale of the Inquirer, Daily News & Philly.com' the newspaper said on its Twitter feed.

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . A woman and her boyfriend have been charged with beating to death a 15-month-old girl they were babysitting. North Carolina's Malaya Faith Heun died on January 22, two days after a brutal assault which left her unconscious with ruptured intestines, broken collarbone, fractured ribs and brain bleeding. Malaya's aunt Alisha Nicole Carlisle, 20, and Carlisle's boyfriend, 30-year-old John Travis Turner, who were caring for the toddler, were charged with first-degree murder on Monday. 'Just seeing their faces makes me angry, . to know that they would do something like that to my daughter,' Jamie Heun, Malaya's grief-stricken father, told Independent Tribune. 'My daughter’s gone. I’m always going to have to deal with that fact.' Heartbreaking: Toddler Malaya Faith Heun (pictured left and right) died two days after allegedly being savagely beaten at her North Carolina home in January . Family: Little Malaya Heun with her parents Jamie and Christy Heun and her three older siblings in happier times . Malaya was unresponsive when she was rushed to hospital on January 19 after, police say, she was beaten by Carlisle and Turner. The couple were babysitting the toddler while her mother Christy Heun, Carlisle's sister, was at work.  They had moved in with the Heun family in December last year, according to WCNC. Malaya underwent emergency surgery, but her mother took her off life support on January 22 when the infant's condition worsened. An autopsy finalized last month revealed Malaya suffered 'repeated inflicted . trauma consistent with Battered Child Syndrome'. The cause of the innocent girl's death was listed as 'septic shock due to . complications of inflicted blunt force trauma to the abdomen'. Her colon was perforated and surgeons had to remove multiple portions of her bowel. In addition to fresh fractures, the child had numerous broken ribs and bruises in . various stages of healing, indicating she had been abused over an extended period. Charged: John Travis Turner, 30 (left) and his girlfriend Alisha Nicole Carlisle, 20 (right) are accused of fatally beating 15-month-old Malaya Heun . 'The brutal murder of Malaya Heun . … was one of the worst cases of child abuse I have seen in over 30 . years being a police officer,' Kannapolis Police Chief Woody Chavis said . in a statement released Monday. 'I have seen many abused and battered . children during my career but this one was extremely disturbing knowing . how much this baby must have suffered before she died.' Malaya's devastated mother, Christy Heun, has come under fire by observers questioning how she failed to notice her sister was allegedly abusing Malaya. Christy Heun, a mother-of-four, said he was at work, trying to support her family, when the attack happened, and that she typically worked 18 hour days up to six days a week. 'That was my sister. I left her with people I thought I could trust,' she told WCNC. 'He (Turner) is the reason she (Carlisle) didn't protect my baby.' Tragic: The family of Malaya Faith Heun, who died on January 22 after being savagely beaten, are 'ecstatic' that her alleged attackers have been arrested and charged . Tragic: Christy Heun (left), a mother-of-four, said she left her daughter Malaya (right) in the care of her sister and sister's boyfriend while she was at work .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A plane from Houston on its way to New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Saturday had to make an emergency landing after an unruly passenger ran for the cockpit while telling the flight crew he had a bomb. Victor Manguel allegedly bum-rushed the cockpit of United Flight 1435 after a scuffle with other passengers and had to be subdued with the help of four first class passengers. Pilots were forced to land at Memphis, where authorities arrested Manguel before bringing in bomb-sniffing dogs and eventually giving pilots the okay to head to New York. Scroll down for video... Unruly: United Flight 1435 passenger Victor Manguel allegedly charged the cockpit while claiming he had a bomb on Saturday while en route to New York City . Passenger Cookie Smith told KPRC that Manguel first argued with a passenger toward the back of the plane. 'He seemed a little off and he had a black eye. Like the whole white part of his eye was blood red,' said Smith. After the scuffle in back, Smith said Manguel charged toward the cockpit as the flight attendant yelled for him to stop before asking passengers for assistance. Among those who helped hold Manguel back was Smith's husband. Smith told KPRC that Manguel said he had a gun, while other passengers reported that he claimed  to have had a bomb. Grounded: Manguel was taken off the plane, as were the 140 other passengers. He'd allegedly charged the cockpit after claiming he had a bomb. Authorities brought on explosives sniffing dogs before allowing the plane to go on to New York . Once the plane landed in Memphis and Manguel was hauled away by authorities as all the passengers were ushered out, bomb-sniffing canines were brought aboard. 'The FBI showed up and put a bomb-sniffing dog on the plane and we were told the plane had to be searched by this bomb-sniffing dog because the passenger had reported that there were some explosives on-board,' passenger Brent McCowan told WREG. All 140 passengers were seriously inconvenienced by the Manguel, who's been charged by federal authorities with interfering with a flight crew. However, McCowan said the flight crew handled the situation perfectly. 'There was no panic. There were no screams. There were no cries,' he said. 'The flight attendant did a great job with the way he handled the situation.' Manguel now faces federal charges for interfering with a flight crew. The plane eventually made it to New York via Newark airport .","Flight 1435 from Houston was headed to LaGuardia airport in New York on Saturday when it was forced to land at Memphis .

"By . Kate Lyons . The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software . The dangerous cyber pandemic known as Gameover Zeus could have infected thousands of Australian computers and be lying dormant gathering data, experts say. The malware, which the FBI estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million computers worldwide, has resulted in users losing tens of millions of dollars. Gameover Zeus, which experts say is 'sophisticated' and capable of evading anti-virus software, infects a user's machine when they open a PDF or click on a link sent to them in an email. Once it is set up on the computer, Gameover Zeus will intercept all financial transactions and rewrite them, so that payments made by the user will be redirected into other accounts. The malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are made, meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear normal. 'It keeps track of balances; it automatically corrects the numbers on the balance. It's so sophisticated that it hides its tacks,' said Nick Savvides, senior principal systems engineer at Symantec Australia. The malware has hit computer users around the world, with the most incidents reported in the U.S. and Italy – 13 percent and 12 percent respectively. Seven percent of incidents have occurred in the UK. There are no figures available on how many Australian computer users have had money stolen through the malware and Mr Savvides says this is because so far Gameover Zeus 'hasn't been targeting Australian financial institutions or users yet in any significant scale.' But Mr Savvides stated that many Australian users could have downloaded the virus already and it may be lying dormant on their machines ready to be activated at any moment. Scroll down for video . The Gameover Zeus malware has targeted computers in the U.S. with up to one million affected worldwide . Cryptolocker is malware run by the same gang behind Gameover Zeus and they are often installed on computers at the same time. The Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a 'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their financial details. Cryptolocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. 'There's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection [except paying the ransom],' said Marcel Mascunan, Marketing Manager for Kroll Ontrack Asia-Pacific. 'It’s a really nasty piece of malware.' The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files. The Gameover Zeus malware was shut down by an international police effort this week, spearheaded by the FBI, assisted by both the Australian Federal Police and Symantec. This is the third attempt to shut down the malware, which first emerged in 2011, and the FBI is reporting that users have two weeks to clean up their hard drives and install anti-virus software before the network responsible for Gameover Zeus will be operational again. Gameover Zeus has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer-to-peer software, meaning that even if the main server is shut down, infected computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue operating. Another reason is that once installed on a computer, Gameover Zeus has the ability to evade anti-virus software. 'Once it has infected [a computer], it's very hard to get it off,' said Mr Savvides. Computers are often concurrently infected with Gameover Zeus and a separate piece of malware, Cryptolocker, and there is some evidence linking the two pieces of malware back to the same Eastern European network. The Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a 'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their financial details. Cryptolocker then locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom. At the moment the software demands one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around £300 (AU$540). In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . According to Symantec data, three percent of people affected by the Cryptolocker malware pay the ransom rather than lose their files and paying the ransom seems to be the only way for users to gain access to their files once they have been attacked. 'There's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection. There's not much we can do about it… without having the keys it's virtually impossible to decrypt the files,' said Marcel Mascunan, Marketing Manager for Kroll Ontrack Asia-Pacific. The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files. Earlier this week, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. The complaint claims the software has been responsible for the loss of more than $100m from individuals and a string of major companies, with estimates that members of the gang behind the malware would have amassed tens of millions of dollars each. Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. The software can lock the information on a computer and hold it to ransom - one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around $500. File picture . Computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates. A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police, which assisted the FBI with the operation against the Gameover Zeus botnet, said: 'The AFP continues to urge individuals to ensure they have the most up to date anti-virus software to protect themselves from malicious software.' Users are also advised to change their passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during infection, and to enable automatic updates on their anti-virus software. Users are also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails, particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild their network. Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. Symantec has also produced a clean-up tool for infected users who need to get rid of the malware. However potential victims only have only a short time to protect themselves before the hackers can rebuild their network.","Up to one million computers have been infected by 'Gameover Zeus'

Police claim Mr Court, originally from Dunsborough in Western Australia's Margaret River, was visibly intoxicated and beer could be smelt in the car. He allegedly told police he consumed seven beers during the drive - about one every 30 minutes. Sergeant Al Keogh, of the Mt Barker district police, expressed his dismay with the three men in the car, for displaying such reckless abandon during a state-wide long weekend - when thousands of extra cars were using Albany Highway. 'It's a young, stupid mentality. All three of them in the car were tanked,' Sgt Keogh told The West Australian newspaper. 'His explanation was he and his two friends in the car were going to see how much they could drink in the time it took to drive from Perth to Albany, with little or no regard to other motorists or members of the public.' Roughly one beer every half hour: Mr Court blew more than three times over the legal limit during what should have been about a 4.5-hour drive . 'It's absolutely pathetic,' Sgt Keogh noted. 'You have a long weekend where there are thousands of extra cars on the road and you have this bunch of idiots thinking they'll get pissed as they drive at 110km/h.' Sgt Keogh was pleased the car was stopped before somebody was potentially killed. 'We do not tolerate this behaviour,' he added. Police served Mr Court with an immediate two-month driving ban and charged him with a drink driving-related offence. Concerned motorist alerted police: Officers were able to pull Mr Court's Mitsubishi four-wheel-drive over on the Albany Highway, as he was about to enter Mt Barker - a bit over half an hour away from their final destination . One of Mr Court's friends offered to drive the remaining 50km from Mt Barker to Albany, but was also too far over the legal limit to drive. Police remained at the scene to ensure none of the drunk young men got behind the wheel. 'People who drink at this level of intoxication need to experience the full weight of the law and these people have no right on our roads until they can show some responsibility,' Road Safety Council chairman Murray Lampard said. If convicted of driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.15 or more, Mr Court potentially faces a 10-month driving ban and a $2,500 fine, if this is his first offense. Mr Court is due to front Albany Magistrate's Court on June 26.

"By . Sarah Michael . The parents of an Australian Muslim convert who was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen are still waiting for answers from the government more than six months after their son's death. Christopher Havard, 27, was killed when a missile hit the car he was traveling in with another Australian-New Zealand national and three members of terror group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) on November 19 last year. Mr Havard grew up in Townsville and was jailed at 16 for stealing a car. But in 2008 he converted to Islam at a Queensland mosque before moving to New Zealand and eventually Yemen, apparently to teach English. Australian Federal Police were investigating Mr Havard's alleged links to Al Qaeda and his involvement in the kidnapping of three Westerners in Yemen in 2012 before his death. Christopher Havard, 27, was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen in November last year while traveling in a car with three members of terror group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . But Mr Havard's mother and step-father Bronwyn and Neill Dowrick, from Townsville in Queensland, told the 7.30 Report their son was dead for a month before they were told and since then they have been kept in the dark about the details surrounding his death. Adding to their distress was the fact that the Australian government 'changed the stories every week', with the couple first told he was killed in a Yemeni air strike on a mosque. The couple wants to know what proof the government has that their son was a member of Al Qaeda. 'Everything the government is saying, it's all hearsay, there's never been one ounce of proof given to us by any department of the government to prove that he was or he was not a terrorist, because they don't want to,' Mr Dowrick said. Mr Havard's step-father Neill Dowrick (left) and mother Bronwyn Dowrick,  from Townsville in Queensland, say they can't get closure until the Australian Government gives them more details about their son's death . Ms Dowrick wants to know exactly how her son died. 'We've got no closure. We've got no proof of Chris's body or death certificate or how he was actually killed, so how can you move on?' she said. According to heavily censored documents obtained by the ABC, Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop was given information saying Mr Havard was 'involved' with Al Qaeda just four days before the US drone attack. The documents, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, show Australian police had been investigating Mr Havard's possible involvement in the kidnapping of a Finnish couple and an Austrian man in Yemen in 2012. Police were investigating Mr Havard, an Australian Muslim convert, over his alleged links to Al Qaeda and his involvement in the kidnapping of three Westerners in Yemen in 2012 (including Austrian man Dominik Neubauer, pictured) The three Westerners were released in May last year after a multi-million-dollar ransom was paid. The documents show confusion over whether Daryl Jones, a joint Australian-New Zealand Muslim convert who was killed in the same drone strike as Mr Havard, was also linked to AQAP with one document saying Mr Jones was only 'probably' associated with the group. Another document says the pair were members of Al Qaeda. Mr Havard moved to Yemen in 2011, three years after converting to Islam following a troubled past. The Australian government first told the Dowricks their son was killed in a Yemeni air strike on mosque, before telling him it was a US strike on a car. Pictured is a file photo of a US unmanned Predator drone . After spending time in jail for stealing a car aged 16 he wanted to turn his life around. Mr Havard befriended a group of Muslim students while studying at James Cook University. He converted to Islam at the King Fahd mosque in Townsville in 2008 before moving to Christchurch in New Zealand and joining the local mosque. Mr Havard told his parents he encountered radical Islam at the Christchurch mosque but said he 'didn't agree with what they were teaching' so he moved to Dunedin.

Tribesmen attend a tribal gathering held following a police raid on a hideout of al Qaeda militants in the Arhab region, north of the Yemeni capital Sana'a on May 27 this year . Then in 2010 he surprised his parents with news that he was moving to Yemen to teach English. Mr Havard said his trip was fully paid for but he never told them who paid for it. The Dowricks stayed in contact with their son while he was in Yemen, but in 2012 they learned he was under suspicion from the government when they received a phone call from Australia's spy agency ASIO saying Mr Havard's passport had been cancelled. Since Mr Havard's death the Dowricks say they have received death threats and have been harassed on the street in Townsville. Mr Dowrick said now all he wants from the government is: 'The straight-out truth. No lies. The straight-out truth.'

"Gold Coast teenager Todd Elswick prompted a serious police response when spotted playing with a toy gun at home on Tuesday . A teenager on Queensland's Gold Coast had a very real-life experience while fooling around with a toy gun at a family gathering on Tuesday. Todd Eslick from Upper Coomera sparked a swift and strong response from police in the area and got the surprise of his life when a dog squad and officers in bullet-proof vests turned up at his home. Police officers stormed Clydesdale Drive around 10am while a police helicopter monitored the situation from above, while several nearby streets were sent into lock down. It is thought a spooked passerby made a call to police after another family member had pointed the fake weapon at their car. Todd told the Gold Coast Bulletin he and his family spotted the helicopter above while he was messing around at home, but they were unsure what it was doing. 'I saw the chopper and next thing I saw cops coming down with dogs,' he said. The 18-year-old told the publication that he then was ordered to the ground by an officer, who had his hand on his weapon. 'I got on the ground and they pat me down and stuff. They [police] are pretty big, a lot bigger than me. 'It was something to remember.' It is thought a spooked passerby made a call to police after another family member had pointed the fake weapon at their car . Todd's father, Les, said he was impressed that police were on the ball and he was glad they were doing their job efficiently. He also told the Bulletin he held no grudge for their unannounced arrival at the family event. A police spokeswoman said three police crews were sent to the scene with a fourth on standby should things have escalated, and the teenager will not face charges over the incident.","Todd Eslick was playing with a toy gun at a family gathering .
