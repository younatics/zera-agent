A benefits fraudster who fled the UK for the Costa del Sol ahead of his sentencing in 2008 has been jailed for three years. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith labelled the case as 'outrageous' when it emerged 70-year-old Norman Brennan had been at large in Spain for five years. He vowed to bring the pensioner back to face justice. Brennan had earlier admitting fraudulently claiming nearly £120,000 of various benefits before he skipped bail. Benefits fraudster Norman Brennan, from Merseyside, had been at large in Spain for five years before he was found by Sky News reporters . Some of the benefits were claimed in the name of his brother, Leslie, who had lived in Germany for nearly three decades. Brennan, formerly of Netherton, Merseyside, was given bail when sentencing was adjourned in July 2008 but gave authorities the slip and left the country. Last month, Sky News tracked down Brennan to the Spanish village of Mijas Costas, and asked him if he thought he should be in the UK. 'No,' was Brennan's response. Mr Duncan Smith told the news channel: 'I'm astonished. I'll certainly take this case away, and I know that I have myself fraud investigators who are out in Spain already. 'So, what we'll do is we'll check this case, and I can promise you that if they haven't done enough, they will now do their level best to get this man back. 'This sort of case is outrageous, and I'll deal with it.' Brennan (left), formerly of Netherton, Merseyside, was given bail when sentencing was adjourned in July 2008 but gave authorities the slip and left the country . Weeks later Brennan was detained on a European Arrest Warrant and extradited to Britain. Sentencing him today at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge David Aubrey QC told him: 'The law has finally caught up with you.' Brennan made the false claims between March 2001 and February 2008. His first bogus application was for Jobseeker's Allowance and council tax benefit when he failed to declare ownership of another property he inherited from his mother in December 2000. Emboldened by dishonestly receiving those benefits, he failed to notify the authorities a year later that he was now in work as a self-employed joiner - a job which he continued to do up to his arrest. Brennan had earlier admitting fraudulently claiming nearly £120,000 of various benefits before he skipped bail . Liverpool Crown Court heard Brennan made the false claims between March 2001 and February 2008 . The third strand of the fraud also . began in 2002 when he claimed Jobseeker's Allowance in the name of his . brother, Lesley, who in fact had been living in Germany for three . decades. He forged the . signature of his unsuspecting brother on benefit forms and he even . pretended to be him when he handed in identity documents to social . security staff, including a bogus ID card which showed his photograph. Brennan admitted seven counts of council tax, housing benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance fraud at the earlier hearing in 2008. Today . he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for those counts and given an . additional six months in prison for failing to surrender to bail when he . did not attend his original sentencing hearing. Judge . Aubrey told him: 'The claims in my judgment were dishonest through and . through. They were blatant. Week by week, month after month, year by . year, you were in effect stealing from the public purse. 'You have shown complete and utter disdain and contempt - not only for the welfare state but also the criminal justice system. 'The . fraud was persistent, prolonged and sophisticated. You were fleecing . the public purse with no compunction and in my judgment as a result of . sheer greed. Vernon Sanderson, Department for Work and Pensions regional fraud manager, said: 'We have worked hard with Sefton Council and the police to bring Brennan back to justice. 'Fraudsters need to know our investigators have the resources and powers to ensure we track them down wherever they hide and make sure they face the courts.'","Norman Brennan, from Merseyside, had been at large in Spain for 5 years .

Cash-strapped shoppers who use supermarket special offers in a  desperate attempt to trim their weekly food bill may end up paying more, research has found. A study of 75 popular products by Which? found that leading stores routinely use multi-buy promotions and special offers to wrongly give shoppers the impression that they are saving money. In one case, shoppers at Asda buying two packs of a popular yoghurt during a promotion paid £1 more than if they had bought them beforehand. Under another special offer,  customers were paying 50 per cent more for a packet of rice. With falling wages and higher bills eating into households’ disposable income, many hard-pressed families are looking to save money on their groceries. Four in ten say they are likely to cut back on food spending in the next few months, according to Which?, while 81 per cent say they are looking out for supermarket deals to help them save money. But the Which? research suggests such deals are not all they seem, despite eight of the leading retailers signing up to a new code to deliver honest prices. Asda, which was the only major chain not to adopt the guidance on how to describe offers, was found to have raised the headline price for a four-carton pack of Müller Light Greek Style Yoghurt from £1.50 to £2.18 – before introducing a ‘2 for £4’ multi-buy promotion. Asda also increased the regular price of Uncle Ben’s Express  Basmati rice from £1 to £1.58 as it went on a ‘2 for £3’ offer, a 50 per cent hike. Misleading? Researchers found stores like Sainsbury's put up prices for seven days, then offer 'cut price' for months . Difficult: Families are trying to cut their spend on food but confusing supermarket deals make it difficult . Which? found that Sainsbury’s sold packs of Carex Antibacterial Handwash at £1.80 for just seven days before launching an offer that stated ‘Was £1.80 now 90p’, which ran for 84 days. Similarly, Tesco sold Flash All Purpose Cleaning spray at an ‘original’ price of £2 for just 17 days, before selling at a ‘half-price’ of £1 for 47 days. Which? is demanding an end to misleading deals, clear rules on what defines an offer and tougher enforcement. Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘The stores have had long enough to sort their act out. We’re saying it’s time to Make Special Offers Special.’ The supermarkets blamed the examples identified by Which? on simple mistakes while the new code was introduced, rather than a deliberate attempt to fool customers. Asda said: ‘Sometimes mistakes can happen, but we would never deliberately mislead our customers – our aim is always to offer the  lowest prices for the longest.’","Which? found major supermarkets put up prices for a week then cut them .

A 13-year-old schoolboy was plied with four tumblers of vodka before a middle-aged woman tried to smother him to death with a pillow, a judge has heard. The child managed to fight off his attacker but as he dialled 999 for the police, she gulped down highly toxic anti-freeze in an apparent suicide attempt. Today the 43-year-old 'very intelligent' businesswoman Jane Rogers was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after she admitted a charge of attempted murder. She was told that she will not be released from hospital until the Government decides she no longer poses a threat to the public. A judge heard Rogers had tried to suffocate the 13-year-old boy while he slept. Pleaded guilty: Jane Rogers was ordered to be detained indefinitely at Reading Crown Court . She then downed toxic anti-freeze in an attempt to kill herself after the youngster leapt out of bed and called the police. The troubled businesswoman sobbed and dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock as the court heard she suffered from psychotic depression. Smartly-dressed Rogers, who was thin with her blonde hair in a short bob, was arrested following the incident on May 24 this year. Prosecutor Mike Roques said the spindly, bespectacled defendant had given the teenage boy four tumblers of vodka and fruit juice before he went to sleep at 1am. He added: 'He described waking up at 5.45am because he felt a force on his face and couldn’t breathe. '(She) was pushing a pillow down on his face. He was lying on his back and (she) was on her knees on the bed. 'Any killing of a child or attempt to kill a child is obviously an offence of great gravity. I don’t believe you disagree with that for one moment' Judge Stephen John, sitting at Reading Crown Court . 'He attempted to get up and she grabbed him and tried to push him back on to the bed. He was able to get away and run downstairs. 'He describes her as not saying anything after she came downstairs. She just looked down at the floor.' The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, called the police. When police arrived at the house in Reading, Rogers told them she had consumed toxic anti-freeze and had 'tried to take him with me.' She told officers: 'I decided this a week ago. I planned it. I tried to take him with me, I tried to smother him. 'I wanted to take him with me. I was going to kill him then myself so nobody else would be involved.' Judge Stephen John, sitting at Reading Crown Court, Berkshire, heard that spinster Rogers had suffered with depression stemming from an assault she had suffered some years earlier. The date was not specified in court. He was also told she had also battled alcohol problems and had two 'drink-related' convictions in 2001, and had received a caution for making threats to kill in 2004. Her defence barrister, Nigel Daly, said: 'She is a very intelligent woman. She had a career in business which was quite successful but she has had personal difficulties. 'She herself was subjected to a serious assault and developed an addiction to alcohol. She was also taking other drugs. 'She developed, over a period of time, what is described in the reports as psychotic depression.' Mr Daly said her condition worsened earlier this year when she left one job on the promise of another more high-profile position, which never materialised. 'If this defendant was not unwell, she would be facing a long period of imprisonment. But she is sick' Judge Stephen John . The court heard from consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Rami El-Shirbiny (corr), who said Rogers’ illness was very serious and posed a significant risk to others. After considering the psychiatric reports, Judge John sectioned Rogers under the Mental Health Act and said she would not be released until the Secretary of State was satisfied she was no longer a risk. 'If this defendant was not unwell, she would be facing a long period of imprisonment. But she is sick,' the judge said. Addressing Rogers directly, Judge John said: 'Any killing of a child or attempt to kill a child is obviously an offence of great gravity. I don’t believe you disagree with that for one moment. 'In many such cases, a long period of imprisonment would inevitably follow. But this case is not one of them because I consider that what you require is not punishment but help.' The judge ordered that Rogers be treated at the Littlemore Mental Health Centre in Oxfordshire. 'Any decision to release you from hospital will not be taken by the doctors responsible for your care but by the Secretary of State on recommendation from a Mental Health Tribunal,' he added. Rogers nodded and was in tears as she was led down from the dock.","Jane Rogers, 43, gulped down anti-freeze as the child called 999 .

'Shameful': The 27-year-old rapper scaled the lighting rig during his last song before asking spectators 'have you got my back?' Stunned Alex McCabe, 24, of Plymouth, Devon, captured the terrifying leap on video. He said: 'Watsky was obviously so pumped the crowd was loving him. At the start of the song he asked us if we had his back no matter what he did. Everyone shouted 'yes'. 'At the end he climbed the rigging, and as no one stopped him we thought it was scripted. He stood at the top and jumped. 'The crowd parted and he hit the concrete taking a couple of people with him.'

He wrote: 'I have no excuse for my actions, and the only way I can explain my mindset is that it was a huge overreach in the heat of the moment. No, I was not drunk or on drugs. 'I used to be a kid who was afraid to do anything physically dangerous - I was scared of the ball in little league, didn't want to jump into lakes and would never have had the nerve to crowdsurf. 'But in the last year of touring, I've done increasingly risky things, maybe pushing myself by some dumb sense I am conquering my early timidity.

A new mother died in a hospital maternity unit just moments after texting her husband to say she could come home with their first son. Nurses discovered Jane Whiteside, 41, slumped in a chair in a private room at Burnley General Hospital, an inquest heard yesterday. The building society manager was pale and unresponsive and her baby boy Ben was crying in the cot at her side. Grief: Jane Whiteside and her husband Stephen Whiteside. She was found dead in a hospital maternity unit on the morning she was due go home after giving birth to her first son . Midwives started to perform heart massage . on the patient while she was still in the chair and then moved her to . the floor where they continued resuscitation until a crash team arrived. The mother-of-two was declared dead 40 minutes later at 10.25am on September 22, 2011. Mrs . Whiteside’s family, from Burnley, in Lancashire, now face further . turmoil after doctors failed to reach a conclusion about the cause of . her death, the inquest was told. One pathologist has blamed the post-birth infection postpartem sepsis while another cited cardio respiratory arrest. The inquest was told Mrs Whiteside had attended Burnley General Hospital on September 22, 2011 for a pre-arranged caesarean section because of her scoliosis - curvature of her spine. Ben was delivered successfully the same day and after his mother came round from a general anaesthetic she was said to have been 'extremely happy and looking forward to the future'. Loss: Mrs Whiteside's mother Jean Ridehough leaving the inquest. She spoke of her concerns over the care her daughter received after the birth . Mrs Whiteside who also had a daughter Lucy, then aged five, had been eating fine and had been put on iron tablets after the birth. But her mother Jean Ridehough became concerned with the aftercare of her daughter when her legs became extremely swollen. She and Mr Whiteside were allowed into the recovery room where she said her daughter had been struggling with an oxygen mask and had felt nauseous. Mrs Ridehough, 59, who had seen her daughter every day up until her death told the inquest: 'I never felt the recovery was quite as good as it was with Lucy. 'I was really concerned about her legs, they were really swollen and misshapen but no one else appeared to be concerned when I asked about the lack of attention. 'You are very much left to feel responsible for your care, it was like a case of you have had your baby, recovery and go home. 'On the Saturday Jane wanted me to go in, she was a little tired, Lucy was singing to the baby, they were all extremely happy and looking forward to the future. A new family all together. 'That was the last time I ever saw her.' Mr Whiteside, 40, told the inquest: 'Scoliosis did restrict her in certain ways but it was not as if she was going to be an Olympic athlete. 'She could do day to day things like everyone else could do but sometimes things were a bit tough like picking Lucy up. Day to day she was fine.' Burnley General Hospital where the new mother was found dead three days after giving birth . He added that after the birth of Ben she didn’t suffer any more problems than another woman who had given birth yet had been 'groggy' from the operation but did have 'really swollen legs'. He said: 'Everything was very similar to when Lucy had been born. She wanted it (birth) out of the way and to carry on with life. She was groggy when she came round from the major operation but was happy she had a little boy and her family there.' 'There were never any particular complaints about anything in particular but I noticed she had really swollen legs. 'She could get about but was a bit of a strain.' Mr Whiteside said his wife had texted the morning of her death asking him to bring a bag so she could pack up her things and come home . Mr Whiteside told the Burnley hearing: 'She was wanting to come home but it hadn’t been said when she could come home. 'Jane was trying to push for the Sunday morning. 'As far as I’m aware it was going fine, she just wanted to come home and texted in the morning about 8am saying ""bring the bag which I’m going to be packing, I’m coming home"".' Health care assistant Wendy Fallows told the inquest that she had checked on Mrs Whiteside at around 8.40am, on the Sunday morning to see if she had been given breakfast and she had been asleep in the chair. She added: 'I had gone into the room and everything appeared peaceful, the baby was asleep and Jane appeared to be asleep, the (breakfast) tray was by her. 'I knew she had got her breakfast and that’s what I was checking. 'I looked in, I didn’t go in. It was a peaceful scene, all okay and no concerns. 'I had a good look because I needed to make sure she had had breakfast, I didn’t go in because she was asleep and the baby was asleep.' But an hour later Mrs Fallows returned to the room to collect the breakfast tray to find Jane still apparently asleep but with Ben crying . She added: 'She was in the same position she had been in before. I called out to her, there was no response. I walked past the baby and went to Jane in the chair, she appeared pale and unresponsive. 'I called her name and gently shook her, there was no response.' Midwife Jane Morris came into the room within seconds and started heart massage. Mrs Morris said: 'My first reaction was that she had passed away, there was no sign of life. I did what I could, what I thought was best at the time.' Sepsis, also known as blood poisoning or septicaemia, is the body's often deadly response to infection or injury. It is estimated that there are over 30,000 cases of severe sepsis in the UK every year. Once sepsis sets in, if left untreated, it can progress to septic shock and death. Worldwide, one-third of people who develop sepsis die. The most common cause of sepsis after surgery (including Caesarean section, which is major abdominal surgery) is infection. This could be infection of the incision, where the surgeon opened to perform the procedure, or an infection that develops after the surgery, such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection (UTI). The British Heart Foundation says that, in extreme cases, sepsis can trigger a cardiac arrest - when the heart stops beating.  Cardio respiratory failure is heart and lung failure and can lead on to a cardiac arrest. Anaesthetist Dr Samar Johana told the inquest that before the operation Mrs Whiteside had 'appeared well' and added that there had been no aspiration (breathing in a foreign object) due to the anaesthetic. Gynaecologist Dr Nikoletta Panagiotopoulou who carried out the C-Section said the procedure was performed with no complications and had been deemed successful. But coroner Mr Richard Taylor said that Mrs Whiteside’s family had been left with 'concerns, and confused' at her loss and why the cause if her death couldn’t be agreed by medical experts. The hearing continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Jane Whiteside died just days after the birth of her son Ben .

When a multi-millionaire couple decided to wind-down their business empire and move to Portugal they thought they were headed for sun, sea and relaxation. Instead it triggered a 12-year running battle with the tax authorities and now means the couple could face a £600,000 tax bill. Stephen and Pauline Rumbelow, who owned a grade 1 listed mansion and made a fortune in property development, insisted they had abandoned Britain as their home when they drove their Mercedes to the continent in April 2001. The couple bought 16th Century pile, Winnington Hall, near Northwich, which Mrs Rumbelow ran as a restaurant and conference centre - working so hard that she eventually suffered a breakdown . But the Salford-born parents-of-three, both aged 57, are now facing up to tax bills totalling almost £600,000 after a tribunal ruled that their hearts had stayed in England and they had continued to view their farmhouse, in Northwich, Cheshire, as their true home. From lowly beginnings as an engineering apprentice straight from school, Mr Rumbelow - who described himself as a 'hard hat man' - had built up a phenomenally successful building and property development business. The couple's energetic rise culminated in their purchase of 16th Century mansion, Winnington Hall, near Northwich, which Mrs Rumbelow ran as a restaurant and conference centre - working so hard that she eventually suffered a breakdown. That was the trigger for the couple's plan to 'tidy up' their business affairs, escape the stress of it all and make a new life for themselves on the continent, Judge Jonathan Cannan told the First-Tier Tax Tribunal. After briefly living in an unfurnished flat in Belgium - which was 'not to their taste' - the couple built themselves a villa - the 'Villa Rumba' - in Silves, Portugal, intending to 'lead the easy life' and settle down to enjoy the weather. However, their idyll was disturbed . when Revenue and Customs refused to accept that they were resident . abroad in the tax years 2001-2005 and hit them with retrospective tax . demands. The Rumbelows, who . lived at a farm in Crowton before their departure, argued that they had . intended to make their lives permanently abroad when they boarded the . Europe-bound train in 2001. The couple built themselves a villa - the 'Villa Rumba' - in Silves, Portugal, intending to 'lead the easy life' and settle down to enjoy the weather . After years of hard work to establish their fortune, they said they wanted to retire and hoped the move would benefit Mrs Rumbelow's health as well as 'improving their quality of life'. They said they had only since returned to England as visitors to see friends and family - and never for more than the 90 days-a-year, the threshhold then applied by the tax authorities for overseas residence. However, dismissing the couple's appeal, Judge Cannan noted Mr Rumbelow's 'deep suspicion' of the tax authorities and found that their departure had not marked 'a distinct break' with the UK. Their youngest daughter was only 15 when they headed abroad but had stayed behind in England. Although her mother 'would have liked nothing better' than for her to go with them to Portugal, she did not want to leave Northwich and could not be forced to move against her will. Noting the couple's, particularly Mrs Rumbelow's, close family links to Northwich, the judge said they had never sold the farm and were 'not merely travellers' when they stayed there during their frequent trips back to England. Although the couple protested that their intention to make their permanent home abroad 'could not have been more distinct or clear', the judge said that the farm had 'remained, essentially, a family home'. Mr Rumbelow had continued to be closely involved in winding down the couple's businesses and, although there had been some 'loosening' of their social and family bonds with Northwich, it was not 'substantial' enough to make them non-UK residents.","Stephen and Pauline Rumbelow insisted they had abandoned Britain for Portugal in 2001 .

A boy of 10 has written a heart-breaking letter to Santa asking him to cure his father of a deadly brain tumour. Ronnie Harris has told Father Christmas he has just one wish this year - help for Russell Harris, 32, as he fights for his life. The big-hearted youngster from Ipswich does not ask for a single present for himself. Ronnie said he would be the 'happiest boy in the whole world' if Father Christmas could make his poignant dream come true. Heartfelt: Russell Harris with sons Ronnie (right), 10, and Lennie (left), six. Ronnie has written a letter to father Christmas asking him to cure his father's cancer . Letter: Ronnie does not ask Santa for a single gift for himself this coming Christmas . His mother, Emma Harris, 31, found the poignant letter under her son's bed - and was moved to tears with pride. Mrs Harris, of Ipswich, Suffolk, said: 'I didn't even know he had it. 'I was just cleaning Ronnie's bedroom when I found it shoved under his bed. I was very touched. 'It was heart-wrenching to think that a child of his age doesn't want anything for himself for Christmas.' Proud: Ronnie's mother Emma with Lennie (left) and Ronnie (right). She says the letter moved her to tears . Mrs Harris, who looks after her stricken husband around the clock at home, added: 'It made me cry.'I felt so proud of him for thinking just of his dad and wanting him better.' She has known Mr Harris since they were three-year-olds growing up in the same neighbourhood in Ipswich. The childhood sweethearts started going out when they were teenagers, got married in August 2010 and also have a son Lennie, six. Dear Santa, . This Christmas I would like one specific thing this year. My dad has a really bad brain tuma (sic). Could you please find a cure for him to make him better and I will be the happiest boy in the whole world! Merry Christmas, . Yours sincerely, . Ronnie Harris . But they were left reeling when Mr Harris was struck down by a devastating brain tumour eight years ago. The malignant, inoperable growth has become more aggressive and is now classed as grade four severity, leaving him critically ill and taking every day as it comes. 'The boys have good days and bad days. I care for Russell 24 hours a day and make sure my kids do everything they need to. 'Every day is absolutely normal. I still take them to school - I do everything a mother would do,' said Emma. 'But it's hard to see when he's badly sick a lot. 'Ronnie does stuff 10-year-olds shouldn't have to do, like making his brother's breakfast and learning to cook.' She said Ronnie was distraught when his school recently finished runners-up in a table tennis competition because he so badly wanted to win for his father. But Mrs Harris said that despite her husband's illness, he has continued to attend all of his son's home matches for local football club Ipswich Valley Rangers FC. Brave: Ronnie helps his mother by looking after his little brother . 'Ronnie has dealt so maturely with his dad's illness,' she said. 'He's called an ambulance when Russell has been very unwell and learned new skills to help around the house.

Attack: David Rawson, 25, groped the woman in her bed after being mistakenly let into the room, Burnley Crown Court heard . A drunk wedding guest who managed to get into a woman's hotel room and groped her as she tried to sleep avoided a jail sentence after a judge told him 'you are no sexual predator'. David Rawson, 25, carried out his attack after being let in by the victim at 4am who wrongly assumed it was a female friend she was sharing a room with who was knocking on the door. She opened it and in the darkness did not realise it was former soldier Rawson so she went back to bed. The defendant then got in alongside the woman and began to grope her. The judge at Burnley Crown Court was told Rawson was was 'out of his head' after snorting . cocaine and drinking beer and wine during the wedding party at the 50-bedroom Oaks Hotel, in Brierfield, Lancashire. Prosecutor Mark Lamberty said Rawson had been invited to the wedding reception along with his victim. He said that as Rawson carried out his attack the victim suddenly realised what was happening and thrust him away before rushing to the reception area to try and get some help. Mr Lamberty said the woman returned to . her room and told the defendant to leave, but he refused. She got . dressed and left the room and police were called. After the incident a fight broke out between Rawson and his brother which culminated in him grabbing him by the neck and pinning him against the wall. He was eventually calmed down by others and started to cry. Rawson who works at a carpet making . factory was questioned, agreed he had been in a scuffle with his . brother, but denied going to the woman’s room and the sexual assault. But he admitted sexual touching and two counts of assault by beating following the incident on May 31. Defending him, David Bruce described the case as 'quite unusual and sad'. He said the year before, the defendant had left the Forces. Sex attack: The woman was staying at the 50-bedroom Oaks Hotel in Brierfield, Lancashire, in May when she was groped after a wedding reception . He added that Rawson had fallen out with his girlfriend of around a year a few weeks before the incident and had been hospitalised after trying to take his own life. Mr Bruce added: 'He has very little recollection of what went on that evening. He was out of his head. He had had a cocktail of anti-depressants, drugs and alcohol.' 'He describes this incident as at a time when he was in a very dark place. He can’t begin to explain it. He is devastated and feels very ashamed for what he has done on that particular evening.' Rawson, of Bury, was given 14 months in jail, suspended for two years, with 12 months’ supervision. He was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years. Judge Beverley Lunt told Rawson: 'I accept it’s wholly out of character for you and I accept it because you had taken of cocktail of alcohol and drugs. You are not a sexual predator. You are not a sexual danger to society. 'Drugs and alcohol abuse was the root of this entire incident.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 07:33 EST, 19 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:58 EST, 19 November 2013 . Gun-crime in the UK may still be rare, but a drive around our roads reveals that it is far closer to home than you might have thought. In fact, hundreds of road signs are peppered with bullet-holes, rather than pellet holes, made by ammunition from illegal firearms. From a No Stopping sign near the A40 in Oxfordshire that has been shot seven times to the Hungerford road sign near where Michael Ryan shot 16 people dead, many of our road signs are riddled with sinister bullet-holes - a result of gunmen using them as target practice. Sinister: This No Stopping sign near the A40 in Oxfordshire is riddled with what appear to be bullet-holes . This shot-at sign on the A614 in Humberside bears testament to the murky world of illegal firearms . Matt Seiber found this road sign near Hungerford, where Michael Ryan went on a shooting spree, killing 16 people . Former Marine Matt Seiber, 58, who has travelled the land in search of signs that have been shot at, says there is plenty of evidence of illegal firearms if you look for it. He believes Britain's road signs are being used by killers and other criminals to test their weaponry before they unleash it on a live target. 'I find evidence of people modifying shotguns, similar to what Raoul Moat did by putting weight into shotgun pellets,' he said. 'There are specific types of location that you find them in, and I get a gut feeling when I think I'm in the right spot.' His astonishing pictures show bullet-holes in hundreds of signs across 36 counties, some of which the Falklands veteran believe may have been put there by Britain's most notorious killers. Driving through Cumbria, close to where taxi driver Derrick Bird murdered 12 people in June 2010, Mr Seiber saw bullet-holes he believes were caused by Bird. This sign for an army barracks has a large hole in it and is located at a busy road junction in Oxfordshire . Mr Seiber says these holes were made by a high velocity rifle in the Oxfordshire countryside . 'I've found sights that I think could be linked to Derrick Bird; but it's impossible to be sure,' he said. He is also convinced about the road-sign outside Hungerford, the quiet Berkshire market-town where in 1987 Michael Ryan shot dead 16 people including his own mother before shooting himself dead. Before he embarked on his massacre, Ryan told an employer he liked to go out at night to shoot at things on the road-side. Mr Seiber, who photographed the local road sign with bullet holes, drives thoughout the country in his job as a corporate driver, and picks routes near scenes of notorious shootings. 'I will purposefully travel on a route that I think may have bullet holes in,' he said, adding that Oxfordshire and Cumbria had particularly high numbers of signs that had been shot at. This is the legacy of a round from a high velocity rifle that was fired from a field into a Warwickshire sign . Former Marine Matt Seiber believes the holes are caused by would-be criminals testing their illegal firearms . This sign outside the village of Cuddington in Buckingham has what looks like a bullet hole among the pelelts . Mr Seiber's interest in the subject began when he saw some men shooting at a road sign in Madrid years ago. 'I was 300m from a small road when I saw three guys firing hand-guns at a road sign,' he said. 'One of them started shouting at me, then suddenly they were shooting and bullets were flying over my head.' This narrow escape was followed by a stint in the Royal Marines, which familiarised him with guns, enabling Mr Seiber to identify what different models are being used on road signs. He said: 'The majority of weapons used are rifles and shotguns, not handguns so much.' Mr Seiber records his project on his website gunfire-graffiti, and has also written a book called Gunfire Graffiti: Overlooked Gun Crime in the UK.","Hundreds of road signs across the country are riddled with bullet-holes .

Cruelty was allowed to become 'normal' in the NHS at the time of the Stafford hospital scandal and neither staff nor ministers took any notice, Jeremy Hunt said yesterday. The Health Secretary promised to overhaul hospitals so they provide the 'safest, most compassionate and most effective' care in the world. He made a string of formal recommendations to drive up standards in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which hundreds of patients died needlessly and staff were said to have become 'immune' to the sound of pain. Named: Every patient will have the name of the doctor and nurse responsible for their care written above their bed, as part of measures to hold NHS staff to account . They include: . * Fines for hospitals if they try to cover up mistakes . * Every patient to have an allocated nurse and doctor, with the names posted above their beds . * Hospitals to publish the number of nurses working on each ward . * Doctors and nurses to be suspended or even struck off for not owning up to mistakes . * Doctors and nurses to face up to five years in jail if they wilfully neglect patients . * Failed managers to be blacklisted and barred from getting other jobs in the NHS. * Hospitals to put up 'how to complain' guides in wards. Up . to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at Mid . Staffordshire NHS Trust between 2005 and 2009, yet a damning inquiry by . Sir Robert Francis, QC, at the beginning of this year warned it could . happen again. The Government . has since been drawing up a series of recommendations to improve care . across the health service and prevent staff from trying to cover up . their mistakes. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) said that cruelty had become the norm in the NHS, and he warned it must never happen again while Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the government's words had to be followed by action . Outlining his response to the Francis . report in the Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt said: 'Cruelty became normal in . our NHS and no-one noticed. The inquiry shows the devastating effects . of overly defensive responses – hurting families, suppressing the truth . and preventing lessons being learned. 'The . NHS is a moral being or it is nothing. I do not simply want to prevent . another Mid Staffs, I want our NHS to be a beacon across the world, not . just for equity but its excellence. 'I want it to offer the safest, most compassionate and most effective care available anywhere and I believe it can.' The . proposals include fining  hospitals if they try to cover up  mistakes . which cause harm or death. Trusts could be made to pay out tens of . thousands of pounds to the NHS for the most serious errors. Every patients will also be given the name of a nurse and a consultant who is in charge of their care. Hospitals . will have to publish the number of nurses working on each ward and be . expected to put up 'how to complain' guides, with step-by-step . instructions for what patients and families should do if they are . unhappy. Mr Hunt told MPs patients needed to have confidence in the care they would receive from the NHS . The Francis Inquiry into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire heard hundreds of patients died there from 2005 to 2009 . They will also have . to publish  figures on the number of complaints every three months, . with details of what lessons have been learnt from each one. Staff . who do not immediately  own up to errors would face  tougher sanctions . than those who are honest, under proposals. NHS officials are liaising . with watchdogs to see whether honesty could be taken into account in . punishments. But Julie . Bailey, whose mother Bella died at Stafford Hospital, said she was . 'disappointed' that Mr Hunt's proposals did not go far enough. She and . other campaigners wanted new laws protecting whistleblowers from the . sack and a legal obligation for staff to be  honest with patients. Meanwhile, . former Labour health spokesman Diane Abbott admitted her party had made . it more important for nurses to take exams than to care. She . said: 'For many members of the public, one of the problems with general . standards of care may have been the push under a Labour government for . an all-graduate nursing profession. And there is a view that what that . has led to is elevating taking exams over and above basic levels of . care.' Alone: Dorothy Simpson, who died at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital . A hospital has apologised after a dying 84-year-old woman was forced to make a desperate call to her family after being abandoned by staff. Dorothy Simpson died 'frightened and alone' in a ward which resembled a 'ghost town' after doctors and nurses at Royal Bournemouth Hospital failed to come to her aid. The great-grandmother used her mobile to call son Steve as she struggled to breathe, without a single member of staff on the ward to help her. Her eldest son Jim rushed to the hospital, arriving 20 minutes later, but found that she had died alone with the bedside monitor alarm still sounding. Steve Simpson, 63, said the family were 'angry and devastated' at the appalling treatment of their mother. He said: 'She died alone and frightened because of the hospital's countless failings. If my mother had been given the care she deserved she would still be here today.' The retired decorator described the ward as a 'ghost town' and said Mrs Simpson, who suffered from a terminal lung disease, was left for a further four hours before a doctor arrived. The hospital has now admitted to a catalogue of shocking blunders in relation to the death on July 27 and apologised, following an internal inquiry.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reveals plans to prevent repeat of Mid-Staffs .

A cheating wife tried to hire a hitman to wipe her husband 'off the face of the earth' after she started a series of affairs with other men, a court heard. Kelly Cliff, 40, is accused of hatching a 'cold-blooded' two-year plot to kill Carl Gallagher, 47, following a string of relationships with other men. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the mother-of-two asked friend Dalton Bowen, 45, to arrange her estranged husband's death as she wanted to end their 22-year relationship 'once and for all'. Accused: Kelly Cliff, 40, who is on trial after allegedly trying to hire a hitman to wipe her husband 'off the face of the earth' But jurors were told 'violent' Bowen shopped his former neighbour to police telling officers: 'I may have a reputation for kicking a**- but I don't go around killing people'. Cliff made the calculated decision to cause or arrange the death of her husband on April 3 this year after leaving him for at least two other men, the court heard. Opening the case, prosecutor Hugh O'Brien-Quinn said: 'She wanted him dead - she wanted to be rid of him, rid of him permanently. 'It was a cold blooded calculated decision which she had thought about for two years. Their 22-year relationship was punctuated by numerous splits. 'These were caused by the defendant's affairs with other men. Then Carl Gallagher forgave her and they would get back together.' Mr O'Brien-Quinn said Cliff left the couple's home with another man in September last year. Although by Christmas she had moved back into the house in Aldridge, West Midlands. Cliff, 40, is accused of hatching a 'cold-blooded' two-year plot to kill Carl Gallagher, 47, following a string of relationships with other men . The mother-of-two (pictured) allegedly asked friend Dalton Bowen, 45, to arrange her estranged husband's death as she wanted to end their 22-year relationship 'once and for all' The court heard just four months later Cliff was again seeing another man which was when she decided to 'be rid of her partner once and for all'. Mr O'Brien Quinn added: 'In April this year she was seeing another man. 'She said it was just a bit of fun and nothing serious but against the background she decided to be rid of her partner once and for all. 'The reason she chose Dalton Bowen to kill her husband was because he was trusted as a friend, was a man of violence and somebody who was unlikely to speak to police'. However, the father-of-five was so shocked by the suggestion that he instead went to the police who arrested Cliff, jurors were told. Giving evidence Mr Bowen described the moment Cliff turned up at his home 'out of the blue' to ask how much it would cost to have her husband killed. Bowen, from Bilston, West Midlands, said: 'She said she wanted her partner killed, wiped off the face of the earth.

There was sufficient proof that former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had sex with an underage nightclub dancer in exchange for cash and jewellery a court in Italy has heard. New documents released to a Milan court today show that prosecutors were satisfied that Berlusconi had sex with Karima El Mahroug knowing she was underage - a consensus which led to his conviction in for using underage prostitutes earlier this year. The court handed Berlusconi a seven-year jail sentence in June for abuse of office and paying for sex with a minor. But although the judgement was made public at the time, the reasons behind conviction have remained secret until now. Protesting his innocence: Silvio Berlusconi always maintained he didn't know Ruby Heartstealer was when he paid her for sex . Underage: Moroccan Karima Keyek, nicknamed Ruby Heartstealer, was 17 when Berlusconi paid her for sex . But in an explosive document released today it is revealed that the court found 'it is proved that the defendant had sexual relations with Miss El Mahroug - known as Ruby the Heartstealer -  in exchange for considerable sums of money and other items such as jewellery.' Judges also concluded that the disgraced politician was the director of bunga bunga parties where female guests ' worked to satisfy the . desires of the defendant... staging lap dances and stripteases'. Following the high profile court case in June the three-time premier was found guilty of having sex with a minor and for abuse of office in trying to cover it up, but he still has two levels of appeal before the conviction and eventual punishment is confirmed by Italian courts. And the case involving Miss El Mahroug is just the latest in a long line of scandals that has seen the 77-year-old former leader rarely out of the Italian courts in the last few years. In August the disgraced politician lost his final appeal over a fraud conviction which handed him a four-year jail term. As a result he faces the loss of his senate seat for 24 months under a ruling by an appeals court in his home town of Milan. Under a 2012 law, anyone convicted to more than two years in prison cannot hold or run for office for six years. It is the second political ban process to be set in motion following Berlusconi's failed appeal this summer. Even before his conviction over Miss El Mahroug Berlusconi was already at risk of being kicked out of parliament under this law, as a result of a  five-year political ban for a previous tax fraud conviction. However, the court was ordered by Italy's highest judges to reassess the length of the ban after prosecutors admitting errors in sentencing. Mr Berlusconi's legal team have already pledged to appeal the two-year ban to Italy's highest criminal court - a move that could be rendered futile if the six-year expulsion is already in place. If approved by parliament, the ban will prevent Berlusconi from wholly participating in new elections - but he could remain the titular head of his party without holding political office. And shockingly Italian polls repeatedly show that many would still vote for him despite his outragous personal life. But despite losing his appeal the media tycoon is unlikely to see the inside of a jail any time soon. His four year sentence has already been reduced to one year - under an amnesty for crimes committed before 2006 -  because of his age and he has opted for the cushier choice of 12 months' community service. High flying: The court documents revealed that Miss Mahroug was given 'considerable sums of money' and jewellery to have sex with the Prime Minister . This means that although he will have to join other convicts in carrying out menial tasks, such as cutting the grass in public parks, painting sheltered accommodation or picking up litter he will not be punished with any form or imprisonment or even house arrest. But the conviction poses a serious threat to his decades-long political career and Berlusconi has threatened repeatedly to bring down Prime Minister Enrico Letta's broad left-right coalition government if the Senate votes to expel him from parliament on Nov. 27. It's not all bad news though as the former premier did eventually find one court on his side a judge in Monza has cut his alimony payments in half - to a mere £1.2million a month. He had previously been ordered to pay ex-wife Veronica Lario, whom he first met when he saw her topless on stage, a cool £2.5million a month. Berlusconi was famously divorced in 2009 by Miss Lario after she saw him photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party. At the time she said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties. Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling another woman - a guest at a TV awards dinner - that he wanted to marry her instead. Bitter dispute: Veronica Lario and Berlusconi pictured in 2004 before she filed for divorce in 2009. In an open letter open published around the same time she said she and her children had suffered through her husband's affairs . 'If I wasn't married, I would marry you right away, ' he told showgirl turned politician Mara Carfagna. Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25. He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44. Last month he reportedly married his fiancée in a secret wedding at his private chapel. The three-time Italian premier, who is nearly 50 years older than his bride, wed former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 28, at a church inside his palatial villa near Milan in early October. The couple, who met when Miss Pascale was a teenage activist in Berlusconi's his Forza Italia party, wed despite a string of allegations that their relationship is ‘a sham’. Miss Pascale is seeking Euro 10million damages after a TV station broadcast claims by Bulgarian actress Michele Bonev that she is in fact a lesbian. She says the comments are defamatory.","Berlusconi was handed a seven-year jail sentence in June for having sex with the underage dancer whose real name is Karima El Mahroug .

Normally the picture of composure, Microsoft chairman revealed his softer side on Tuesday as he choked up during company CEO Steve Ballmer's final shareholders meeting as chief executive today. The co-founder of the software giant said progress was being made to find Ballmer's replacement and he thanked him for serving as CEO for the last 13 years. Only Gates and Ballmer have led Microsoft Corp. since its founding 38 years ago. Teary: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates choked up as he ended his remarks at the company's annual shareholders meeting today . Gates grew emotional while saying that both he and Ballmer are committed to making sure 'that the next CEO is the right person for the right time for the company we both love.' Ballmer, who said in August that he would step down within 12 months, was mostly light-hearted at what he called a 'unique and fun meeting.' One shareholder suggested a U.S. government cabinet post as an information technology secretary be created for Ballmer. The outgoing CEO replied that he didn't think the job would make sense, adding 'but thank you for trying to help me find work.' Big shoes to fill: Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer (pictured) said in August he would step down from the top job . Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, front right, sits with other company officers at today's annual shareholders meeting in Bellevue, Washington . The company, based in Redmond, Washington, said today that all of its proposals were approved. Board nominees, including Ballmer and Gates, were re-elected with each nominee backed by more than 90 percent of the votes cast. Gates thanked Ballmer for his 33 years at Microsoft, 13 of them as CEO and made the point that for such a large corporation, it was unusual that there had only been two CEO's - him and Ballmer. 'Steve and I really appreciated all the joys and challenges that came with being CEO,' he said. 'It’s a real privilege to lead the incredibly talented group of employees we have. It’s a privilege to work on the technology that’s changed the world.' Business partners and friends: Redmond, Washington State, USA --- Original caption: Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer during a press conference at Redmond in 2000 . Gates choked up when talking about two other things that he and Ballmer share: 'We’ve got a commitment to make sure that the next CEO is the right person for the right time for the company we both love. 'And we share a commitment that Microsoft will succeed as a company that makes the world a better place.' Gates said on Tuesday he was pleased with Microsoft Corp's progress in finding a new chief executive but outlined the difficulties in picking the next leader of the world's largest software company as it seeks to reinvent itself as a mobile computing power. Gates is part of the four-man committee that gave itself a year to find a successor to Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer after he announced his plan to retire in August. Sources close to the process have said the search is down to a handful of candidates, but the company itself has been largely silent. Beginnings: Redmond, Washington State, USA --- Microsoft co-founder and CEO Bill Gates with other Microsoft executives: Steve Ballmer (left) and Mike Maple (center) 'We've been doing a lot of meetings with both internal and external candidates and we're pleased with the progress,' said Gates at Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting in Bellevue, Washington. 'We're looking at a number of candidates and I'm not going to give a timeline today.' Ballmer said in August he planned to retire within 12 months, and the CEO search committee - headed by lead independent director and former IBM executive John Thompson - tasked itself with finding a replacement by the end of that period. Sources close to the company expect an appointment no later than January. Gates, who in previous years did not address the shareholders' meeting with prepared remarks, went on to describe the challenges of finding the right person to lead Microsoft. 'It's a complex role to fill - a lot of different skills, experience and capabilities that we need,' he said. 'It's a complex global business the new CEO will have to lead. The person has to have a lot of comfort in leading a highly technical organization and have an ability to work with our top technical talent to seize the opportunities.' Indeed, few CEOs wielded more power than Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer. And yet the company's first and foremost salesman never gained the respect he deserved for his role in transforming Bill Gates' tiny startup in the woods outside Seattle into the world's largest software maker. Ballmer had the misfortune to follow megastar Gates at the helm just as the company hit the end of its explosive growth period and faced a resurgent Apple Inc under an inspired Steve Jobs. The Detroit native, who met Gates at Harvard, was doubly unfortunate that his ascent to the CEO office in January 2000 came just weeks before the bursting of the dot.com stock bubble, from which Microsoft's share price never recovered. Salesman and software genius: Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates at a PC Forum in 1986 in Phoenix, Arizona . Although Ballmer did treble revenues at Microsoft during his time in charge, and managed to steer the company away from obscurity or crisis that befell other tech firms, he consistently attracted criticism for management miscues. Under his watch, Apple and Google Inc roared past Microsoft in the emerging arena of Internet search, smartphones and tablets, which made the software company look stodgy and behind-the-times. 'He tried hard. Nobody can doubt his commitment to Microsoft,' said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. ""The missing element was execution."" His attempt to catch up was a failed $47 billion bid for fading internet giant Yahoo Inc in 2008, a company which is now worth much less. Yahoo's inexplicable decision to reject the deal probably saved Ballmer's job. Ballmer never lacked passion and energy for the company he helped to build, but he was always more of a salesman and cheerleader than a technology visionary. 'That is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers,' Ballmer laughed in a TV interview after the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007. Five years later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft's overall revenue. Bill Gates (R), chairman of Microsoft, and Steve Ballmer (L), ceo and president of Microsoft, talk to members of the media during Forum 2000 at Microsoft headquarters 22 June 2000 in Redmond, Washington . A clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million times on YouTube, gaining him the nickname 'Monkey Boy'. And his hypnotic and slightly unhinged mantra of 'developers, developers, developers', captured at another company conference, made him the butt of jokes for years after. A natural math whiz from Michigan, Ballmer met Gates at Harvard before Gates dropped out to co-found Microsoft in 1975. Five years later, Gates persuaded Ballmer to drop out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft's first commercial manager, and only the company's 30th employee, giving him an 8 percent stake. As Microsoft's first salesman, rather than a techie, he was viewed with some distrust. 'The first time we met face-to-face, I thought this guy looks like an operative for the NKVD (Soviet police),' recalled Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in his memoir. 'He had piercing blue eyes and a genuine toughness. Though as I got to know him better, I found a gentler side as well.' Allen said that the young Ballmer - a zealous basketball player and jogger - would wake him up at 7 a.m. doing push-ups in their shared hotel room on early business trips. As Microsoft engineered the personal computer revolution through the 80s and 90s, the sales side of the organization grew in size and importance, led by the charismatic Ballmer - unmistakable on campus and at industry meetings with his shiny bald dome, strapping physique and booming voice. In Microsoft-speak, employees were either a 'Bill guy', meaning a technology person, or a 'Steve guy', meaning a sales and marketing person. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer (L) and Chairman Bill Gates (R) answer questions 01 November 2002 in Redmond, Washington . When Ballmer, known internally as SteveB, took over from Gates as Microsoft CEO in 2000, some saw it as the triumph of sales over technology and innovation, which ultimately ruined the company. 'I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft,' former Apple CEO Jobs is quoted as saying in his biography. 'The quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen.' Jobs was partially correct. Under Ballmer's watch, Microsoft missed the shift to smartphones and tablets, and its share price has been static for the last decade. All the while, Ballmer tended to push out any executives who threatened his power. 'His (Ballmer's) continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock,' prominent hedge fund investor David Einhorn said in 2011, as he campaigned publicly for Ballmer's ouster. Microsoft shares rose 7 percent on the news of Ballmer's retirement on Friday. But Ballmer's record as a CEO was not as bad as many think. People close to him say his loud public persona belied a quietly shrewd business mind, and he managed Microsoft as well as anyone could as the company reached a mature stage. He boosted Microsoft's revenues and more than doubled its already large profits. He outlasted erstwhile rivals such as Novell and Sun Microsystems, which have now all-but disappeared, and avoided the boardroom fiascos of Hewlett-Packard or dramatic decline of AOL. 'I don't see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer,' said Eric Jackson at hedge fund Ironfire Capital.","Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer attended his final shareholders meeting today as chief executive .

Labour faced further damaging questions last night about its links with shamed Co-op bank chief Paul Flowers. Pictures emerged of a lavish reception hosted by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls at 10 Downing Street for drug abuser Flowers and fellow Co-op grandees while Labour was in power. Three meetings followed between Flowers and Mr Miliband. Hospitality: Paul Flowers (centre) at Downing Street for the launch of a Co-op venture in 2010 . It also emerged that Labour knew two years ago that Flowers had been forced to resign as one of the party’s city councillors after gay porn was found on his computer. But it appears the Co-op was not told – allowing him to continue until June as its banking chairman, a position from which he helped to approve massive donations to Labour and Mr Balls. The Tories last night urged Mr Miliband and Mr Balls to ‘come clean’ about their links with Flowers, who has been suspended from the party. Both men have been scrambling to distance themselves from the disgraced Methodist minister since the Mail on Sunday captured him on film buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth. Labour support: Ed Miliband at the same function with Co-op chairman Len Wardle (left) But last night damaging details were emerging about the extraordinary position he had held at the heart of Labour. At the Downing Street dinner in February 2010, Flowers can be seen drinking wine and mingling with guests, who included a string of Labour ministers. Mr Miliband is pictured laughing and joking with Len Wardle, another senior Co-op figure who quit as the group’s chairman yesterday because of ‘serious questions’ over his decision to appoint Flowers to the bank’s board. Mr Balls, one of 32 Labour MPs who receive financial sponsorship from the Co-op, was also pictured networking at the event, which was held to launch the ‘Friends of the Co-operative ideal’. A report of the event, in Co-operative News, reveals that Mr Miliband was ‘in demand’ from senior Co-op figures because he was in charge of Labour’s manifesto for the election that May. A few months later, Flowers, who describes Mr Balls as a ‘political friend’ was appointed to the Co-op’s ‘political strategy working group’. Along with Mr Wardle, he approved millions of pounds in donations to the Labour and Co-operative parties, including a £50,000 donation to Mr Balls. Despite the economic crisis – and the Co-op’s dire finances – the group has increased its political donations from £664,000 in 2008 to £880,000 last year. Flowers boasted to MPs earlier this month that he had helped oversee an increase in the maximum annual donations to £1.15million before stepping down. Following the Number 10 dinner, Mr Miliband appointed Flowers to his exclusive business advisory board. The Labour leader went on to hold dinners with Flowers and other business figures at Westminster restaurants in July and November of 2011. This March, he invited Flowers for private talks at his Commons office. The following month the Co-op Bank threw Labour a financial lifeline with a £1.2million loan. In a letter to the Labour leader, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps demanded answers to nine critical questions, including what the Labour leadership knew about Flowers’ resignation from Bradford council and what personal dealings Mr Miliband had with him while the Co-op was doling out cash to Labour. Mr Shapps wrote: ‘The latest revelations about the conduct and behaviour of Paul Flowers have shocked and appalled the public. 'They have also raised serious questions about the Labour Party to which you have not yet adequately responded.’ Tory MP Brooks Newmark, a member of the Commons Treasury committee, which is investigating the near-collapse of the Co-op during Flowers’ time as chairman, said there were also questions about whether Labour had been involved in his extraordinary rise. Mr Newmark said: ‘Labour need to come clean about exactly what place Paul Flowers held in the Labour hierarchy. 'We know that the Rev Flowers’ judgment was deeply flawed, no doubt not helped by whatever drugs he was taking. ‘But the question does arise whether, in spraying shareholders’ money around to the Labour Party, including an extraordinary gift of £50,000 to Ed Balls, was he engaged in some sort of payback for being given this £132,000 bank job for which he was manifestly ill-suited? 'We know there is a special relationship between Labour and the Co-op – did the Rev Flowers receive support from Labour in getting the job?’ Flowers boasted to MPs earlier this month that he had helped oversee an increase in the maximum annual donations to £1.15million before stepping down . Flowers was a senior Labour councillor before rising to prominence in the Co-op movement. The inappropriate material that cost him his council seat was found when he gave his laptop to the Bradford authority’s IT department for a routine servicing. Shocked council officials confronted him with the images, and he resigned immediately. But in public, he pretended he was leaving for family reasons and because of his high-pressure role at the Co-op Bank. Yesterday, a spokesman for Bradford Council said: ‘Inappropriate but not illegal adult content was found on a council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for servicing.

At the time, the then leader of the council, Councillor Ian Greenwood, paid tribute to his work and called him ‘a highly gifted individual who has made an enormous contribution as a member of the executive’. Mr Miliband and Mr Balls both deny having close links with Flowers. Labour refused to comment in detail on the fresh allegations yesterday. A spokesman said: ‘Ed Miliband and the Labour leadership have been as shocked as anyone at the recent revelations regarding Paul Flowers. That is why we have taken immediate action and suspended him from the Labour Party.’ Mr Balls was under further pressure last night to hand back a £50,000 donation from the Co-op. Mr Newmark said: ‘Mr Balls should ask himself whether it is right to accept that money and consider giving it back.’ A spokesman for Mr Balls insisted there was no reason to return the money as it had been properly donated by the Co-op Group.","Flowers attended a Downing Street reception hosted by Miliband and Balls .

But it was not Oliver’s hero, the fearless fictional TV firefighter, who arrived on the Cahill doorstep. It was a female police officer. The three-year-old was not impressed, telling her: ‘I wanted Fireman Sam.’ Little Oliver Cahill (pictured with his mother Leanne) picked up the phone, dialled 999 and asked to speak to Fireman Sam, sparking an emergency response. But he was less than impressed when a female police officer answered the call . Oliver’s parents Andrew and Leanne let him play with the phone when it is unplugged at their home in Blackpool, but on this occasion a friend had left it connected and PC Claire Van Deurs Goss came to investigate the 999 call. ‘I think it tickled her a bit,’ Oliver’s mother said. Ms Cahill, 31, said: 'My friend had borrowed it to phone their doctor and must have left it plugged in. 'I saw Oliver playing with it in the dining room and thought nothing of it. Three-year-old Oliver had been using the phone, which parents Andrew and Leanne usually leave unplugged for him to play with, and made it through to the emergency services. But he told the WPC investigating the call: 'I wanted Fireman Sam' 'When the officer came up the path I thought, ""Oh my gosh"" because I’ve never had any problems with the police.

'He’s been on the phone a few times since but it’s been unplugged. 'Every time he says the same thing, he wants to speak to Fireman Sam.' PC Van Deurs Goss, who was called to the incident, said: 'When I attended his mum was shocked to see the police there.

Ministers have vowed to continue immigration checks at Tube and train stations - despite allegations of 'racial profiling'. Immigration minister Mark Harper said one in three of the illegal immigrants caught during operations this summer had already been deported. He defended the operations, which took place this summer, as part of efforts to encourage migrants with no right to be in Britain to return home. (File picture) Police carry out checks at Waterloo Station in London. Ministers have said that immigration checks will continue . Speaking to the World At One on BBC Radio 4 he said: 'Yes, there will be more of them. 'We base these operations on intelligence, so where we have cause to think we are going to be successful in targeting people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom, not based on racial profiling, they're based on intelligence and on the behaviour of individuals. 'We will continue to use them because they're effective in targeting people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom and who we should be removing.' On July 30 immigration officials carried out 29 stops at Kensal Green Tube station in North London, and arrested three people. At Walthamstow, East London, a total of 48 people were stopped, leading to 14 arrests. One further person was arrested by British Transport Police in Stratford. Out of the 18 arrests, six have been deported, ten are going through the deportation process and two have claimed asylum. Increased vigilance: Immigration checks at Heathrow Airport, west of London . Mr Harper said the operations had been 'very successful.' He said such operations were carried out under the last government since 2008. He added: 'All our operations are intelligence-led, so clearly I want them to be as effective as possible.' “Would I like to arrest more people as a proportion of those we encounter? Yes I would.' At the time of the operations, Migrants rights groups accused the Home Office of turning Britain in to a 'hostile environment' for illegal workers, and demanded an amnesty allowing them all to stay. UKIP leader Nigel Farage also criticised the raids, telling Sky News: 'Spot checks and being demanded to show your papers by officialdom are not the British way of doing things.'

Death: Leisure centre lifeguard Jake Harris, 21, was said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night house party in Manchester . A father-to-be died after slitting his own throat with a broken wine glass when he suffered a devastating reaction to a legal high. Jake Harris, 21, is said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night party after taking a mind-bending drug known as N-Bomb. As he was suffering terrifying hallucinations, Mr Harris, a leisure centre lifeguard, was heard shouting and pleading: 'I want it to stop.' He then broke a wine glass on a bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat open. The legal high, which was banned in the UK just days after the incident, has been blamed for half a dozen deaths in the US. Similar in chemical make-up to LSD, it can give the distorted appearance that time and movement are going faster or slower. Colour, sound and objects can get distorted visually and users can experience extreme double vision. An inquest heard that Mr Harris and friend Steven Higgins, 27, had gone to a party at the luxury flat of Heather Turner, 28, near Manchester city centre. The court was told she had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his friend. He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect before visiting the Glastonbury festival. The inquest was told that the party in May this year went on all night and in the morning Mr Harris and Mr Higgins went to shops to get more alcohol. Miss Turner said: 'As they got back they said they had taken LSD but they didn't seem any different at all – I didn't notice any changes. They brought vodka back but I'm not sure it was opened. We just sat on the bed talking and I fell asleep after a few hours.' She said she was woken at around noon by Mr Higgins shouting 'calm down' at his friend who was sitting on the apartment floor. 'When I turned round I remember Jake was sat next to the floor-to-ceiling window and he jumped up off the floor and threw himself at it. He hit the window with his shoulder and got caught in the blind and landed on the floor.' Involved: Steven Higgins (pictured) supplied the N-Bomb drug to Jake believing it to be LSD, which he wanted to 'test' before visiting the Glastonbury music festival in June, the inquest was told . Dangerous: During a hallucinogenic experience, father-to-be Mr Harris was heard shouting 'I want it to stop' Scene: Mr Harris went to a luxury flat at the Spectrum apartment complex near Manchester city centre . N-Bomb is known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana. Noah Carrasco, 18, of Scottsdale, Arizona, died in January after taking N-Bomb, which he mistakenly thought was LSD. Anthony Carlson, also 18 and from Scottsdale, died three months later after taking just a few drops of the drug up his nose. And Clayton Otwell, 21, of Little Rock, Arkansas, died in October 2012 after taking a single drop of the drug at a festival. Other deaths have been reported to be linked to N-Bomb over the last few years in California, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia. The drug can be consumed in powder or liquid form. Miss Turner told the inquest in . Bolton: 'Steven got up and had his arms around him and told him to calm . down. They landed back on the bed and next to the bed was a chest of . drawers and a box with glasses in it. 'There were two wine glasses and he . grabbed one of them and smashed it on the side and then stabbed himself . in the side of the throat. Steven let go of his arm and he continued to . put the glass in his throat.' The pair ran outside to alert neighbours and immediately called an ambulance before running back into the apartment. Miss Turner added: 'As we walked back . in Jake was lying down the side of the bed. I was grabbing towels to . stop the blood but I couldn't go near him. I was so scared.' Mr Higgins said he 'didn't feel . massively different' after taking the N-Bomb drug and claimed his friend . was still in good spirits at 10am. But he became more and more agitated before trying to shoulder charge his way through a first-floor window of the apartment. Mr Higgins added: 'He said he wanted . it to stop and it was different to anything he had ever done before. 'I . told him to relax as much as possible. He was agitated for about half an . hour before he threw himself at the window – it wasn't all of a . sudden.' He then broke a wine glass on a . bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat from the ear . to the opposite side of his chest. Despite efforts by paramedics and . doctors to stem the blood loss Mr Harris, of Manchester, died ten hours . later from his injuries in hospital. Tests showed he had taken the . 251-NBOMe drug – a recently discovered psychedelic substance which was a . 'legal high' at the time of his death on May 28. The drug has been banned since June . 10, 2013 under a temporary class drug order and will remain illegal for . at least 12 months while drug experts consider the full range of harms.

This tiny koala has spent the past six months tucked up cosy and warm in its mum’s pouch. And as it poked its sleepy head out, the joey seemed reluctant to venture much further into the chill Edinburgh air. Britain’s first-ever joey, which was born at the city’s zoo in May, emerged fully from the pouch of his mother Alinga for the first time at the weekend. This koala, Britain's first-ever joey, emerged fully from the pouch of his mother for the first time this weekend . Alinga, the joey's mother, aged two, became the zoo's first female koala when she arrived in February . Its sex has not yet been determined by its keepers. Zoo spokesman Lorna Hughes said: ‘A lot of people expected the joey to just suddenly appear one day but the process has been more gradual. ‘The first thing we saw was a pink arm poking out, with no fur. Now the whole joey is starting to come out and we can see it has developed a beautiful grey fur coat.’ Born blind with no ears or fur, it has spent the past six months developing in Alinga's pouch. After growing almost all of its fur, the creature recently became active at night and started climbing on its mother's back. Zoo keepers monitored the youngster's late night activity on CCTV but excited zoo visitors were limited to the odd glimpse of a nose or arm. Born blind with no ears or fur, the joey has spent the past six months developing in its mother's pouch . The joey finally emerged in daylight for the first time on Sunday and is now set to be a star attraction at the zoo. Koalas are marsupials native to the southern and eastern coasts of Australia and Edinburgh is the only British zoo housing any. Alinga, aged two, became the zoo's first female koala when she arrived in February. She fell pregnant during her first introduction to male Goonaroo. Koalas are marsupials native to Australia and now Edinburgh is the only British zoo housing any . The zoo's head of living collections, Darren McGarry, said: ‘As koalas are solitary animals, bringing them together for mating required a lot of skill. ‘So for Alinga to breed successfully, on the first attempt is a great accomplishment for the team. ‘We have worked with koalas for eight years now and everybody is completed devoted to their care. ‘Each of our three adult koalas - Alinga, Goonaroo and Yabbra - have very distinct characters and we cannot wait to see what sort of character our little joey has.’ Alinga will carry the joey on her back until it is aged around one. When it reaches sexual maturity at around two, the joey will begin a breeding programme. Alinga, who has been in Edinburgh for just less than a year, will carry the joey on her back until it is aged one . If it is female it may stay at Edinburgh Zoo to breed with male Yabbra. But if it is male it will be moved elsewhere in Europe. Edinburgh Zoo has been part of the European breeding programme for koalas for eight years. Despite being one of Australia's most iconic animals, koala numbers are in decline in the country due to habitat loss. A koala's diet consists solely of Eucalyptus leaves, a plant that is toxic to most other animals. The Edinburgh Zoo koalas receive a wide variety of Eucalyptus species fresh every day.

You would not be the only one thinking Halloween is back when looking at this creepy gathering of demon-children, a possessed little girl and adults with vacant stares. However, this is not a an Addams holiday snap, but the official portrait of three generations of the Danish royal family. The painting of Queen Margrethe II, her two sons and their families has been accused of bearing a closer resemblance to a horror film poster than a royal portrait. The royal Addams family: From left to right are: Princess Isabella, Crown Prince Frederik holding Prince Vincent, Princess Mary holding Princess Josephine, Queen Margrethe II, Prince Christian, Queen Margrethe's husband Prince Henrik, Prince Henrik - son of Joachim, Princess Marie holding Princess Athena, Princes Nikolai and Felix from Joachim's first marriage and last - but not least - Prince Joachim . 'Is the Danish Royal Family starring in a sequel to The Omen?,' one Twitter user posted in response to the image. The portrait sees the young Prince Christian, second in line to the Danish throne, stand in the foreground with visible bags underneath his eyes and an eerie glow around him. Next to him, on the floor, sits his sister Isabella, who has been turned from her normal adorable cherub-self into a creepy come-alive doll creature with blue-brown lips, rubbing her hands. In the background on the right are Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian wife Princess Mary, holding their two youngest - twins Vincent and Isabella. Left are Prince Joachim and his French princess Marie, holding their young daughter Princess Athena. Both wives are staring at their children, while their husbands take a regal stand and stare into the distance, a rather unconventional interpretation of the role of a woman in a country proud to be one of the world’s most gender neutral nations. In a better light: From left to right are Prince Joachim, his sons Prince Felix and Prince Nikolai, Queen Margrethe II, Crown Prince Frederik holding Prince Christian, and Crown Princess Mary, in 2006 . Creepy dolls: Adorable Christian and Isabella, pictured with their parents in 2007, have been made to look more like the children of the undead in the portrait . The only three to have eye contact with the viewer are the Queen, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Christian as current or future rulers of Denmark. On the floor playing with Denmark's pride and joy - Lego - are Prince Felix and Prince Nikolai, the two sons from Prince Joachim's first marriage to Hong Kong-born Briton Alexandra Manley, now Countess Alexandra of Frederiksborg. The Lego is said to symbolise the two young boys rebuilding their lives following their parents divorce. The couple standing in the ruins in the background is the painter Tomas Kluge and his wife.

The former children's laureate and author of  War Horse, said listening sessions where students are not tested on what they have heard would teach young people to rediscover their love for reading. Morpurgo, himself a former teacher, said he believes books are primarily to be enjoyed and that the current education system makes texts seem like working tools which are used solely to improve English. In a direct message to the education minister, the writer said a change in culture was required to change attitudes towards reading. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'You cannot force this medicine down their throats and say ""you have to learn this because you’re going to be tested on it"".' 'It’s really, really important for . children to have these moments in the school day for contemplation, there must be no questions afterwards, no comprehension exercises . and no testing.

Iran has struck a historic deal with the United States and five other world powers, agreeing to a temporary freeze of its nuclear programme in the most significant agreement between Washington and Tehran in more than three decades of estrangement. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani endorsed the agreement, which commits Iran to curb its nuclear activities for six months in exchange for limited and gradual sanctions relief, including access to £2.5bn from oil sales. The six-month period will give diplomats time to negotiate a more sweeping agreement. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrive sat Stansted Airport, today. He flew in from Geneva in Switzerland were a deal has been reached between six world powers and Iran that calls on Tehran to limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief . EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton (3rd from left) delivers a statement on the agreement. Foreign secretary John Hague was in attendance (far left) Foreign Secretary William Hague, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, and US . secretary of state John Kerry were among those in Geneva, Switzerland, . working on a deal that was acceptable to Tehran. It builds on the momentum of the public dialogue opened during September's annual UN gathering, which included a 15-minute phone conversation between President Barack Obama and moderate-leaning Mr Rouhani, who was elected in June. The package includes freezing Iran's ability to enrich uranium at a maximum five per cent level, which is well below the threshold for weapons-grade material and is aimed at easing Western concerns that Tehran could one day seek nuclear arms. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani speaking during a press conference on November 24, 2013 in Tehran a day after a deal was reached on the country's nuclear programme . Mr Obama hailed the pact's provisions, which include curbs on Iran's enrichment and other projects that could be used to make nuclear arms, as key to preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear threat. 'Simply put, they cut off Iran's most likely paths to a bomb,' he said. For Iran, keeping the enrichment programme active was a critical goal. Iran's leaders view the country's ability to make nuclear fuel as a source of national pride and an essential part of its insistence at nuclear self-sufficiency. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives at Geneva International airport in Geneva, Switzerland on Saturday . Giving up too much on the enrichment programme would have likely brought a storm of protest by Iranian hard-liners, who were already uneasy over the marathon nuclear talks and Mr Rouhani's outreach to Washington. In a nationally broadcast speech, Mr Rouhani said the accord recognises Iran's 'nuclear rights' even if that precise language was kept from the final document because of Western resistance. 'No matter what interpretations are given, Iran's right to enrichment has been recognised,' said Mr Rouhani. Anger: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the world powers' nuclear agreement with Iran as an 'historic mistake' that left the production of atomic weapons within Tehran's reach . Saying 'trust is a two-way street,' he insisted that talks on a comprehensive agreement should start immediately. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who led his country's delegation, called on both sides to see the agreement as an 'opportunity to end an unnecessary crisis and open new horizons'. But initial reaction in Israel was strongly negative. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called the deal, a 'historic mistake'. Speaking to his Cabinet, Mr Netanyahu said Israel is not bound by the deal and reserves the right to defend itself. That is a reference to possible military action against Iran. Mr Netanyahu has said the international community is giving up too much to Iran, which it believes will retain the ability to produce a nuclear weapon and threaten Israel. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who joined the final negotiations along with the foreign ministers of Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany, said the pact will make US allies in the Middle East, including Israel, safer reducing the threat of war. 'Agreement in Geneva,' he tweeted. 'First step makes world safer. More work now.' The deal marks a milestone between the two countries, which broke diplomatic ties 34 years ago when Iran's Islamic revolution climaxed in the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. A White House statement said the deal limits Iran's existing stockpiles of enriched uranium, which can be turned into the fissile core of nuclear arms. The statement also said the accord curbs the number and capabilities of the centrifuges used to enrich and limits Iran ability to 'produce weapons-grade plutonium' from a reactor in the advanced stages of construction. John Kerry (right) being greeted by (right to left) Ambassador Alexandre Fasel of the Swiss Mission in Geneva, Ambassador Jurg Lauber of the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs and US Charge d'Affaires Peter Mulrean . The statement also said Iran's nuclear programme will be subject to 'increased transparency and intrusive monitoring'. 'Taken together, these first step measures will help prevent Iran from using the cover of negotiations to continue advancing its nuclear programme as we seek to negotiate a long-term, comprehensive solution that addresses all of the international community's concerns,' said the statement. In return for Iran's nuclear curbs, the White House statement promised 'limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible (sanctions) relief' to Iran, noting that 'the key oil, banking, and financial sanctions architecture, remains in place.' And it said any limited sanctions relief will be revoked and new penalties enacted if Iran fails to meet its commitments. Mr Obama hailed the deal as putting 'substantial limitations' on a nuclear programme that the US and its allies fear could be turned to nuclear weapons use. 'While today's announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal,' Mr Obama said. 'For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear programme, and key parts of the programme will be rolled back.'","Presence of senior ministers had raised expectations of agreement .

Kang Sun Bong once considered this tiny island a 'hell on earth,' a place where hospital workers beat the leprosy patients exiled here and forced them into harsh labor, sterilisations and abortions. But three years ago, old, sick and broke, Kang returned to the place he'd been banished with his mother decades ago. His savings wiped out by cancer treatment, the 74-year-old now hopes to live the rest of his life with hundreds of other former patients on Sorok Island, which sits off South Korea's south-western tip and has become a mini-welfare state. Kang Sun Bong, a former leprosy sufferer, walks outside his house. Kang's savings wiped out by cancer treatment, the 74-year-old now hopes to live the rest of his life with hundreds of other former patients . South Korean leprosy patients sit on a bench at Sorokdo National Hospital on Sorok Island, South Korea . South Korea abolished its anti-leprosy segregation policy in 1963, but rights abuses on the island continued for decades . Despite the misery many say they endured here, dozens are returning each year, partly for the free medical care, food and housing offered to former sufferers of the disease. But the one-time place of exile has also become a peaceful refuge for many after years of discrimination and hardship, the only place they feel at home. 'I came here because I thought I should die while being nursed,' said Kang, who had a bitter, lonely childhood here, but came back to find the island had utterly changed. Most returnees are cured of the disease and are free to live wherever they choose. But many say life is better here than outside the island, where prejudice against leprosy still runs deep. Yu Myung-sun, 61, who lived on Sorok for six years until 1974, returned in 2008 after living with other former leprosy sufferers in a village near Seoul. People outside the village 'wouldn't even look at me ... restaurants wouldn't sell meals to us,' Yu said. 'People on Sorok Island make me feel at ease,' she said, wearing a pair of big sunglasses, her face dotted with black spots from anti-leprosy medication. 'I feel comfortable here and this is where I'll die.' A villager strolls near houses on Sorok Island, South Korea . The island was once known as a place where hospital workers beat the leprosy patients exiled here and forced them into harsh labour, sterilisations and abortions . Now the island has become a peaceful refuge for many after years of discrimination and hardship and the only place they feel at home . Starting about a decade ago, the number of returning former patients began gradually increasing. Over the past few years, about 70 people, mostly former residents, have resettled here each year. Six years ago, a bridge was built linking the island, which is about the size of New York's Central Park, to the mainland, symbolising the end of its isolation. Growing numbers of tourists are visiting the island, which still preserves historic sites, including a detention building for disobedient patients and another ward where sterilizations took place. These days, there are about 570 former leprosy patients, with an average age of about 74, as well as six who are currently being treated for leprosy but not contagious, according to officials at the government-run Sorokdo National Hospital. Twelve doctors are on staff. A nurse helps leprosy patients at Sorokdo National Hospital on Sorok Island, South Korea .

Recent government investigations confirmed a 1948 slaughter of 84 leprosy patients by hospital workers and security officers over a management dispute . Leprosy, also called Hansen's disease, is neither highly contagious nor fatal. It is a disabling chronic bacterial infection that often lies dormant for years before attacking the body's nerves and slowly causing numbness. Hands and feet eventually claw inward and serious injuries often go unnoticed because no pain is felt - fingers and toes can be lost and blindness can occur. It has been curable since the 1940s thanks to antibiotics. As in many Western countries, leprosy has almost disappeared from South Korea, which reported only six new cases in 2010. The disease remains a problem in Brazil, India, Indonesia and East Timor. Worldwide the number of new leprosy patients has dropped from 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year. Active leprosy communities still exist in several countries, including in India, China and Vietnam, and discrimination continues to plague those maimed by the age-old disease.

In South Korea, the stigma remains strong. Many former leprosy sufferers say they've never visited a public bath house, a popular pastime, and some are still turned away at restaurants. Many are shunned and ostracised by their families too. 'The people who returned really had no other places to go,' said Lee Kil Yong, who lived on the island in the 1960s and now heads the Korean Federation of Hansen Associations, a government-affiliated organization that promotes leprosy victims' rights. Oh Dong-Chan, a dental surgeon and the longest-serving physician on the island at 18 years, said many former patients have come back as word has spread that conditions on the island have improved. He said he often treats his patients, who are used to be shunned, with his bare hands because he knows they like the feel of bare skin.

The island was established as a leprosarium in 1916 by the Japanese during their 35-year colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. They mobilised patients to produce war supplies and forced sterilization and abortions. South Korea abolished its anti-leprosy segregation policy in 1963, but rights abuses on the island continued for decades. Recent government investigations confirmed a 1948 slaughter of 84 leprosy patients by hospital workers and security officers over a management dispute. Kang was 7 years old and did not have leprosy when he was quarantined here in 1946 with his mother, who had the disease and was housed in a separate compound. He lived with about 10 boys in a single room that had no heating for much of winter. They were infested with lice and many of them suffered from malnutrition. A few years later, he developed leprosy himself. Yu Myung-sun, 61, a South Korean leprosy patient, lived on Sorok for six years until 1974, returned in 2008 after living at so-called leper colony near Seoul . 'We were nothing but skin and bones,' he said. 'We only had rice, kimchi and watery soups.' During once-a-month meetings between children and parents, he wasn't allowed to touch his mother through a wire fence that separated them. Everyone was crying, he said. Parents 'cried after seeing how their children looked, and children cried because they missed their parents so much. It's beyond description,' he said. He fled the island 16 years later, in 1962. 'It was like being sent to the hell and escaping... A hell on earth,' Kang said from his small home on the island. 'I returned in 2010 and found things have changed completely and bias has disappeared a lot.' Kang, who lost much of his eyebrows because of the disease, has faced less discrimination than those with more serious physical deformities. But even after he was cured of the disease, he said that he was required to be sterilized before he could marry another former leprosy sufferer in the late 1950s. In 2007, South Korea's parliament passed legislation calling for an investigation into alleged rights violations and the provision of state subsidies to leprosy victims. The next year, the prime minister visited Sorok Island and apologized. South Korea now gives subsidies of 150,000 won ($140) a month to former leprosy patients, but only to those who authorities determine belong to low income brackets and were the victims of rights violations. Critics say it's too little money. Kang Chang-suk, who lived on the island for six years in the 1980s before returning in 2009, said men were still required to get sterilized before they got married at least until the 1980s. He said hospital workers ordered former patients to clean squat toilets at their homes and stay 3 meters (10 feet) away from them during conversations. 'When I left here, I spit and swore that I'd never drink Sorok Island water again,' said Kang, who lost parts of his fingers to the disease. 'But I'm drinking its water again.'","South Korea abolished its anti-leprosy segregation policy in 1963 .

The father has accused his son of abandoning the Sikh tradition of sharing family property . Together they turned a small family business into a high-class hotel chain worth £800million. But on Tuesday Bal Mohinder Singh, 86, and his elder son, Jasminder, are due to take opposing sides in a High Court battle. Jasminder, 62, head of the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotels empire, is being sued by his father who accuses him of abandoning the Sikh tradition of sharing family property by excluding him from the business. Amazingly, the men and their wives still share a home together near Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. Mr Singh Snr arrived in Britain from East Africa 40 years ago and started out running a Post Office in North London. His . son helped in the business and after he qualified as an accountant they . moved into hotels, buying a rundown B&B in Kensington, West London, . which they refurbished and sold on at a profit. They gradually traded up and bought a string of upmarket hotels, including the Vanderbilt and the Savoy Court in central London. But . Mr Singh Snr claims that in 2010, his son forced him to retire, and has . failed to follow the ‘Mitakshara’ system, from the Sikh and Hindu . traditions, which implies a sharing of family wealth. The . system is not part of English law, but his lawyers argue that all . family members chose to work under it and had therefore joined a ‘common . intention constructive trust’. Jasminder Singh is head of the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotels empire, which includes the May Fair in London . Bal Mohinder Singh and his son went into business together and bought a string of upmarket hotels . Mr Singh Snr said he was ‘devastated’ by his son’s behaviour. He added: ‘As the head of the family, I have to be respected and the fact that I was forced to retire by Jasminder was very, very painful for me. Since then my health has failed. My wife is unwell too. When I travel to the High Court I will be in an ambulance and it will be very  difficult and stressful to have to give evidence against Jasminder. ‘I still love him. I always will. I will not hear anybody say a bad word against him ... He has worked hard too. But as I said, this is about respect and carrying on the traditions in which I have brought  Jasminder up.’ He has also accused his son of trying to force him and his mother out of the family home, the seven- bedroom Tetworth Hall where Jasminder also lives with his wife Amrit and their four children. It is understood that Jasminder Singh claims that he did not have a particularly religious upbringing, that neither of his parents regarded the family to be living under an agreement to share property nor  was there any such agreement, and that he played the leading part in building up the family business.","Father and son turned small family business into high-class hotel chain .

A pilot experiencing engine trouble managed to land his small plane on a Maine interstate during rush hour without damaging any vehicles or causing injuries, but the episode caused a traffic jam that stretched for miles Thursday evening, state police said. The pilot reported problems while flying from Waterville to Portland and had to set his plane down on Interstate 295 in Cumberland, then taxied several hundred yards into Falmouth, according to state police. The single-engine Cessna 152 was parked on the side of the highway, limiting southbound travel to one lane.

Sir Cameron Mackintosh, above, planned the demolition of the former village hall and the erection of retail space for food and drink units . Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh's plans to renovate a harbour in his highland village has caused bitter division after residents accused him of planning to destroy local trade. Sir Cameron is said to have been 'deeply hurt' over claims his £750,000 coastal development in Mallaig would ruin local business. The theatre mogul, behind hit shows such as Phantom of the Opera, Cats and Les Miserables is now threatening to pull out of building new marina facilities after the outcry by locals. Plans by the entertainment tycoon - estimated to be worth £725m, placing him second on the Sunday Times Rich List of UK music millionaires - include the erection of a food outlet. But locals say Mallaig already has too many restaurant and fear the competition. Sir Cameron, 66, has sparked fierce debate over the site, which includes his own private pier. It involves the demolition of the former village hall and the building of marina facilities, flats, shops, restaurants and bars. It is due to be heard by Highland Council in the New Year. But already many locals have lodged official objections and even organised a petition. Taste of Scotland award winner Michele Milligan of The Steam Inn said: 'How in God's name is another one (food outlet) going to benefit anyone? You say 'it will provide jobs' I say I will need to pay off staff as there won't be enough to go around! 'Think bout (sic) this from our point of view! We graft all year I employ 18 staff which is all year if the business has a downturn I will have to reduce full time workers so another competitor can employ seasonal workers. 'By all means renovate what existing buildings are there and clean the place up! If Mr Macintosh wants to invest money do it wisely and not to the detriment of all ready struggling businesses !!' Overhaul: The harbour of Mallaig in the Scottish Highlands, above, has become the subject of fierce debate after locals claimed Sir Cameron's plans would 'destroy' local trade . Cafe owners Linda and Peter McLean wrote that 'having new retail, catering and carryout facilities would be to the detriment of existing businesses within the village - these businesses are mainly locally owned and provides much needed employment to local people.' Bed and breakfast owner John Summers added: 'At present I have a partial view of the marina but if the food and drink outlet goes ahead we will have no view of the bay at all. 'There are already ten locally run restaurants eight of which do takeaways I am quite sure we don't need another.' Charlie King, the vice chairman of the Mallaig Harbour Authority - who will gain new toilets and shower facilities out of the development - said an 'upset' Sir Cameron had telephoned him last week. 'He had received an email from one of the objectors claiming that he was destroying the village. It really annoyed him. He says he is spending £750,000 on helping the village', said Mr King. 'He has taken the criticism badly. He has received quite a few personal attacks over this and he said to me that 'if they don't want it he does not need to do it.' He will never make money in his lifetime from this. Investment: The theatre impresario has already invested in the area, part paying for this health centre close to the coast . 'Cameron has been very hurt over it. He is very annoyed - here's somebody willing to spend £750,000 to do some good and he is expected to take these attacks that he is destroying a place he loves on the nose? Cameron has done so much good for the area over the years - he deserves better than this.' Mr King, who used to be the Highland councillor for the area added he agreed that Mallaig had too many restaurants, but Sir Cameron had told him he was going to drop the restaurant from the plans and replace it with a bakery. Andrew Aitchison, the estate's agent, said they were talking to objectors to try and overcome their concerns. 'Though there will be some form of food outlet we are not proposing a restaurant' said Mr Aitchison.

'Unless there was strong support in the majority of the community, Sir Cameron would not proceeded against the wishes of the majority of the village. 'Sir Cameron's motivation has been to help and provide facilities which will improve Mallaig and make it sustainable. 'If the village community are supportive we will crack on.

But the lawsuit against Rechter isn't over. Ms Lenhoff is suing him for $54,000 following a nasty break-up. Ms Lenhoff and her daughter moved out of his house last spring after coming home to find him 'having relations with someone Adrienne later learned was a convicted felon'.

She also wants compensation for moving and storage costs, the cost of her Jewish marriage contract from her first marriage, that Rechter ripped up, and other items he has refused to return including jewelry, accessories, golf shoes, Ugg boots and a Cuisinart toaster. Lenhoff said Rechter became a father figure to her daughter during their relationship. She said the incident has given her daughter her first heartbreak. 'This has made her not trust adults,' Lenhoff said. 'A big part of her innocence has been taken from her because of this. 'These are lessons that no child 10 years old should have to be learning.' Lenhoff and Rechter had discussed marriage and buying a home together during their relationship, leading Hannah's mother to sell their condo and move in with him. The trial is scheduled for July 2014.","Hannah Wise and her mother moved out of Mitchell Rechter's home in spring after they found him cheating .

France's highest court has confirmed that mayors will face prison if they refuse to perform same-sex marriages because of religious or moral objections. In a ruling which will be studied intently across Europe, the French Constitutional Council rejected an appeal by officials who do not want to take part in gay weddings. Roman Catholics and Muslims are among the thousands in France who have expressed their opposition to a new bill introduced this year allowing homosexual marriage. Marriage row: French mayors will face jail if they refuse to perform gay marriages, such as that of Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau who were the first same-sex couple to marry in France . Starting out: Since Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau were married in May there has been a host of other couples applying to follow suite - to the anger of some French officials . The first gay wedding in France took place in May in the southern city of Montpellier, when Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau were married in front of cheering family and friends. Since then there have been hundreds of applications for similar ceremonies. As officers of state, French mayors have to officiate the wedding ceremonies, and in June a new law was passed confirming that they cannot raise religious or moral objections to doing so. Today’s ruling reads: ‘This legislation did not violate their freedom of conscience, and the disputed sections conform with the Constitution’. It is a huge blow to France's anti-gay marriage movement, which blames liberals within France’s Socialist government for forcing the original gay marriage bill through. Controversy: Although President Francois Hollande has a long-term partner, Valerie Trierweiler, he has never married, prompting criticism that he has undermined the traditional French family . President Francois Hollande has never been married, and many think he and his left-wing ministers have undermined the traditional French family.

Zumba prostitute Alexis Wright has been released from jail after serving nearly six months behind bars - bringing to a close a scandal featuring sex videos, adultery and a client list with more than 100 names. Wright, 30, admitted to running a prostitution business from her fitness studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine. She also confessed to tax evasion and conspiracy charges. She walked out of the York County Jail Saturday morning wearing a gray suit and clutching a stack of folders. Free: Alexis Wright walked out of the York County this morning a free woman after serving nearly six months in prison for prostitution and tax evasion . Going home: Wright's husband, Jason Trowbridge, was waiting for her in an SUV outside when she got out of jail . Asked about her time in jail she said, 'I have no comment.' She then stepped into a waiting sport utility vehicle driven by her husband, Jason Trowbridge. Trowbridge has stuck by his wife and the mother of his young son, despite allegations that she had sex with more than 100 men - and one woman - for money. Wright served nearly six months in jail and was released early for good behavior . Wright served six months of a 10-month sentence after she received credit for good behavior and participating in a work program. The scandal erupted a year ago in an unlikely place, a small town known for its beaches, New England charm and proximity to former President George H.W. Bush's seaside estate in Kennebunkport. Wright's prostitution business came as a surprise to her fitness clients but not to police officers who'd become suspicious after fielding complaints about groaning, loud music and men coming and going from an office Wright rented across the street from her studio. According to police, her business partner, Mark Strong of Thomaston, watched the sexual encounters unfold in real time on a computer in his insurance business office. In a twist at her sentencing, . Wright divulged that she believed her business partner had tricked her into believing she was a secret operative investigating sexual deviance. Scandalous: Revelations that Wright had sex with at least 100 men in her Zumba exercise studio rocked the small town of Kennebunk, Maine . Co-conspirator: Mark W. Strong was accused of being Wright's business partner and helping to organize the prostitution business. He served 20 days in jail . Prosecutors didn't buy Wright's story, saying investigators continue to believe the 30-year-old Wright was ""a willing participant"" in the prostitution business. Detailed records over an 18-month period indicated Wright made $150,000 tax-free. She also collected more than $40,000 in public assistance, prosecutors said. Strong, a 58-year-old married father of two, acknowledged having an affair with Wright and helping her start the fitness studio but said he didn't profit from the prostitution. He was convicted of 13 counts related to promotion of prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail.","Alexis Wright was released early from 10-month sentence after getting credit for good behavior .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:57 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:58 EST, 1 March 2013 . Decision: Bruce Davis, a former Charles Manson follower who has spent more than 40 years in prison . One of cult leader Charles Manson’s follower was denied parole and will continue to serve his jail sentence after the California governor stepped in and stopped him from being released. The state’s parole board had recently approved the release of 70-year-old Bruce Davis, who was convicted in two Manson-related murders, since he has served more than four decades in prison. Governor Jerry Brown reversed that decision and ordered Davis to remain in jail after having a meeting with the Los Angeles district attorney. 'I find the evidence ... shows why he currently poses a danger to society if released from prison. Therefore, I reverse the decision to parole Mr. Davis,' the written decision said. Davis would have been only the second Manson-related murder defendant to be granted parole since the killing spree began in 1969. Davis was not involved in the notorious Sharon Tate-LaBianca killings but was convicted with Manson and others in the murders of a musician and a stuntman. Brown's six-page decision focused on Davis' role in the murderous Manson Family in the late 1960s. 'The record indicates that Davis fully embraced and championed the family's distorted values and goals, and was willing to protect the family's interests at all costs,' the decision said. Brown said that Davis' refusal to fully acknowledge his responsibility for two killings was central to his decision. Behind bars: Charles Manson orchestrated the murders of eight people and is serving life at Corcoran State Prison in California . Infamous: Charles Manson is escorted by a deputy sheriff and his lawyer from a Santa Monica courthouse following a hearing in the Gary Hinman murder case . 'I do not believe that Davis was just a . reluctant follower who passively went along with the violence,' he . said. 'Davis was older, more experienced, he knew what the Manson Family . was capable of, and he knowingly and willingly took part in these . crimes.' The decision outlined in gruesome . detail the killings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman ranch hand . Donald 'Shorty' Shea. Manson was a direct participant in both killings, . according to witnesses. Steve Grogan, another participant in . those murders, was released many years ago after he agreed to lead . police to where the bodies were buried on a remote movie ranch in the . San Fernando Valley. The decision relied heavily on trial . testimony of Barbara Hoyt, a former Manson Family member who has become a . constant attendee at parole hearing and an advocate for keeping all . members of the cult in prison. Captured: Steve Grogan (left) and Bruce Davis (right) enter court to be tried for murder in 1970 . Many of the details she gave were . proven wrong when the bodies were exhumed. She had spoken of dismembered . bodies but both men's bodies were found intact. Killed: Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson and his cult followers in 1969 but Davis was not involved in that murder . 'Until Davis can acknowledge and . explain why he actively championed the family's interests and shed more . light on the nature of his involvement, I am not prepared to release . him,' Brown said. Davis was 30 when he was sentenced to . life in prison in 1972 in the case that was a postscript to Manson's . notorious reign as leader of the murderous communal cult. Davis long maintained that he was a . bystander in the killing of the two men. But in recent years, he has . acknowledged his shared responsibility. He said his presence may have . emboldened others to take action because he was an elder of the group. Davis became a born-again Christian in . prison and ministered to other inmates, married a woman he met through . the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. The couple recently . divorced. Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion. Brown commended him for his self-help efforts but said the work was outweighed by other factors. 'After 42 years of incarceration, it . is encouraging that Davis is beginning to reveal the actual details of . what happened. But it is clear that he continues to withhold information . about these events,' Brown said. Terrorizing: Manson family murderers Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Leslie van Houton . The governor's decision echoed that of . his predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also reversed a parole board . that found Davis suitable for parole. Manson and three of his followers, . Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles 'Tex' Watson, remain . in prison for life in the Tate killings. Their co-defendant, Susan .

Thousands of new Mercedes are set to be banned from sale in Britain after they were declared 'illegal' by the EU. The German luxury car maker is embroiled in an extraordinary row with EU bureaucrats over a decision to force all car manufacturers to use a new 'green' air-conditioning gas. Mercedes has raised fears that the new coolant causes cars to catch fire. But any car maker refusing to install the gas faces a ban on selling cars across the Continent, the European Commission warned this week. Luxury car maker Mercedes is embroiled in an extraordinary row with EU bureaucrats over a decision to force all car manufacturers to use a new 'green' air-conditioning gas . The DVLA and the Vehicle Certification Agency in the UK are poised to suspend any new registration of the luxury German cars if they do not conform to the regulations. All new Mercedes A-Class hatchbacks, B-Class family cars and SL roadster models will be affected because the manufacturer has failed to agree to the law, which came into effect on January 1. Most manufacturers have already complied with the directive. But last September Mercedes appealed to delay the implementation of the law. Internal tests by the company allegedly showed that ten out of 14 cars using the new coolant caught fire when subjected to conditions that simulated the coolant leaking into the engine in a front-end collision. But the Commission last week rejected the claims and warned it is not possible for new cars to be sold within the EU if they do not conform to the legislation. Implementing the directive could result in thousands of new cars being left on dealers' forecourts, unable to be registered by the DVLA. In an update last week, the European Commission said 'controversial' testing techniques by Mercedes were to blame for the findings and the Department for Transport in the UK would be fined if it allowed the company to sell the affected models. It stated: 'It is not possible for motor vehicles to be registered and marketed in the EU if they are not in conformity with the relevant legislation.' The European Commission has warned any car maker refusing to install the gas faces a ban on selling cars across the Continent . The Department for Transport said it was monitoring the situation closely, but it could cost Mercedes almost £500 million in lost sales in the UK and more across Europe. Mercedes predicts sales of about 15,000 A-Class cars this year, which cost from £18,970. About 6,500 £21,000 B-Class models and an estimated 800 of the £72,550 SL models are also expected to be bought by Britons – but all could remain unsold if the DVLA refuses to register them for the UK market. Older models will be unaffected but from 2017 every vehicle released into the European car market must be installed with the new coolant. Daimler, parent company of Mercedes-Benz, claims its tests show the new air-con chemical is 'highly flammable', poisonous and poses a danger to occupants and rescue services. The European Commission is now involved in 11th hour talks with Mercedes. Volkswagen, which owns the Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, has also refused to install the new coolant. However, the fellow German manufacturer has insisted its engineers have designed a new coolant using carbon dioxide which adheres to the European environmental guidelines and is in advanced talks to use the new variant. Mercedes claims it has instructed its engineers to design a similar chemical but the Commission denies knowledge of the plans. Critics have accused Mercedes of putting costs ahead  of global climate concerns because the new coolant is more expensive. Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies, who helped to draft the new law, said: 'This amounts to a declaration of war on Daimler. It is widely believed Daimler is trying to avoid paying extra costs of about £20 per vehicle. 'The Commission's briefing makes clear that new models using the old refrigerant should not be sold.' Mercedes was last month confirmed as the leading premium brand in the UK. It registered 3,329 new cars in February – up 13.5 per cent on last year. Professor Thomas Weber, from Daimler, claimed the  company was in the process of producing a new coolant using carbon dioxide which would be approved by the European Commission. He said: 'Daimler has examined all possible options very closely over recent months and worked with the other manufacturers within the VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry) to find a solution that is acceptable to all. 'These efforts have shown clearly that CO2, is by far the most promising solution, as it is environmentally acceptable and safe. We have given our engineers the clear commission to develop the CO2 air-conditioning system.' A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'The safety of all road users is paramount. However, we have seen no evidence that the air-conditioning fluid in this case poses any risk in appropriately designed vehicles. We continue to monitor this issue and the European Commission is leading a review to ensure a consistent approach for all vehicle manufacturers and purchasers.' The European Commission said it would not take action against anyone who has bought one of the affected Mercedes models since January 1. But a spokesman said it would continue to appeal to countries to enforce the legislation and ban future registration of all new vehicles that do not contain the new coolant gas.","Car maker embroiled in an extraordinary row with EU bureaucrats .

It is a cruel stereotype: that Scotsmen have a tendency towards thrift that sometimes borders on the downright tightfisted. And, according to a survey released today, it is entirely unfair. Quite the reverse, in fact - it shows that Scots are in fact the most charitable people in the UK. More than 42 per cent of those in Scotland give money after watching a TV charity appeal - well above the national average of 25 per cent. Those north of the border are more likely to donate to sponsorship requests from friends and family, with 65 per cent giving compared to the national average of 54 per cent. Scots are also more responsive to charity emails - with 18 per cent saying they prompt a donation, versus a national average of just 12 per cent. The results were found by online charity donation service Give as you Live in a survey of 2,000 people. The survey also found that across the UK, young people are more likely to give to a charity than the old. An impressive 85 per cent of those aged between 16 and 24 said workplaces and businesses should do more to support charity, with younger people embracing fundraising . opportunities their companies offer. 54 per cent of workers aged 16-24 have taken part in work fundraisers, with only . 39 per cent of people aged 45-54 and 41 per cent of those aged 25-44 getting involved.

The survey also revealed that men are more charitable than women. Last Christmas, men donated £17.89 to charitable causes, while women only donated £15.52. With 27.6 million men in the UK, versus . 28.5 million women, this means that men gave an estimated £65.4 million . to charity MORE than women. The results come just months after an .

Charitable: Scot Ewan McGregor, pictured here on a trip to Malawi with UNICEF, is well known for his support of the charity .

Michael Peltz, the editor of the magazine group at Institutional Investor, said in a statement: 'The very best hedge fund managers proved in 2012 that they could deliver strong returns in challenging markets.' The Motley Fool reported earlier this month that Mr Tepper made a gamble in the fourth quarter of 2012 that paid off considerably - betting on Apple. He worked for eight years at Goldman . Sachs as a trader but left to start up his own hedge fund, Appaloosa . Management, in 1992 after repeatedly being passed over for partnership . at Goldman. Wedded bliss: Tepper and his wife Marlene, right, have three children and live in Livingston, New Jersey . Mr Tepper owns property in the . Hamptons but calls Livingston, New Jersey, his home. Gov Chris Christie, . Chelsea Handler and Seinfeld star Jason Alexander also live there. He and his wife Marlene have three children. After Hurricane Sandy struck last year, he donated $200,000 worth of Target gift cards to residents impacted by the storm. The David A. Tepper School of Business at his alma mater Carnegie Mellon University was established after he made a $55million donation. He's also a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Taken out: Mr Tepper famously tore down his Hamptons mansion because he couldn't see the ocean from every room . Gone: Mr Tepper tore down his 6,165-square-foot, $43.5 million Hamptons home to make room for a bigger one with better views . Other top earners: Mr Tepper was joined in the top three by Raymond Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, left, and Steven Cohen of SAC Capital Advisors, right . Mr Tepper made headlines back in 2011 when he tore down his sprawling $43.5million oceanside home in Long Island's plush Hamptons - because he didn't have enough ocean views. He was allegedly irked that he couldn't see the ocean from every room of the sprawling 6,165 square foot estate, so he decided to build another one from the ground up, according to Curbed Hamptons. Benefactor: James Simons, 74, who generally stays out of the public eye is known for his entrepreneurial efforts . It is thought he made the money by correctly predicting that the U.S. government would not allow major banks to fold that year, compounding his profits as the banks' share prices then recovered. Not far behind Mr Tepper on the list was Raymond Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, and Steven Cohen of SAC Capital Advisors, each earning $1.7billion and $1.4billion, respectively. Mr Dalio, who topped the list last year, graduated from Harvard University and Long Island University. He is known for his harsh business practices, which, according to Forbes, include videotaping all meetings and requiring brutal honesty from all staffers. Like Mr Tepper, Mr Cohen has spent some of his fortune with a sports team, and is a minority owner of the New York Mets. He graduated from the prestigious Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2010, he and his wife pledged $50million to the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. James Simons, 74, who generally stays out of the public eye is known for his entrepreneurial efforts. The former math professor and his second wife, Marilyn Hawrys Simons, have donated more than $200million to Stony Brook University. He is involved in several other charitable foundations.

Guilty: Dawn Simon was sentenced to three years in prison today at Maidstone Crown Court . A benefits cheat and handbag thief who lived in a six-bedroom home with a swimming pool and drove a £144,000 Bentley has been jailed. Dawn Simon, 51, made up to £1million stealing cash and jewellery, but was today sentenced to three years in prison at Maidstone Crown Court. She had been living a life of luxury funded by the proceeds of her thefts, while also claiming benefits for the house in Iwade, Kent. She used her stolen cash to buy sports cars and a holiday villa in Florida, as well as booking lavish holidays to Dubai, Las Vegas and New York. But her scheme fell apart because her partner tipped off police to her life of crime when the two had had an argument. Peter Harvey, 50, who was also jailed for a year, went to the police station in Sittingbourne, Kent, after the dispute in November 2011 and revealed that his partner was 'on the fiddle'. High life: Simon was able to use her stolen cash to go on luxurious holidays . Flash cars: Simon's criminal life allowed her to pay for this silver Mercedes . A police investigation then revealed that Simon had devised a fraudulent scheme to live in her lavish house at the taxpayer's expense, as well as uncovering evidence of her thefts. The court heard that she convinced her nephew, 29-year-old Daniel Wade, to pose as a mortgage applicant for the six-bedroom home, despite being unemployed. The pair forged payslips and other documents which allowed Wade to secure a £379,000 mortgage on the house. Simon moved in under a bogus tenancy agreement, which she then used to claim benefits to cover the rent of living in the property. Meanwhile, she was giving Wade huge amounts of cash to meet mortgage payments. Police soon uncovered her false claims, which . included housing benefit, council tax benefit and child tax support. But she would make he lion's share of her cash in London, where she would wait for . victims at ATM machines. She watched people enter their PIN, then following them through the streets and stealing their handbags. She could then use their cards to drain their bank accounts, as well as taking any valuables inside. Cash: This photo, showing piles of stolen cash, was found on Simon's phone . International lifestyle: Simon, who would jet off to destinations such as Dubai and Las Vegas, also amassed a sizable amount of foreign currency, pictured . When police searched Simon's home they found that she had kept many of the handbags and their valuable contents, rather than throwing away the evidence. Investigators also found digital cameras, mobile phones and a range of jewellery. They estimate that she had stolen between £500,000 and £1million in total. She was arrested in March 2012 along with Harvey and Wade. In May this year a jury found them guilty of four counts of fraud, one count of conspiracy to launder money, and one count of conspiracy to possess criminal property. At the sentencing today Wade was also jailed for three years for his part the crimes, while Harvey received a one-year sentence. A . Kent Police spokesman said: 'Two men and a woman who were able to fund . a lavish lifestyle from a complex mortgage and benefit fraud have been . sentenced to a total of seven years. 'They . came to the attention of police on 8 November 2011 after Peter Harvey . attended Sittingbourne police station after a domestic dispute and . reported that his partner Dawn Simon, had fraudulently acquired her home . address by encouraging her nephew Daniel Wade to pose as a mortgage . applicant. Big spender: Simon, pictured here posing in a showroom, spent £144,000 on a convertible Bentley SS . Justice done: But police repossessed the sports car, and are setting about reclaiming the rest of her assets . 'At the same time, Simon was fraudulently claiming benefits, including child tax support, whilst living a cash rich lifestyle which boasted luxury jewellery, holidays to Dubai, Las Vegas and New York and numerous vehicles including a £140,000 Bentley SS.' Detective Constable Stewart Walker said: ‘Dawn Simon’s lifestyle of expensive jewellery, holidays and expensive cars was funded entirely on the back of other people’s misery. 'Simon was a compulsive thief who’s continued stealing of handbags and purses not only cost people the money they physically carried, but also their treasured items such as personal mementos and a vast number of family photos, as well treasured jewellery valued at up to £500,000. 'Her actions around spotting victims at cash points and following them shows a deep level of premeditated and ingrained criminality. 'Not only was she stealing from victim’s handbags and purses, but she was also using the tax payer to fund her six bedroom house with a pool - money she just wasn’t entitled to. 'Peter Harvey and Daniel Wade knew the full extent of the crimes being committed and enjoyed the windfalls that came with them, which included Harvey, a long term benefit recipient being able to spend over £40,000 on watches alone. 'I’m pleased with these sentences - the evidence was overwhelming and this should send a clear message that crime does not pay.'","Dawn Simon, 51, made up to £1million stealing cash and jewelery .

Struggle: Jim Wolf, 54, has gone to jail weeks after he had a makeover in a viral video . A homeless Army veteran who underwent an incredible transformation in a timelapse video that became an internet hit has been jailed for causing a disturbance in a Burger King. Jim Wolf, a former soldier from Grand Rapids, Michigan, featured in the video, which shows stylists cutting his scraggly beard and hair and dressing him in a dapper suit, in September. The video explained that the 54-year-old had slipped into a life of alcoholism and destitution but had 'taken control of his life' - with alcohol treatment and housing on the horizon. But a police report now indicates that the transformation has not been as easy as it appeared for Wolf, as he was arrested at a Burger King on Sunday November 17. He was charged with trespassing and creating a disturbance, Mlive reported, and on Monday he pleaded guilty to both charges. District Judge Michael Christensen ordered Wolf to serve 10 days in jail on each charge. Wolf had previously WOOD-TV on Wednesday that he appreciated the efforts of Dégagé Ministries, the organization behind his makeover, but admitted that he had gone back to drinking. 'I have no excuse for what I do wrong,' he said. 'It is all me putting a bottle to my mouth.' Scroll down for video .

'With the help I'm going to receive, I believe I can become clean,' Wolf said. Rob Bliss, who made the video, said he hoped it would help Wolf start a new life, but said he knew it would be hard. 'If he gets arrested fewer times this year than last, that's progress,' he told CNN. Getting there: Wolf, who has been arrested 80 times, smiles as his beard is reduced to designer stubble . Job done: The video said he had turned his life around but Wolf has since admitted he is drinking again .

She was only six years old when she saw the union flag raised at school to commemorate a former pupil who died in Afghanistan. It was put up to celebrate the life of Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe, after he was killed by a Taliban bomb while serving with the Welsh Guards in 2009. The emotive tribute must have struck a chord with Annabelle Asher, from Oxfordshire, as she has raised more than £11,500 for charity in his memory during the past four years. Annabelle, now 10, was so moved by Lt Col Thorneloe’s death that she began selling fresh chicken eggs to students and teachers to raise money for his regiment. She has also raised thousands of pounds completing the sponsored 190-mile coast-to-coast walk from Cumbria to Yorkshire and became the youngest person to walk the 102-mile Cotswold Way. Annabelle is already her planning her next charity challenge – walking the 268 mile Pennine Way. And she is so devoted to fundraising she has even foregone Christmas presents in favour of donations to her charity pot. The youngster’s impressive record includes also conquering Britain’s tallest mountains – Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike – by the time she was six. Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe was killed by a Taliban bomb while serving with the Welsh Guards in 2009 . She completed the 190 mile coast to coast walk across Britain with her father Adam and dog Izzy and plans to tackle the 268 mile Pennine way . Annabelle saw the flag at her home at £24,000-a-year Cothill House boys’ school near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, where her parents Fiona, 47, and Adam, 43, work and live as boarding masters. She said: ‘At Cothill there is a board with the names of all the former pupils on it and when I was six I saw a flag draped over the name of Rupert Thorneloe. ‘Mummy explained he was killed in Afghanistan and that he had been the highest ranking officer to die there. It made me sad so I decided to raise some money for the Welsh Guards’ Afghanistan appeal. ‘We had plenty of eggs from our chickens so I thought I could sell them at school. Then I decided to take it one step further by taking on big walks for charity. As a family we love the outdoors and I had climbed the Three Peaks by the time I was six so I knew I could complete long walks. Sally Thorneloe, left, wife of Lieutenant Colonel Thorneloe, of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, watches as a coffin bearing his body is carried out of the Guards Chapel, in London, following his funeral on July 16, 2009 . Annabelle saw the flag at her home at £24,000-a-year Cothill House boys' school where her parents Fiona, 47, and Adam, 43, work . ‘The coast to coast walk and the Cotswold Way were both very hard but it was worth it to raise so much money. My friends and teachers have been really supportive and very generous too. ‘I asked them to make donations instead of buying me birthday presents, and I have asked the same of my family this Christmas. ‘It is much better that the Welsh Guards get some help than I get another teddy bear.’ Annabelle took on the Cotswold Way from Bath to Chipping Campden in 2012 which she completed in five and a half days through sleet and driving rain. She then completed the coast to coast walk from St Bees in Cumbria to Robin Hood’s Bay in North Yorkshire earlier this year in 11 days during the summer heat wave. Lt Col Thorneloe was the highest ranking British soldier to be killed in action since 1982 . On both occasions she was accompanied by her father and her trusty border collie dog Izzy. Her mother drove the support car and helped by putting up tents along the routes. Mrs Asher, who teaches French and Latin at Cothill, said: ‘I couldn’t be more proud of what Annabelle has achieved. ‘Everything she has done she has come up with herself and it’s driven by her. ‘She is so passionate about fundraising for the Welsh Guards she has told everyone she would rather they donated money than bought her Christmas presents. There aren’t many 10-year-olds who would do that. ‘Because Adam and I are house parents at the boarding school Annabelle has grown up surrounded by boys, and she loves and thrives on it.’ Annabelle, who attends St Hugh’s School in nearby Faringdon, still sells eggs at her school and is planning on walking the Pennine Way from Edale in Derbyshire to Kirk Yetholm, Scotland, in July next year. Lt Col Thorneloe was the highest ranking British soldier to be killed in action since 1982. He attended Cothill House from 1977 to 1982. He became the highest-ranking British officer to die in action since the Falklands War when a bomb exploded under his armoured vehicle in 2009.","Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe was killed by a Taliban bomb while serving with the Welsh Guards in 2009 .

Cutting the green c**p: David Cameron, who once pledged to lead the 'greenest government ever', has publicly promised to 'roll back' green taxes, which add more than £110 a year to average fuel bills . A leading Liberal Democrat suggested David Cameron was ‘full of c**p’ last night for wanting to ditch green levies on energy bills. The Coalition feud over environmental issues boiled over after the Daily Mail revealed that the Prime Minister has privately told ministers to  ‘get rid of all this green c**p’ –  a reference to the green taxes which are blamed for driving up energy bills. Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander reacted furiously to the comments, saying the green levies, which add £112 to the average bill, were helping to insulate homes for the poor and invest in clean energy such as wind farms and solar panels. He told Sky News: ‘We’re engaged in a serious exercise to make sure that the costs of those things are not any more than they need to be. ‘But what’s being referred to here as “green c**p” is stuff, which is helping to insulate people’s homes to reduce the costs of their energy consumption – levies that help support investment in our country’s long-term energy needs. ‘That’s about helping people on low incomes, it’s about investment, it’s about jobs in this country.

Mr Cameron has publicly said he wants to ‘roll back’ green taxes in next month’s autumn statement.Yesterday’s row erupted after a senior Tory source revealed the Prime Minister’s message in private is far blunter. The source said: ‘He’s telling everyone: “We’ve got to get rid of all this green c**p.” He’s  absolutely focused on it.’ Referring to Mr Cameron’s pre-election slogan ‘vote blue, go green’, the source said: ‘It’s vote blue, get real now.’ Downing Street yesterday said it ‘did not recognise’ the reported comments, although it stopped short of issuing a denial. A spokesman said the Prime  Minister stood by his pledge to lead the ‘greenest government ever’. A Number 10 source said: ‘Mr Cameron has been quite clear about rolling back the impact of levies on energy bills, but only last week in Sri Lanka he was talking about the importance of tackling climate change.’ Speaking after a meeting to promote the HS2 rail line yesterday,  Mr Cameron said he ‘of course’ still believed in the green agenda. He cited his support for HS2 and added: ‘We have got the world’s first green investment bank, we  have got great support for our green technology industries. 'We have got the first nuclear power station since 1995. This is a Government investing in important green technologies.’ Environmental groups condemned Mr Cameron’s apparent change of heart. Greenpeace spokesman Joss Garman said: ‘If David Cameron thinks the road to electoral victory will be found in attacking the very policies he once passionately advocated then he is sorely mistaken. ‘The British electorate are a sophisticated bunch who will see through his chameleon tendencies and conclude this attack is not an act of leadership, but one of cowardice as he panders to the extreme wing of his own party and tries to claw back support from Ukip.’ But former Cabinet minister Peter Lilley, one of a handful of  MPs to vote against Labour’s 2008 Climate Change Act, said: ‘There is no point in impoverishing this generation in the vague hope it might help some distant future generation.’","Danny Alexander has reacted furiously to the comments about green levies .

More than 500,000 elderly patients are needlessly being taken to A&E every year because they are not being properly looked after at home, according to the care watchdog. Many are becoming desperately malnourished, succumbing to infections or falling and breaking bones due to failings by GPs and care home staff. The Care Quality Commission has calculated that the number of avoidable admissions amongst the elderly has soared by 40 per cent in five years which is partly why A&E units are under such pressure. Concerns: Inspectors found that records were not being kept of whether elderly people in homes needed help with meals, if they had lost weight or if they needed to be rolled over to prevent bedsores (file picture) Its inspectors found that records were not being kept of whether elderly people in homes needed help with meals, if they had lost weight or if they needed to be rolled over to prevent bedsores. In one home, they came across five bedbound patients left alone in their rooms with no drinking water. The watchdog calculates that 1 in 10 of the over 75s and 1 in 5 of those over 90 are being admitted to A&E needlessly - some of whom will never return home. Many elderly patients quickly deteriorate once in hospital and become confused, reluctant to eat or develop chest or urinary infections. The CQC is particularly concerned about dementia sufferers who are 37 per cent more likely to die in hospital than all other patients. David Behan, Chief Executive of the watchdog said: ‘GPs, care homes, home care agencies, community health services and hospitals, with local commissioners, must plan effectively to make sure our older and more vulnerable people are cared for in the way they deserve. ‘Where care can be provided for people outside of hospitals, it is better for them and eases pressures on hospital services.’ Caroline Abrahams charity director at Age UK said: ‘The numbers of older people being admitted to hospital when with the right care they could stay at home is distressing and a sad consequence of a social care system that so often fails to help the people who need it. Crowded: The soar in the number of elderly is partly why A&E units are under such pressure (file picture) ‘Older people must be able to receive the treatment and care they need when they need it. ‘However cuts to social care budgets has forced local authorities to increasingly restrict access to social care support leaving many older people to struggle on until they reach breaking point and have a serious health crisis or an accident and end up in hospital. This is not only morally wrong but makes no financial sense.’ There is growing concern that this winter could be the worst ever for A&E units which are struggling to cope with the soaring numbers of patients and severe shortages of senior doctors. Last week the NHS’s medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh announced plans to ease the crisis which included beefing up the NHS 111 helpline and increasing GP appointments. The CQC analysed hospital admission figures for conditions which could have been prevented through better care such as pneumonia, falls, urinary infections and the worsening of long-term illnesses like diabetes. Working together: Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said the elderly were not supported enough . There were 535,000 such admissions for the over-65s last year, up from 374,000 in 2007/8. Its inspectors found one care home in Romford, Essex, where residents were visited by a GP once a week who failed to record their weight or details about their needs. Two patients had developed pressure sores because care home staff were not aware they needed to be moved. At another nursing home nearby bedbound patients were not given any water while at another centre nurses had no idea how often they changed wound dressings. Norman Lamb, care and support minister said: ‘We know too many older people don’t get the right support in the community, leaving them at high risk of repeated admissions to A&E. ‘We want to make the whole health system work together around the patient, so that more people get the help they need before emergency treatment is required.’","Report found 10% of over 75s in care are needlessly admitted to A&E .

McDonald's has been blasted for telling staff to return gifts and eat stale bread if they are struggling to get by on their wage. The employee budget guide published online by the 'McResource' team also advised breaking food into smaller pieces to feel fuller on less, and 'quit complaining' to reduce stress levels. It comes a month after the company came under fire for telling a Chicago employee to apply for government food stamps in response to claims she is struggling to feed her children. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Quit complaining': The fast food chain has been blasted for advising staff to combat money worries with positivity . Pressure group Low Pay Is Not OK has . attacked the global fast food company for the articles, which have since . been removed from the site, and published a video using screen grabs of the original site NBC reported. The video reveals bosses advised: 'On a short term basis, do whatever it takes to dig out from your holiday debt. 'You may want to consider returning some . of your unopened purchases that may not seem as appealing as they did. Selling some of your unwanted possessions on eBay or Craigslist could . bring in some quick cash. SING AWAY STRESS: Singing along to your favourite songs can lower your blood pressure .

You might also consider a temporary part time job to dig out of debt quickly.' Other advice included eating bruised apples instead of throwing them out, and 'sing away stress'. Paradoxically, they also suggested 'two vacations a year can cut heart attack risk by 50 per cent'. Critics lambasted the advice on social media. One man tweeted: 'Ho Ho Ho! @McDonalds offers scrooge-worthy holiday budget and health tips to it's chronically exploited workers.' Many have taken to publishing spoof advice using the hastag #OtherMcDonaldsAdvice. One said: 'If you shave your head, you won't need shampoo. #OtherMcDonaldsAdvice' Another said: '#OtherMcDonaldsAdvice if you give your kids empty boxes for Christmas they can also double as a bedroom!' And one person tweeted: 'A good pair of pliers makes most dentist visits unnecessary. #OtherMcDonaldsAdvice'. But despite a wave of criticism, McDonald’s has defended the site. A spokesman said: 'The vast majority of the resources and information on the site are based on credible outside experts and well-published advice.' She rejected backlash from Low Pay Is Not OK as 'an attempt by an outside organization to undermine a well-intended employee assistance resource website'. However, she revealed McDonald's and Nurtur Health, which created the site, would 'review the content and make any necessary adjustments'. Ruth Milkman, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York, told NBC the advice is 'probably well-intentioned but shows deep ignorance of what it means to survive on a low wage job. 'Between the low wages and the short hours, it’s tough out there.' Last month, it emerged that more than half of America's fast food workers rely on benefits to support themselves. Defence: A McDonald's spokesman defended the advice saying it came from credible outside experts . Protests: Fast-food workers staged strikes to protest low wages outside a Los Angeles . McDonald's in August . And days later, news broke that the McDonald's helpline told an employee of 10 years to apply for government-provided food stamps to get by. Mother-of-two Nancy Salgado called 'McResource' in October asking for help paying her heating bill, feeding her children and getting her sister medical care. Instead of discussing a raise - Salgado has been on $8.25 an hour for a decade - or offering health cover, the representative said Salgado, a full-time employee, 'definitely should be able to qualify for both food stamps and heating assistance.' New venture: The McHome service, trialled in a city near Dortmund, may be rolled out across Germany . McDonald's fans rejoiced as a German firm launched the nation's first McDonald's delivery service. With a team of 20 drivers, catering firm Systengastronomie trialled the 'McHome' service on Saturday across Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, north east of Dortmund. They delivered Big Macs and Happy Meals for the same price as restaurants with no delivery charge as part of what they branded 'Crazy Saturday'. Christian Eckstein, the company's director, said: 'Since we often got asked about the non-existent delivery service, we dealt with the issue and decided to test this scenario for and with our customers on Crazy Saturday.' But despite claims that other German cities are looking to follow suit, McDonald's is not on board with the project. In a statement, a spokesman said: 'At the moment we are not planning a nationwide delivery service. But that does not exclude any local offers. 'A nationwide delivery service would be a big challenge, especially in sparsely populated areas with long distances. 'Unfortunately we can’t guarantee that our customers will receive the product just as fresh and delicious as they are in the restaurant.' The Osnabrück McDonald’s is not the first to come up with the idea.

Snow will fall in Britain  as early as next week as temperatures plummet to below freezing, forecasters warned last night. The coldest weather of the year so far is set to hit swathes of the country as Arctic winds bring flurries of snow and widespread frost. By Tuesday, large parts of the UK could see wintry showers with the chance of some significant snowfall on higher ground. Cold snap: The coming weather could lead to repeats of these scenes in Teesdale, County Durham, last week . Coated: A man walks his dog in the thick snow which fell in northern England last week . But snow is more likely along coastal regions and the northern parts of England and Scotland, the Met Office said. Forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘On Tuesday morning some people could wake up to see snow falling – but it won’t last for long. There could be some slushy snow in places – possibly where showers get organised. ‘There will be more persistent snow showers along coastal areas. There could be accumulations of snow on higher ground and in some coastal areas it could settle.’ Temperatures over the weekend will be as high as 12C (54F), with clear weather expected in the South East. Sunrise: The sun broke through the clouds in London as temperatures are set to plummet . Last of the good weather? London got off to a sunny Autumn morning today with the sun rising behind Tower Bridge. The weather is predicted to soon take a turn for the worse . Chilly start: These Cambridge University rowers had a chilly start to their day yesterday morning as they took to the River Cam at sunrise to practise . But it could be gloomy for those in the north, with cloud predicted for much of the day  on Saturday. There will be a significant drop in temperatures overnight on Monday as the mercury falls as low as -4C (25F) in northern England and -3C (27F) in some parts of southern England. Those in Scotland should be braced for temperatures as low as -5C (23F). The average temperature for Britain in November is 9C but daytime temperatures will be dropping to as low as 5C in some parts of the country next week. Forecasters are warning people to be prepared for a cold snap. A forecaster at Meteogroup said much of the UK could be covered in a ‘nice and pretty’ light dusting of snow as it gets ‘noticeably colder’. Experts do not expect the snow to cause any disruption and believe temperatures will climb again by next weekend. Rachel Vince said the cold snap and risk of snow will be caused by air coming down from the Arctic, and the areas at risk of snow are Scotland, the east coast of England, west Wales, south-west England and Northern Ireland.

She described next week’s  cold weather as ‘brief’, and  said temperatures are expected to return to normal towards  the weekend. Snow has already fallen on higher ground in Scotland but next week up to four inches could fall in the Cairngorms. The Met Office stressed that it was ‘not unusual to see snow in late November and early December’ and temperatures were only a couple of degrees lower than average for this time of year. But a spokesman said next week’s snow flurries appear to be ‘a blip’. Forecaster Charles Powell, from the Met Office, said the country would be getting noticeably colder and people should be prepared for snowfall and frosty mornings. He said: 'Snowfall will mainly be for northerly and north west Scotland, probably drifting as far south as north west England, south west England across the moors. 'The main thing people will notice is the drop in temperature below average.' Sainsburys expect a 200 per cent increase in sales of snow shovels and are anticipating selling 23,000 cans of de-icer in the coming week.

Accused: Ross Ulbricht is accused of masterminding the Silk Road website and plotting six murders . The man allegedly behind Silk Road, a black market website where users could trade guns and drugs, is now also accused of hiring a hitman to kill six people. Ross William Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on October 1 in San Francisco, accused of being behind the so-called hidden site, which has gained widespread notoriety for its illicit trading over the past two years. Following his arrest, the FBI shut down the site and Ulbricht was charged with a number of crimes, including plotting the murders of two people. But last week, Ulbricht, who was denied bail over fears he could abscond, was accused by prosecutors of actually plotting to kill six people. Prosecutors say Ulbricht, who operated under the alias, Dread Pirate Roberts, hired someone named 'redandwhite' to carry out the killings. However, the government was not able to confirm any of the six murders actually took place. Prosecutors suggest that Ulbricht may have therefore been duped into paying the fee of $500,000 Bitcoins to his hitman. A so-called hidden site, Silk Road used an online tool known as Tor to mask the location of its servers. Visitors could buy and . sell drugs and guns using bitcoins, a form of online cash. While . many other sites sell drugs more or less openly, Silk Road's technical . sophistication, its user-friendly escrow system and promise of . near-total anonymity quickly made it among the best known. The popularity of Silk Road is said to have earned the site owner $80 million from commissions involving every sale. The . FBI shut down the site after Ulbricht's arrest on October 1 at a small . branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a cooperating . witness, according to authorities and court papers. Among the allegations against him is one from the Baltimore . federal court involving soliciting the murder of a former worker who was . arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the . former worker would turn on him. Black market: Silk Road gained widespread notoriety two years ago as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash . Meanwhile prosecutors . in New York have charged Ulbricht - a native Texan who was living in . San Francisco and holds degrees from the University of Texas and Penn . State - with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian . man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and . began blackmailing Ulbricht. Ulbricht . is also accused of operating Silk Road under the alias 'Dread Pirate . Roberts' and earning $80 million from commissions involving every sale. FBI . agents appear to have penetrated the behind-the-scenes operations of . Silk Road and obtained a list of the sites users and sellers, court . papers show. In court: This artist's sketch, from October 4, shows Ross Ulbricht, right, . appearing in Federal Court with his public defender Brandon LeBlanc, in San Francisco. Last week he was denied bail. Authorities . in Britain, Sweden, and the United States have arrested eight people . who are charged with using the site to sell drugs. Earlier this month, it was also revealed that just six weeks after being shut down, the website had reopened.Silk Road 2.0 - which can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items such as cocaine, ecstasy, fake utility bills and driving licences. But some commentators have expressed caution over Silk Road 2.0, with one suggesting it could be a scam by law enforcement agencies, set up to capture details about those using the website. Ulbricht's family and friends protest that he is innocent and this week offered $1m in bail for his release. Business: Ulbricht is listed as an entrepreneur on LinkedIn.

Close ties: Roberts' father was Congressman Hale Boggs (seen left with President Kennedy on October 11, 1963- just a month before the assassination) 'I really think that the problem is that it's very hard for people to accept that one deranged soul could have such an enormous impact. It's so much easier to believe in a conspiracy bc its rational,' she said during an interview on Morning Joe. Her father was a leader in Congress and accompanied the Speaker to Andrews Air Force Base to receive Air Force One and the President's casket when it arrived from Dallas. Newly-elected President Johnson later called Congressman Boggs at their family home in Louisiana to ask him to join the investigating committee, which went on to be referred to as the Warren Commission. 'I can remember my father so well saying ""We need a blue ribbon commission to put everything to rest so the American people know we have examined every possibility and we know exactly what happened"" and of course that didn't happen,' Ms Roberts said. Searching: After nearly a year-long investigation, the Warren Commission (featuring Boggs, right) produced a 889-page report asserting that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and a 'single bullet' was used to hit both Kennedy and Connally . Political family: Cokie was the youngest child (seen at right in 1947) of Congresswoman Lindy Boggs (left) and Congressman Hale Boggs (center), both Democrats from Louisiana . 'Now, he was somewhat skeptical of the single bullet theory and basically he signed the commission report and of course it was unanimous.' She went on to concede: 'It's somewhat difficult to see the bullet taking that trajectory.' 'Since then we haven't learned anything more that would indicate anything else. 'The House Committee on Assassinations in 1978 with much more technology to examine these things basically came to the same conclusion right up to the last minute when they heard an acoustical report that- to them- sounded like to guns. That report has been discredited.' The Warren Commission produced an 889-page report and passed their findings on to President Kennedy on September 24, 1964. Fatal ride: President Kennedy was shot and killed during a motorcade in Dallas . They asserted that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing the President, and nightclub owner Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald before he could stand trial. More than a decade later, the House Select Committee on Assassinations used improved technology. While they conceded that Oswald did act alone, they did think that Oswald was motivated by a conspiracy.

Since the 1800s, populations around the world have grown six fold causing a rapid expansion of cities and towns. To plot the extent at which some of these cities have grown, cartographers created colourful and striking maps showing the age of every building in certain countries. Properties in Moscow, Reykjavik, New York City and its borough Brooklyn have been colour coded to not only show how populations have expanded, but also highlight the places within those cities that are still growing. The colours in the Houses of Moscow map, pictured, appear to spread outwards from the centre of the Russian city in ripples. The oldest buildings are plotted around this centre and date back to the 15th Century and much of the architecture that was built before the revolution remains largely untouched .

The oldest buildings are plotted around the centre, dating all the way back to the 15th Century and much of the architecture that was built before the revolution remains largely untouched. As the map is zoomed out, the newer developments sit predominantly on the outskirts of the city. Houses of Moscow, created by Russia’s Mercator Research Centre, lists six historical periods.The map covers pre-revolutionary Russia, and then Russia under Stalin and the Bolsheviks (1922 to 1952), Nikita Khrushchev (1958 to 1964), Leonid Brezhnev (1964 to 1982), Yuri Andropov (1982 to 1984), Konstantin Chernenko (1984 to 1985), Mikhail Gorbachev (1988 to 1991) and Yury Luzhkov (1992 to 2010).

Few buildings remain that date back to the 19th century but one of the oldest properties is shown as 67 Jumel Terrace, built in 1765. This is the Morris-Jumel Mansion located in the historic district in Washington Heights. The district consists of 49 rowhouses and apartment buildings built between 1882 and 1909. Many of the buildings are made of wood or brick rowhouses in the Queen Anne and Romanesque styles. Other older buildings can also be found in Broadway as well as along the East river in Manhattan. Alternatively, people interested in seeing the ages of buildings in just Brooklyn can use the Block by Block map. This map covers buildings built in 1825, shown in blue, up to buildings built since 2000, shown in dark red.

A former Mob associate who spent over a decade posing as a cattle rancher in Idaho has been convicted in a string of federal charges, including the attempted murder of a man who became the boss of the New England Mafia. Enrico Ponzo was convicted in a racketeering indictment after a month-long trial. Prosecutors said Ponzo teamed up with a faction of mobsters that wanted to stop Francis 'Cadillac Frank' Salemme from becoming the boss of the Patriarca crime family. Secret life: Enrico M Ponzo, right, who was known as Jay Shaw to his neighbors in the rural town of Marsing, Idaho, with his friend Kelly Verceles, left, at a hockey game in Boise . Prosecutors said Ponzo teamed up with a faction of mobsters that wanted to stop Salemme from becoming the boss of the Patriarca crime family, the New England branch of the Mafia. Ponzo was convicted of being one of the triggermen who shot at Salemme in 1989 as he walked into a pancake house in Saugus, north of Boston. Salemme survived the shooting. Ponzo fled in 1994 and wasn’t captured until 2011, when authorities found him in Marsing, Idaho, where he owned a handful of cows on a small ranch and neighbors knew him as Jay Shaw. In opening statements to the jury last month, a prosecutor said Ponzo was an associate in the Patriarca family who participated in extortions, assaults and attempted murders while rival factions were vying for control of the organized crime group in the late 1980s and early ‘90s. Prosecutors said Ponzo re-invented himself after he fled Massachusetts, first as a large-scale marijuana distributor in Arizona, then as a cattle rancher in Idaho. Ponzo’s lawyer, however, said he was not a made member or an associate of the Mafia. The defense also challenged the credibility of the government’s witnesses, including mob figures who made deals with prosecutors for reduced sentences. Ponzo’s lawyer, John Cunha Jr., also told the jury that Ponzo left Massachusetts because he believed he was on a hit list created by a mobster whose son was shot to death. Cunha said he plans to appeal. 'The jury worked hard. They obviously gave great care since they found him not guilty on a number of things as well as guilty on other things,' he said. 'Nevertheless, it’s a disappointment.' Verdict: Enrico M Ponzo, left, who was known as Jay Shaw was found guilty and will be sentenced in March . Ponzo was convicted of being one of the . triggermen who shot at Salemme in 1989 as he walked into a pancake house . in Saugus, north of Boston. He was acquitted of several other charges. Ponzo fled in 1994 and wasn't captured until 2011, when authorities found him in Marsing, Idaho. With his East Coast accent and tales . of living in New York, Ponzo lived under an assumed name, Jay Shaw. He stood out when he moved to the tiny farm . town but he was friendly enough, even helpful, to his neighbors, and they never suspected him of having a dark secret. After . about a decade of living the quiet life of a would-be cattle rancher, . his past closed in on him one day in 2011 as he was negotiating a . purchase of hay near his 12-acre ranch. A 1994 file photo provided by the FBI shows Enrico Ponzo - he had been living quietly as an Idaho rancher for almost two decades before the law caught up with him . Massachusetts authorities had caught up with him, more than 16 years after he disappeared. His real name was Enrico Ponzo, and he was wanted on numerous federal charges in a racketeering indictment, including the 1989 attempted murder of Francis 'Cadillac Frank' Salemme, who went on to become the boss of the Patriarca crime family. His former neighbors in Idaho have been watching news coverage of the trial over the last month. Some are still stunned that the novice rancher they knew was accused of being mixed up with mobsters in Boston. In this artist's sketch, 42-year-old Enrico Ponzo appears in federal court in Boise, Idaho. He is accused of being part of a plot to kill a crime boss . 'It was almost unbelievable,' said . farmer Bob Briggs, who was talking about hay with Ponzo when he was . arrested. 'People couldn't understand why and what for and how come.' In . Idaho, where he had lived for a little over a decade, Ponzo owned a . handful of cows and spent a lot of time with his two young children. 'He . told me he was from New York and that he had been in the Army,' said . Briggs, who farmed land across from where Ponzo lived and got to know . him. In August 2010, Ponzo's longtime girlfriend Cara Pace left with their kids and moved to another state. 'It . almost killed him,' Briggs said. 'He took care of them, he fed them, he . did everything for them. He was just devastated when she took the . kids.' Ponzo was wanted for the attempted murder of Francis Salemme, a mob boss turned government informant who is now believed to be in the witness protection program .

Warning: Ofcom said in a scathing report it was very concerned about Royal Mail's performance . Royal Mail is failing to deliver the post on time to a third of Britain’s postcodes, despite charging more than ever for a first-class stamp, the industry watchdog said yesterday. Ofcom said in a scathing report it was ‘very concerned’ about the company’s performance and threatened to impose multi-million-pound fines unless drastic improvements were made. Royal Mail’s failure is particularly shocking because the report covers the year from April 2012, the month when the price of a first-class stamp jumped from 46p to 60p. Brian Binley, a Tory MP on the Commons Business Select Committee, which is investigating Royal Mail’s controversial privatisation, said: ‘The British public is simply not getting the service it needs. ‘If there was ever an argument for an injection of new management into Royal Mail, it is this report.’ In each of the country’s 121 postcode areas, 91.5 per cent of first-class letters are meant to be delivered the next working day. But Royal Mail only manages to meet this target in 73 areas, equal to just 62 per cent of the total. Because of difficulties in delivering post the extreme weather, the Hebrides, the Orkneys and the Shetland Islands are not included in the target. As a result, the post arrives later than it should in 45 areas as widespread as Oldham, Stevenage, Brighton, Stoke-on-Trent, Tonbridge and many parts of London. Ofcom’s report revealed: . Ofcom warned: ‘We are very concerned about these failures. In particular, we note the poor and highly variable performance of the postcode area targets.’ Interrogation: The report comes just days before MPs are to quiz Business Secretary Vince Cable about the recent privatisation . It will now monitor Royal Mail’s service and says it will launch a formal investigation if targets are not met. This could result in ‘enforcement action’ and ‘financial penalties’ of up to 10 per cent of postal revenue. Mike O’Connor, chief executive of the watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ‘Consumers want a reliable postal service and they need to know they are getting what they pay for, especially given the number of price rises over successive years. ‘Ofcom’s analysis clearly shows that Royal Mail is falling short in this respect with no clear reason for these failures.’ Ofcom points out that the  91.5 per cent target is crucial because it ‘ensures Royal Mail provides a good level of service across the UK, not just in more densely populated areas’. But Royal Mail’s performance has actually deteriorated since it increased its prices. During the financial year 2011/2012, when a first-class stamp cost just 46p, the target was met in 97 postcode areas. Ian Murray, Labour’s postal affairs spokesman, said Royal Mail ‘must do better and take appropriate steps to make sure targets are met in future.’ He added: ‘Given that Royal Mail is no longer in public ownership after the Government’s fire sale, it is crucial that we don’t see a shift in focus away from service delivery to maximising shareholder value leading to a poorer service.’ Ofcom’s report comes just days before MPs are to quiz Business Secretary Vince Cable, Business Minister Michael Fallon, and Lazards, the investment bank that advised the Government about the recent privatisation. The biggest controversy surrounds the pricing of the shares at just £3.30 each, with many critics claiming they were undervalued. Last night, they were priced at £5.39 when the markets closed. A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘We were disappointed that we didn’t meet all of the regulatory quality of service targets we were required to last year. This remains a key area of focus for us. ‘Royal Mail has the highest service specification of any major European country and we take our service performance very seriously.’","Royal Mail deliver letters and parcels late in 45 areas across the country .

Organic evangelist: Lady Carole Bamford has spent over a year and £1million to open The Wild Rabbit . Down in the lush pastures of Daylesford Organic, where every tomato is heritage and the beetroots are shaved, not pickled, trouble is a-brewing. Carole Bamford, Britain’s pioneering champion of luxury eco-chic and all things organic, has uncovered a problem. Married to the fabulously wealthy JCB magnate Sir Anthony Bamford, who has just been elevated to the House of Lords, Lady B faces a teensy glitch in her bid to live a life untainted by chemicals, synthetics or the merest whiff of bad taste. Brace yourselves, people: there is no such thing as organic condensed milk. That’s a bit like saying there is no such thing as an organic deep-fried Mars bar, but one can sympathise with her plight. In her new Daylesford cook book, A Love For Food, subtitled Recipes And Notes For Eating Well, we learn that Carole loves purple sprouting broccoli, coffee jelly (‘It gives you a lift at the end of a meal’), clam linguine with butter and lots of salads of crunchy chopped vegetables, but only if the vegetables are chopped small. We also discover that choosing to live organically is not always a free-range picnic, not even for the most evangelical devotee. For when developing a recipe for chocolate, almond and espresso fudge in line with the Daylesford organic-only edicts, one of Lady Bamford’s cooks was stumped when it came to making it without the condensed milk — surely that’s against the fudge law? So she fudged it with double cream. Phew. Crisis averted. And another step forward for Lady Bamford’s relentless,  36-year organic crusade which encompasses farms, cheeses, a herd of rare breed Gloucester cows, her famous and much-copied farm shops, a bunch of cafes, a spa, bath products, a range of clothes made from natural fibres plus her recipe book — and now a pub. Nestled in the Cotswolds village of Kingham, the pub welcomes locals with two topiary rabbits at the front door . For Lady B, 67, has spent more than a year and £1 million overseeing the renovation of the former Tollgate pub in the idyllic Cotswold village of Kingham. Now called The Wild Rabbit, the pub is just down the road from the Daylesford  epicentre itself and boasts two giant  topiary rabbits guarding the front door. Inside, it is ravishing, with all the stripped back, rustic chic many have come to associate with the farm shop motherships. There is mellow, exposed brickwork, weathered oak and vases artfully drooping with cowslips and hedgerow berries. Not one but three log fires crackle as customers sip blackberry Bellinis or nurse beers served in the most elegant pint glasses I’ve ever seen. At one table, a glamorous woman in a bubble skirt is enjoying a date night away from the kids. No wonder she looks familiar; it is Amanda Holden and her husband Chris Hughes. The previous evening, former Labour Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and her husband David Mills also dined in the handsome restaurant, where Spanish hams hang from the ceiling, bottles of Lady Bamford’s own brand prosecco are on ice and even things as humdrum as chips are given the superstar treatment: hand-cut, cooked until gilded and crisp, served in miniature copper saucepans and costing £4 per portion. Not one but three log fires crackle in front of the bar where Daylesford Organic prosecco is being chilled . ‘That’s about 70p per chip,’ moaned one diner, but no one was listening. It is all achingly tasteful, from the pots of sage on the bleached wood tables in the garden to the raw linen napkins to the stone-flagged bathrooms, where loo paper is hung from artisan hazel twig holders and even the soap, blended from herbs and flowers, is organic, fragrant and desirable. Does this make The Wild Rabbit, which opened four days ago, the poshest pub in Britain? It certainly seems that way, even if some might think Lady Bamford has gone too far in her cream-paint quest for perfection. Sometimes, just sometimes, it might be that little bit too precious. For example, on the Wild Rabbit menu, ironic italics are used to describe a chilled blackberry and apple ‘crumble’. Why the italics, I ask one of the passing waiters, all of whom are dressed in amusing checked shirts and jeans, like the cast of a local production of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers. ‘I don’t know,’ he said, with charm. ‘Maybe it’s because it is not really a . . . crumble?’ When I look at Lady B’s beetroot orzo with hazelnuts recipes, she reminds me a little of Gwyneth Paltrow, another clean queen whose 500 thread count bed linen, healthy, organic and multi-mansioned lifestyle means that she conveniently forgets ordinary people do not have the time, the staff or the resources to factor in the sour dough bread making, stock simmering, chutney making and quinoa soaking demands that such an existence entails. Never mind, the Wild Rabbit is sure to become a popular meeting place for the Chipping Norton set, whose Cotswold homes are dotted around the pub like a ring of not-too-distant compass points. Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson is out to the west, troubled former newspaper editor — and Lady B’s good friend — Rebekah Brooks and husband Charles live east, Matthew Freud and Elisabeth Murdoch are south at Burford Priory while David Cameron, in whose constituency The Wild Rabbit stands, has a home farthest away, to the south east. Even things as humdrum as chips are given the superstar treatment: hand-cut, cooked until gilded and crisp, served in miniature copper saucepans and costing £4 per portion. Preciously, ironic italics are used to describe a chilled blackberry and apple 'crumble' on the restaurant's menu where waiters pass by in checked shirts and jeans . The kind of stealthy, unobtrusive luxury available at the Wild Rabbit is bound to appeal to them all, even if the pub launch is an intriguing development for Lady Bamford. Although her brands are much admired, not everything she has launched has been a commercial success. Indeed, the latest figures from Companies House show that Daylesford Organics made a £4.3 million loss at the end of 2011. However, the Bamfords plough on regardless, and one gets the idea that money is not the motivating issue here. An early adopter, Carole Bamford has been passionate about organic farming since 1977. For most, buying organic is a choice made if you can afford it. For the Bamfords, it is a way of life, and one she wants to share. In 2002, she started the Daylesford Organic farm shop. From sheepskin ponchos to £300 truckles of artisan cheese, some of the things she does are so wildly extravagant, so far removed from the ordinary person’s finances that even the yummy mummy bedrock of her businesses baulked. Once an air hostess, Carole Bamford is now one of the richest women in the country — one can’t help but feel she has lost touch with family budgets. Critics suggest it is easy for her to launch these money-draining ventures; she is married to a billionaire. But it would be easier to do nothing. Instead, she creates jobs — and fun. For I can’t help but feel she is on to something with her lovely pub, its first class food, made by her own former chef Adam Caisley, and 12 bedrooms. The 12 bedrooms are all named after woodland creatures, and offer a whirl of natural fabrics and throbbing neutrals . Costing about £100 a night — not extravagant in these parts — each room is named after a woodland creature — of course it is! I stayed in Hedgehog, a whirl of natural fabrics and throbbing neutrals. After a night swathed in so much monogrammed organic cotton and raw linen luxury, I know how it feels to be a coddled golden egg. In some respects, Lady Bamford is a Marie Antoinette figure — let them eat organic — but I admire her field-to-folk ethic and her love of good food — even though few of us could afford to dine so well on a daily basis. Once home, in my own not entirely organic environment, I channel the wholesome and totally Cotswoldy Lady B vibe. Things I’ve learned from her book? If you’ve got partridge legs — and I do, but not the way she thinks — freeze them for a pie. Putting a pinch of salt in the water makes boiled eggs easier to peel — but does anyone apart from a multi-millionairess  think peeling an egg is hard? And please note that the Daylesford gang feel really quite happy describing their own chocolate brownies as ‘iconic’. Things I learned from The Wild Rabbit pub? That the potted rabbit and roast loin of rabbit they serve are actually farmed. So the place should really be called The Farmed Rabbit. Or even The Shaved Beetroot. Or perhaps The Poshest Pub In England? Yes, most definitely that.","Jan Moir visited The Wild Rabbit in the Cotswolds village of Kingham .

The 49-year-old's naturally bee-stung lips looked larger than ever on her latest outing with the 70-year-old advertising tycoon .

"By . Annabel Cole . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 20 November 2013 . Last week, Emma Thompson revealed that she had written a 'sex handbook' for her 13-year-old daughter to help guide her through the pitfalls of being a modern teenager. The Oscar-winning actress explained she had come up with the idea because she was in a 'constant state of anxiety' due to of the vast pressures that young people are under today when it comes to sex, relationships and the internet. Mum's wise words: Annabel Cole shares her advice with her 14-year-old daughter Elsa . It was a situation that mother Annabel Cole sympathised with. Even though she's always strived to be open about the 'birds and the bees' with her 14-year-old daughter Elsa, she knows there remains a vast array of subjects she still needs to tackle. Here, she writes her own 'sex handbook' for Elsa. So could it help your daughter too? Your private life should be private, not splashed over the internet like the late-night antics of Miley Cyrus. To us oldies, it beggars belief that teens might even contemplate sending send pictures of their private parts over the phone; or share their intimate feelings with several hundred so-called 'friends' on Facebook or Tweet a comment about last night's date to your followers. In a world where these activities are often seen as 'normal', it's easy to forget that you do have a choice. Would you let someone read your diary? Why should your attitude to the internet be any different? Posting something intimate online might seem like a good idea, at the moment you do itbut it has the potential to go from private to extremely public at the press of a button. The potential consequences of this are at best embarrassing, at worst very damaging. A good rule of thumb is: if you wouldn't feel comfortable sharing this with the whole schoolassembly, then don't share it electronically. There seems to be quite a lot of confusion about this among young people like you at the moment. Porn is a form (if you like, and many people don't) of 'entertainment'. The people in porn films are paid actors. On the birds and the bees: Emma Thompson has written a 'sex handbook' for her 13-year-old daughter Gaia . The danger is, teenagers - particularly boys I'm afraid - don't always get this, and they can develop some pretty unrealistic expectations of what real-life sex will be. An inexperienced boy who has watched a porn film will have about as accurate an idea of what real-life sex is like as a viewer of Keeping Up With The Kardashians will have of a day-to-day American family life. Sex doesn't have to involve theatrical groaning and volcanic orgasms; it generally doesn't take place within two seconds of coming within sight of a man. Some of the most intimate moments I have experienced are far removed from these artificial scenarios. Hard as it might be to imagine, successfully putting together an Ikea wardrobe can be as much an invitation to great sex as twerking. Everyone wants to look their best, but don't distort who you are in the process. Waxing, salon-perfect hair and push-up bras and a distinctly measurable thigh gap are part of an increasingly long list of apparent must-haves for teens , but, trust me, none of that will help you unless you feel confident inside. I spent much of my teens counting calories and obsessing about the odd spot, but guess what - boys generally want to be with someone who doesn't take themselves too seriously and is happy to go out for a burger without making everyone feel guilty in the process. I cannot begin to imagine the pressure that teens are under today. Checking your Facebook status, whether you have had a 'like' on Instagram and posting seductive-looking selfies are now routine activities, carried out with deadly seriousness many times a day. It must feel as if the world is watching you and to some extent, it is. But, when it comes to boys, you might be surprised to find out that they don't care as much about appearance as the online world might lead you to think. Dating can be a pretty grisly business, particularly when you are new to it, and often when you are not. The best preparation for dating is to abandon fairytale fantasies and prepare yourself for awkwardness, nervous chatting, deadly silence and possibly clumsy fumbling. First kisses are generally not the earth-shattering experiences you might imagine alone at home in your bedroom. Mine - with a gangly Italian boy at a teen disco in Cinderella Rockerfella's in Guildford - was a nasty mess of clashing teeth, blackheads and saliva flavoured with cheap cans of cola. The earth did not move, but I survived. Don't be fooled by 'big talk' from your peer group. No teenager really knows what they are doing, although many people will try to convince you in no uncertain terms that they do. At 14, I used to dread Monday mornings at school when a certain gang of girls would loudly relate their weekend exploits. I felt like a baby in comparison and felt pressurised into exaggerating some of my own behaviour, which I regret. Retrospective regret: Your private life should be private, not splashed over the internet like the late-night antics of Miley Cyrus . And don't lie to get a guy. 'Yes, I love rugby; no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon.' 'The Matrix - my favourite movie of all time. What a coincidence!' Or, as I once memorably lied to a potential beau: 'Rock climbing - been wanting to try that for ages!' Reality will always out - in my case quite spectacularly when, fully kitted out in professional gear, I failed even to hoist myself off the ground. At best, like me, you will be setting yourself up for some serious embarrassment; at worst you run the risk of condemning yourself to some pretty unappealing down-time with your man. Rejection will happen. It's awful and you will feel as if the world has ended.  My first love left me to go back to his ex. Even now, it hurts and I still feel a little bit indignant - how could he prefer her to me? If you like someone, a little bit of them will stay with you forever. It's OK to wait and absolutely OK to say 'no'. There is so much talk about sex in the teen years among teens that you might feel as if you are the only one on the planet who isn't bedhopping on a nightly basis. You are not. Experience has taught me that those who boast the loudest about sexual encounters, generally aren't doing it at all. Nobody likes to feel left out, but remember it is your body and you should be in charge of what you do with it and whom you share it with. Distorted view of reality: Boys who think porn accurately depicts sex are like those who think Keeping Up With the Kardashians is an accurate portrayal of day-to-day American family life . When I was in my teens one of our favourite topics of conversation at school was who had 'done it' and who had not. Not much change there you might think. However, when I was at school these conversations generally started to take off in the Sixth Form, not in Years 9 and 10 as they often do today. When I lost my virginity at 17 it was with a mixture of pleasure but more than that, relief. Box ticked.  Could I have waited longer? Yes. Was it with the right person? I thought so at the time. Did I feel more grown up? Not really. I still had to go home afterwards and finish off my English homework. As with first kisses, your first sexual experience may not be the stuff of your wildest fantasies. Sex takes practice and is best with someone you love and who loves you too. So it's no surprise that the 'first time' can be riven with false starts, embarrassment and often the feeling that something didn't go quite right. That's absolutely normal and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But when things do go right and you eventually fall in love, there is nothing better. A real, worthwhile relationship will not play itself out online and the person you are with will give you the space to be who you are, not constrain you within a porn-inspired fantasy which will be elaborated - with pictures - on Facebook the morning after. Don't expect everything to run without a hitch. Even after a romantic date and night of passion, your partner is as likely to be thinking about his breakfast as he is hearts and flowers. Never forget that something posted on the internet will stay with you for life. Imagine how you would feelif you went for a job interview and before you had even arrived, your potential employer had made a judgement about you based on a revealing selfie posted on Instagram a few years before? The same goes for comments about other people. Being online can give you a false sense of freedom as you don't have to deal with people face to face. Think twice before you write; what you say will affect the person you are writing about and will undoubtedly have an impact on the way that others view you.","Keep your private life private - not splashed all over the internet .

But these hardy travellers are happy to laugh off the impending danger of a 2,000ft plunge into a rushing river below them. At some points on their dangerous journey, believed to be between Killar and Kishtwar in the Himalayas of northern India, barely inches separate the men from a terrifying fall. Tempting fate: One of the British passengers leans out of the van to catch a glimpse of the drop below him . Precarious: At some points the van is just inches from a 2,000ft drop . The footage shows the British travellers tentatively guide their their van along a track carved out of the rock high above the waters of the Chenab river below. One passenger, identified only as Rob, remains tight-lipped throughout the experience despite being prompted to chime in by the narrator. At one point a man referred to as Rinku, who appears to be a local, steps out of the van in order to survey an overhanging rockface, which the tourists fear may be so low as to stop the vehicle from proceeding. The video, uploaded to sharing site Prochan, invites watch to join the gut-churning spectacle as the camera is pointed over the lip over the road. At any especially narrow spot, the men can't help tempting fate s they stare into the abyss below with cries of 'Oh my God!' and 'What do you reckon to that drop?' Sure-footed: A man referred to as Rinku, who appears to be a local, steps out to test whether the van will fit under the jutting rockface ahead . Slippery territory: At one point the road passes directly under a waterfall . They do not seem to have complete confidence in their vehicle either, with one man wondering whether the doors might give way and leave him plunging down the mountainside. The stretch, dubbed 'the narrowest we've been through' by the passengers, was also described as 'the maddest road I've ever been down in my life'. Nonetheless, everybody seemed impressed by the break taking views, despite the danger that came with them. One particularly dangerous moment came when the van came close to a waterfall, sheltered only by the lip overhanging their road. Amusingly, the camerman failed to close his window in time and ended up with a soaked chair.","Daredevil tourists drive, inches from death, along a mountain track .

Senior Tory MP Tim Yeo has been cleared of accusations that he abused his position to help green companies lobby ministers. Mr Yeo, who stepped down as chair of the influential Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee in June, was reinstated yesterday after an inquiry by the sleaze watchdog. The parliamentary standards committee ruled that his actions - exposed by a newspaper sting operation - had broken no rules. Tim Yeo had been clear of claims he abused his position as chairman of the Commons energy and climate change committee . Undercover reporters, posing as representatives of a fake solar technology company, approached Mr Yeo offering a £7,000-a-day consultancy contract with the firm. He was filmed saying: ‘If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections’. Asked if that included government minister he said ‘yes’. House of Commons rules prohibit MPs from acting as paid advocates to lobby ministers. Mr Yeo was also asked about his committee’s questioning of John Smith, managing director of GB Railfreight. The MP did not ask him any questions, after declaring he was a paid director and shareholder of Eurotunnel - its parent company. But he was filmed telling the reporters: ‘I told him [Mr Smith] what to say. Ha ha.’ Mr Yeo had stepped down as chairman in June, but was reinstated yesterday . The standards committee, which is made up from MPs of all parties, concluded he did not expect a financial interest in the company or offer to approach ministers or civil servants on their behalf. They said it was the undercover reporters who were guilty of ‘subterfuge, misrepresentation and selective quotation’, and went on: ‘Media investigations can have a role to play in ensuring high standards of public conduct but we note that in this case Mr Yeo has broken no rules and the only misrepresentation has been that of the journalists themselves.’ Standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson found there was no evidence he had coached the business associate but did urge Mr Yeo to ‘consider more carefully the impact of his comments’. But she did called for a wider review into whether committee chairmen’s outside interests should be restricted, saying while these positions could help their work on specialist committees, ‘there is equally a reasonable concern that that Member is then placed in a privileged position which he or she may be able to exploit for their own interests with few checks and balances’. Mr Yeo, she said, had made clear he could not be a ‘public advocate’ and any ministers would have to judge the merits of the product adding that ‘the integrity of the system here is pretty high’. A former environment minister under John Major, Mr Yeo’s job as chairman of the committee is to ask tough questions of ministers and firms about Britain’s energy policy. But the MP for South Suffolk has attracted criticism for earned £400,000 in the past three years from commercial work, much of it linked to the business of green energy. He has also clashed with George Osborne about plans to cut green taxes. Mr Yeo said in a statement yesterday: ‘I welcome this report. After a full investigation, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner accepted, as I have always maintained, that I did not break the rules of the House. ‘This investigation included a thorough examination of the full video-recording produced - after a six-week delay - to the commissioner by the Sunday Times. ‘Based on what I actually said, rather than what I was reported by the newspaper to have said, the commissioner found and the committee confirms that I have not acted in breach of the code of conduct.’","Senior Conservative cleared over claims he abused his position .

A wealthy young Philippine woman is being investigated over tax evasion after she posted pictures of her privileged lifestyle online. Jeane Napoles, whose mother is being investigated as part of the Philippines' biggest ever fraud case, used social networking sites to post pictures of her life in the US. Featuring designer dresses, jewel-encrusted shoes and fast cars, the posts drew condemnation from those in her home country where an estimated 28 per cent of people live in poverty. Scroll down for video . Tax investigators from Napoles' home country say they found out about her from the internet . Napoles hasn't filed a single US tax return since 2008 despite having estimated liabilities of $744,000 . But the photographs also drew the attention of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, who are now investigating the 23-year-old for tax fraud. Kim Henares, chief of the Philippine Bureau, said: 'We read the newspapers. We follow the Internet. That is where we heard about her.' Miss Napoles, a fashion design student, owns a Los Angeles condominium at the Ritz Carlton, valued at $1.3million (£795,000), as well as another property worth $339,000 (£212,000) in her home country. The socialite owns a $1.3million condominium at the Ritz Carlton in LA, which is now reported to be up for sale . Jeane Napoles, 23, is being investigated for tax fraud after allegedly posting images online which drew the attention of authorities who are already investigating her mother in one of the country's biggest-ever fraud cases . ABS-CBN news has since reported that the American property is up for sale. The youngster's mother, Janet (pictured right), is currently in jail awaiting trial . According to Ms Henares the young woman had not filed any US tax returns since 2008, despite being a registered taxpayer. 'We have always said there is nothing wrong with being rich as long you pay the right taxes' Ms Henares added. The socialite's tax liabilities were calculated to be $744,000 (£465,000) for the last two years alone. Janet Napoles, a businesswoman and Jeane's mother, is being investigated for allegedly helping Philippine MPs embezzle up to $232million (£145million). Three opposition senators as well as former president Gloria Arroyo, who is in jail for election fraud and graft, are among those swept up in the investigation. They could face criminal charges for misuse of funds. Ms Henares denied any political motive in prosecuting the daughter and said she is merely enforcing tax laws. 'Whether it is her fault or her mother's fault, someone will go to jail,' said Ms Henares.","Jeane Napoles, 23, posted pictures of her luxury life online .

A family in Russia are behind a six-year reign of terror including at least 30 murders and countless robberies, say police. Former nursery teacher Inessa Tarverdiyeva, 46, and her second husband Roman Podkopaev, 35, a qualified dentist, were involved in the spate of ruthless serial killings. Tarverdiyeva's daughter from her first marriage Viktoria Tarverdiyeva, 25 and her 13-year-old daughter Anastasiya 'actively took part in all crimes', say police in the Rostov region. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Former kindergarten teacher Inessa Tarverdiyeva, 46, demonstrates to police how she used a gun to kill her victims . Head of the family Roman Podkopayev (left) who was killed by police in a shootout and mother Inessab Tarverdiyeva's 25 year old daughter Viktoria  who was seriously wounded . Podkopaev died in a shootout with police when the middle class killers were finally arrested, and Viktoria was seriously wounded. Six policemen were among their murder victims in a family crime spree which began in earnest six years ago though some offences go back to 1998. They saw murder and robbery like 'going to the office for a day's work', claimed Inessa who also confessed to hating police saying: 'I am a gangster by nature.' Killing was a 'means of earning money', she said, before demonstrating to police how she used a gun to kill her victims. In one 2009 murder, the gang . murdered paratrooper Dmitry Chudakov, his wife Irina and son Sasha, 7, . with a semi-automatic weapon before daughter Veronika, 11, was . knifed 37 times. 'Housewife' Inessa Tarverdiyeva demonstrates to police how she gunned down victims during a six year reign of terror that left 30 people dead . Inessa Tarverdiyeva shows how she shot one of her victims through a car window . They overpowered the family in their car at a lay-by, stealing a laptop, hair dryer and a camera, all worth £950. 'It was not me who killed the children. My husband shot them,' claimed Inessa, who confessed to gunning adults to death. On another occasion the gang tortured and killed two teenage girls, gouging out their eyes. One is believed to have been Inessa's goddaughter. The former teacher allegedly robbed the girl's . house because she knew her father was a passionate hunter and . kept hunting guns at home. She reportedly hid inside the house . with with her gang waiting for the girl's parents to return. But her goddaughter and her friend walked in and were killed. The gang used camping trips - which seemed like . family holidays - as a pretext for their murderous activities. Vicious: One occasion the family cruelly tortured and killed two teenage girls, gouging out their eyes . Vladimir Markin, chief of Russia's . equivalent of the FBI, said: 'They looked like a totally good, nice . family. Imagine them - a mother, a father, two children, including an . underage girl. 'I am sure that when they were together one could hardly imagine that they could even plan a crime.' Inessa claimed  that some of the . policemen were killed to get extra arms, 'Others were shot purely for the sake of money.' According to the police, both Inessa and her second husband had higher education qualifications. Several years ago, she gave up work in . a kindergarten and 'switched completely to their robbery and murder . business', said a source. Podkopaev's sister Anastasia Sinelnik was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting the crime family . The group were finally arrested after a robbery on the home of a former military officer in Baklanova Street, Aksai, in Rostov region. As well as killing an unnamed husband and wife,  they stole alcohol and candles  - as well as chicken drumsticks from the fridge - after finding no money. Podkopaev and his adopted daughter Viktoria tried to escape on a scooter but minutes after leaving the crime scene they were stopped for an ID check by police. When they asked for his documents he pulled out his weapon and opened fire. A second police car came to assist but not before patrolman and father-of-one Ivan Shakhovoi was gunned down. Wounded policeman Aleksey Lagoda, who was in the same patrol as murdered Shakhovoi, said from hospital: 'We told them that we were police, to which the man suddenly raised his arm at shot in my direction.' Searches of the family's homes revealed an . 'arsenal' of 20 firearms, including automatic rifles, grenades, . shotguns, silencers and ammunition, as well as items stolen from their . victims, said Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the Russian Investigation . Committee, equivalent of the FBI . The gang normally broke into private homes from the rear, thoroughly planning their escape, said Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin. They used walkie-talkies and seemed to be well informed about police movements, he said, adding it was difficult to estimate the total number of crimes they committed. The family had a comfortable home in the Stavropol region but travelled to neighbouring Rostov to commit their crimes. Inessa and her younger daughter were seized by police at a camp site where they were guarding a huge haul of weapons. While Podkopaev is portrayed by many . reports as the gang leader, other accounts suggest his wife was the . moving force behind their evil acts. She refused to say why she hated . policemen. One theory is that she had a lover who was a policeman who . left her for another woman. Police now suspect that she later murdered the officer and his new lover. A friend of Inessa said of her: 'Everyone called her Inna but in her passport she is Inessa. Victims: Former paratrooper Dmitry Chudakov and his seven year-old . son were shot in the head. His wife and daughter were stabbed . Hideout: Inside the tent where mother Inessa and 13-year-old Anastasia were caught by police . Wounded policeman Aleksey Lagoda (left) and Ivan Shakhovoi (right) who was murdered by the gang . 'She grew up with her mother, step-father and younger brother. The family was a good one, Inessa was a beauty and many young men liked her, but her step-father watched that she was back home in time and she argued with him about it.' 'She fell in love with an  Azerbaijani man called Arzu, Viktoria's father. He died in mysterious circumstances at a power station were he worked.' Podkopaev was 'a suspect and he married Inessa later,' said the friend. 'Inessa's younger brother openly talked about it. I rarely met Inessa afterwards, and only know that she had one more daughter later.' Also arrested as part of the family . crime gang were Podkopaev's sister, also called Anastasiya, aged 26, and . her husband Sergei Sinelnik, 31, a former traffic policeman. They are suspected of aiding and . abetting the crime family by identifying targets for their robberies, say police sources. They were also used to conceal stolen goods. Weeping in court, Anastasiya told journalists she was not guilty but refused to say if she knew about the crimes her relatives and their children were committing. Before the dramatic finale to the family's years of crime, the authorities suspected the killers had an inside track to the police. Sinelnik, 31, a traffic policeman from Aksai region, did not take part in killing people but knew about all murders and hid some stolen things at home, claim sources. He confessed to feeling pleased that his colleagues could not find the killers yet he knew exactly who they were. His wife Anastasiya took stolen valuables to the jeweller to sell or make into new jewellery, it is claimed. Gunned down by the FBI: Arizona 'Ma' Barker . Arizona 'Ma' Barker was the mother of five sons who ran the Barker crime gang in 1930's America. The popular image of Barker is of a criminal mastermind, Thompson machine gun in hand, leading her boys out on hits against rival gangs during the heyday of the 'Public Enemy' era. But this was later found to have been at best exaggerated and at worst fabricated by the FBI. While her sons were undoubtedly guilty of crimes including murder, robbery and kidnap, there is no evidence that Ma Barker ever took part herself. However that is not say she was innocent - she would do everything within her power to protect her boys and helped them to evade capture on numerous occasions. She knew what they were up to, looked after them and helped them before and after they committed their crimes. They travelled together as mother and sons so as not to arouse suspicion of law enforcement. Most notoriously, she died, aged 61, in a hail of bullets, Tommy gun in hand, during a ferocious battle with the FBI at her home in Wichita, Kansas. Official FBI reports from 1935 say that agents began the shoot-out at the Barker household by throwing three canisters of tear gas inside the house at 7.15 a.m. Shooting began soon afterwards and the Barkers were reported to have used Thompson machine guns to attempt to repel the federal agents. Three hours later, the agents reportedly had almost run out of ammunition and asked Willie Woodbury, a handyman on the estate to check that Barker and her son were indeed dead. Finding that they were, agents detailed the scene and noted that Ma Barker had died in a curled-up position, her slippers on the floor nearby, beneath the bedroom window. Some have suggested that the myth of Ma Barker as the gang leader was created by F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover to justify the killing by police of an old woman.","Family had a 'comfortable' home but travelled for miles to carry out crimes .

The best time to take aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack is in the evening, a study has shown . The best time to take aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack is in the evening, a study shows. The painkillers are taken by millions of Britons to keep their blood thin and cut the risk of potentially deadly clots. And a major heart conference was told blood cells were least likely to bind dangerously together following a bedtime aspirin. In the study, 290 people were asked to take a low-dose aspirin every morning for three months, then before bedtime for three months. At the end of each period, they underwent tests on their blood pressure and platelets. Platelets are tiny cells in the blood that make it clot. Aspirin makes it harder for them to stick together and so cuts the odds of them forming a clump that could trigger a heart attack or stroke. The treatment of 100mg of aspirin a day did not cut blood pressure. However, taking the drug at bedtime did make it more difficult for the platelets to stick together in the morning – the peak time for heart attacks. Lead researcher Dr Tobias Bonten, of Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, said: ‘This simple intervention – switching aspirin intake from morning to bedtime – could be beneficial for the millions of patients with heart disease who take aspirin on a daily basis.’ However, British experts said it was too early for patients to make any changes on the back of the study. Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘We know aspirin can be vital in reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Research into the best time to take a daily dose of aspirin is an interesting idea, but we would need to see much larger and longer studies before a change in practice can be recommended. ‘For now, keep taking your daily aspirin as recommended by your doctor. If you have any concerns about your medication, talk it through with your GP.’ The findings were presented at the American Heart Association’s scientific sessions meeting in Dallas, Texas. Previous research has shown aspirin cuts the risk of certain cancers by more than 40 per cent . Millions of Britons who have survived a heart attack or stroke take low-dose aspirin each day to keep their blood thin. It is also taken by some smokers and others considered to be at risk of having a first heart attack. Some ‘worried well’ also take a daily dose of the painkiller as a form of health insurance. Many will take it first thing in the morning, to prevent them from forgetting it and to get it out of the way for the day. Previous research has shown aspirin cuts the risk of certain cancers by more than 40 per cent, even when only taken every other day. Harvard researchers in the US found that even a very low dose of the painkiller drastically reduces the odds of bowel and stomach cancers. Women who took one 100mg tablet every other day were 43 per cent less likely to get bowel cancer and 36 per cent less at risk of stomach cancer, after a period of 20 years.","Painkillers taken by millions in UK to keep blood thin and cut risk of clots .

Nick Clegg held a secret meeting with a group of super-rich investors hosted by a glamorous French fund manager who was brought up near the Clegg family chateau in Bordeaux. The Deputy Prime Minister spoke at the private dinner hosted by Nathalie Dauriac-Stoebe, a rising City star who handles more than £2 billion of funds on behalf of her ‘ultra-high net worth’ clients. Last night, neither Mrs Dauriac-Stoebe, the 35-year-old chief executive of Signia Wealth, or Mr Clegg would disclose details about the event, which took place recently  at an undisclosed venue. Nick Clegg held a secret meeting with a group of investors hosted by a glamourous French fund manager . Such elite ‘private briefings’ are usually restricted to investors who have placed a minimum of £10 million in funds with the company. Mrs Dauriac-Stoebe grew up on the family vineyard in Saint-Emilion where Chateau Destieux Grand Cru wine is produced. Mr Clegg’s banker father owns a ten-bedroom chateau a few miles away in Bordeaux, which is often used by the Liberal Democrat leader and his family for holidays. Nathalie Dauriac-Stoebe who hosted the secret briefing . Mrs Dauriac-Stoebe, who left France as an 18-year-old to study at Cambridge University, has had a meteoric career in the City, founding the Coutts Private Office – whose clients include the Queen – before establishing Signia three years ago with the backing of leading City figures such as venture capitalist Jon Moulton and Fitness First founder Michael Balfour. She has boasted that she attends business-related breakfasts, lunches and dinners every day of the week at top London restaurants. She also takes groups of clients on trips to Bordeaux, where her father owns three chateaux. Mr Clegg’s father Nicholas, a  76-year-old banker, allows his son to use the family chateau in Curac, near Bordeaux, as an idyllic summer escape for his family. The house is approached by a long, straight drive that leads to two sets of iron gates. It has an outdoor pool, four-car garage and spacious outbuildings. Last night, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘Nick Clegg markets himself as  a champion of the poor, but this sort of secret briefing for investors will beg plenty of questions among Lib Dem voters. I doubt he was discussing plans for a chateau tax.’ Mr Clegg last week called for a  £1 billion tax break for the low-paid  to be introduced in time for the 2015 General Election. He claimed Britain’s recovering economy meant the income tax personal allowance could be raised from £10,000 to £10,500 in April 2015. The move was regarded with suspicion by Conservatives, who saw it as an attempt by Mr Clegg to claim credit for the recovery and ‘ambush’ the PM who was out of the country at the time.

A university is offering students the opportunity to study for a degree in Gothic studies. A new centre at Manchester Metropolitan University will focus on teaching classic spine-chilling literature - but will also cash in on the popularity of modern-day TV shows and vampire flicks such as Twilight. Degree in Twilight: Students are to be given the opportunity to study Gothic horror at university . Lecturers say the subject is no longer a niche topic for horror fans and goths, but has entered the mainstream. And Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series - not to mention the acting of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart - is thought to have played a big part in the genre's recent surge in popularity. The new Manchester Centre for Gothic Studies will also look at the influence of Gothic architecture and art in Victorian times as well as contemporary goth bands and online culture. Literature expert Linnie Blake, who will head up the centre, said the haunting stories often explored taboo topics such as sex or illness. She said: ‘The public interest in the Gothic has never been greater. ‘Books, films, television, video games and graphic novels all illustrate this. ‘But the Gothic isn’t simply a popular mode of entertainment. It is a powerful form of storytelling that tells us something about our deepest and darkest fears, about who we are as people and how our society works.’ Gothic expert Linnie Blake (right) will head up the new course at Manchester Metropolitan University . The centre will be formally launched during the city’s first ever Gothic Manchester Festival, which runs from October 21 to 27. It will also be home to two courses on Gothic studies as well as an academic magazine, Dark Arts. Dr Blake said: ‘MMU is extremely unusual in having a large proportion of academics working on the Gothic, not just in English but in art and design and science and engineering . ‘The Manchester Centre for Gothic Studies will capitalise on this outstanding expertise to enable those who love the Gothic to think about it more deeply and those that don’t to think again. ‘To us, studying the Gothic is an intellectual adventure on the dark side and we want to share this not only with other academics but also with members of the wider world.’ Manchester Metropolitan isn't the only university seeking to capitalise on the recent resurgence of Gothic literature. Dr Serena Trowbridge has revealed her plans to launch an undergraduate module on Gothic literature from next year at Birmingham City University. A purist, she has contended that Twilight series does not constitute Gothic literature in the conventional sense, but said that the popular series would be touched on in her course. The module is also likely to feature discussions on books such as Harry Potter and A Series of Unfortunate Events, which Dr Trowbridge claims are better examples of Gothic fiction. Dr Serena Trowbridge, of Birmingham City University, claims Harry Potter is a better example of Gothic fiction . Despite her reservations, the expert has admitted that the Twilight series has played a significant role getting people interested in other Gothic books. 'There's certainly a growing interest in Gothic literature,' she told Mail Online. 'And I suppose the people coming to our universities now have read the Twilight books now. 'I don't think Twilight is Gothic at all - the Gothic novel up until the mid 20th century certainly tended to be historical. 'But my view is that people reading anything is good news.' She added: 'I have read the Twilight series and know that they have appealed to a lot of people - and not just teenagers. 'It has certainly sparked a rise of interest... and there have been a lot of new books recently that are loosely Gothic.'","New Gothic course to launch at Manchester Metropolitan University .

A dog has died after eating a decomposing ball of fat that had washed up on a Welsh beach. Surfer Daniel Hart, 32, was forced to put his pet Maisey to sleep after she became seriously ill with pneumonia and a bleeding nose. Now, pet owners are being warned about the white lumps of fat - which look like snowballs - that have been washing up in small quantities along the Welsh coast for more than a fortnight. Warning: Pet owners are being warned about decomposing fat balls that are washing up on the Welsh coast . The rancid substance has also been reported in areas along the Cornish coast. Experts are at loss to explain where the fat has come from, but believe either Atlantic storms could have washed it over to the UK or passing ships might have dumped it at sea.

She ran half way to me then started . being sick,' he told BBC Wales online. Maisey, who is believed to have eaten congealed vegetable oil, bled from the nose . as she was carried to her owner's car. She was quickly taken to an emergency vet, where she was given antibiotics for pneumonia. Mr Hart, from Gorseinon, near Swansea, took Maisey home and slept with her on his settee - however, her condition failed to improve and blood began pouring from her nose. Less than six hours hour, Mr Hart decided it would be kinder to have his beloved pet put to sleep. 'It was horrible taking the decision but I didn't want her to suffer,' he said. 'She had lost the will to live.' Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has warned dog walkers using the region's beaches to be 'vigilant' A spokesman for Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has warned dog walkers using the region's beaches to be 'vigilant'. He added that the first reports of rancid fat on Welsh beaches had come in from Ogmore, in the Vale of Glamorgan, almost two weeks ago. 'It appears to have started off in the east and is gradually making its way west,' he said. He said he believed that there had been one death and up to 10 cases of dogs becoming ill after consuming the fat. 'There is nothing particularly to worry about environmentally and there is no danger to humans - I'm assuming that nobody would try to eat it,' he said. The fat has been tested. It has been found to be largely vegetable matter, possibly oil, that is relatively harmless. 'We are not talking about large amounts here but it is something that dogs might eat so we have warned people to be vigilant for the sake of their pets,' he said. A spokesman for Swansea County Council said it was investigating reports of the fat, but had so far encountered nothing. He said cleaning the beach would be the responsibility of the landowner in the area affected.","Surfer Daniel Hart, 32, was forced to put his pet dog Maisey to sleep .

Signalling his intetions: Nigel Farage has said it is an absolute outrage that no-one from Ukip has received a peerage . Nigel Farage has signalled that he wants a seat in the House of Lords, branding it ‘an absolute outrage’ that the UK Independence Party has not been handed any peerages. The Ukip leader attacked David Cameron for failing to recognise his party, despite promises to make the Lords more representative of how people vote. Mr Farage, who is currently an MEP, has said that he will run for Parliament at the general election in 2015. But sources in Ukip have privately revealed that he also covets a seat in the upper house. In an interview with Total Politics magazine, Mr Farage joked that that become a peer ‘sounds a bit respectable doesn’t it, very, very worrying’. But he added: ‘What I will say that it’s an absolute outrage that we haven’t been offered any peerages for the party already. Just an outrage. ‘Cameron blathers on about wanting a House of Lords that represents the way people in this country vote, well crikey O’Reilly, we’ve been offered nothing, it just goes to show, doesn’t it?’ In the wide-ranging interview Mr Farage admitted that his party has suffered in the past because it resembled a ‘rugby club’ and did not include enough women. He said: ‘I think at its worst UKIP has looked a bit like the rugby club on a day out’ where the priority was to ‘go off and have some fun -- we’ve been a bit guilty of that. ‘We also, in the early days, just didn’t have many able women in the party, or able women who had the time to give to politics. That’s changed completely and if you look at the European election list for next year, the women dominate it.’ Mr Farage attacked David Cameron over his desire to want a Lords that represents the way people vote without any Ukip members . Mr Farage said Ukip would run candidates at every seat in 2015 but also suggested Ukip would be prepared to endorse individual Conservative MPs who were prepared to call for an in-out referendum before the election. Never say never: The Ukip leader made clear he would not want to work with David Cameron if Ukip won seats in Westminster in 2015, but said he would not rule it out . David Cameron has pledged to hold a referendum in 2017 after re-negotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. But a handful of Tories are preparing to back a Commons motion tabled by backbencher Adam Afriyie calling for a vote next year. Mr Farage said: ‘I think there will be discussions at local level and let’s see what happens. I think there are some people in the parliament who are on the right lines. When we do finally get the vote on the Adam Afrieye amendment it will actually clarify things rather nicely.’ The Ukip leader made clear he would not want to work with David Cameron if Ukip won seats in Westminster in 2015, but said he would not rule it out. He said: ‘It’s pretty stupid in life to come up and say that you would never do something. I could say to you I’ll never, ever jump out of that window, but you know what, if that was on fire and the option was burning to death or jumping out of the window, I’d jump out of the window. ‘I’d have thought David Cameron would rather go to his political grave rather than ever contemplate doing a deal with the ghastly UKIP - that’s my judgment, I could be wrong.’ Mr Farage said he would rather work with London Mayor Boris Johnson or Education Secretary Michael Gove if they were Tory leader. ‘I’ve always said I think Michael . Gove’s an approachable, open-minded, interesting, intelligent politician . who understands that different people have different points of view and . that it can be actually quite acceptable to hold other points of view,’ he said. Working partnership: Mr Farage said he would be happy to work alongside Boris Johnson or Michael Gove if they were to become Conservative leader . ‘Boris is obviously a fascinating character. One thinks that his instincts are closer to ours than they are to Mr Cameron’s.’ Asked about Nick Clegg, Mr Farage said: ‘Cleggers! Well, he probably thinks that maybe Jose Manuel Barroso should become the next king of England.’ Mr Farage said he expects to be frozen out of TV leadership debates at the next election but plans to sabotage them by broadcasting his own response to the words of Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg and Ed Miliband. He said: ‘I think that if UKIP has good cause to think that it should be in the TV debates and it’s excluded we will . provide an alternative form of entertainment on the evening. You could live stream. ‘People would have their TVs and their laptops next to it. They might think they can exclude us but modern technology has such a power.’","Ukip leader attacks Cameron for failing to recognise party .

"By . Anna Pursglove . PUBLISHED: . 18:04 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:04 EST, 20 November 2013 . We don't need analysts to tell us what we already know. The evidence is there on High Streets across the country for all to see: well-dressed, middle-class women armed with those familiar brown paper bags bulging with cut-price clothing. And not a hint of shame in sight. Primark has become such a middle-class staple that it has even opened concessions in swanky Selfridges department stores. A generation ago, these women were customers Marks & Spencer could confidently call its own. This month, however, poor old Marks announced its ninth successive fall in clothing sales - a trend that has been going on for two years, despite its slick £5 million advertising campaign by renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz, featuring 'leading ladies' Dame Helen Mirren, Darcey Bussell and Tracey Emin. Primark, meanwhile - playing on low prices rather than swanky advertising - announced a record 44 per cent rise in profits in the same period. So is this where the M&S shoppers have gone? And can Primark's budget clothing really match M&S's quality? ANNA PURSGLOVE took to the shops to see exactly how their winter wardrobes measure up. PRIMARK: Embellished jumper,  £16, jeans, £7,  shoes, £12, Total: £35 . M&S: Embellished jumper, £49.50, jeans, £35,  shoes, £29.50,  Total cost: £114 . PRIMARK . Embellished jumper, £16, jeans, £7, shoes, £12, Total: £35 . Fabric: The acrylic fabric of the jumper is too fluffy for the embellishments and I kept getting them caught on the sleeves.  Unless you keep your arms pinned to your sides, you'll have snags galore in no time. Fit: The jumper is too bulky to be sexy but too rhinestoned to be practical for daily wear. And don't mention the shoes - agony. I think Primark may have forgotten that women have toes. M&S . Embellished jumper, £49.50, jeans, £35, shoes, £29.50, Total cost: £114 . Fabric: I love this sweater. The embellishments are beautifully detailed without being in your face and the fabric feels as soft as cashmere (although, in fact, it’s mostly man-made fibres with 8 per cent angora). Fit: Beautiful - the plunging v-neckline sits in just the right place for a subtly, sexy look. You could easily dress this up a bit with a pencil skirt. And the shoes are far more comfortable than Primark's. Verdict: Save money by buying your skinny jeans in Primark and get the rest from M&S. Do bear in mind that Primark sizes are significantly smaller - I was easily a 10 in Marks but a 12 in Primark. PRIMARK: Coat, £25,  jeans, £7, shoes, £12 Total: £44 . M&S: Coat, £139, jeans, £35, shoes, £25 Total: £199 . PRIMARK . Coat, £25,  jeans, £7, shoes, £12 Total: £44 . Fabric: The jeans are lovely and soft, as is the coat - despite being 100 per cent synthetic. I'm not a fan of the ultra-shiny buttons (cheap fastenings so often give budget clothing away), so I'd change these for something less obvious. Fit: The short coat has a nice Sixties vibe, although Primark hasn't quite got the funnel neck right.It catches you just under the chin, which gets annoying quickly. Again the shoes are painfully unwearable - even though I only had them on for a short time. M&S . Coat, £139, jeans, £35, shoes, £25 Total: £199 . Fabric: Excellent on all counts. The coat - a polyester and wool blend - feels warm without being too bulky. The jeans are beautifully soft, yet nice and fitted, suggesting they won't bag dreadfully around the knees or bottom. Fit: I'm only 5 ft 3 in so often get swamped by coats, with the result that I was particularly pleased with this one. And thank you to M&S for some very comfy leopard-print heels. These I could dance in. Verdict: Again, save some money by buying your skinny jeans at Primark, then spend the difference on the M&S coat. This red number was one of my favourite finds and feels far more expensive than its £139 price tag. PRIMARK: Blouse, £9, skirt, £14, shoes, £12 Total: £35 . M&S: Blouse, £49.50, skirt, £149, shoes, £29.50 Total: £228 . PRIMARK . Blouse, £9, skirt, £14, shoes, £12 Total: £35 . Fabric: The skirt is nicely lined (I do hate the feel of a scratchy sequin against your skin) and surprisingly heavy given the price. But the shirt isn't particularly breathable, so I wouldn't advise any heavy lifting or vigorous dancing while you're wearing it. It could all get a bit sweaty. Fit: Full marks for the cut of the shirt and skirt, which is an excellent budget buy. Not so many points for the metallic high heels. M&S . Blouse, £49.50, skirt, £149, shoes, £29.50 Total: £228 . Fabric: Believe it or not this skirt is 100 per cent leather, which is why it feels so lovely and breathable. The shirt fabric, although man-made, still feels airy and light. Fit: The shirt is great (if a little too piratey around the sleeves for a short-armed woman like me). But the cut of the skirt is disappointing. Neither an  A-line silhouette nor a pencil, it's an indeterminate shape for such a bold fabric. The designers should be more courageous. The shoes pinch a little - not for dancing. Verdict: I'd go with the M&S shirt (I particularly like the embellishment around the neckline), but save yourself some money and go to Primark for the rest of the look. PRIMARK: Cardigan with chain detail, £14, dress, £12, shoes, £12, Total: £38 . M&S: Boucle jacket, £59, dress, £69, shoes, £25 Total: £153 . PRIMARK . Cardigan with chain detail, £14, dress, £12, shoes, £12, Total: £38 . Fabric: The dress looks OK from a distance, but the lace layer was already beginning to tease itself out into very unattractive strings when I picked this up in the shop - not a good sign. Fit: The lining of the dress was too long for the lacey overlay. All wrong. And, yet again, it's best not to mention the shoes. I like the cardigan, however. It's cut nicely and is a good compromise if you can't afford to splash at M&S. M&S . Boucle jacket, £59, dress, £69, shoes, £25 Total: £153 . Fabric: This lace dress is lovely and soft, and boucle jackets are a particular favourite of mine.You would expect to pay well over £200 for a jacket like this from a designer label, so this really is an absolute bargain. Fit: The frock is so flattering - it really sucks you in at all the right places. The shoes with the bow detail were almost as comfortable as the leopard-print heels. Verdict: The Primark dress looks and feels cheap and is cut very badly. I'd go for the Marks one every time. As good as the Primark cardigan is, I must say that the winning item in this section is that classy M&S jacket. PRIMARK: Dress, £10, shoes, £12 Total: £22 . M&S: Dress, £99, shoes, £29.50 Total: £128.50 . PRIMARK . Dress, £10, shoes, £12 Total: £22 . Fabric: I was definitely braced for scratchy lace considering that this skater-style dress cost only £10. But again, a pleasant surprise from Primark - how on earth do they manage it? Fit: A shorter, flirtier  style, but every bit as good a fit as the M&S dress - for nearly a tenth of  the price. Just a shame once more about the excruciating shoes. So tight! When it comes to these outfits, Primark just can't match  the quality of Marks' wearable shoes. M&S . Dress, £99, shoes, £29.50 Total: £128.50 . Fabric: Not a hint of scratch to the lace here either, so well done M&S. The red shoes are reasonably comfortable but not quite as suitable for a night on the dancefloor as the leopard-print pair. Fit: The lining of this  dress was a little too  flimsy for my liking, and really wasn't as supportive as the chic black  lace number. You want to feel really sucked in by a va-va-voom style like this and I didn’t. But the full-length sleeves are very flattering, especially for older arms. Verdict: Sorry Marks, but I can’t see a reason to splash out nearly £100 on a red lace dress when you only need to spend a tenner. Primark wins this one hands down. Or should that be hem up?

A seven-year-old is recovering after suffering from a very rare form of childhood ovarian cancer. Niamh Brown was diagnosed with the cancer, which affects just a handful of youngsters in the UK, earlier this year. She underwent surgery to remove the tumour at Manchester Children’s Hospital and also lost one of her ovaries, but after gruelling chemotherapy she is now thought to be on the mend. Niamh Brown was diagnosed with a rare childhood form of ovarian cancer at the age of seven . Her mother, Julia, said: ‘She was diagnosed at the beginning of the summer holidays after she started showing signs of early puberty. These are tumours which develop from the granulosa cells, normally in the ovaries, and are malignant. In boys, they can occur in the testes but this is extremely rare. Granulosa cells' major function is the production of sex hormones, such as FSH. The most common symptom in girls is the early onset of puberty. The prognosis tends to be good, especially if the cancer is caught early. ‘The first thing I noticed were her mood swings, she turned into a teenager overnight. ‘The tumour they found was the size of an orange.

Nearly thirty years of New York City’s street art history was wiped out overnight Monday when a warehouse that was once the city’s graffiti Mecca was completely painted over. Known as 5 Pointz and referred to lovingly as the United Nations of Graffiti, the Long Island City Queens warehouse was the most impressive and beloved of the few remaining spots in the city where aerosol-wielding artists could legally do their work. The covert move came after a struggle between graffiti lovers and the building’s owner Jerry Wolkoff, whose plan to raze the landmark to build luxury condos was approved in October. But Wolkoff’s decision to paint over the painstaking work of some 1,500 artists at night and without attempting to preserve anything at all leaves 5Pointz supporters angry and puzzled. Then and now: A building that was known around the world as the graffiti Mecca of New York City was quietly painted over Monday night by the building's owner who plans to build condos . The final blow against the internationally known, unmistakable building visible right off Queens’ elevated 7 line train came earlier this month when a judge denied an effort by graffiti artists to stop the planned demolition. The building’s fate had been all but sealed since October when Wolkoff, who has owned the warehouse since 1971—and actually gave the first okay that led to the creation of 5 Pointz—had his plans to knock it down in favor of profitable condos in the burgeoning Queens enclave approved. ‘This is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffiti,’ a tearful Marie Cecile Flaguel, a spokeswoman for the group behind 5Pointz told the New York Times. ‘He’s painted over the work of at least 1,500 artists.’ Erased history: Seen easily from the city's busy 7 line train, the so-called United Nations of Graffiti had hosted the works of artists from around the world over nearly 30 years and had become a landmark of sorts in the borough of Queens . Humane: Jerry Wolkoff, who owns the Long Island City building says he painted over the graffiti covertly and instead of just tearing down the building because it was the 'humane' thing and would limit confrontations with graffiti lovers . 'I cried this morning': Wolkoff, who actually gave the first okay that allowed the building to become graffiti Mecca 5Pointz, says he loved the place but not enough to preserve it . Flaguel was one of many who fought to preserve 5 Pointz after Wolkoff’s plans were revealed. ‘It’s like David and Goliath,’ the spokeswoman said in June. ‘What the landlord doesn’t understand is that 5Pointz is a brand and an icon, and if he knocks it down it will be missed.’ Now, that grieving process has begun. Supporters of the iconic spot gathered Tuesday and made plans for a candlelight vigil. Endangered species: 5Pointz was one of the last, the largest, and most iconic place in New York where graffiti artists can legally practice their art . Jerry Wolkoff purchased the complex, made up of mostly abandoned buildings at the time, that makes up 5 Pointz in 1971. He leased space to a company that first produced record player accessories, then eight tracks, then CD cases before moving out in the early 90s, reports the New York Times. Wolkoff then filled the void by renting studio space out to artists for a few hundred dollars per month. He says a man at the time asked him if graffiti artists he knew could use the warehouse as a canvas. He agreed and the open air art space began to flourish as Wolkoff allowed them to use more of the warehouse's exterior. In 2002, the by then iconic walls of Wolkoff's building became an official art space as a graffiti artist named Meres One took over the operation as curator and named it 5Pointz. In the years since its humble inception, 5Pointz had become a international destination. It had become a graffiti museum of sorts attracted tourists from around the world eager to see the unique spectacle. Meres One brought in a rotating lineup of artists from areas as far as Spain, France, and Australia to add their vision to 5Pointz's history. A particularly striking likeness of murdered rapper Biggie Smalls, an unmissable sight from the elevated 7 train, was actually painted by a New Zealand artist. Graffiti has piled atop graffiti at 5Pointz and no one disputes the ephemeral nature of the art form. But Wolkoff's take on the perpetual battle of the old versus the new spells the true end of 5Pointz. Wolkoff's plan to put 2 million square feet of luxury condos was okayed by city planners in October and attempts to halt 5Pointz's demolition were struck down in court earlier this month. 'It’s time for me to put something else there,' Wolkoff told the Times, before launching into a pitch for Manhattan-adjacent development before its even begun. 'I can get you to 53rd and Fifth in 12 minutes!' One such supporter, who gave his name as Just, just stared at the newly white walls for hours. ‘Heartbreaking. This is not just about graffiti — it’s about the unity of people who met here from all over the world. That’s what really hurts.’ Wolkoff told the Times that painting over the graffiti on the 200,000 square foot warehouse was the ‘humane’ thing to do, but admits he also did so at night to avoid confrontation. ‘I am telling you, I did not like what they did — I loved what they did,’ said Wolkoff. ‘I cried this morning, I swear to you.’ Progress? The area will soon become home to a proposed 2 million square foot development . Destination: A roster of thousands of the world's most dedicated street artists would visit 5Pointz each year to place their work, legally, among the best in the game . Wolkoff’s approved proposal laid out plans to erect two million square feet of development in a trendy area where luxury one bedroom apartments easily stretch toward $4,000 per month. Wolkoff says his love of the artists for whom he ‘had nothing but admiration’ prompted the overnight whitewashing. ‘The last thing I want is for any of them to get arrested,’ he said. Over the years, 5 Pointz had become an international destination for street artists in addition to its home grown fans. Controlled chaos: More than a spot for graffiti, 5POintz actually had a curator and a rotating roster of visiting artists . Outgunned: Graffiti artists only just this month lost a legal fight to preserve 5Pointz as an historic landmark . Jerry Wolkoff, who has owned the building since 1971, was granted permission to move forward with his 2 million square foot development in trendy Long Island City, Queens back in October . While the battle to save the building was still being waged, British graffiti icon Banksy showed his support in a final message to New York at the tail end of his recent high profile stay in the city. ‘Save 5Pointz,’ he wrote. Unfortunately for graffiti lovers, that message went unheeded by those who wield the wrecking balls. The end of the 5Pointz era will take an agonizing three or four months as the building that once hosted a thousand artists a year is slowly demolished. Wolkoff says there will be a 60-foot wall near the proposed towers in where graffiti artists may continue to paint. Mourning: Graffiti lovers gathered Tuesday to mourn the loss of their New York City Mecca and to plan a vigil . Some people left handwritten notes atop the whitewash paint on Tuesday. Heartbreaking. This is not just about graffiti ¿ it¿s about the unity of people who met here from all over the world. That¿s what really hurts¿ said one mourner . Consolation prize: Over the next several months, 5 Pointz will be torn down and luxury condo towers will be put in its place. The owner says a 60 foot wall will be put in place on which street artists may continue to paint . End of an era: A street artist known as Guess1 works on a memorial mural on Tuesday .","5 Pointz, a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens known as the United Nations of Graffiti for its international renown is now a plain white building .

Frances Wilkins, 56, was rushed to hospital unable to move her arms and suffering a crippling headache. She underwent countless tests which failed to diagnose the mystery illness - all while her daughter Elizabeth’s nuptials approached. Miracle: Frances Wilkins (centre left) developed a rare, life-threatening disease just days before her daughter Elizabeth's wedding. She made it to the big day thanks to the help of 137 medics. (Pictured with husband David (left), her daughter Elizabeth and the wedding party . Doctors performed special out-of-hours scans and worked from home to diagnose Mrs Wilkins with Churg-Strauss syndrome - an extremely rare disease which attacks the vital organs. The mother-of-three immediately started treatment but was so weak her family thought she wouldn't make the ceremony. But nurses at Royal Bournemouth Hospital rearranged rotas so they could drive her to the venue by ambulance, and accompany her throughout the ceremony. The team at the event even did her hair, nails and make-up for the occasion. Mrs Wilkins, from West Moors, Dorset, said: ‘It was way beyond their jobs and I wouldn’t have made it to the wedding without them. ‘This hospital has been fantastic and the care I received on the Acute Medical Unit was outstanding, especially the way they got me to the wedding.’ Emotional: Mrs Tucker's daughter Elizabeth embracing nurse .

Her daughter Elizabeth, who married Richard Bolton, added: ‘I didn’t know mum was going to be there until the last minute. ‘When I’d walked down the aisle, I just ran over and gave her a big hug, it was really emotional.’ Mrs Wilkins had been plagued with a host of seemingly unrelated symptoms for two months ahead of her daughter’s big day, on August 2. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a disorder characterised by blood vessel inflammation. This inflammation can restrict blood flow to vital organs and tissues, sometimes permanently damaging them. Asthma is the most common sign of Churg-Strauss syndrome, but the disorder can cause a variety of problems, ranging from hay fever, rash and gastrointestinal bleeding to severe pain and numbness in the hands and feet. The wide range of signs and symptoms and their similarity to those of other disorders makes Churg-Strauss syndrome challenging to diagnose. The condition is rare and has no cure. But the symptoms can usually be controlled with steroids and drugs that suppress the immune system. SOURCE: Mayo Clinic . She was rushed into hospital on July 25, after suffering an acute headache and loss of movement in both arms. Doctors carried out tests but, unable to find a cause for her symptoms, ordered a special MRI scan. Consultant Tanzeem Raza heard about the upcoming wedding and rallied colleagues. He said: ‘I spoke urgently with my . radiology colleague, Dr Paula McAlinden, who went out of her way to . perform a very specific type of MRI scan which is generally not . available out of hours.’ The results of the scan were so unusual that Dr McAlinden phoned Dr Raza at home to discuss them. The pair diagnosed Churg-Strauss syndrome and immediately ordered intravenous steroids and chemotherapy. Mrs Wilkins said: ‘The team were . fantastic pushing through my scan outside of normal hours - if they . hadn’t diagnosed me when they did, I either would have had very severe . brain damage or not been here at all.’ Mrs .

Grateful: '[The staff went] way beyond their jobs and I wouldn't have made it to the wedding without them, said Mrs Wilkins. 'The care I received was outstanding' But determined ward sister Kelly Spaven reorganised the rotas so Mrs Wilkins could be escorted to the wedding at Kingston Mauward near Dorchester in Dorset, by staff nurse Beth Tucker. Sister Spaven said: ‘Frances being rushed into hospital was a horrible scenario for the whole family and if there was one thing that we could have done to improve things, getting Frances to the wedding was it. ‘I am so proud of my team as everyone went out of their way to ensure this could happen.’ Mrs Wilkins is hoping for a good recovery and continues to take medication.","Frances Wilkins was rushed to hospital just days before daughter's wedding .

The girl, named Tia, was found alone and terrified by firefighters in the back garden of her terraced home as the blaze spread through the rest of the property. Her mother, Claire James, 27, her friend, Josie Leighton, 32, and Josie's sons, Jordan Green, 12, and Tyler Green, nine, were all trapped upstairs and died in the fire. Survived: Tia, whose face has been pixellated by MailOnline, was the only survivor of the fire . Tragedy: Josie Leighton, 32, who was killed in the fire which broke out at around 5am yesterday . Fire victims: Josie Leighton, 32, (left) and her friend Claire James, 27, (right) who died in the blaze . Killed in the fire: Josie Leighton's two sons Jordan, 12, (left) and Tyler, nine (right) who also died in the house fire in North Wingfield, Derbyshire . Police and fire crews say the source . of the blaze could have been a portable heater left on downstairs during . what was one of the coldest nights of the winter so far. But they said they were unable to rule . out the possibility the fire was started deliberately. Tia, who evaded . deadly fumes and flames to escape into the garden of the house in North . Wingfield, Derbyshire, was taken to hospital with only minor injuries. She is being kept under observation at Chesterfield Royal Hospital. It is thought that Miss Leighton, a . care home worker, had recently separated from her partner. She and her . sons were staying with Miss James while they looked for somewhere else . to live. A friend of Miss Leighton, who didn't . want to be named, said last night: 'I can't get their (Jordan and . Tyler's) poor little faces out my head, I'd only seen and spoke to them . yesterday. They were lovely lads, always smiling, and everybody knew . that they were close brothers.' She added that both women, who were . single mothers, had known each other for a number of years and shared . childcare.

Blaze: Firefighters work at the scene in North Wingfield as officers try and establish the cause of the blaze . Probe: A fire investigation dog unit is on the scene as the emergency services try and establish the cause of the blaze in Chesterfield . 'Josie stopped over at Claire's last . night, and to think that they went to bed and didn't wake up is just . horrifying,' she added. Miss James's cousin, Zoe Maude, said: . 'Claire was an amazing mum to Tia, they were inseparable and she really . doted on her. Tia was a real mummy's girl. 'Poor Tia is going to grow up without a mum and that this has happened just a few weeks before Christmas is just heartbreaking.' The exterior of the house showed . little evidence of damage, but fire chief Kam Basri described how his . officers had battled thick smoke inside the property in a bid to rescue . the victims. He said: 'It was thoroughly . smoke-logged and four rescues were carried out. Unfortunately those . rescues did not prevail and all four perished through the fire. 'It is far too early to say what the cause of the fire was.' Pete Ripley, divisional director for . East Midlands Ambulance Service, said they had been called to the fire . at 5.10am. Scene: The terraced property in North Wingfield, near Chesterfield, where the fire broke out . Police investigation: The emergency services were called to the home in North Wingfield, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, at around 5am . He added: 'This was a particularly tragic incident and we are . providing our staff with all the support necessary to help them deal . with the distressing situation they encountered.' Neighbour Paul Allen, 33, said: 'This will devastate North Wingfield. It is only a small place and people will be very upset.' Tammy Nash, 30, the mother of a girl . who was friends with Jordan, said: 'He was a lovely lad who would do . anything for you. My daughter is in absolute bits.' Four deaths: Two adults and two children died in the fire in North Wingfield. A girl called Tia, seven, survived the fire after escaping into the garden . The blaze is the fourth in Derbyshire in just three and a half years in which children have died. In April 2010, five-year-old Niamh .

The immense ash clouds that erupted from Iceland’s Eyjafjallajoekull volcano in 2010 caused chaos for the airline industry. No one really knew if it would be safe to fly, and technology to accurately detect the plumes of ash had yet to be developed. Since then, easyJet has been working on a system known as AVOID (Airborne Volcanic Object Identifier and Detector) that it claims will prevent ash clouds disrupting flights. Scroll down for videos... Easyjet has been working on a system known as AVOID (Airborne Volcanic Object Identifier and Detector) that it claims will prevent ash clouds disrupting flights in the future . The group today flew a commercial aircraft through the first-ever artificial ash cloud to see if  the sensor could detect the plumes. In the test, an A400M Airbus plane dispersed one tonne of Icelandic ash into the atmosphere at between 9,000ft and 11,000ft. This created conditions consistent with the 2010 eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull. A second Airbus test aircraft, an A340-300, with the AVOID technology fitted, flew towards the ash cloud identifying and measuring it from around 40 miles away. An A400M Airbus plane released a cloud of ash as part of test to see how passenger aircraft can cope with volcanic eruptions . From inside the A400M test aircraft, Icelandic ash was extracted then dispersed into the atmosphere as part of the AVOID system testing . The AVOID system uses infra-red technology that allows pilots to see the damaging ash plumes up to 62 miles ahead between 5,000 and 50,000 ft. The system shows images of ash to aircrew, allowing them to change flight path. The images are also sent back to ground control where data from different aircraft can help create a detailed ash cloud map. The experiment also used a small aircraft, a Diamond DA42 from Dusseldorf University of Applied Sciences in Germany, to fly into the ash cloud to take measurements which help to corroborate the measurements made by the AVOID system. The ash cloud produced during the test was between 600ft and 800ft deep measuring about 1.75 miles in diameter. To begin with the ash cloud was visible to the naked eye but dissipated quickly, becoming difficult to identify. The AVOID system uses infra-red technology that allows pilots to see the damaging ash plumes up to 62 miles ahead at between 5,000 and 50,000 ft. AVOID detected the ash cloud and measured its density which showed that it was within the range of concentrations measured during the ash crisis in April and May 2010. Dr Fred Prata who invented AVOID volcanic technology is shown with the original detector at the Airbus factory in Toulouse, France . During the testing, the AVOID volcanic sensor detected the artificial ash cloud and measured its density . ‘The threat from Icelandic volcanoes continues and so we are delighted with the outcome of this unique and innovative experiment,’ said EasyJet’s engineering director Ian Davies. ‘Finding a solution is as crucial now as ever to ensure we never again see the scenes of spring 2010 when all flying ceased across Europe for several days.’ EasyJet said it is now working towards a non-integrated stand-alone system which its aim to fit on to a number of its current fleet of aircraft by the end of next year. Dr Fred Prata, inventor of the AVOID technology, said: ‘The team has just executed a unique scientific and engineering experiment conclusively demonstrating that low concentrations of ash can be identified by the AVOID sensor. ‘ . Ash clouds that erupted from Iceland's Eyjafjallajoekull volcano in 2010 caused chaos for airliners . A second Airbus test aircraft, an A340-300, with the AVOID technology fitted, flew towards the ash cloud identifying and measuring it from around 40 miles away . Airbus engineering head Charles Champion added: ‘We are at the beginning of an invention which could become a useful solution for commercial aviation to prevent large-scale disruption from volcanic ash.’ Explosive volcanic eruptions in Iceland happen on average once every five years. When winds blow from the north west, the ash is transported towards Europe as it did during the Eyjafjallajokull eruption in 2010. ‘It was a coincidence that this did not happen in the seven explosive eruptions that took place between 1970 and 2010. Instead the ash was mostly carried away from Europe by southerly winds,’ said Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, from the Institute of Earth Sciences in Iceland. ‘Considering the relatively long time since the last eruptions in two of Iceland’s most active volcanoes, Hekla and Katla, both should be regarded as ready to erupt. ‘It is not possible to predict when or where the next eruption will take place. What is certain is that it will happen.’ Explosive volcanic eruptions in Iceland happen on average once every five years. Pictured is an ash cloud from the volcano Eyjafjallajokull .

Whether it was jealousy or nervousness, this bird of prey's antics almost ruined the big day for a bride and groom. Lilo the Barn owl was supposed to be flying the rings down the aisle for Ceire and Andrew Bode but he decided to head for the rafters and refused to come down. Mr Bode, 32, tried to coax Lilo down with a piece of chicken but he remained on his perch and it was only when his handler produced a dead chick that they managed to get him down. Wedding chaos: Lilo the Barn Owl (pictured) was supposed to fly Cerie and Andrew Bode's rings to the altar - but instead flew into the roof . The couple, who got married in Hoghton, Lancashire, said Lilo’s performance helped calm their nerves and made sure the day was even more memorable. Flown off: Lilo the Barn owl sits on a rafter holding onto the rings and refuses to come down - despite efforts to tempt it with chicken . Ceire, 33, said: 'It was absolutely hilarious. We wanted our wedding to be something different and this made sure it was. 'If we’d just had the owl delivering the rings then our guests would have talked about it for maybe five minutes. 'Because of what happened, people are still talking about it now. It really broke the ice and stopped everyone feeling nervous.' Andrew, who hired Lilo for £150 from a bird sanctuary, said: 'Ceire is a big Harry Potter fan and she wanted to incorporate this into the wedding day. 'We’ve also been to hundreds of weddings in the past through work so we wanted one with a difference. 'The owl was at the back of the church with one of the people from the sanctuary. 'None of the guests knew we had an owl as ringbearer so it was a surprise for them when, after we’d said our vows, I picked up a glove and a piece of chicken. 'I’d been told to make a clicking sound with my mouth to call the owl over, but it wasn’t coming. 'Eventually it started flying up the aisle, but then it veered off and almost flew in Ceire’s face. Then it just flew up into the beams and stayed up there for about five minutes - only it felt a lot longer. 'But we didn’t know how to get the bird down and the guy from the sanctuary pulled out a dead chick to coax it down. Wedding chaos: The couple, who hired the owl as ringbearer, were relieved when the owl was eventually be tempted down from the rafter . 'It was a bit of a surreal moment really, I didn’t expect to be holding a piece of chicken and trying to lure an owl down from the roof with a dead chick on my wedding day. 'The guests were all really laughing. And it did stop me from feeling so nervous.' Ceire added: 'I didn’t mind at all. It was still the best day of my life. Everything else went to plan, this was just a little hiccup in my perfect day.' The couple, who have been together for seven years, have taken a long weekend to the Lake District for their honeymoon. In September this year another owl held up a wedding after it flew to the roof of a church and fell asleep on a ledge. On that occasion the owl could not be coaxed down and so Sonia Cadman, 46, and Andrew Mettle, 49, had to get married using a back up set of rings. It remained perched high inside the 900 year-old Holy Cross Church in Sherston, Wiltshire, for an hour after falling asleep.

Plea: Mrs Bertani, centre left, posted the status, right, without the knowledge if her husband, Stefano, left, in the hope of getting him a job . Headlined: 'May I make an urgent plea' Mrs Bertani, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, said her husband was happy to take 'any' job to avoid having to claim £71 in jobseekers' allowance from the taxpayer every week. She wrote: 'This big share has taken all my courage, my pride, my honesty and my red raw panic - so please be gentle. 'Stefano, my extremely hard working, enterprising, considerate, kind husband has been sadly made redundant. 'We have a few days left to find him work before we regrettably have to join the benefit system. We do not want this.

A drunk sailor who kicked a shipmate three times in the head after his victim complained about his 'awful' jokes has been spared jail. Don Earl, 48, kicked Kenneth Cook, also 48, once square in the face and twice more in the head, while the two were working as civilian merchant sailors on a vessel in the fleet which supports the Royal Navy. Mr Cook lost a tooth, suffered a deep cut to his nose and was left with a black eye, while Earl was so drunk he was left with no memory of the attack. Earl was given a 10-month suspended sentence at 200 hours of unpaid work at Southwark Crown Court today, and wept in the dock as the judgement was handed down for his 'stupid, stupid' actions. The attack took place in July last year, at a time when the two men were working aboard Fort Rosalie, a ship in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, which was stationed in Bermuda. Both men were working as stores assistants in the supply and transport office of the naval department on board the vessel, which was described by the prosecution as a 'pressure cooker' environment. The court heard that tensions had been brewing between the two for 'a considerable period of time' on board the vessel, and that many other shipmates in fact found Earl 'annoying'. Prosecutor Peter Zinner told the court: 'Mr Cook and Mr Earl were both employed by the Ministry of Defence as civilian seamen on Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship, Fort Rosalie. 'Both men were working as stores assistants in the supply and transport office of the naval department on board the vessel. ‘There was a personality clash due to being in a confined space and they took a dislike to each other.' ‘It seems the victim was sitting on a jetty on a raised curb when he was approached on his blind side by Mr Earl. ‘He then kicked him full force in the face, before that was followed by a second and third kick in the head.’ The Court was told that Mr Cook's injuries would have been much worse had Earl not been wearing soft canvas shoes at the time. Earl has since been sacked and was arrested on his return to Britain. He pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding. He told police he had been provoked by Mr Cook for a ‘considerable period of time’ but couldn’t remember the attack due to being intoxicated. 'Pressure cooker': The assault took place while the two were working on the RFA Fort Rosalie, pictured, while it was in Bermuda last year . In a statement, Mr Cook said: ‘When Don Earl first joined Fort Rosalie, we got on OK but as time progress he started to annoy me because he was so loud and he used to tell awful jokes. ‘He just got on everyone’s nerves, including mine. ‘As time went on, I didn’t like him and he didn’t like me.’ Earl has found himself in severe financial difficulties as a result of the brawl, which also contributed to the breakdown of his marriage. Sentencing Earl to 10 months in prison, suspended for a year, and 200 hours unpaid work, Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘I want to make it absolutely plain that nothing I say to you should be taken to be a criticism of Mr Cook in the sense that he was asking for it or deserved what happened to him. ‘You used a weapon - your foot with a shoe on it - and that’s the equivalent of a weapon. ‘The fact that you had been taking drink when you did this explains it but does not excuse it, on the contrary it makes it worse. ‘But there is another side to this and there are many indications suggesting that you are a man of positive good character. ‘I accept that there was a background between you and Mr Cook. ‘I recognise that it was a stupid, stupid moment of loss of control on your part. ‘You attacked him and you must take responsibility for it, but the loss of your job has punished you to some extent already.’ Robert Newbould, defending Earl, told how he had an ‘antagonistic’ relationship with Mr Cook, adding that his actions were ‘very much out of character’. ‘The two men were on the same vessel, it’s the same working and living quarters and from Mr Earl’s point of view, there was no means of escape from what he felt was on-going torment. ‘His pride was dented by numerous comments being bandied about. ‘He makes no secret of the fact he can’t remember the incident but he accepts the witness’ account and he is absolutely dismayed by his behaviour. ‘There is no getting away from the fact this has had a significant impact on his personal circumstances.'","Don Earl, 48, attacked Kenneth Cook, knocking out a tooth .

Emergency workers climbed over the rubble with stretchers to find survivors of the collapse . Police are struggling to make their way through the wreckage of Tongaat mall with sniffer dogs . 'In all my years as a paramedic I have never seen anything like this,' said one rescue worker, running to the site carrying oxygen canisters. Others used hydraulic jacks to lift the slabs and grinders to cut through the metal. 'You can’t see anything, and you can’t hear anything. The generator is making so much noise,' another rescue worker said. Large crowds of onlookers and anxious friends and relatives gathered in the darkness behind a security cordon. The injured, including two of them in critical condition, were rushed to nearby hospitals, which initiated full-scale disaster plans, health officials said. Emergency workers are seen during their search for survivors after a building collapsed in Tongaat, north of Durban . Rescue teams are using cranes, sniffer dogs and torches to look through the football pitch-sized complex . At least one person was killed and dozens were feared trapped under rubble last night . The deputy mayor of the municipality . that includes Tongaat said construction should not have been taking . place because contractors were not doing a proper job, the South African . Press Association reported. 'We took them to court a month ago,' Nomvuzo Shabalala said. 'We thought they had stopped.' There were initial reports that up to 50 people were trapped in the debris. Police were checking names, and said some workers reported as missing may have left the scene before notifying authorities. Deputy Mayor Nomvuzo Shabalala said local authorities had tried to halt construction at the site, alongside a railway, a month ago. 'We took them to court a month ago,' he said. 'We thought they had stopped.' 'There are areas of the law that they did not follow in terms of building of this infrastructure,' He told broadcaster ENCA. 'We were not aware that they were continuing building.' The identity of the builder was not immediately known. Collapse: The shopping mall in Tongaat, north of Durban, was still under construction when it collapsed . Rescue: Around 100 emergency service workers are said to be on the site recovering victims . Survivors: Two of the survivors stand at the scene where a mall collapsed, as other workers are still missing . Authorities appealed to residents in the area to stay away from the scene so that rescue teams could work more quickly. Fiona Moonean, a resident whose house . is located across a railway line from the collapsed part of the mall, . said she was washing dishes at the time of the incident, SAPA reported. A few days earlier, Moonean said, workers had started to remove the scaffolding. 'Just after 4.30 pm, it was a thunderous sound. Before the bang, I heard too much scaffolding fall,' Ms Moonean told SAPA. 'The whole concrete slab crashed down with the pillars. 'The smoke and dust was too thick. I heard them screaming out for help in Zulu.' She called emergency services and a woman took down her details, according to SAPA. Tongaat: The city, near to the hometown of President Jacob Zuma, has had a construction boom in recent years . Trapped: About 50 workers are feared trapped under the roof, with at least 17 others injured . Large: The mall is expected to be at least 15,000 square metres and will house 40 retail stores . Rescue workers carry an injured person from the collapse. It is still not known what caused the incident . 'She . had to calm me down because I was so freaked out,' Ms Moonean added. 'For me, the most traumatic is the sound of the guys’ voices. That is . the part that plays in my head.' Television footage showed police and . rescue workers walking over large piles of rubble and twisted metal . lying next to a railway track. Chris Botha, a spokesman for the Netcare 911 emergency service, said the second floor of the structure had given way. 'The scene is extremely horrific... concrete big blocks have fallen on to people,' he told broadcaster ENCA from the scene. 'The guys are busy using hydraulic rescue equipment to break through the concrete and get to some of the patients.' If safety regulations are found to have . been breached, the accident could sour already fraught labour relations . in South Africa’s construction sector and might have ramifications for . the ruling African National Congress as it moves towards an election . next year. Reports coming in suggest there could be at least 29 seriously injured and potentially two dead . Durban: The mall is in Tongaat, just up the coast from Durban on the east coast of South Africa . Television footage showed police and rescue workers walking over large piles of rubble and twisted metal lying next to a railway track. Large parts of the building had completely given way. Ambulances ferried the injured to nearby hospitals, which initiated full-scale disaster plans.'There are no really severe injuries,' said Jenny Meer, manager of the Mediclinic Victoria hospital in Tongaat that had admitted eight patients. 'It’s mainly broken bones, soft tissue injuries and a bit of shock. But obviously there are a lot of patients that are still trapped on site,' she said. Emergency services spokesman Botha said others were more seriously injured. Durban and the surrounding province of KwaZulu-Natal is the home of President Jacob Zuma.

Bailey and her brother Nigel Shaw were given power of attorney over Mrs Shaw's estate. The pair agreed Bailey would take care of the day-to-day finances when her mother was put into Keldgate Manor residential home in Hull, Yorks. The care home, who were looking after the dementia sufferer, telephoned Mr Shaw to warn him that a payment had not been received and he became suspicious. Mr Shaw found out money in his mother’s account, most of which had come from the sale of her house, had been spent by his sister. A fraud investigation was launched in 2009 and despite Mrs’s Shaw's death in 2010, it was completed earlier this year and found Bailey had spent her mother’s money over three years. Detective Constable Krista Wood, who investigated the case, said: 'Jennifer’s last transaction was January 11, 2010, the day her mother passed away, and she withdrew £22,000, leaving nothing in her mother’s bank account to even cover her funeral.' 'Production orders for several of Mrs Shaw’s bank accounts and conveyancing files from the sale of her house took months to come through. 'Eventually, when all the files were ready, I went through all of the accounts with a fine-toothed comb and followed the money through various accounts in bits and bobs to see where it had gone. Thief: Jennifer Bailey will be sentenced at Hull Crown Court next week . 'It transpired that the money had been spent over a period of several years by Jennifer, who was using it to fund her own lifestyle, shopping, days out, spending money for foreign holidays, and so on. This continued until the money was gone. When Bailey was interviewed by the police, she refused to co-operate and the case eventually went to court. DC Wood said: 'Mr Shaw is overjoyed at this outcome, as all he ever wanted was to get to the truth. 'He is also out of pocket, having been defrauded out of his potential inheritance from his mother’s estate, but this was not the primary driver in him making this report to the police. 'He had trusted Jennifer to take care of paying the nursing home for the care of their mother and she let his mother down.' Bailey admitted the offences at Hull Crown Court and will be sentenced on Friday, November 29.","Jennifer Bailey, 59, abused her position as a carer for Mabel Shaw .

It beat 'twerking' to be crowned word of the year by editors of the Oxford English Dictionary and it seems that the power of the selfie shows no sign of abating thanks to image conscious Brits. A new study has revealed that Britons are now so obsessed with taking the perfect 'selfie' that more than one in ten take over ten minutes to prepare themselves for the shot, taking as many as seven before they post the final snap. Somewhat defeating the object of a selfie, a staggering 81 per cent admitted they'd prefer a friend to take it for them before posting it online as their own perfect shot. How many times did you take that, Rosie? Miss Huntington-Whiteley looks picture perfect in her selfie, but did she, like one in six Brits, take seven attempts before settling on this one? Almost two in ten Brits (17 per cent) would even encourage their selfie wingman to upload it onto social networking sites for them – believing it makes them seem less vain. Hoping to strike the perfect pose, the study, which asked 1,500 people to reveal their selfie habits, found that over two thirds (69 per cent) touch-up their make-up and re-style their hair before a selfie, with one in ten (12 per cent) of those being men. Looking good: Two thirds of Brits touch-up their . make-up and re-style their hair before a selfie; does flawless Miranda Kerr do the same? One in five (19 per cent) admitted to changing outfits ‘pre selfie’ to ensure they attain the ultimate selfie ‘look’. The report showed that Brits take selfies to make friends envious, with almost a quarter (24 per cent) posting selfies to social networks to show off, and one in five (21 per cent) being most likely to snap a selfie whilst away on holiday. Sun-drenched selfie: Like Justin Bieber, one in five Brits take a selfie whilst on holiday and one in ten men touch up their hair before snapping themselves .

In a scene that wouldn't look out of place in a science fiction blockbuster, researchers have unveiled the world's first walking, talking bionic man complete with circulatory system and a beating heart. Called Frank, short for Frankenstein, the six-foot robot is made up of artificial body parts donated by various research centres from around the world, has 200 processors and is covered in over a million sensors. It was designed by Dr Bertolt Meyer from the University of Zurich, built by a team of engineers at Shadow Robot in London and is currently on display at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington as part of The Incredible Bionic Man exhibition. Scroll down for video . Researchers from Zurich have unveiled the world's first walking, talking bionic man called Frank, short for Frankenstein, pictured. The six-foot robot has a fully functioning circulatory system with a beating heart and lungs made from 28 artificial body parts and synthetic organs . Frank, pictured left, was designed by Dr Bertolt Meyer from the University of Zurich, right. Dr Meyer is a social psychologist and has a bionic hand. Frank was built by a team of engineers in London and is on display at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington in an exhibition called 'The Incredible Bionic Man' Frank, short for Frankenstein and named after Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, is fitted with 200 processors. It has 70 circuit boards and 26 individual motors. The 'skin' of the robot features more than one million sensors while a functional circulatory system, including a heart, powers it from the inside. Frank's face is made of silicone and is a replica of Dr Meyer’s. 'The goal is not to replace the . human being,' Dr. Meyer told a press conference on Thursday. 'The ultimate goal . is to provide technology to fix a broken person.' Dr. Meyer is a social psychologist and was the model for Frank because he has a bionic hand himself. A total of 200 processors fitted to Frank are powered through 70 circuit boards and 26 individual motors. The skin of the robot features over one million sensors that can detect touch and changes in temperature. The London engineers . built Frank using 28 of 'the most advanced artificial body parts . available today from laboratories and research centres around the world' as well as implantable synthetic organs. Frank's face was then made of silicone and is a replica of Dr Meyer’s. Engineers designed the Bionic Man to enable several of its 'human' parts to operate without a body. For example, although the robot is fitted with limbs, it doesn’t have a brain to make them work, instead it is controlled remotely through a computer connected by Bluetooth. Frank is capable of walking and can talk and answer questions with the help of this human controller, via a laptop. Frank's name is taken from a Mary Shelley novel in which character Victor Frankenstein creates a living 'monster' from human parts. This image of Boris Karloff is taken from the 1931 Frankenstein film . Dr Meyer is set to explain more about how Frank was built and what it is capable of during a one-hour documentary to be aired on the Smithsonian Channel on Sunday 20 October at 9pm PDT. The documentary is only available to viewers in the U.S. Meyer's did tell reporters: 'A female bionic companion would be great. 'Unfortunately, I'm missing a few other important parts.' Frank's name is taken from Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. In the book, published originally in 1818, Victor Frankenstein creates a living 'monster' from human body parts. Frank is also reminiscent of the Terminator robot played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1984 film of the same name and the Six Million Dollar Man, played by Lee Majors in the 1970s, who was a fictional astronaut with bionic limbs called Steve Austin. The heart and other organs in the circulatory system were built by Alex Seifalian, a professor of Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine at University College London, using a specially-designed polymer that builds implantable organs of any shape. Other artificial body parts featured in the Bionic Man include a heart from SynCardia Systems in Tucson, Arizona, ankles and feet from BiOM in Bedford, Massachusetts; a lung from Haemair Ltd. in England; ears from Cochlear in Australia; a pancreas from De Montfort University in the UK; and a prototype kidney from the University of California, San Francisco.

Former presidential candidate John Edwards pictured out on a date with his new partner in Chapel Hill, NC . John Edwards has returned to his old profession as a personal injury lawyer after two failed bids for the Oval Office and a political career ruined by a sex scandal and fraud trial. The disgraced former Senator from North Carolina is to rejoin his former law partner David Kirby to set up shop in his home state's capital Raleigh. His eldest daughter Cate will also be joining the business, which will practice under the name Edwards Kirby. And despite the ignominious end to his political career, Mr Edwards will not quite break links with the nation's capital: Edwards Kirby will have a satellite office in Washington DC. Mr Edwards has kept a low profile since he was acquitted of campaign finance charges last year, but he was last week caught on camera with the new woman in his life after ending his relationship with the mistress at the centre of that trial. He has reportedly been dating a single mother nearly half his age for about a year and the woman has gotten close with his family. The National Enquirer reported that Danielle King was spotted going on a date to a local Italian restaurant with Mr Edwards after first meeting with him at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The couple arrived separately at the restaurant and kept a distance from each other when they left. However while inside, their closeness was evident to other diners. 'They were very smiley and absolutely engrossed in conversation. They gazed into each other's eyes as if they were the only two people on the planet,' an unidentified source told the tabloid magazine of their meal at Panzanella. The 35-year-old has reportedly become a fixture at the home Mr Edwards shares with his young children. The 60-year-old is now solely responsible for raising his teenage children Emma Claire, 15, and Jack, 13, following his wife Elizabeth's death to cancer in 2010. Ms King, who has a son of her own, has reportedly become a maternal figure in the Edwards home, with the Inquirer reporting that she has watched the children when 'Johnny' has had to go out of town.

The pair were spotted on October 18 going to an Italian restaurant near his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina . Finding love with a home town girl has come at the right moment for Mr Edwards, who was also fortunate in that his former law partner found himself in need of a new team. Mr Kirby was senior partner for the Kirby & Holt law firm in Raleigh, his colleague Mark Holt struck out with attorney Dave Sherlin to open their own law firm last week, WRAL.com reported. So now Edwards Kirby rides again, and Cate Edwards and her law partner Sharon Eubanks will also join the new firm. Speaking her father's new venture, Ms Edwards told WRAL.com: 'His life's mission, I think, has been to help people. Edwards Kirby is founded for that purpose – to give people a voice, to give the disenfranchised a voice.' Mr Edwards added in a statement: 'It is a privilege to practice again, and we want to take on cases that, through litigation, change social inequalities in favor of the greater good. 'In building Edwards Kirby, we sought a team that has championed the causes of economic and social equality in court and in hundreds of communities across the country.'

Mr Edwards's return to the legal profession comes just a year after he was sat on the wrong side of the dock during his trial over accusations he defrauded his own campaign's finances to hide his affair. Prosecutors accused the former presidential-candidate of funnelling cash pledged to the 2008 race to an aide to keep mistress Rielle Hunter out of the public eye. But after a month-and-a-half of having his private life exposed in court, a federal jury eventually found Mr Edwards not guilty on one count and couldn't reach a decision on six others. But the damage was nonetheless severe. The court heard as lawyers recounted the most intimate details of Mr Edwards’s affair with former campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, with whom the then-married presidential candidate fathered a daughter, wife his wife Elizabeth was batting cancer. Since the highly publicised trial, Mr Edwards has shunned public attention and lived quietly at his North Carolina home, a sprawling gated estate outside Chapel Hill. Mr Edwards and Mr Kirby have known each other since law school; along Mr Edwards's late wife they both attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Seventies.

Mary Portas said charity shops need a makeover to become 'less smelly' if they are to help revive high streets . Charity shops need a makeover to become ‘less smelly’ if they are to help revive high streets, retail guru Mary Portas claimed yesterday. Second hand stores that increasingly dominate struggling town centres should transform themselves into ‘beautiful, respectful’ places rather than being the ‘sad face’ in a parade of shops, she said. Ms Portas, who led a government backed review of high streets, spoke out amid fears that the explosion of charity shops since the credit crunch is turning Britain into a nation of ‘charity clone towns.’ There are now 10,000 charity shops - which enjoy generous tax breaks - prompting claims that they are fuelling the decline of high streets by forcing traditional retailers out. But a report by think tank Demos this week claimed the stores actually boost local businesses by keeping shoppers on the high street and drastically reducing the number of empty stores. Ms Portas, who runs 11 stores for Save the Children, agreed that charity shops had a ‘vital role’ to play saving the high street. ‘Some, however, are a bit smelly and need sorting out and can pull a high street down,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I think you could make them a little bit more lovely to be in. ‘That doesn’t mean that prices have to go up ‘If you create a charity shop that is a beautiful, respectful place people will give you great stuff and actually respect it in a better way, which in turn makes more money for charity. ‘My charity shops are the highest earners within Save the Children because we have done that.‘We have actually put at the centre of it ‘respect and something lovely.’ ‘It doesn’t have to feel like it’s a sad, sad face on the high street.’ The number of high street charity shops has risen 30 per cent since the start of the credit crunch in 2008, recent research by the Local Data Company found. Charity shops pay a fraction of the £7 billion annual business rates of traditional retailers, giving them a considerable financial advantage over other stores. Ms Portas, who led a government backed review of high streets, spoke out amid fears that the explosion of charity shops is turning Britain into a nation of charity clone towns . They are also attractive to landlords, who avoid paying the business rate, while the charity can claim relief on it. Ms Portas urged councils to offer all new businesses the same rate relief given to charity shops to encourage diversity on the high street. She said anything that encouraged more people onto the high street - whether that was libraries or yoga studios - was welcome. The Demos study found that charity shops help combat unemployment, with over 80 per cent of volunteers in the stores saying they were using their shifts as an opportunity to gain retail experience as a path to paid employment. Orpington in Kent which had the highest number of charity shops on its High Street in Britain . Jonathan Birdwell, from Demos, said the decline in high streets was due to out of town retailers and internet shopping. He said: ‘Charity shops are helping to maintain some vitality to high streets ‘They are not causing the decline of high streets, they are helping to maintain them.’ Warren Alexander, of the Charity Retail Association, said: ‘Charity shops not only raise vital money for their parent charities but they bring huge value to their local communities and this report gives some clear insight into those benefits. ‘Charity shops offer a space for individuals to learn new skills and experience through volunteering and work.’ The Portas Review, published two years ago, selected 12 towns to receive £1.2million of taxpayers’ cash for high street renewal schemes.","Ms Portas led a government backed review of high streets .

Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has warned that, for many people, their standards of living are falling . The Archbishop of York has warned of the growth of a 'new poor' who have jobs and work hard but still live in poverty. Dr John Sentamu, second in the hierarchy of the Church of England, told its General Synod that many people who previously enjoyed comfortable lifestyles were seeing their standard of living fall significantly. Such people - who he called 'the new poor' - feel they are going 'down the social scale' through no fault of their own, he said. 'Unlike the chief executives, many hard-pressed people find that they are on a 'down escalator',' he said. 'That phrase captures more than just a shortage of money - it adds a sense of descending the social scale.' Dr Sentamu added that many such people no longer believed that they could provide a better life for their children than they had enjoyed themselves. 'Formerly, each new generation enjoyed a higher standard of living than the previous one,' he said. 'That was the progress that everybody was taught to expect. It was a source of hope. 'But now the gains are being reversed. Many people believe their children will be worse off financially than they are.' He added that while 'once upon a time, you could not really be living in poverty if you had regular wages', this was 'no longer so'. Now, he said, 'you can be in work and still live in poverty', adding: 'Politicians often refer to hard-working families. They should speak instead of hard-pressed families.' Speaking in his presidential address to the Gerneal Synod - the parliament of the Church of England - Dr Sentamu said the annual salaries of chief executives of Britain's 100 largest companies 'reached an average of £4.3 million last year, or 160 times average wages'. Meanwhile, he said, 27,000 people in Leeds were diagnosed as suffering from malnutrition last year - 'not in Lesotho, not Liberia, not Lusaka, but Leeds.' The NHS defines malnutrition as poor nutrition, and it can include people who eat too much or eat the wrong things as well as those who eat too little. Concern: Justin Welby (right), the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Dr John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York . Poverty warning: Dr John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, addresses the General Synod . Dr Sentamu said such figures left a 'dark stain on our consciences' - but he added it was a 'hard economic fact' that wage rises were likely to lag behind price rises in future, as a result of global competition for jobs and technological advances. 'This is the new reality. Food banks are not going to go away any time soon,' the Archbishop said. 'Prices are rising more than three times faster than wages. 'This has been going on for 10 years now. And for people slipping into poverty, the reality is much harsher.' Official poverty figures, which draw a poverty line at 60 per cent of average household income, have been showing that rising numbers of people with jobs have been falling into poverty since 2004 - three years before the onset of recession. Last week a study for the York-based Joseph Rowntree Foundation by the left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research said that traditional families with stay-at-home mothers and fathers who work are now more likely than to be poor than any other kind of family. There were more families with stay-at-home mothers in poverty than two-parent families where the household lives on benefits, or benefit dependent single-parent families, it found. The study said nearly one in three - 30 per cent - of the families with children who live below the official poverty line are families where only one parent works. The Archbishop said the need to combat poverty could provide the CofE with a moment similar to the foundation of Methodism 250 years ago, when John Wesley concentrated heavily on the poor and working people. 'The Church of England, I believe, has arrived at another such moment', Dr Sentamu said. 'Confronting poverty is again rising to the top of the agenda.'","Dr John Sentamu said standards of living are falling significantly .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 2 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 2 November 2013 . Cheerleading? Pah! It's a pastime for softies and schoolgirls, a kitsch parade of pom poms, tinsel and all-American grins. It's not a real workout. At least, that's what I thought until I was invited to train with The ROAR, the dauntingly named cheerleading squad of the Jacksonville Jaguars American football team. Within moments of arriving for a training session at the Pineapple Dance Studios in Covent Garden, London, and being handed my  pom poms - 'shake them to fluff them' - I realise that I am hopelessly out of my depth. Matt Warren training with The Roar cheerleading squad at Pineapple Dance Studios, London . These women are athletes at the very top of their game. They have six-packs. They can do the splits and smile at the same time. They can high-kick for three hours straight without their make-up running. And I am just a man who does a bit of jogging in his spare time. They obviously sense my weakness, since they suggest we 'begin gently' with a set of 'simple' bends and twists. But we are soon bouncing in and out of the splits. Or rather, they are. I think I've spread my legs but, glancing in the mirror, I seem to still be standing upright. 'You're doing great,' says 22-year-old Kayla, an effervescent five-year veteran of the team.'Urrrphh,' I whinge, unconvinced by her pity. The cheerleaders were over here from Florida to support the Jaguars, who played an NFL match at Wembley Stadium last weekend. But The ROAR's acrobatic performances are underpinned by constant training - and that definitely does not mean just learning to wave a pom pom and look pretty. In fact, it's a very particular kind of exercise, and I was warned at the outset that cheerleading and running - the latter being my means of keeping fit - don't really mix. Running tends to tighten muscles, while cheerleading demands the opposite: strength with flexibility. These women are athletes at the very top of their game. They can do the splits and smile at the same time . Even the warm-up is gruelling, but you need to be supple if you're going to attempt those signature high-kicking routines. Indeed, cheerleading is a perilous sport. There is even a Wikipedia entry on 'Dangers of cheerleading', which reveals that their moves account for 67 per cent of all athletic injuries among female American college students. 'I pulled a muscle in my leg during my audition for The ROAR,' says 20-year-old Caitlin. 'But I just pressed on. It hurt so much, but there was no way I was giving up.' A sport for softies? I am rapidly changing my mind. With the warm-up over, we move on to a dance: the team's signature routine is choreographed to Welcome To The Jungle by Guns N' Roses. I fluff up my pom poms as the instruction begins. 'The dance is eight lots of eight counts,' says Kayla, 'which is around 60 moves. We'll just teach you half of it, though.' Sounds easy enough, doesn't it?  We form a line, with me in the middle, while Kayla talks me through the steps - 'Shaking, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, then split on eight. Shampoo .  .  .' Shampoo? 'Oh, that's just what we call any move that goes over our hair,' Kayla explains. 'Right, on we go. It's shampoo, one, spin to the back, up, out, together, look, look, spin, back .  .  .' I'm already completely lost, but there's no reprieve. Cheerleading requires not just strength but a bafflingly extensive memory for routine. The ROAR may be able to learn three such dances in a single three-hour training session, but it's not a skill I possess. Even in slow-motion, I am a staccato shambles with my pom poms. I look like a jellyfish dad at a disco. By the time they add music and quicken the tempo, I am at least five moves behind on every run-through. And gasping for breath. Cheerleading requires not just strength but a bafflingly extensive memory for routine . Not that it matters - this is one of the few forms of fitness that are actually enjoyable. Cheerleading is a discipline you must perform with a smile - it's part of the job description - and it really does help.Grinning makes gruelling warm-ups and intense cardio sessions feel like fun. It's worth trying next time you visit the gym. 'Smiling is contagious,' says Caitlin. 'Smile and the crowd will smile with you.' Perhaps that's what helps The ROAR's girls survive such taxing practice sessions - they each have their own personal workout routines, then train together for three hours, three times a week, and then do extras; some choose dance or Pilates (great for the abs), others run up and down the stadium steps. It has to be this way. An American football match lasts for four hours and they will be cheerleading throughout. No wonder they each drink as much as a gallon of water during every match. It turns out to be strangely addictive. As we stand together in a kick line, hands placed on each other's shoulders, and begin counting and kicking - with straight legs and pointed toes - I'm mesmerised by the movements. We could be on the stage of the Moulin Rouge. My kicks are stiff, low and, frankly, pitiful next to those of the professionals, but I feel part of the team - even if I would look rather out of place in their annual calendar. Cheerleading at this level is almost entirely female. You'd think such a tough sport would attract more men . But, ironically, cheerleading began as just another boys' club, with Princeton's University's 'Princeton Cheer' mentioned in the newspapers as early as 1887. They didn't do much more than holler, though, and it took the arrival of the first women in 1907 - and their gradual domination of the activity - for cheerleading to become the gymnastic performance we now know. Today, cheerleading at this level is almost entirely female. But why? You'd think such a tough sport would attract more men. 'It's the kick  line,' says Caitlin. 'Most men simply don't have the flexibility. And  they'd struggle to fit into the uniforms.' Ouch! But after this eye-opener, I can't argue with that. 1. Beaming .

At the time the cash-stricken Italian state could not raise the funding needed to buy it from its private owners in Milan.

The government has first refusal to buy back the island, which will expire on January 8, and will allocate £2.6 million towards it, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported. And the Senate Budget Committee has passed an amendment allowing the state to reclaim the island, which is in a protected area ten miles off the coast of Sardinia. Budelli first found fame as the sensational backdrop for the 1964 Italian film Red Desert starring celebrated British actor Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in two Harry Potter films. After its Milan-based owners went bankrupt, it was auctioned off to the highest bidder for £2.4million. The buyer, Michael Harte, chief information officer for Australia’s Commonwealth Bank, said he would preserve it as a natural wilderness. But the Italians were up in arms at the thought of the jewel of the Maddalena archipelago falling into foreign hands. Swathes of the northern coast of Sardinia has already been bought up by Qataris.

It is completely private - landing or dropping anchor within a hundred metres of its unique sands is forbidden, keeping paparazzi at bay. The only existing buildings are the caretaker’s house, a post-war military structure, the ruins of a cabin and a dry stone wall along the beach. The Spiaggia Rosa (‘Pink Beach’), on the south-eastern side of the island, owes its distinctive colour to microscopic fragments of corals and shells. The island is one of a group of three uninhabited islands originally populated in the 13th century by monastic hermits, who are thought to have used a network of underground tunnels to move between them.","Budelli fell into foreign hands earlier this year when it was sold at auction to a New Zealand businessman for £2.5 million .

Shot dead: 18-year-old Dane Scott Jr. was shot a few weeks after the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was unarmed when he was shot in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer . The friend of a teenager who was fatally shot in the back by an Oklahoma police captain testified on Tuesday that the unarmed 18-year-old was running away when the officer fired four shots at him. 'It surprised me very much,' John Lockett, 17, testified on the first day of testimony in the trial of Del City police Capt. Randy Harrison, who is charged with first-degree manslaughter in the March 14, 2012, death of Dane Scott Jr. Lockett said he was a passenger in a car driven by Scott when Harrison pulled up behind them in a police car with lights flashing. Lockett said Scott led Harrison on a high-speed chase and tried to hide the marijuana and gun he had in the car. Scott, who had recently been released from a juvenile detention center for selling drugs, 'just started to panic,' Lockett said. Lockett said he and a second passenger pleaded with Scott to let them out during the chase that he said reached speeds of up to 100 mph. The car eventually crashed into a tractor-trailer. Lockett said Scott and Harrison scuffled on the ground after the collision before Scott wriggled free. As soon as Scott started running away, Harrison started shooting at him, Lockett said. Authorities say Scott fired four shots, with the fourth one fatally striking Lockett in the back. Scroll Down for Video . Del City police Capt. Randy Harrison looks at the jurors box in the courtroom during his trial at the Oklahoma County Courthouse in Oklahoma City, Monday, Nov. 18, 2013. Harrison faces a first-degree manslaughter charge . Lockett said a second officer had hit Scott with an electrical stun gun about the same time the final shots were fired. Scott fell to the ground and Lockett said he didn't' realize Scott had been shot until later. 'I had no idea he was gone until after the fact,' he said. According to a police affidavit, Scott was unarmed and posed no threat of death or great bodily harm at the time of the shooting. But defense attorney Doug Friesen said Harrison's use of deadly force was justified by Scott's actions before he was shot. The police affidavit says Harrison managed to get a handgun from Scott as the two wrestled before Scott ran off. Scene of the scuffle: A police affidavit says Harrison was trying to arrest Scott after a car chase and took a handgun from the teen. As Scott ran away, Harrison fired four times, with the fourth shot striking Scott in the back . John Lockett, 17 (left) the friend of Dane Scott Jr. (right) who was fatally shot by an Oklahoma police captain testified Tuesday that the unarmed 18-year-old was running away when the officer began firing at him . 'Dane Scott is dead as the result of the choices that Dane Scott made,' Friesen said during opening statements. '(Harrison) could not have done anything other than what he did do and not violate his oath.' Harrison, a 23-year veteran of the Del City Police Department, has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge. He faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of life in prison if convicted. Harrison had previously arrested Scott on drug violations, and District Attorney David Prater told jurors that Harrison remained focused on Scott after he was released from juvenile detention and turned 18, meaning Scott could be charged as an adult. 'It was something other than professional. It became personal,' Prater said. 'Randy Harrison seemed obsessed with Dane Scott Jr. A police officer crossed the line.' After Harrison was charged last year, his attorney said prosecutors' decision was made in part to prevent the kind of racial discord that erupted after high-profile shootings in Florida and Tulsa. Scott was black; Harrison is white. A police affidavit says Scott was unarmed and posed no threat of death or great bodily harm. Harrison faces a minimum of four years and a maximum of life in prison if convicted of manslaughter . Scott was shot a few weeks after the death of Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was unarmed when he was shot in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer. And Harrison was charged within weeks of the arrests of two white men accused of fatally shooting three black people in Tulsa during a shooting spree that investigators described as racially motivated. According to police, Scott had previous convictions in juvenile court on misdemeanor drug charges and a pending felony case of drug possession with intent to distribute. Harrison had arrested Scott as he allegedly sold drugs near Del City High School in 2011. Court papers indicate Harrison also saw Scott allegedly selling marijuana from his home. Scott allegedly was selling drugs to a passenger in his car before the pursuit that led to the shooting, according to court records.","Testimony began today in the trial of a Oklahoma police Captain Randy Harrison who is accused of shooting unarmed Dane Scott, 18, in the back in March last year as he ran away .

Sophie, 23, admitted: 'You end up eating at stupid times and putting on weight. You are constantly on the move and don't have access to healthy food. You end up grabbing a sandwich and eating lots of other calorific things.' New frame: Former Geordie Shore star Sophie Kasaei has lost 10lbs (L) after a gruelling week at an intense boot camp.

You may not recognise its handsome Georgian facade but it’s likely you have taken a look inside Edwina Dvorak’s South London house before. The interior of the Clapham property, which is for sale at £1.1 million, has been used as a set for numerous advertisements and fashion shoots. Edwina’s vast kitchen on the lower ground floor has been given a particularly large amount of screen time – culinary superstar Jamie Oliver, MasterChef winner Dean Edwards and award-winning London restaurant The River Café are among those who have recently used the space to film commercials to promote cookbooks. Scroll down for video . Right ingredients: Edwina Dvorak in the kitchen of her £1.1million South London home which has been hired out for film shoots . Ironically, Edwina, a great-great-granddaughter of Czech composer Antonin Dvorak, is not particularly interested in cooking. ‘It’s the best kitchen for making cheese on toast,’ she jokes modestly. Where Edwina’s talents lie are as a film  and TV producer and in finding locations for shoots, so it’s perhaps not surprising her own home has been used as a set. She has also produced pop videos, for The Rolling Stones, Queen and Tinchy Stryder. Her contacts in the film and music industry have undoubtedly helped her, but she believes there are several factors that make it attractive for location managers, so a buyer could, if they desired, continue to use it as a set. ‘The house is on a very wide road so there is good access for the crews’ lorries,’ she says. ‘It is also close to the centre of London.’ Owners of properties used in adverts are generously remunerated and often put up in high-class hotels while filming takes place. King of the kitchen: MasterChef winner Dean Edwards films a commercial in Edwina's kitchen . The house itself has an illustrious history, having been designed by early 19th Century builder Thomas Cubitt, who built the east front of Buckingham Palace and swathes of Belgravia. In fact, Cubitt constructed the entire road as dwellings for his workforce: the house sizes are all different and they were built to reflect the rank of his staff. Edwina says her house’s large size suggests it was built for someone in a senior position. She bought the property 12 years ago because she wanted a Georgian home and a south-west-facing garden. But she had to  use her intuition and eye as a location manager to realise its potential. ‘It was owned by someone who had gone to live abroad and it had been used as a squat,’ she recalls. ‘The kitchen was divided into lots of small rooms and the garden was in a right state.’ On location: The home is build in Georgian style . Edwina stripped out walls to give an open-plan feel, in the process creating the vast kitchen with its central-island work station that has proved so attractive for photoshoots. The house now has three bedrooms, three reception rooms and two bathrooms. She also put in a conservatory and got to work in the garden, which looks so well-manicured and mature it’s hard to believe it was used as a dumping ground by squatters just 12 years ago. ‘It gets so much light so the plants I put in have grown fantastically,’ says Edwina, who plans to move to a large flat she already owns when the house is sold. ‘I will miss the garden – it is not overlooked at all, which is very rare in London.’ Edwina, who was raised in Hampstead, North London, is now a convert to the charms of life in the capital south of the Thames and believes the buyers of her house will appreciate what life has to offer in Clapham. ‘It’s so green – there’s Clapham Common five minutes’ walk away and Wandsworth Common and Battersea Park close by,’ she says. She also says Clapham has changed dramatically for the better in the 12 years she has lived there, with a variety of good-quality restaurants and pubs popping up. In fact, one of the local pubs proved particularly useful when Jamie Oliver’s team were at her house to film. ‘He arrived with a huge team of chefs and even my kitchen wasn’t big enough so they ended up using the kitchen in the pub up the road to prepare food.’ Thomas Crabtree, area director for Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘The house is a gem with its Cubitt history, but the interior is a  real surprise. The ground floor has been turned into a magnificent space that is currently both a fabulous live-in kitchen but also a set for commercials. If kitchens sell houses, this one will go very quickly.’ Marsh & Parsons, 020 7368 4458,  sales@marshand parsons.co.uk .","South London home used for film shoots and commercials up for sale .

His withering put-downs have humiliated University Challenge contestants for years. But Jeremy Paxman was finally forced to sample a taste his own medicine after the programme this week, when viewers pulled him up on a series of errors. The presenter fell short of his own high standards on the BBC2 show on Monday. His first gaffe came when a team from Clare College Cambridge  were asked to name the Czech composer of a piece of music as a bonus question. After they wrongly guessed Smetana, Paxman quickly corrected them, saying: ‘No, it’s Dvorak’s Requiem in B flat minor.’ But it was not long before music experts pointed out the clip was actually a Gregorian plainchant and not the work of Dvorak. One viewer, Helen Garrison – a senior producer for the BBC Singers and Radio 3 – tweeted: ‘Appalled at the ignorance of question on #universitychallenge.’ Another, Nick Edmonds, wrote: ‘Did #universitychallenge just play a requiem plainsong and ask which composer it was by?’ He added: ‘Some work to do on their musical knowledge.’ And a third, Damian Farrell tweeted: ‘Err … was there a mistake with the music question about Dvorak’s requiem on university challenge?’ Paxman’s second blunder came when Clare College were asked to identify the missing sister from Jane Austen’s novel Pride And Prejudice. The Clare College team responded ‘Eliza Bennet’ but Paxman soon told them that they had got the answer wrong. The question was then handed over to their rivals, Christ Church Oxford, whose answer ‘Elizabeth Bennet’ was accepted. Scroll down for video .

Harassment: Margaret Harvey with a photo of her late husband Graham at her home in Stoke-on-Trent . A grieving widow who admitted harassing three members of staff at a hospital where her husband died has walked free from court. Margaret Harvey, 75, bombarded 57-year-old Pauline Crossley - a former legal advisor at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire - with phone calls and even turned up at her home. She became obsessed with staff at the hospital who she blamed for causing the death of her husband Graham, who died in 2004 aged 66. Since his death following a heart attack, she has harassed three members of staff - including cardiologist Dr John Davis, who treated Graham. On one occasion Harvey even armed herself with a wooden meat hammer and travelled 220 miles to Dr Davis’s holiday home in Saltash, Cornwall, where she planned to confront him. In September 2012, Harvey was jailed for 28 days for bombarding the hospital’s former chief executive Julia Bridgewater with late night nuisance phone calls. But she was spared jail yesterday when she appeared again at North Staffordshire Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to harassing Mrs Crossely. She was given an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and a 10-year restraining order. Targets: Harvey became obsessed with staff at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire who she blamed for causing the death of her husband Graham, who died in 2004 aged 66 . But Harvey said she will continue her . campaign to prove her husband was let down - despite numerous . investigations finding the hospital has no case to answer. The court heard that after the death, Harvey had numerous ‘dealings’ with Mrs Crossley in 2006. Suspended: Harvey was spared jail when she appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court . But in October this year Harvey found Mrs . Crossley’s home address and phone number and began to harass her. Giles . Rowdon, prosecuting, said she called the home three times on October 5. He said: ‘She said, “Will you not help me now you no longer work for the trust, and bring me the records? Will you help me?” ‘When Mrs Crossley said there was nothing she could do the defendant said, “How would you feel if I paid someone to do something to your sons?”’ Mrs Crossley then stopped answering the phone, but Harvey left a voicemail message later that day, and again on October 7, talking about a ‘cover-up’. She was arrested later that day and admitted in interview that she had been to the house in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, to try and see Mrs Crossley. Angela Trafford, defending, said: ‘Mrs Harvey is not sorry for trying to get justice for her husband, but she is sorry that she’s caused Mrs Crossley distress. ‘She is not going to stop this fight for justice until she takes her last breath, but she is not going to commit any further offences.’ Death: Graham Harvey suffered a fatal heart attack in 2004 aged 66. Since his death his wife has harassed three members of staff, including cardiologist Dr John Davis, who treated him . Previous case: In September 2012, Harvey was jailed for 28 days for bombarding the hospital's former chief executive Julia Bridgewater (pictured) with late night nuisance phone calls . Harvey is already subject to an indefinite order banning her from contacting Mrs Bridgewater or going near her home. 'How would you feel if I paid someone to do something to your sons?' What Margaret Harvey told Pauline Crossley in a phone call . She hired a private detective to find Mrs Bridgewater’s telephone number and started repeatedly calling her in November 2011 - despite the fact that Mrs Bridgewater was not working at the hospital at the time of Graham’s death. Mrs Bridgewater contacted police and had a panic alarm installed at her home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, but the calls continued.

'You have to learn how to not just tighten up your tummy but actually pull your tummy in to your lower back as much as you can. Just doing 40 crunches a day isn't gonna do it for you,' she says. The Los Angeles-based fitness guru revealed Miley has recently installed a studio in her own home so she can sculpt her body every day, and is especially pleased with the result Mari's workout regime has had on her lithe limbs. She told People magazine: 'I gave her those legs. She's always going to have those long gorgeous legs. We just toned and firmed in all the right places. 'She wants to be healthy, she wants to have good abs. It always makes her feel better and clearer when she works out.' Greg Small, spokesperson for Register . of Exercise Professionals (REPs), says you need to do more than sit-ups . to achieve a fit physique.

'She has the luxury of being young which can result in having a faster metabolism and a team of expert nutritionists and dieticians to hand to help her achieve such a slim figure. 'In addition to this, some time ago she announced that she is gluten intolerant.  For those who suffer with this condition, excluding gluten containing products may reduce abdominal bloating. By cutting this food group out, Miley’s stomach would also appear flatter if previously gluten was causing her a problem. 'Coupled with her hectic lifestyle in the spotlight, I’m sure her nutritionists recommend she eats lots of B6 rich foods, such as dark green leafy vegetables, lean protein and good carbohydrates such as quinoa and oats to help boost her energy levels.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 11:14 EST, 15 December 2011 . Victoria Beckham's elegant style has endeared her to the over-50s . She is the pop-star-turned-designer who went from teeny bopping Spice Girl to running a world class fashion label. And today Victoria Beckham was handed yet another accolade as it was revealed she had been named as one of the country's top style icons by women over the age of 50 - despite being just 37 years old herself. The glamorous mother-of-four made a surprise appearance just outside the top five in a poll of 1,000 women. As the youngest to feature in the top 20, the results show the former Spice Girl now appeals to women with more refined tastes. Unsurprisingly, Oscar winner Dame Helen Mirren came top of the pile. A spokeswoman for clothing brand CC, who carried out the poll, said: 'Victoria Beckham has proven she carries universal appeal and her image over the past few years has altered from high glamour to a more classic look which appeals to women of all ages. 'The results show women in their fifties aren't afraid to embrace younger styles when they're done the right way. 'And Dame Helen Mirren has as much style, grace and elegance off screen as she does on it and is a fitting icon for the women of her generation. 'All too often we are bombarded with images of youth and temporary trends, so it's great to see such a varied list filled with women of real class. Runner up was world-renowned model and face of the swinging sixties, Twiggy.  Following a glamorous career, her unique appeal to the over fifties was dubbed the 'Twiggy effect'. Joanna Lumley, who famously starred in Absolutely Fabulous, was third. Sixties pop sensation Lulu was fourth while the first lady of British cinema, Dame Judi Dench, was fifth. Carole Middleton followed in the illustrious footsteps of daughter Kate - frequently named best dressed on global lists - in finding her way into ninth place. Ms Middleton won approval for her slender figure and immaculate dress sense, and won over the nation at the royal wedding with a perfectly pitched pale blue dress and coat. It seems having such icons has given older women confidence in their appearance - as the study found 85 per cent believe they have 'their own style'. A whopping nine out of ten women said they took pride in their appearance most of the time and, more than half said they never worry about dressing inappropriately for their age. In fact, nine out of ten women said they dress for themselves, with the majority admitting they have enjoyed shopping more the older they have got.  And a refreshing 85 per cent felt they could still wear trendy clothes despite being over 50. A CC spokeswoman added: ""These results show that age really isn't a barrier to style or confidence. In fact, it can be quite the opposite. 'It's inspiring to see that many women over fifty are comfortable in their self, confident in their style and brave enough to explore new clothing options.' Australian songstress Kylie Minogue hit the high notes at number 12, while showbiz judge Amanda Holden took 14th place. Samantha Cameron was voted into 15th spot.

Now the couple who bought the 'one-of-a-kind' property on the Upper East Side have put it on the market for $17million - making them a profit of $9million in the three years since they bought it from the U.S. government. Pokemon toy mogul Alfred Kahn and his wife Patsy are hoping to sell the apartment on East 64th Street - which boasts 4,000sq ft of living space - for more than double what they paid for it in 2010.

Prime real estate: The government sold off the apartment for $8million in 2010 to help compensate the victims of Madoff's scam . The property has a price tag of $17.25million, according to a report in the New York Daily News.

Disgraced: Madoff, currently serving a 150-year jail sentence, bought the penthouse in 1984 and spent his last days under house arrest there . The ponzi scheme fraudster is currently serving a 150-year sentence in a prison in North Carolina. Broker Dolly Lenz, who is handling the sale, told the newspaper: 'It's a one-of-a-kind penthouse - I remember it well.' Another broker described the property, which features soaring 11ft high ceilings and Palladian windows, as 'very grand'. It features three bedrooms, a library, a chef's kitchen, and a wraparound terrace with views of Manhattan's Central Park. It is a world away from Madoff's new residence - the Butner Federal Correctional Complex. Madoff, 75, was at the helm of a multi-billion dollar empire when he ran his own finance firm. But his high-flying lifestyle came crashing down in 2008 when it emerged it was being funded by the biggest financial fraud in U.S. history. The following year Madoff pleaded guilty to siphoning $17.5billion from thousands of investors in a long-running, pyramid-style scam. Along with his multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment, Madoff said goodbye to luxury properties in Florida and France, a beach house in Montauk, New York, and a yacht called The Bull. The conman and his wife Ruth were also forced to auction off furniture, jewellery and clothes in a bid to compensate the victim's of Madoff's scam. In 2010, on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, Madoff's eldest son Mark took his own life. The financier had tried to hide the fraud from his family.

Macy's is moving rocker Joan Jett off the South Dakota tourism float in its Thanksgiving Day parade after ranchers complained about having a vegetarian and animal rights advocate representing their state. Orlando Veras, Macy's parade spokesman, said today that Jett and her band, the Blackhearts, will be moved to another float. Veras said that the annual parade in New York City is about entertainment, not advocacy, and that Macy's was making the change 'to prevent any further distraction from our entertainment mission.' Joan Jett (seen in Baltimore in April) will no longer be park of the Macy's tourism float in their Thanksgiving Parade in South Dakota . 'The Parade has never taken on, promoted or otherwise engaged in social commentary, political debate, or other forms of advocacy, no matter how worthy,' Veras said in a statement. 'Macy's intention is only to provide a range of entertaining elements and performers free of endorsements or agendas.' A new performer for the South Dakota float will be announced later, Veras said. Some South Dakota farmers and ranchers voiced concern about the choice to put Jett on the float because she is a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which promotes a vegetarian diet and criticizes livestock production practices. South Dakota Cattlemen's Association President Cory Eich, who farms and ranches near Canova in eastern South Dakota, said earlier this week that he thinks it was a mistake to select Jett because her stands don't mesh with a state where the cattle industry makes up a huge part of the economy. Dan Mathews, PETA's senior vice president, said Friday to Associated Press that he's happy with the publicity generated by the controversy. Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (seen in New York) wants to keep its entertainment value and not be distracted by other issues . 'Thanks to South Dakota's reactionary ranchers, people across the country have learned why Joan Jett supports PETA,' Mathews said. 'The meat trade can't stand any scrutiny of its cruelty,' he said. South Dakota Tourism Secretary Jim Hagen has said that many people mistakenly assumed state officials selected Jett to appear on the float. None of the artists the state proposed were available or willing to appear in the parade, so Macy's selected Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, he said. Kristen Foster, a spokeswoman for Jett said earlier this week that Jett has played in South Dakota countless times and is a fan of the state. Jett just accepted a gracious offer to appear on South Dakota's float, Foster said. The state pays $175,000 to support the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and have a float in the event, and $5,000 of that goes to pay expenses for the artist on the float, officials have said. The South Dakota float, which has appeared each year since 2010, features Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Black Hills and more. Don McLean, the singer of American Pie, appeared on the float last year. Previous years' entries featured Neil Diamond and Mannheim Steamroller. More than 3 million people are expected to watch the parade on the streets of New York, with more than 50 million watching the event on television nationwide.","Ranchers had complained about having a vegetarian and animal rights advocate representing their state .

In a damning analysis, the corporation’s governing body accused its commercial arm BBC Worldwide of getting ‘carried away’ with ‘highly optimistic’ plans to buy the struggling brand six years ago. It was forced to sell the business to US-based company NC2 Media at a huge loss earlier this year, prompting an internal inquiry. Mistake: The BBC lost £100million in a disastrous takeover of the Lonely Planet travel guide business . Waste: The loss is £20million more than was previously thought because BBC Worldwide continued to inject funds into Lonely Planet despite the fact it failed to generate the expected profits . The full scale of the waste is £20million more than was previously thought because BBC Worldwide continued to inject funds into Lonely Planet despite the fact it failed to generate the expected profits. The BBC Trust report criticised the Worldwide division for being ‘too aggressive’ in its forecasts, saying the potential for the travel guide to succeed as an online venture was ‘unproven’. Review: Diane Coyle, vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ¿Mistakes were made in the acquisition and handling of Lonely Planet' It added: ‘[BBC Worldwide] seemed to get carried away with the deal momentum and there should have been an effective mechanism in place to ensure that it did not end up over-paying. ‘Not enough downside analysis was done of the potential impact of a faster decline in books and of not achieving the very optimistic online forecasts.’ Lonely Planet was acquired for £132million when John Smith was head of BBC Worldwide. He left to become chief operating officer of Burberry last year with an £800,000 payoff. BBC Worldwide paid for the firm - set up in 1973 by English engineer Tony Wheeler and his wife Maureen - in two chunks in 2007 and 2011. It invested a further £20million in the business before selling it this year for £52million. Diane Coyle, vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ‘Mistakes were made in the acquisition and handling of Lonely Planet. 'The important thing now is that the lessons highlighted by this review are implemented, alongside broader improvements to the strategy and oversight of the BBC’s commercial operations. ‘It is important to view the significant financial loss from Lonely Planet against the backdrop of a sustained strong performance from BBC Worldwide as a whole, which brings significant benefits to licence fee payers.’","BBC Worldwide forced to sell the travel guide business at a huge loss .

A school situated close to an asylum screening centre has pupils that have 69 different languages as their mother tongue, it emerged today. Teachers at the Oasis Academy Shirley Park, in Croydon, south London, have to cope with teaching children who speak a vast multitude of languages from across the globe, including Akan, a language native to Ghana, and Bemba, a dialect spoken in part of Zambia. It is thought that the school, which is located a little more than two miles away from the UK Border Agency's Asylum Screening Unit, is thought to have the highest number of different languages currently spoken in a British school. Diverse: Pupils speak a staggering 69 different languages at Oasis Academy Shirley Park in Croydon, South London . The screening unit is where asylum seekers from across the UK go to have their applications assessed. Of 1,539 children at the school aged between four and 19, 422 speak English as a second language. The other main languages spoken are Turkish, the mother tongue of 41 students, Urdu, spoken by 30 pupils and French, which is the native language of a further 29. But the academy also has 28 children who speak Somali, 23 who speak Jurdish, and 18 who speak Arabic. Some of the more unusual languages spoken by pupils include, Igbo, a dialect familiar to people in south eastern Nigeria, Kikuyu, which is spoken in Kenya, and Bahasa, a language spoken in Indonesia and Malaysia. A number of languages including Afrikaans, Berber (spoken in Algeria and Morocco), Burundi, Congolese, . Croatian, Lithuanian, Mandingo (spoken in the Gambia and other African countries), Mandarin, Oshiwambo (spoken in Angola and Namibia), . Papiamento (spoken on the Caribbean ABC Islands), Serbian, Shona (Zimbabwe/Zambia), Slovak, Sorani (Malaysia and Singapore), Telegu (south east India), Wolof (east Africa) and Shosa (south eastern South Africa). Neighbour: The school is close to the UK Border Agency's Lunar House asylum screening centre . The school also caters for one pupil who communicates using sign language. Staff at the school insisted yesterday that they see the arrival of children from all over the world as a positive rather than a challenge. The school has students with 69 different mother tongues. But what are some of the more unusual? Spokeswoman Jacqui Collins said: 'Although the number of different languages is currently 69, it is changing all the time. It comes in waves. 'Having such a variety of cultures and languages means the pupils learn in a rich environment and the children are always helping one another. 'There has been negativity sometimes about the diversity of population, but we really celebrate it here. 'We mark Black History Week and other events. It has always been culturally diverse here - and the children learn very quickly.' Head of the secondary school, Dan Morrow, says the language diversity is one of the school’s biggest strengths. He said: 'There is no data or any studies educationally to say needs of native speakers are being held back.' 'It’s not about attention. It is about matching resources to need. It is about making sure everyone is able to access the curriculum.' In February, it emerged that a primary school in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire with more than 400 pupils had become the first in the country where no children speak English as their mother tongue. Punjabi Urdu, Portuguese, Czech, Polish, Russian and several African dialects are among the 20 foreign languages spoken at Gladstone Primary School. But the school has thrived. Only 14 months ago the school was rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted, the lowest of four ratings. In January this year, however, that rating was upgraded to 'good' - the second highest rating.","The Oasis Academy Shirley Park in Croydon says diversity is its strength .

A former chemist at a Massachusetts drug lab who admitted faking test results in criminal cases pleaded guilty Friday and was sentenced to prison for three to five years. Annie Dookhan, 35, changed her plea in a Boston court on Friday on charges of obstruction of justice, perjury and tampering with evidence. The scandal that has jeopardized thousands of convictions and authorities have committed over $47 million to dealing with the crisis so far. During the ruling Judge Carol S. Ball told Dookhan that the consequences of her actions were 'catastrophic' and that 'the integrity of the criminal justice system has been shaken to the core.' Guilty: Annie Dookhan, a former chemist at a Massachusetts drug lab who admitted faking test results in criminal cases pleaded guilty Friday and was sentenced to prison for three to five years . The judge continued to state that: 'Innocent persons were incarcerated, guilty persons have been released to further endanger the public, millions and millions of public dollars are being expended to deal with the chaos Ms. Dookhan created.' The diminutive Dookhan showed no emotion during the hearing and did not address the court. She was sentenced to three to five years in prison, followed by two years' probation. She answered 'guilty' and replied to a series of routine questions from the judge in a barely audible voice. Dookhan also pleaded guilty to falsely claiming that she held a master's degree in chemistry. She was led away in handcuffs and will begin serving her sentence immediately at the state women's prison. Her attorney did not comment and her parents left without speaking to reporters. Prison bound: Former state chemist Annie Dookhan is led away after a hearing where she was jailed for three to five years . Dookhan sent the state's criminal justice system into a tailspin last year when state police shut down the state Department of Public Health lab she worked at after discovering the extent of her misconduct. Prosecutors said Dookhan admitted 'dry labbing,' or testing only a fraction of a batch of samples, then listing them all as positive for illegal drugs, to 'improve her productivity and burnish her reputation.' Since the lab closed in August 2012, at least 1,100 criminal cases have been dismissed or not prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other fallout from the lab's shutdown. Anne Kaczmarek, the state's prosecutor, asked Judge Carol Ball to impose a five- to seven-year sentence, citing the 'egregious nature' of Dookhan's actions. Ball had already said in a written memo that she would not sentence Dookhan to more than three to five years if she changed her plea. Defense attorney Nicolas Gordon asked for a one-year sentence for his client, who was born in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago and has no previous criminal record. Damage: During the ruling Judge Carol S. Ball told Dookhan (seen center with her family) that the consequences of her actions were 'catastrophic' and that 'the integrity of the criminal justice system has been shaken to the core' Prosecutors said Dookhan's actions had caused serious damage to the criminal justice system and cost the state millions of dollars to assess the damage and mitigate the effect on thousands of people charged with drug offenses during the nine years Dookhan worked at the lab. The court system has been flooded with motions for new trials filed by defendants in drug cases. As of Friday, the state had spent a total of $8.5 million responding to the drug lab crisis, and another $8.6 million was authorized to be spent in the current fiscal year, according to Alex Zaroulis, spokeswoman for the state office of Administration and Finance. The Legislature has authorized as much as $30 million to cover costs incurred by the court system, prosecutors, public defenders and other state agencies. 'This ends one chapter in this situation, but the story goes on for the thousands of individuals whose lives have been affected by the conduct of Annie Dookhan,' said Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel for the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state's public defender agency. 'There are millions of dollars more that will be spent and a lot of time spent by a number of people in the criminal justice system trying to deal with the fallout of what happened in that lab.' Quiet: Dookhan showed no emotion during the hearing and did not address the court. She answered 'guilty' and replied to a series of routine questions from the judge in a barely audible voice . Dookhan also pleaded guilty to falsely claiming that she held a master's degree in chemistry. One of the conditions set for her probation was that she not use the false credentials when seeking employment after serving her sentence. She was also ordered to have mental health evaluations after leaving prison.","Annie Dookhan, 35, pleaded charges of obstruction of justice, perjury and tampering with evidence in Boston .

The woman who falsely accused three Duke lacrosse players of raping her in 2006 has been found guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of her boyfriend. Crystal Mangum, 35, was sentenced to between 14 and 18 years in prison for killing Reginald Daye, 46. The former stripper and mother-of-three stabbed her boyfriend in the side of his chest during a fight at Daye's apartment on April 3, 2011. Daye died 10 days later at Duke Hospital due to complications from his injuries but managed to speak to police before his death. The verdict: Former stripper and mother-of-three Crystal Mangum is told she will spend a minimum of 14 years in prison for the stabbing murder of her boyfriend, Reginald Daye, in 2011 . Crystal Mangum was found guilty of second-degree murder on Friday by a court in Durham, North Carolina. In 2006, Mangum shot to notoriety as the stripper who accused three Duke Lacrosse players of raping her at a party where she had been paid to perform . While Mangum claimed she stabbed Daye in self defense after he dragged her out by the hair out of the bathroom, Daye told investigators she  Mangum attacked him several times with knives before stabbing him in the chest, according to News & Observer. Victim: Crystal Mangum was found guilty of the second-degree murder of her boyfriend Reginald Daye (pictured) whom she stabbed in his apartment during an argument in 2011 . It took the jury six hours to deliberate. Deputies immediately led Mangum out of the courtroom in handcuffs following the announcement of her sentence. Her attorneys had hoped for a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. The jury found Mangum not guilty of larceny for allegedly stealing cashier’s checks totaling $700 that Daye had previously given her to pay the rent. Members of Daye’s family said they were satisfied with the verdict. 'We’re just grateful that justice was served for Reggie today, for his family and his friends,' his sister, Cynthia Wilson, said. 'We just thank everybody that played a part and thank God. We’re just happy.' In 2006, Mangum claimed Duke lacrosse players Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans gang raped her at a team party where she was hired as a stripper. Scene: Mangum allegedly stabbed her 46-year-old boyfriend in this apartment block in 2011 after they had an argument over rent money . The three men were arrested but eventually declared innocent by North Carolina's attorney general after the evidence failed to back up Magnum's inconsistent story and her mental stability was called into question. The district attorney who championed Mangum's claims was later disbarred. North Carolina's attorney general eventually declared the players innocent of a 'tragic rush to accuse'. Prosecutors declined to press charges for the false accusations, but Mangum's bizarre legal troubles continued. Not long after she was convicted on misdemeanor charges of setting a fire that nearly razed her home with her three children inside. Crystal Mangum - seen here following her arrest in April 2011 - maintained she had stabbed boyfriend Reginald Daye in self-defense, with her attorneys hoping for a voluntary manslaughter verdict . In a videotaped police interrogation, she told officers she set got into a confrontation with her boyfriend at the time - not Daye - and burned his clothes, smashed his car windshield and threatened to stab him. Friends said Mangum has never recovered from the stigma brought by the lacrosse case and has been involved in a string of questionable relationships in an attempt to provide stability for her children. Vincent Clark, a friend who co-authored Mangum's self-published memoir, said: 'I'm sad for her. I hope people realize how difficult it is being her.'","Crystal Mangum, 35, was found guilty Friday of the second-degree stabbing murder of her boyfriend, Reginald Daye, 46, in April 2011 .

The Al-Madinah School in Derby was told they will be replaced by a more experienced team with the ‘skills and capability’ to make improvements. The chief executive of another trust has been asked to step in at the ‘dysfunctional’ free school – which was put in special measures by Ofsted last month. Changing hands: The Al-Madinah School in Derby was told senior staff will be replaced by a more experienced team with the ¿skills and capability¿ to make improvements . Schools Minister Lord Nash wrote to the school’s chairman of governors Shazia Parveen, saying: ‘I am not satisfied that you have demonstrated a strong basis for the transformation required at the school. ‘I cannot tolerate any child experiencing a poor quality of education in any state-funded school and am therefore determined to ensure there is a swift resolution. ‘You and your fellow trustees have agreed to resign in due course.’ Controversy: The school was criticised in September for allegedly threatening non-Muslim staff to wear hijabs . Barry Day, chief executive of the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust, will now start work with the school. The trust has a proven ability to transform struggling schools and a track record of providing high-quality education to children from a Muslim background, said Lord Nash. The Department for Education said the plan to improve Al-Madinah underlined the Government’s commitment to take ‘swift and decisive’ action against under-performing schools. Al-Madinah, one of the Government’s flagship free schools, opened last September. On its website it was billed as having a strong Muslim ethos with shorter holidays and longer school days to boost learning opportunities. But last month it was condemned as ‘in chaos’ by inspectors from Ofsted, who said the school had failed to keep pupils safe and was led by an ineffective governing body. The watchdog found older pupils were made to sit on different sides of the classrooms according to their sex. Singing and fairy tales were banned for being un-Islamic and even the word ‘pig’ was prohibited. In September there were claims that non-Muslim female staff were forced to wear hijabs. Miss Parveen said in a statement: ‘The trust will ensure that the  transition is smooth and the ethos of the faith-designated school remains secure. ‘We acknowledge the positive  input to allow our children to progress and have an academic success and a positive future.’","Al-Madinah School said staff would be replaced by an experienced team .

When it was revealed Wednesday that Jameis Winston's DNA was found in the woman's underwear, his attorney told reporters that Winston had consensual sex with her. 'To be clear, the victim did not consent. This was a rape,' the family said in a terse statement Friday. Winston, who is a top Heisman Trophy contender and one of the biggest stars in college football, continues to lead the No. 2-ranked Seminoles and is expected to play against this afternoon against the University of Idaho. Allegations: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston smiled on the sidelines of a recent game but is now fighting serious claims . Prosecutors said they have 'four or five' things left to do before they can make a decision on whether to charge Winston. The woman's family has been furious about how police in Tallahassee, Florida, handled the rape case, which was reported in December 2012. The . family says they pushed to have a DNA sample taken from Winston only to . be told by a police detective that it would alert Winston and make the . case public. The statement released Friday called it 'significant' that the DNA matches Winston. Winston was a top prospect and a backup quarterback at the time. When the FSU player was identified as . her attacker, her ‘family grew concerned that she would be targeted on . campus,’ the statement continued, adding that a lawyer was retained. A . detective ‘told the attorney that Tallahassee was a big football town’ and that the victim should give her allegations some thought because . ‘her life will be made miserable.’ The case was listed as 'open, status inactive.' Under investigation: The team have stopped the quarterback from answering questions about the assault at their press conferences . It was only after the Tampa Bay Times . broke the story about the allegations against Winston that police . referred the case to prosecutors. The . quarterback has been accused of sexually assaulting the woman at an . off-campus apartment in the early morning hours of Dec 7, 2012. The . woman immediately contacted police and was cooperative with their . investigation, said the family statement first published by the Tampa Bay Times. ‘Everybody wants to know what's going on,’ William Meggs, state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit told ESPN. ‘So do we. We're in the process of trying to figure out what's going on,’ he added. ESPN said they had seen the DNA analysis report undertaken by the Florida state crime lab. The alleged victim carried out a sex assault test at the time of the alleged incident. The . presence of DNA is not an indication of sex assault but does suggest . the football player had sexual relations with his accuser. Meggs told ESPN that investigators plan to use a combination of physical evidence and testimony to determine their course of action. Officials blamed the delay on the accuser abandoning her cooperation with police in February. ‘In February 2013, the case was classified as open, but inactive, when the victim in the case broke off contact with TPD, and her attorney indicated she did not want to move forward at that time,’ a spokesperson told ESPN. Accused: Mr Winston can outrun anyone on a football field, but he hasn't yet been able to distance himself from allegations almost a year old . Winston made his customary media appearance Wednesday before Saturday’s game, but the school prohibited him from answering any questions related to the investigation, according to ESPN.

He might have been able to put his troubles to the back of his mind for a while during a week spent in hiding from the media – but drugs squad officers from  West Yorkshire were waiting to arrest him shortly after these pictures were taken. Flowers sought refuge with American-born Rev Hu, 51, an old friend, at his  house near Liverpool Football Club’s Anfield stadium after The Mail on Sunday’s revelations last weekend. Scroll down for video . Paul Flowers was seen out at a cinema in Liverpool last Thursday shortly before his arrest (left), while according to friends Flowers' nose-blowing became more frequent after his cocaine habit increased (right) His companion was Reverend Hu, an ex-addict minister who has spoken about his battles with drugs and alcohol and has a house in the city . Rev Hu, who describes himself as a ‘California dude lovin’ life in Liverpool’ is open about his own past struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction and spends much of his time helping addicts in the North West. Despite media pressure Flowers looked relaxed while he was on his night out . In an internet blog called Pastor Buddha, the openly gay minister wrote recently: ‘In March 2011 I acknowledged 18 years of living life clean and sober. 'I am to this very day confronting the demons of alcoholism and drug addiction which have taken such a powerful hold on many people to whom I minister.’ In September, he took over a unique ministry called Something Else in the centre of Liverpool. It is also known as the Bread Church because visitors bake and eat fresh bread on the premises. Rev Hu will no doubt be astonished to learn that Flowers last week invited his dealer to stay at his friend’s Liverpool house, encouraging him to bring cocaine. On Thursday, Flowers and Rev Hu watched the space movie Gravity. Flowers emerged into the foyer and loudly blew his nose on a monogrammed handkerchief. According to friends, his nose-blowing has become more frequent as his cocaine habit has become more prodigious. Apparently neither man had any inkling of what would happen when they returned to Rev Hu’s house shortly before midnight. Within minutes, the police were knocking on the door to arrest Flowers and drive him 70 miles across the Pennines to Leeds.

In 2010, 4,906 car and motorcycle licences were revoked or refused, along with 493 lorry or bus applications. Among lorry and bus drivers the increase was a shocking 39 per cent. Transport minister Stephen Hammond revealed the figures for 2011 in response to a series of parliamentary questions from Labour MP Meg Munn. Mr Hammond told MailOnline: 'Licensing rules have an important part to play in keeping our roads safe.  We must make sure that only those who are safe to drive are allowed on our roads while at the same time avoiding placing unnecessary restrictions on people’s independence. All drivers must meet certain minimum eyesight standards.  There are additional checks for drivers of large goods vehicles and passenger carrying vehicles, which we strictly enforce. 'This is to protect the driver and other road users given their size, the number of passengers and the likely additional distance and time spent on the road.' Driving with defective eyesight is an offence and a driver who does not meet the required standard could be prosecuted.  They may also invalidate their motor insurance. Ms Munn said: 'A recent report showed that in 2010 road accidents caused by poor driver vision resulted in an estimated 2,874 casualties. 'These figures provide information on how many drivers who have come forward and reported problems with their vision to the DVLA had their licenses revoked or refused. 'I will be continuing to seek further information to ensure that robust measures are in place to check drivers’ vision, so we can continue to improve road safety. For most people it is simply a matter of getting their eyes tested to ensure they have glasses or contact lenses if required.' Under Department for Transport rules, all drivers should be able to read a number plate from 20 metres away, with glasses or contact lenses if necessary. They should also be able to pass an eye test with an optician and have an adequate field of vision. The government has ruled out introducing formal eyesight testing whenever a driving licence is renewed. Instead, it is up to drivers to ensure that they are able to meet the appropriate vision standards while driving. Police officers are able to carry out roadside eye tests if they think a driver does not meet the minimum requirements. If the driver fails the roadside test, the police can inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency who will revoke the driving licence. Last month a survey by Specsavers found one in three drivers were putting themselves and others at risk by failing to meet the legal vision standard required for driving. Labour MP Meg Munn said she was worried about road safety . Experts predict the number of older drivers will soar to record levels as the post-war 'baby-boom' generation reaches retirement. By 2032 the number aged over 70 will have risen to 5.8million, and the total will include almost two million over 80, the Institute of Advanced Motorists said. Earlier this month 87-year-old Peter Cole was released from jail on appeal, after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and making a false statement to obtain a driving license after twice lying to the DVLA about his eyesight. Cole of Abridge Homes, Abridge in Essex, ran over and killed war veteran Ambrose Skingle, 86, in January. Cole was jailed for 18 months, but the Court of Appeal said it was ‘wrong in principle’ for the frail pensioner to remain behind bars. The court heard how after the accident Cole was seen using a magnifying glass to use his mobile phone even whilst wearing glasses. It was later found that he could only read a number plate from just eight metres. On appeal Cole’s jail term was quashed and he was handed a 51 week suspended sentence, with a 12-month supervision requirement. Two years ago Raymond Hampshire, 87, escaped serious punishment after fatally injuring a disabled woman while she was riding a mobility scooter. Sheffield Crown court heard he had cataracts in both eyes and was unfit to be on the road because everything appeared ‘foggy’ to him.","Number of motorists banned from driving for poor eyesight jumps 10 per cent in a year .

"By . Ross Slater . PUBLISHED: . 16:59 EST, 23 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 23 November 2013 . Shamed Paul Flowers is said to have boasted that he ‘often went for lunch’ with senior Labour figures. The claim was made by a young male escort who says he met the former Co-operative Bank boss many times over the summer and was even invited by him to a party at the home of a Labour peer. Flowers’s alleged boast heaps more pressure on the Party, which last week desperately tried  to distance itself from its former ‘favourite banker’ as a slew of sleazy revelations followed our exclusive exposé of his drug abuse last week. General Secretary Michael Stephenson pictured with disgraced Paul Flowers who has claimed to have had lunch with senior Labour party members . The escort even said Flowers had specifically identified Ed Miliband and Ed Balls as the Labour figures he had lunched with – a claim that the party last night strongly denied. The new claim comes as The Mail on Sunday publishes photographs showing Flowers and Mr Balls at the same conference in 2010. Both men were on the panel at the three-day Co-operative Party Conference. Earlier this month, Flowers told MPs he helped to arrange a £50,000 donation by the Co-operative Group to the Shadow Chancellor’s office. The former escort, who has found other work and does not want to be named, said: ‘Once [Flowers] hit the cocaine, his mouth would go off and he would soon be boasting and dropping names of people who he said he knew and places he had been. ‘He told us he often went for lunch with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls,  and would speak about meeting important-sounding people in the House of Commons or for lunches in London.’ In another astonishing claim, the escort said Flowers, who was still chairman of the Co-op Bank when they met in April, admitted to being so hooked on Class-A drugs that he had to snort cocaine to sit through lengthy bank board meetings at the CIS Tower in Manchester. The political war of words  over Paul Flowers intensified yesterday as the Conservatives reacted furiously to claims that they were conducting a ‘smear campaign’ over his links to the Labour leadership. Tory chairman Grant Shapps described Ed Miliband as ‘pathetic’ for claiming that the episode ‘showed more about the character of the Prime Minister than about the character of Labour’s relationship with the Co-op’, and for accusing Mr Cameron of trying ‘to make cheap political points rather than sorting it out’. Mr Shapps said: ‘This is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues. Labour have big questions to answer, and when they are asked, they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears.’ And he claimed Mr Miliband’s remarks amounted to hypocrisy ‘from the party that brought  you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times, fronted by Damian McBride, and known about, encouraged and tolerated by Ed Balls and Ed Miliband’. ‘McBride was simply the  latest in a long line of bullying Labour spin doctors, including Alastair Campbell and Charlie Whelan,’ he added. ‘We suggest that they explain how the corruption at Falkirk happened, and how the Rev Flowers was allowed to become and remain an adviser, rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears.’ The escort, who was only 19 during most of their relationship, said: ‘As I got to know him, the scale of his dependency on drugs became clear. He couldn’t get through the day without snorting some. ‘He told me bank board meetings were the worst and he would have a line at lunchtimes to keep him going through the afternoon session.’ The pair were introduced by another escort who had already begun having trysts with the Methodist minister. The escort said: ‘We first met  at the Renaissance hotel in Manchester, where he had a suite he used when he was in the city. ‘I wore a shirt and smart trousers, and he had on a polo shirt and chinos. He was very good company. He was well spoken and intelligent, and we were not short of conversation. A Labour party spokesperson categorically denied that either Ed Miliband or Ed Balls had lunch with the disgraced Co-op bank chief . ‘We had a meal at the hotel and he told me that he was the chairman of the Co-op Bank but he was about to step down. He also said he was a Methodist minister. ‘When I asked him what chairing  a bank entailed, he was a bit short on detail and just said he was mostly a figurehead and not concerned with the actual running of it. ‘We were drinking white wine all evening and then went up to his suite. It was a very large room with a bed that he proudly told me could “comfortably sleep three.” ’ He said they began to meet frequently, with Flowers booking him for £400-a-time ‘overnight sessions’ at his house in Bradford, owned by the Methodist church. It was at one of these gatherings that Flowers apparently made the claim about his contact with Mr Miliband and Mr Balls. The political wing of the Co-operative movement could be facing financial crisis of its own next year as the  Co-ope Group’s board reviews its £1million political fund. Cutting the spending would deal a severe financial blow to the Co-operative Party, a sister group to the Labour Party, whose members include Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and 31 other Labour MPs. Just two weeks ago the interim members meeting of the  Co-operative Group – the parent company behind the funerals, supermarkets and banking businesses – voted in favour of a £1million fund for political donations in 2014. But with the Group reeling from the Paul Flowers scandal, a strategic review is under way and a spokesman for the group confirmed political donations could be cut. ‘Given there is a group-wide strategy review under way, it is safe to assume everything will be looked at. ‘In the case of political engagement, do we want to make donations to one political party?,’ said the spokesman. The way the money is dished out is left to the discretion of the Co-op Group Board, but in previous years the vast bulk has gone to the Co-operative Party. The political donations pot was also the source of the £50,000 given to Ed Balls office by the Co-op group last year. The Co-operative Party describes itself as Britain’s ‘fourth biggest political party’, although it only puts up candidates in partnership  with the Labour Party. Its politicians, who also number Stella Creasy, Stephen Twigg and Adrian Bailey, style themselves as ‘Co-operative  and Labour Party’ MPs. Payouts to political groups  will be doubly controversial in the coming year as the Group battles to arrange a financial rescue for its struggling banking business, which  could cost investors, including private individuals, thousands  of pounds. ‘The comment about lunching with Miliband and Balls was made at his house in Bradford. There was another escort there and another man who he had picked up for the night from the Grindr [gay dating mobile phone] app. He loved an audience. ‘He seemed serious about his politics. At one of our meetings at the Renaissance hotel, I remarked that perhaps Labour had gone for the wrong brother for the leadership. He launched into a very forceful defence of Ed Miliband and promised me more than once that he would introduce me. He said I would change my mind if I met him.’ The escort said he was astonished by how unguarded Flowers was about his drug use. ‘He was either very naive or he just thought different rules applied to him. Most people use code when referring to drugs in text messages or on the phone, but he didn’t seem to care. ‘Often I would go to bed and he would stay up. When I got up, the next day he would say that he had just been taking coke all night. The day after we went to see Cabaret  at the Alhambra Theatre in Bradford, he had three lines of coke and then went to take charge of a funeral. It was totally inappropriate.’ A spokesman for the Co-op said he could not comment on claims that Flowers had used drugs to get through board meetings. A Labour Party spokesman last night denied that Flowers enjoyed lunch with either Mr Miliband or Mr Balls: ‘This is not true. Ed Miliband has met Paul Flowers on only three occasions. 'They met in March this year and Flowers also attended, along with other business people, two informal dinners at which Ed Miliband was a guest. Ed Balls has been to a few events Flowers was also at but he has never had a meeting or a phone conversation with him. ‘Any attempt to suggest the behaviour of Flowers calls into question the integrity of the Labour Party as a whole is an unjustified smear. The Labour Party leadership has been  as shocked and appalled as anyone at the revelations regarding Flowers. 'That is why we took immediate action to suspend him from Labour within hours of the revelations.’","Shamed Reverend said he 'often went for lunch' with senior party members .

At least 29 students and a teacher have been killed after Islamic extremists attacked on a boarding school in northeast Nigeria. Survivors, who are being treated for burns and gunshots wounds, say some students were burned alive in the pre-dawn attack today on the Government Secondary School in Mamudo town in Yobe state. Farmer Malam Abdullahi wept over the bodies of his two sons, aged ten and 12. 'That’s it, I’m taking my other boys out of school,' he told The . Associated Press. He said he had three . younger children in a nearby school. Conflict: The attack is the deadliest on a school since the Nigerian Government began an offensive against Islamist group Boko Haram . He said there was no protection for students despite the deployment of thousands of troops since the government declared a state of emergency mid-May in three north-eastern states. 'We were sleeping when we heard gunshots. When I woke up, someone was pointing a gun at me,' said 15-year-old Musa Hassan. He put his arm up in defence, and suffered a gunshot that blew off . all four fingers on his right hand, the one he uses to write with. He said the gunmen came armed with jerry cans of fuel that they used . to torch the school’s administrative block and one of the hostels. Dozens of schools have been torched and unknown scores of students killed among more than 1,600 victims murdered by extremists since 2010. The attackers set fire to buildings and shot pupils as they tried to flee, according to Reuters. Several of the students were being treated for burns, he added. It was the deadliest of three attacks on schools since the military launched an offensive in May to try to crush Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group whose nickname translates as 'Western education is sinful' in the northern Hausa language. The attack happened on a boarding school in the north eastern state of Yobe in Nigeria . Violence: Several people died and more than 40 were injured after a car bomb attack on a church service in Nigeria - also believed to have been carried out by Boko Haram . Potiskum is in Yobe state, one of three covered by a state of emergency declared by President Goodluck Jonathan in May, when he ordered extra troops into the region to try to quell a rebellion seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's top oil producer. Police responded to queries by email as the mobile phone network was cut to much of the northeast as part of the state of emergency. The hit-and-run strikes have raised fears the seven-week-old military offensive has pushed the militants fighting for a breakaway Islamic state in northeast Nigeria into hiding, but failed to stop them launching devastating attacks. Suspected Islamist militants opened fire on a school in Nigeria's northeastern city of Maiduguri last month, killing nine students, and a similar attack on a school in the city of Damaturu killed seven just days earlier. Nigerian forces say their offensive has enabled them to wrest back control of the remote northeast from Boko Haram, destroy key bases and arrest scores of suspects.","Pre-dawn attack on Government Secondary school in Mamudo in Yobe state .

Hundreds of people are expected to attend his funeral after it emerged he died with no close friends or relatives . Hundreds of people are expected to attend the funeral of a war veteran they never knew after an appeal for mourners in a local newspaper revealed he died with no close friends or relatives. Harold Jellicoe Percival, who helped with the famous Dambusters raid during the Second World War, died last month aged 99 in a nursing home. He was a distant relative of Spencer Perceval, the only British prime minister to be assassinated, and who died in 1812. Poignantly for the ex-military man, his funeral will take place at 11am tomorrow, as Britain pauses to remember its war dead on Armistice Day. But . Mr Percival, who served as ground crew with RAF Bomber Command, never . married, had no children and has no close family members able to attend . the service at the Lytham Park Crematorium, Lytham St Annes, in . Lancashire. An advert was placed in a local paper asking for people to come to his funeral - especially service personnel. John McCormick, who runs a Facebook page for RAF veterans, said: 'It would be a great shame if this occasion went unattended given Harold's service to his country. 'It is particularly poignant that he should be buried at 11am on November 11.' Injured serviceman, Sgt Rick Clement, spread the word on Facebook and Twitter and it was quickly picked up and shared by thousands of other people on the social networking sites. Sgt Clement, who lost his legs while serving in Afghanistan, tweeted his appeal which was picked up by celebrity supporters. 'If you’re in the area give him the send off he deserves. This guy needs and deserves your help.' He wrote on Facebook. Comedian Jason Manford retweeted the appeal and wished Sgt Clement luck.

Using bouncing bombs, their daring night-time raid saw the mission hailed a success. The Sorpe dam was was also attacked by two aircraft and damaged. A fourth dam, the Ennepe, was reported as being attacked by a single aircraft (O-Orange), but with no damage. An estimated 1,294 people were killed by floodwaters, but eight of the 19 aircraft that went on the mission failed to return. There was a loss of 53 aircrew - and three were taken as prisoners of war. Wing Commander Guy Gibson of 617 Squadron was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in leading the attack. 'Gotta pity the poor person who's sorting out the buffet!' Those involved in organising the . funeral say they have been contacted by veterans' groups and other . military supporters keen to acknowledge Mr Percival's career. Edmund .

'It doesn't sit . well with me that somebody who has served their country can be forgotten . about, that his service can go un-noted. I am sure he would have had a few stories to tell.' Mr Percival was one of four siblings but lived a 'nomadic lifestyle' after leaving the RAF at the end of the war. His nephew, David Worsell, said: 'He was a private man, he worked in Australia for a number of years as a decorator and would visit England for holidays. 'He travelled around England with only his backpack. 'He didn't have a postal address, he just used to get everything sent to my mother's address and would go through it when they met up.' Mr Percival lived in Penge, south London, before joining the RAF. He was based in the north west of England and became part of the ground crew which helped with the Dambusters, the squadron which was initially formed to destroy dams in the Ruhr valley in Nazi Germany. The Queen unveiled a memorial to Bomber Command in London last year. After working in Australia, Mr Percival later retired to England and lived at the Alistre Lodge Nursing and Care Home in Lytham St Annes.

British prime minister Spencer Perceval, who was shot dead by a bankrupt . broker, John Bellingham, as he entered the House of Commons, in 1812. Matron Janet Wareing said: 'Harold was a lovely character, very strong-willed and independent.'He was quite a private man, and he loved reading his Daily Telegraph every morning. 'We have already been contacted by military veterans who are intending to come, even though they have never met him. 'Distant relation': Mr Percival was related to Spencer Perceval - the only British prime minister to be assassinated . 'We've been told one group is looking to bring around 200 people to the service, which would be fantastic.' Davis Boothman, secretary for the RAF Association Layland branch, said he would ring friends and colleagues in an effort to gain additional support. He said: 'We normally do try and make a showing at these times. 'It is important that we remember people like Harold - they are part of us.' Relative Mr Worsell is unable to attend the service, but his son - Mr Percival's great nephew - will represent the family. Mr Worsell said: 'My uncle would be very surprised at the attention this seems to have received and the number of people wanting to attend. 'What with him being a very private person, forming long-term relationships didn't seem to be part of his make-up. 'He didn't really speak about his military career but he perhaps wished he didn't leave the RAF at the end of the war. But he was a free spirit.'

Maria Miller has risked angering Spain by praising the Gibraltar football team who played their first match as a member of Uefa last week . Diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain were ratcheted up last night after a Cabinet Minister pledged to boost Gibraltar’s ambitions on the world sporting stage. Culture Secretary Maria Miller taunted Spain by hailing a ‘historic’ match played by Gibraltar’s football team last week, after they were accepted by Uefa, European football’s governing body, and given the chance to compete in an international tournament for the first time. Ms Miller’s provocative intervention comes after the Spanish mounted a doomed attempt to stop the friendly match against Slovakia – which ended in a 0-0 draw – by arguing the Rock was not a sovereign state. The Minister is now promising to help other Gibraltan teams to compete in international fixtures – a move designed to incense the Spanish. Ms Miller, congratulating the Gibraltar Football Association, said: ‘I know it has been challenging for you to get to this point, with the odds seemingly stacked against you, but your tenacity has paid off and the results have made every resident of Gibraltar proud.’ In a letter to Desmond Reoch, the association’s president, Ms Miller said: ‘A draw against Slovakia is a highly creditable result, given this was a team that qualified for the last World Cup, and it certainly augurs well for the future.’ Gibraltar will launch their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign next year. The letter, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, goes on defiantly: ‘We are, as you will know, keen to support Gibraltar’s international ambitions. 'In other sports Gibraltar is struggling to get the international recognition it seeks and deserves, in part because of the approach, attitude and actions of European nations. ‘It goes without saying I unreservedly back you and Gibraltar’s case for recognition, whether that is in football, rugby union or in other sports.’ The match ended in a 0-0 draw which Miller said should make 'every resident of Gibraltar proud' The letter concludes: ‘I look forward to the first match between Gibraltar and one of the home nations.’ Her intervention is likely to be more significant in the political than the sporting sphere. Gibraltar has one full-sized football pitch, and the game had to be played 150 miles away in southern Portugal – cheered on by about 500 fans in the 30,000-capacity Estadio Algarve – because their stadium does not meet Uefa standards. With a population of just 30,000, Gibraltar replaces San Marino (32,000) as the smallest nation to be accepted by Uefa. In Tuesday’s game, the team of amateurs was boosted by the inclusion of ex-Manchester United professional Danny Higginbotham, whose grandmother came from the Rock. Ms Miller’s move comes amid a growing war of words between London and Madrid over the Rock, which Spain ceded to Britain in 1713. Gibraltar and Spain will be kept apart in any qualifying football competitions.","Maria Miller hailed team saying they should make Gibraltar proud .

The Duke of Cambridge cheered on Wales as they conceded 15-24 to South Africa in the final of the Prince William Rugby Cup. It is the seventh time the heir's side have conceded in the Autumn International since the cup was created in 2007. William, vice patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), arrived at Millennium Stadium in high spirits this afternoon predicting a 'brutal' match. He was greeted by 74,000 fans, former . injured players, and the Welsh First Minister after flying in to  the city's Heliport. Roaring: Prince William cheers from the stand watching Wales and South Africa at Millennium Stadium.

It wasn't to be.' Tough: James Hook of Wales and Bryan Habana of South Africa battle for the ball . He was taken to admire a 5ft 4in portrait of the Queen in the stadium by Cardiff-born artist Dan Llywelyn Hall before greeting the former players who make up the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, of which he is a patron. He discussed the upcoming match with around 20 players - as well as his son Prince George. Dennis Gethin, WRU president and chairman of the trust, said: 'Prince William takes time to speak to . each one of them and it is certainly something which they and their . families appreciate and cherish.' He also met Owen Sheers, WRU's first artist in residence, who presented William with a copy of his book about the Welsh side, Calon. Trophy: The Duke hands the Prince William Cup to Jean de Villiers of South Africa after the match... ...before receiving his own gift from the South African team: a soft toy Springbok for baby Prince George . Grateful: William clutched the gift with both hands as he walked with Dennis Gethin back onto the pitch . Speaking afterwards, Mr Sheers said: 'It makes a big difference to the players to have Prince William's vote of confidence. 'He is a big rugby fan and to have him here supporting Wales today is fantastic.' Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones gave William a present for son Prince George - a certificate for initiative Plant!, which plants a tree for every child born or adopted in Wales. Mr Jones said the Duke, who lived in Anglesey, and his family would always have a 'welcome home in Wales'. Proud: William, vice patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, praised the 'special' side. After arriving at the Millenium Stadium today, he discussed the match with WRU chair David Pickering (left) and CEO Roger Lewis (centre) 'By planting trees for this new generation we are providing them with personal links to the environment and creating local, native woodlands that can be enjoyed for generations to come,' he said. 'While Prince George was not born in Wales, we have planted a tree in honour of the time his parents spent here and the fact the family will always have a welcome home here in Wales.' For the game, William sat between Mr Gethin and James Stoffberg, the vice president of the South African Rugby Union. After the match, he presented the cup to the away side.

Russian Boxer Magobed Abusalamov, 32, is in a coma after losing to heavyweight champion Mike Perez in a 10-round duel on Saturday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York. The fighter's family and his manager are outraged and curious as to why the state boxing officials let the bloodied and severely injured boxer leave the arena on his own. New York Magazine reports that according to the fighter's manager Boris Grinberg, doctors who inspected Abusalamov after the fight in his dressing room failed to recognize the severity of his injuries. 'He says, ""Count one, two, three, four, five …,"" and then he tells him to make sure he goes to hospital tomorrow because his nose might be broken,' Grinberg says. “They give him no attention! No ambulance!' Scroll Down For Video . Mike Perez punches Magomed Abdusalamov during their Heavyweight fight at the Theater at Madison Square Garden . They tested his urine for drugs. They then allowed him to leave the venue. Abdusalamov known as the 'Russian Tyson,' walked out of the garden like any other fan, and hailed a cab with the help of his manager Boris Grinberg's son and a passerby. The fighter took a cab to Roosevelt Hospital where he struggled to get immediate medical attention. He vomited a second time, complained of headaches, and finally passed out. He wasn't helped until his Manager yelled out, 'He is fighter from Madison Square Garden.' He is former champion of Russia,' Grinberg says. When ER staff took over, he was put through a CAT-scan machine. Doctors later performed surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. They removed a portion of the fighters skull to lessen some of the pressure from brain swelling. Magomed Abdusalamov went through 10 rounds of torture before Perez was named the champion . Doctors also medically induced a coma, hoping that he would start to heal. The New York Daily News reports that while the fighter was in stable condition on Sunday, Liz Dowling, assistant director of affairs at Roosevelt Hospital, says he is now in 'critical condition.' 'I am not afraid to say it. New York State Athletic Commission is horrible. It is dangerous for these people to be so careless and not do anything,'said Grinberg. The fighter's wife and three daughters and other family members are saddened by the lack of aid given by the Athletic Commission. They are also worried about the medical bills which will go beyond the $10,000 insurance policy that the state requires promoters to hold for fighters. Boris Grinberg, the fighter's manager, is outraged at the lack of medical attention given to Abdusalamov at the arena . Dagestani boxer Magobed Abusalamov was no match against Cuban fighter Mike Perez who studied at the rigorous and technically based Cuban amateur program. New York Magazine reports that Perez fought over 300 matches before working professionally. Abdusalamov started boxing in his early twenties and relied on brawn over technical skill. He managed to go pretty far--knocking out 18 of his opponents before the fifth round prior to Saturday. On Saturday night, after breaking his powerful left hand in the first round, he'd lost his golden fist. Perez punched his opponent to the point where Abdusalov asked his manager, 'How's my face look?' in the sixth round. Abdusalamov's promoter, Nathan Lewkowicz, says he couldn't tell his fighter was in serious condition until after the fight. He partially attributes this to the language barrier. Lewkowicz believes his fighter will survive. He told the Daily News, 'We're pretty bullish he'll make it through.' Lewkowicz told reporters, 'I spoke to his manager around 10 a.m. and he said he was stable. It's possible they might have been saying that (he's in critical condition) because he's in the ICU.' The Athletic Commission released a statement on Monday saying, 'It is reviewing the circumstances surrounding Mr.Abdusalamov's injuries. We are hopeful he makes a complete and speedy recovery.'","Magobed Abusalamov was inspected by doctors in his dressing room following the match and they told him he only had a broken nose .

Defeat: SNP leader Alex Salmond has seen his majority in the Scottish Parliament cut to just two . Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has suffered a crushing by-election defeat that leaves the SNP with a wafer-thin majority in the Scottish Parliament. Labour won the contest in Dunfermline, Fife, by 2,873 votes after a fierce battle that saw an unexpectedly high turnout of 42.75 per cent. Mr Salmond was left personally humiliated after he made a last-minute appearance on doorsteps yesterday evening in a bid to pick up votes. But Labour won 42.5 per cent of the vote, with the Scottish National Party on 30.6 per cent - a swing to Labour of 6.9 per cent. Winning candidate Cara Hilton was heckled and booed by SNP activists as she made her victory speech. She claimed the result sends a clear message to Mr Salmond ahead of next year’s referendum on Scottish independence. The LibDems came third with 11.8 per cent, followed by the Tories on 8.3 per cent, UKIP on 3.8 per cent and the Greens on 2.5 per cent. Dunfermline was a former LibDem stronghold, but fell to Mr Salmond’s SNP in his 2011 Scottish Parliament election landslide. Labour’s victory is a significant boost for the party’s Scottish leader, Johann Lamont, and throws the next Holyrood elections in 2016 wide open. It is the first time a seat has changed hands in a Scottish Parliament by-election for 13 years. It comes just months after the SNP’s majority in a by-election in Aberdeen Donside was slashed and only weeks after Labour trounced their main opponents north of the Border in a council by-election in Glasgow’s Govan ward. The result also casts further doubt on Mr Salmond’s chances of winning next year’s independence referendum, with polls suggesting fewer than 30 per cent of Scots want to leave the United Kingdom. Winner: Labour's Cara Hilton, pictured with shadow chancellor Ed Balls, secured a majority of 2,873 in the Dunfermline by-election . The by-election was held following the resignation of disgraced wife-beater Bill Walker, who had been kicked out of the SNP. Earlier this year he was found guilty of 23 counts of domestic abuse against three former wives and a stepdaughter. Labour’s victory leaves Mr Salmond with a slender parliamentary majority of just two. He now has 65 MSPs - down from 69 in 2011 - with the combined opposition forces on 63. Miss Hilton said: 'The people of Dunfermline have rejected Scotland being put on pause for another year. 'The government of Scotland has been suspended so that a referendum campaign can be won. 'We need a Scottish Government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after [independence]. 'Dunfermline has sent a message to Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession. 'Use the powers you have now to make a difference, not just argue for more in the future.' Count: The contest in Dunfermline was dominated by a local row over Labour-run Fife Council¿s plan to close primary schools . Surprise: Labour's victory throws the next Holyrood elections in 2016 wide open . SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: 'The SNP fought a strong campaign with an excellent candidate in Shirley-Anne Somerville, and we made the issues of the by-election the issues that matter to the people - saving local schools, and protecting vital public services. 'In the event, the seat was just too marginal, and we wish Cara Hilton well in representing the people of Dunfermline and the West Fife villages. 'However, the swing of just 6.9 per cent to Labour is extremely small. It is even less than Labour achieved in the Donside by-election just a few months ago, and is one of the lowest by-election swings in the history of the Scottish Parliament - which indicates the underlying strength of the SNP after six-and-a-half years in government.' The contest in Dunfermline was dominated by a local row over Labour-run Fife Council’s plan to close primary schools. That should have helped the SNP and the party’s candidate - former MSP Miss Somerville - who was widely considered a much more accomplished performer than Miss Hilton. Labour also faced ridicule following the publication of a leaflet that listed a series of SNP policies - including the abolition of bridge tolls and a council tax freeze - and presented them as the party’s own ideas. Countdown: Voters in Scotland will go to the polls in the Scottish independence referendum in September next year . But Mr Salmond suffered his own setback this week after he turned up at a closure-threatened school in a last-ditch attempt to boost support for the SNP. Pitcorthie Primary School had actually been forced to shut its doors hours earlier because the creaking boiler system failed to work. Seven candidates were contesting the seat, with university lecturer Susan Leslie standing for the LibDems. Her party continues to be punished by Scottish voters for joining the Tories in coalition at Westminster. The Tories chose 22-year-old James Reekie, pro-independence campaigner Zara Kitson contested the by-election for the Greens, and UKIP’s regional organiser in Scotland, Peter Adams, also stood. There was one independent candidate on the ballot paper - John Black - who has previously been involved with the Scottish Jacobite Party.","Labour wins Dunfermline by-election with majority of 2,873 over SNP .

Kentucky State Police said only that a juvenile, whom has not been identified, was in custody facing two counts of murder and one count of first-degree arson. But the couple's son, Rusty Garland, said that it was his 16-year-old niece who had been charged. Scroll down for video . Everett Garland, 64, and his 60-year-old wife Linda were killed in their Kentucky home when a fire broke out on Wednesday night . A 16-year-old girl has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of first-degree arson after her grandparents died in a house fire in Lincoln County, Kentucky . The victims, Everett Garland, 64, and his 60-year-old wife, Linda Garland, were in their central Kentucky home when the fire broke out late Wednesday night, authorities said. Rusty Garland said by telephone on Thursday that relatives were stunned. 'She was always a good girl,' he said of the niece. 'Everybody's in shock. They can't believe something like that would happen.' Rusty Garland said his parents had custody of his niece. He said she had had problems in school but he wasn't aware of any friction between his parents and his niece. 'Mom and Dad were trying to raise her,' he added. Mr Garland told Centralkynews.com: 'The community has lost two good people.' State police didn't divulge a possible motive and said the suspect was being held in a juvenile detention center. The fire was set inside the one-story home, said state police Trooper Robert Purdy. Investigators were still trying to determine a cause. Rusty Garland, the elderly couple's son, said that he was stunned by the actions of his niece . Fire investigators on the scene of the charred property said that it did not appear to be an accidental blaze . 'It was intentionally set,' Purdy said. 'There was something that transpired prior to that that's sensitive to the investigation.' Everett Garland was pronounced dead at the scene near the community of Eubank, about 60 miles south of Lexington in Kentucky's Lincoln County. His wife died later at a hospital. Autopsies were planned. Everett Garland was found near the rear door of the home, his wife in their bedroom beside the bed, Lincoln County Coroner Farris Marcum said.

The girl was taken to a hospital to be checked and was later released, he said. Rusty Garland, who drives a cattle truck, was on his way home from a run to Tennessee when he was notified that his parent's home had burned. He lives about a half-mile from his parents.

Energy giants are to repay customers up to £2 billion which they have stockpiled from direct debit overpayments. In a move hailed as a victory for The Mail on Sunday, beleaguered bosses of the ‘Big Six’ power companies agreed to the climbdown after a crunch summit with Ministers. The deal means any customer who is in credit by more than one month’s payment will be given an automatic refund, and comes two weeks after this newspaper exposed how the companies were making up to £36 million a year in interest from accounts in credit, leading to accusations  of profiteering. Energy Minister Greg Barker said last night: ‘This looks like a real win for hard-pressed working people. Delighted: Energy minister Greg Barker praised the announcement as 'a real win for hard-pressed working people' 'Thanks to the pressure from The Mail on Sunday and consumers up and down the country, we have together been able to get a better deal without having to resort to the blunt instrument of legislation, which means these changes should be in place by this winter.’ Energy firms have also pledged to review customers’ accounts twice a year to stop people amassing huge credit. More than 13 million households pay a fixed amount every month by direct debit, with many overpaying in the summer when usage is lower. It has led to huge credits on consumer accounts, earning interest for the energy companies. The new initiatives, which are still to be agreed, will be a welcome relief to millions of households facing inflation-busting price hikes in fuel bills. Problem: When customers switch . provider some suppliers did not always issue a refund to those still in credit . Accepted: Directors at the Big Six have agreed to make repayments after the Mail on Sunday's exposé two weeks ago. (Pictured clockwise from top left) Guy Johnson, external affairs director at npower; Tony Cocker, CEO of E.ON; William Morris, SSE managing director; Martin Lawrence, managing director of EDF Energy . A well-placed industry source said the . Big Six had conceded they needed to act and had agreed ‘in principle’ to creating a best practice across the industry to tackle the issue. The . source said that under the plans, twice yearly checks of customers’ accounts would reveal those who are paying too much. The suppliers would . then offer customers the choice of having their money back or leaving . the money in the account. The . source said: ‘Companies are looking at how to implement this. It may . not be triggered by an amount, but by how much a customer spends each . month. If an account has more than one month’s money in credit, then it . will be flagged up. Pressure: The firms have made their compromise two weeks after Mail on Sunday published an exposé . Mr Barker added: ‘I had a very frank and candid meeting with the Big Six last week; it was cards on the table time. ‘I’m . very pleased to report that we appear to have made real progress for . consumers. There’s still detail to be agreed and I will not rest until . we have scored a better deal for all energy consumers.’ Jo Ganley, an energy expert at price comparison website uSwitch.com, said suppliers need to reassure customers they won’t be sitting on their money. She said: ‘Establishing a blueprint for best practice – whereby all suppliers will review their customers’ accounts at least twice a year with a view to refunding any overpayments –  seems like a sensible solution. It means that consumers will know exactly where they stand.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? added: ‘With trust in the energy market at an all-time low, companies must quickly deliver on this commitment to promptly refund consumers who are in credit with their direct debit accounts. ‘As Which? told the Minister and the Big Six suppliers, some energy companies already automatically refund even very low credit balances, so there’s no reason why the entire industry can’t follow suit. All companies need to play fair and charge more accurately.’ Trust: Richard Lloyd, chief executive of Which?, has warned companies to deliver on their promise quickly . Research by Which? in 2012 said the energy giants enjoy a £1.2 billion surplus each year from customers who are in credit – which they are then free to invest for an annual return of up to three per cent. But industry experts said the number was closer to £2 billion. Four of the Big Six have announced price rises on dual-fuel bills. Npower is raising its bills by 10.4 per cent from next month. SSE customers will pay 8.2 per cent more from this Friday and British Gas prices go up by 9.2 per cent on November 23. Scottish Power customers will pay an extra 8.6 per cent from December 6. EDF has said it will not raise prices before January. E.ON has refused to rule out an imminent price rise. A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry trade association, said: ‘The Mail on Sunday has raised a very important issue. We are looking at this closely with our members.’ Families will be able to see how much they are paying in green taxes on their fuel bills, under new plans being considered by Ministers. A senior Whitehall source said Conservative peers were looking at amending the Energy Bill so power firms will be forced to include details of how much environmental initiatives are costing each consumer on every bill. The source said: ‘This will make green levies more transparent for customers who will be able to see how much of their bill is made up of green levies and taxes. Already pressed: Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill - even £100 in some cases'Tories in the Lords are pushing for an amendment to the Bill, which is in its final stages. 'Conservative Ministers are sympathetic but it is yet to  be agreed by the Liberal Democrats.’ Jo Ganley, an energy expert at comparison website uSwitch.com, said: ‘Telling consumers how much the additional green levies add up to would provide far greater transparency and could mean that they are  better able to judge the fairness of future price increases for themselves.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? said: ‘We have called for a clear and consumer-friendly graphic on annual energy statements to show all the costs that make up our energy bills. ‘While this would be helpful, it won’t help the millions of hard-pressed households that are worried about getting into debt or cutting back on their heating this winter. ‘Consumers need to see that the Government is delivering more radical changes. The Government must show how it is getting under control all the energy policy costs that are being added to people’s bills.’","People not always refunded credit on their account after switching provider .

Working almost 100 metres above those charged with running the country, five timekeepers worked frantically behind the scenes to ensure things ran like clockwork. They are the Keepers of the Clock and have the unique job of upholding the world's most iconic timepiece - Big Ben. And last night was the dawn of their busiest hours of the year as the clocks went back and we moved from British Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time. As millions enjoyed an extra hour in bed, Ian Westworth and his colleagues faced a five-hour mission to turn back the hands of Britain's most iconic clock . The bell was made in 1858 in East London and took two weeks to cool before being transported to the tower on a horse draw carriage . Once the arduous task of turning back the hands of Big Ben was complete the team set about changing the 2,000 clocks in Parliament which will take them until Monday . While millions of people welcomed the extra hour's lie in this morning, the five-strong team set in motion a complex, five-hour process to move the most famous hands in Britain with millisecond precision. The foursome were tasked with altering the 154-year-old, 13-and-a-half-tonne ageing timepiece, a focal point on the capital's famous skyline. If the notoriety was not enough, the keepers faced the prospect of high winds, the famous four faces being plunged into darkness, and the potential uproar were anything to happen to the priceless chime. However former soldier turned horological forerunner, Ian Westworth, was not fazed by the daunting job, which passed off smoothly. The veteran of nine years scales the 334 steps to the top of the iconic tower three times a week to carry out regular health checks, measure the pendulum's swing and keep a watchful eye on any deteriorating parts. The 51-year-old father-of-one, from Beddington in south London, sett up base for his two-day marathon shift to ensure everything went like clockwork. Pennies are used to adjust the 14.5ft pendulum’s swing, adding or taking them away to alter the time by two fifths of a second . The whole process requires painstaking precision and immense skill to ensure the hands are not wound too far, as there is no rewind mechanism . As the 9.45pm chime rung out over the capital, Mr Westworth and his team went to work, beginning the intricate process. The clock wass not heard chiming again until 2am . 'We meet up as usual and take on the foreboding staircase, there’d be no other way for us as it’s part of the romance making your way up them,' said Ian. 'And when you reach the top and move into the belfry you can hear the immense ticking. 'The beauty of the mechanics is what intrigues all of us. It runs on remarkable precision and the fact it is more than 150 years old is extraordinary.' Big Ben is the giant bell in the belfry of the clock tower, renamed Elizabeth Tower last year. It stands at adjacent to the Palace of Westminster and was cast at Whitechapel Bell Foundry in east London in April 1858. It took two weeks to cool and once it was ready, it was transported the Westminster on a horse drawn carriage. Thousands of Londoners lined the route and cheered as the bell went past. Once it was hoisted 96metres up into the tower, the finest clock-makers in the capital set about fine tuning every part of the Great Clock, finally getting it to start working at the end of May 1859. The first chimes rang through Parliament six weeks later on July 11, 1859. Former soldier, Mr Westworth, said: 'After the job is done you realise just how privileged you are. When I walk over Westminster Bridge and see the thousands of people taking pictures and waiting for the hour strike it is charming to know I am part of that' It ran uninterrupted for 57 years until the lights were turned off for two years during the First World War to prevent attack by German Zeppelins. The lights were extinguished again throughout the Second World War but the clock continued to chime despite a German bombing raid damaging two of the dials in May 1941. 'The people who built the clock were pioneers and designed something so solid it could withstand enemy attacks – most clocks can’t handle a bit of rain,” said Mr Westworth. 'The bell was cast in iron and built to last, hopefully for another 150 years.' The first time the clocks were changed coincided with WWI and during 1916 mechanics set about forcing Big Ben’s levers and cogs an hour forward on May 21. Every year since men have fought through tired eyes and tired instruments to set Britain’s watch. For some, it brings a heady . excitement that Christmas is just a few short shopping weeks away. For . others, it heralds months of doom and gloom until we see the sun again. British Summer Time officially ends this weekend when the clocks went back an hour this morning. Debating . the effects of turning the clocks back has been a British pastime for . more than a century, when the first Daylight Saving Bill was brought . before the House of Commons. During . the Second World War the Government moved the clocks forward one hour . to help munitions factories maximise productivity and allow people to . get home safely before the blackout. Between . 1968 and 1971 the Government carried out the same experiment but was . forced to end it after complaints in Scotland and northern England. Plans . have also been mooted to move to Central European Time - something that . would mean lighter winter evenings, which supporters claim would cut . road deaths, boost tourism and reduce energy use. But . the proposals have faced opposition from many in Scotland who do not . relish the prospect of an extra hour of darkness in the morning. Clocks should have been put back 60 minutes at 2am this morning as the UK reverted to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). They ensure temperatures are at an optimum level for the changeable metal parts, using heaters in winter and fans in summer to regulate it. Pennies are used to adjust the 14.5ft pendulum’s swing, adding or taking them away to alter the time by two fifths of a second. Mr Westworth joked: 'This is the most pampered clock in the world, we still follow traditional techniques to maintain it. 'It would be much more straightforward to have an electrical motor inside – but all magnificence would be lost.' He joined lead engineer Mike McCann and the rest of the team, Paul Robertson, Huw Smith and Steve White to complete the arduous task. The last chimes sounded at 9.45pm last night before the bell tolled again at 2am on Sunday. The dial lights are extinguished to allow the hands to be wound forwards without drawing too much public attention. And the hands are then advanced rapidly to midnight by releasing the escapement mechanism, which regulates the accuracy of the clock. The team took immense care to ensure the hands did not overrun, as they faced the prospect of winding the hands right round again if it had happened. In order to ensure the accuracy of the clock is not lost the pendulum is allowed to carry on its motion. Mr McCann, 51, said: 'On the Saturday we ask a specialist inspection engineer to join us, and we also arrange for scaffolding to meander through the belfry tower to allow us to reach parts that need inspecting. 'We then ring up the BBC to confirm when the bells will be stopped and restarted, as Radio 4 still broadcast Big Ben live at midnight. 'It is a job that requires unfathomable skill from our clock engineers, particularly in moving the hands forward to midnight - if they overshoot we cannot go backwards.' Between 10 and 11pm the team carried out inspections on various parts of the clock after the going train is stopped and clamped. The going train clamp was removed and the clock time adjusted to the correct time within one second. The clock ran for the next two hours without the hour or the quarter chimes, giving the team chance to check its accuracy and make any final adjustments. The Keepers of the Clock scale the tower's 334 steps three times a week to carry out maintenance checks . Mr Westworth, pictured, was joined by lead engineer Mike McCann and the rest of the team, Paul Roberson, Huw Smith and Steve White . At 1.46am, now GMT, the chime side and strike side hammers were unlocked to allow the strikes to sound the bells on the hour. Two minutes before 2am the dial lights were switched back on and moments later the bells rang out across the River Thames, completing the process for another six months. But for the team the next step was to change the 2,000 clocks inside Parliament – working through until Monday morning to make sure everything from David Cameron’s oak grandfather clock in the Prime Minister’s office to the Commons’ wall piece is reached. Mr Westworth added: 'By this time we are running very nearly on empty so we do our best not to miss any – but not doubt we’ll get a phone call on Monday morning saying we’ve missed one. 'But after the job is done you realise just how privileged you are. When I walk over Westminster Bridge and see the thousands of people taking pictures and waiting for the hour strike it is charming to know I am part of that. 'You forget the eyes of London are on you until you’re back down on the ground – and you have kept the country running on time.'","Team worked two-day marathon shift to uphold world's most iconic clock .

A doctor who was a young medical student in Dallas on the day President Kennedy was shot has described the events that he had kept quiet about for 50 years. Dr James Henry 'Red' Duke, 84, was a fourth year surgery student at Parkland Hospital in Dallas and so focused on his studies that the President being in town barely registered. 'I don't think I was hardly conscious of the fact that the president and his wife were going to be there,' he told KHOU. Moment in history: Dr Red Duke rarely speaks about the events of November 22, 1963, even though he was present with President Kennedy was admitted to hospital after being shot in Dallas . Emergency: Crowds gathered outside Parkland Hospital as Duke and his colleagues worked on President Kennedy and Governor Connally . It wasn't until a flurry of limousines and motorcycles from the President's motorcade screeched into the emergency entrance at Parkland that the official visit became real. Duke had been quietly eating his lunch at 12:36pm when the speaker system called for the hospital's chief of surgery, 'stat.' Another doctor told Duke to run with him to the emergency room because the President had been shot. Unaware of the seriousness of the President's injuries, Duke thrilled at the prospect of treating a President. Motorcade: Footage shows limos and motorbikes arriving at Parkland's emergency entrance . Fifty years later: Parkland Hospital, where President Kennedy was treated after being shot in Dallas . 'Being a typical country boy,' Duke told KHOU 'I thought, ""Golly, I'm going to get to meet a president.""' Any thoughts of shaking the President's hand were quickly forgotten when Duke entered the trauma ward and saw Kennedy's blood beginning to pool on the floor as doctors desperately tried to save his life. 'I saw these people standing there,' he told KHOU. John Wayne in scrubs: Dr Red Duke has become a well-respected and much loved figure in his native Texas . 'And I saw Mrs. Kennedy seated by the door. And her clothing was stained. And I realized that this was not a good deal.' 'I right quick recognized that this was a fatal injury,' Duke recalls. He knew that it was futile to attempt to aid the doctors who were working on the dying President. 'I have no idea what I said, but they said, ""Well, there's a guy across the hall needs some help,""' he said. The young surgeon crossed the hall and found a man with a severe chest wound. 'Functioning in this kind of situation, I think we develop the ability to just get focused in on the problem,' he told KHOU. 'You don't care who it is or what it is. You just try to identify the problem and do the things that need to be done to achieve your goal.; . Duke began prepping the man for surgery, only dimly noticing that the man he was treating was Governor John Connally. According to KHOU, Duke had plans to take his wife to the opera on November 22, 1963, but they never made it. In fact, Duke didn't return home for several days, staying by Connally's bedside as the President's state funeral took place, and Lee Harvey Osward was shot. Duke's wife told him later that the couple's then-three-year-old daughter said grace at the table before dinner. She said, 'The world is dark and we are very sad.' That a three-year-old could intuit the sombre mood surrounding the events and describe it so precisely shocks Duke to this day. But for the respected surgeon, the dark, sad day is one he prefers not to speak about, even 50 years later. Fateful day: Just hours after this photograph was taken, Dr Red Duke received John F Kennedy into the emergency room and knew the President had been fatally injured . Moment of truth: Young medical student Dr Duke treated Governor John Connally when he first arrived at the hospital after being shot in the chest . Since those events, Red Duke has become a well-respected and much-loved Houston surgeon. He's been referred to as 'John Wayne in scrubs,' and ran a nationally-syndicated television spot called 'Dr Red Duke's Health Reports' for 15 years. He was also instrumental in introducing Houston's Life Flight medical transport service to Houston, Texas. According to Your Houston News, Dr Duke still works 12-hour days saving lives at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. To this day, Duke finds it difficult to believe his role in the day the nation stopped. For years, he didn't talk about it. And for all the years of medical practice, in an office cluttered with mementoes and souvenirs, he has nothing to commemorate that day. He doesn't need anything to remember it by - the events of November 22 1963 are indelibly etched on his memory. 'It's so surreal that it doesn't make sense. It's like an out-of-body experience. But I was there,  I did all that stuff,' he said.","Surgeon Dr 'Red' Duke was on duty when President Kennedy was admitted to Parkland Hospital in Dallas .

The cross-country custody battle between Olympic gold medalist Bode Miller and his ex-Sara McKenna became so bitter that the skier decided to change the name she gave their child at birth - without her permission. That is just one of the revelations to come out of the New York City Family Court over the past two weeks as proceedings started today that could ultimately swing custody back to 27-year-old McKenna. Despite McKenna registering her son under his father's given name, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, the champion skier pointedly got permission from a Californian court to add Nathaniel as his middle name and now calls him Nate, instead of Sam, his birth name. Custody battle: Olympic alpine skier Bode Miller arrives with his son at Manhattan's Family Court in New York, today as the child's mother Sara McKenna arrives too . Husband and wife: Olympic alpine skier Bode Miller arrives with his wife Morgan and his son at Manhattan's Family Court in New York, November 25, 2013 . Miller has been locked in a custody dispute with his former lover since their son was born in February - a child McKenna claims he tried to make her abort. Born to McKenna in New York, the boy, now nine-months-old was transferred back to the custody of Miller, 36, in California because a New York Family Court referee called her 'irresponsible' and 'reprehensible' for moving to Manhattan when she was seven months pregnant. Miller's attorney's successfully argued that McKenna left California to get a more sympathetic hearing for herself to gain custody. He asked her to return to California, but she refused. However, when the New York court found in his favor, Miller's son was returned to him in May. However, the ruling raised serious questions about the rights of mothers-to-be and on November 14, the New York Family Court overturned the May ruling and and will begin a re-examination of who will gain custody of the child. Indeed, women's rights advocates became enraged at the court's decision in May, calling it a threat to the rights of pregnant women to make decisions over their own lives - regardless of the rights of the father. Olympic skier Miller fathered the child with Sara McKenna after the couple met on a dating webisite . Loss: Bode Miller, with wife and volleyball star Morgan Beck. The couple had a miscarriage in January . 'Especially with current political pressures to recognize separate legal rights for fetuses, there will be increasing calls on the courts to fault a pregnant woman for moving, to restrain women from living their lives because they’re pregnant,' said Sarah E. Burns, the head of the Reproductive Justice Clinic at the New York University law school to the New York Times. McKenna, a former marine, had previously claimed that the skier had suggested she have an abortion. according to the New York Daily News. When she first told Miller of the pregnancy, he texted her: 'U are going to do this on your own.' The 36-year-old skier later pushed for joint custody, and a judge ruled that McKenna must return to California for the case, forcing her to give up her studies at Columbia University in New York. A family court referee at an earlier hearing had described McKenna as 'reprehensible' for moving to New York while pregnant. Fling: McKenna, left and right, dated Bode Miller for 3 . months in 2012 when she lived in San Diego . After a short fling with Miller, the former Marine had moved to New York to study at Columbia under the GI Bill. The 27-year-old has applied for temporary custody of the baby, which she named Samuel. She claimed that when the couple met through a dating website, Miller had said he wanted a large family with her. McKenna revealed the couple had sex only twice - and that Miller failed to use protection as he assumed she was ready to get pregnant, she said. 'You have to agree to have four of my babies,' Miller had texted McKenna, she told the New York Daily News. After they met in California, they went their separate ways, and she said he was reluctant to continue a relationship because he wanted a large family, and she did not. But a few weeks later, they arranged to meet in Florida - and a second tryst led to her becoming pregnant with Samuel. 'He never offered to use a condom,' McKenna said. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.' While pregnant, she moved to New York - and Miller, who has five Olympic medals, married volleyball player Morgan Beck. Baby Bode: McKenna discovered she was pregnant after a short relationship with Miller . Beck and Miller married in October 2012 and announced they were expecting a child, but Beck had a miscarriage in January. Days after the devastating news, Miller filed court documents to gain joint custody of his son with McKenna. Miller sought to force a judge to get McKenna to move back to California, so he could have a relationship with the child. He also sought to have the boy's last name changed to Miller on his birth certificate. At a hearing earlier this year, the lawyer representing McKenna said it is too late for Miller to try to seek joint custody. 'If you look at the texts [messages] from Bode Miller to my client, he wanted nothing to do with the baby,' attorney Kenneth Eiges said. Her lawyer also defended his client's decision to live in New York saying it was 'her right'.","Bode Miller and his ex-Sara McKenna appeared in court today in the latest round of their bitter custody battle over their nine-month-old son .

Advisor: The disclosure comes just days after Mr Campbell revealed that he is considering standing for Parliament . Tony Blair was last night accused of helping to secure a plum job for Alastair Campbell’s firm on a ‘dictator’s payroll’. The claim was made after US Government documents revealed the extent of links between the former Prime Minister and the lobbying company that employs his former spin doctor. According to US Justice Department papers, the authoritarian Kazakhstan regime in central Asia is represented in the US ‘through Windrush Ventures Limited, through Portland PR Limited’. The entry appears to indicate that Mr Blair, whose multi-million- pound earnings are channelled into Windrush, secured the contract in Washington for Portland,  a public relations firm for which Mr Campbell acts as an adviser. Mr Blair has always denied receiving money to ‘whitewash’ Kazakhstan’s human rights record, insisting that he has been advising on political reforms to ‘make a difference’ to the country and ‘is not personally making a profit’. However, the US document appears to confirm suspicions that Mr Blair has used his connection with its ruler, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to broker a lucrative deal for his former aide. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘This appears to confirm what we have long suspected: that Blair has been directly involved in securing plum jobs for his cronies.’ The disclosure comes just days after Mr Campbell revealed that he is considering standing for Parliament and that he will advise Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 Election. The former Downing Street communications chief has been spotted in the oil-rich state, which has been ruled for more than two decades by Mr Nazarbayev – a Soviet-era hardman whose regime has been criticised for serious human rights abuses. According to the Justice Department document, the Windrush/Portland arrangement was registered with the US Government in September 2011. Sources said that such a deal was likely to be worth millions of pounds a year. Portland said: ‘We provide communications support for the government of Kazakhstan. It is mentioned on our own website, as is the fact that Alastair Campbell is one of our advisers.’ A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘We don’t lobby but we do carry out work on social and economic reform in Kazakhstan.’ Close: Tony Blair pictured with President Nazarbayev when he was still Prime Minister, he denies that he has received money to 'whitewash' Kazakhstan's human rights record .","US government documents have revealed the extent of links between the former PM and lobbying group which employs his former spin doctor .

It was announced today that Apple snapped up the Israeli company for around $350million dollars. A representative for PrimseSense confirmed the deal, but so far Apple has been mum on their plans for the acquisition. Movement: Apple confirmed Monday the purchase of Israeli company PrimeSense, which has been an innovator in motion-sensor technology . 'Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,' an Apple spokesman said. PrimeSense is perhaps best known for setting the ground work for the motion sensors in Microsoft's Kinect gaming device. The acquisition wasn't exactly a secret.

The company started by the Google founder's ex-wife has been ordered to stop selling their at-home genetic testing kits because the FDA says they are not backed by science. Sergey Brin's wife Anne Wojcicki launched the company, called 23andMe, in 2006 and the Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Ms Wojcicki on Friday. This step comes after many rounds of back-and-forth between the FDA and 23andMe, not to mention a personally difficult year for Ms Wojcicki after she and her husband split following the revelation that he was said to be having a relationship with a 27-year-old Google employee. Better times: In August Sergey Brin's spokesman announced the Google founder had separated from his wife Anne Wojcicki (right) and now her company has been ordered to stop sales of their at-home genetic tests . 'However, even after these many interactions with 23andMe, we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated the (Personal Genome Service) for its intended uses, which have expanded from the uses that the firm identified in its submissions,' the FDA wrote in its letter, listing multiple instances where they did not respond to calls for clarification. The FDA's letter is demanding that the company 'discontinue marketing the PGS until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization for the device'. The personal testing kits retail for only $99, and though it is meant to give peace of mind for a small price, the federal agency asserts that it could be ineffective. The concern at the FDA comes from the fact that the device claims to identify more than 250 diseases and conditions, but the agency asserts that the scientific research does not back up the company's claims. 'For instance, if the BRCA-related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive, it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, intensive screening, or other morbidity-inducing actions, while a false negative could result in a failure to recognize an actual risk that may exist,' the FDA wrote in the letter posted online. Dangerous conclusions: The FDA asserts that the research behind 23andMe tests is not solid enough and may cause people the believe false negatives and avoid seeking treatment . Wojcicki started the DNA testing venture in 2006, one year before she and Brin got married. The company has raised $68million in venture capital, has 70 employees and nearly 150,000 paying members. Ms Wojcicki studied biology as an undergraduate at Yale and then went on to manage healthcare investments and biotechnology funding. 'From her vantage point, Anne saw a need for creating a way to generate more information - especially more personalized information - so that commercial and academic researchers could better understand and develop new drugs and diagnostics,' the company's website reads. The 40-year-old has two children with her husband Sergey Brin- a nearly 5-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter. Brin was one of the early investors, underwrote the costs for creating and testing the company's research on Parkinson's disease as his mother suffers from the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. In August, Sergey Brin's spokesperson confirmed that he and Ms Wojcicki had been living apart for several months. Other woman? After the separation, Brin (right, seen at an event with Dian von Furstenberg) appeared publicly with Amanda Rosenberg (left), a 27-year-old Google employee who he is said to have started a relationship with . Since their separation was made public, more information has emerged about the Silicon Valley titan's new paramour, the British-born Amanda Rosenberg, 27, who left London in search of fame and fortune with Google. There is no suggestion that the pair became an item before Mr Brin’s separation from Ms Wojcicki. Google has been rocked by talk of the romance, and a spokesman yesterday confirmed that Brin – one of the world’s richest men with a $22.8billion fortune – has for several months been living apart from his wife of six years, the mother of his two children. If they divorce, Californian law suggests their massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement.","23andMe is an at-home test that claims to be able to identify whether or not the tester has the genetic disposition for 250 different diseases .

Block: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is refusing to give the guidelines the official sign-off from government . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is blocking controversial guidance which would allow teenagers to stockpile the morning-after pill, it has emerged. NICE, the NHS rationing body, wants to issue advice to GPs and chemists to give all women access to ‘advance provision’ of emergency contraception. Critics say the move could fuel promiscuity and also lead to a rise in sexually-transmitted infections - because the pill is only taken after unprotected sex. These concerns are understood to be shared at the highest level in the Department of Health. Now Mr Hunt is refusing to give the guidelines the official sign-off from government. The advice has been on his desk since spring but he has not yet given it the go-ahead over concerns that NICE has not provided any evidence that the move would bring down unwanted pregnancies. It is not known whether Mr Hunt will actually block the guidance, or whether he will allow it to be published but make it clear that he does not want the Health Service to comply. A Whitehall source said: ‘NICE produced no evidence that this would reduce unwanted pregnancies. There are real worries it would lead to increased rates of sexually-transmitted diseases.’ The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence first recommended in draft guidance brought out three years ago that teenage girls and young women should be given the morning-after pill to keep at home in case they need it. It took the controversial decision despite the fact there is no evidence that advance access to emergency contraception brings down pregnancy rates. Concerns: Critics say the move could fuel promiscuity and also lead to a rise in sexually-transmitted infections (picture posed by models) NICE said that under-25s should be able to get emergency contraception in advance in a range of high-street pharmacies. It is not current common practice for the morning-after pill to be given out for young women to store at home. The draft guidance sparked outrage that the regulator wants to see increased spending on contraception at the same time as wanting to deny hundreds of cancer sufferers drugs that could potentially save their lives. It will only become official guidance if Mr Hunt gives it the green light. Last month an expert warned that letting women keep stocks of the morning-after pill will not cut unwanted pregnancies or abortions. Professor James Trussell, from Princeton University in the US, said: ‘I don’t think it’s a strategy that is going to lead to a reduction in unintended pregnancies or abortions.’ He also warned that there is also evidence to show the guidelines make women more inclined to have unprotected sex - as they come to regard the morning-after pill as a safety net. Fear: There is no evidence that advance access to emergency contraception brings down pregnancy rates (file picture) The draft NICE guidance, issued in 2010, says doctors, nurses and pharmacies should ‘ensure all young women are able to obtain free emergency hormonal contraception, including advance provision’. The guidance was issued despite the fact that, earlier in the year, the respected Cochrane Library concluded women with advance supplies of emergency contraception fare no better than those without early access. NICE is supposed to make its decisions on what should be funded on the NHS by weighing up the evidence. At the time, Norman Wells, of Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘The draft guidance is clearly more interested in getting young people to use contraception than it is in discouraging them from engaging in sexual activity in the first place. ‘Confidential contraceptive schemes are simply giving children under the age of consent the green light to experiment sexually. The result is more schoolgirl mums, and spiralling rates of sexually transmitted infections.’ Last night Josephine Quintavalle, from the pressure group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, described NICE’s draft guidance as ‘appalling’. ‘It’s an entirely new interpretation of emergency,’ she said. ‘The idea was that this pill was to be taken in an emergency, but if you can just have it in the cupboard - how is that an emergency? ‘It is not clear whether this works as a contraceptive or an abortive agent. Whatever, it’s a serious drug - and that’s worrying for young girls because it’s an adult drug and not necessarily appropriate for teenagers. ‘Women will think I have this pill so I am protected, but that doesn’t protect against sexually-transmitted disease. The UK does not have a good record on that.’ She welcomed Mr Hunt’s stance. ‘It would be helpful if he came out and made a loud and clear statement that this is not good medical practice,’ she said.","NICE wants to issue advice to GPs to give all women advance access .

"By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 07:34 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:13 EST, 9 November 2013 . Measles cases in a region hit by an epidemic less than four months ago have tripled in the last fortnight. There are now 36 cases of measles in south Wales, up from 13 just two weeks ago, as children from four schools have reported symptoms. Doctors are urging parents to properly vaccinate their children after fears of a second epidemic in Swansea have spread. Cases of measles at four schools in south Wales have tripled in two weeks after doctors warned that two million children across the UK have not had an MMR jab . Despite an uptake of MMR vaccinations during the outbreak which killed one and infected 1,200 last November, health chiefs warned that 30,000 children aged 10-18 are still unprotected. In April Dr Helen Bedford, of University College London’s Institute of Child Health, warned that two million children across the UK are still unvaccinated, while figures showed 81 per cent of children in London had no protection from the disease. Figured from Public Health England revealed that there are 300,000 children without an MMR jab that are being targetted by a new catchup campaign. Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was 'very frustrated' that a significant number of young people had been given the first dose of an MMR vaccine, but had failed to follow it up with a booster shot within one month. Parents are being urged to make sure their children have been given two MMR jabs to fully protect against the viral disease . It continued to stress that two doses of the vaccination was the only way to protect against the outbreak. Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW consultant in communicable disease control, said: 'Parents and young people should not underestimate how serious measles can be and how quickly it can spread. 'In a school setting, one child with measles sitting in a classroom for just one hour will lead to at least 70% of other pupils who are not vaccinated catching measles. 'To prevent this outbreak from spreading even further, it's crucial that unvaccinated children and young people receive two doses of MMR urgently and that those with symptoms do not attend school.' Cases of measles have steadily risen since a now-discredited report by Andrew Wakefield claimed autism was linked to the MMR jab in the late 90s. The outbreak in 2012 lasted for more than eight months and sparked a massive vaccination programme. Dr Hoffmann added: 'Parents who have decided not to vaccinate their children are not only risking their children's health, but are putting other children at risk, children either too young to be vaccinated or with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated. 'We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year and we are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. A now-discredited report by Andrew Wakefield (pictured centre) in the late 90s linked the MMR injection with autism and scared many parents off vaccinating their children . 'The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine.' Adults who have either never had the disease or work in close contact with children are being encourage to speak to their GP about getting vaccinated as well. Dr Richard Pebody of Public Health England said: 'It is important to remember that measles is highly infectious and spreads easily in the classroom. 'Children who are fully vaccinated with MMR help to stop the spread of measles and therefore to protect their friends and families. 'This protection is particularly important for those who have health problems such as weakened immune systems and who cannot be vaccinated but are at most risk if exposed to the disease. 'Those who have not received a dose of the MMR vaccine should contact their GP urgently. After the second dose individuals achieve almost complete protection.' Measles is an airborne viral infection picked up after inhaling or touching droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Children aged between one and four are the most vulnerable, and the infection can lead to blindness and even death. The symptoms include fever, sensitivity to light, red eyes, and greyish white spots near the mouth and throat. A red-brown spotty rash also develops around the ears and can spread around the head and neck before going to the legs and the rest of the body.","Cases at four Welsh schools rise from 13 to 36 in two weeks .

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 09:35 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:06 EST, 17 October 2013 . One month after losing the New York mayoral primary, GQ magazine has published the closest thing to a heartfelt apology from Anthony Weiner. Weiner's chances at becoming mayor were shot on July 23, when 23-year-old Sydney Leathers released graphic pictures and 'sexts' from married Weiner sent after he stepped down from Congress in 2011 for a similar scandal. Weiner was then, as he is now, married to long-time Hillary Clinton-aide Huma Abdein. The two have a child together, 20-month-old Jordan. While Weiner has apologized for his behavior before, it wasn't until the interview conducted after the race that he seems to finally realize the pain he heaped on Huma, describing himself as an 'empty soulless vessel'. Hindsight: In this month's GQ, Anthony Weiner gives a candid post-election interview finally giving an emotional apology for the pain he's caused wife Huma Abedin. Above, Weiner conceded the mayoral primary last month . Unlike in 2011, Weiner decided to stick out the race and a few days later, reporter Marshall sella started following Weiner on the campaign trail - becoming a witness to his demise. During his time with Weiner, the candidate continued to heap blame back on the handling of the scandal, saying that if it weren't for the internet he might have had a shot at winning the whole race. 'Maybe if the internet didn't exist? Like if I was running in 1955? I'd probably get elected mayor,' he said. Sore loser: A defeated Weiner shown flipping off reporters while leaving his 'victory party' at Connolly's Pub . But the tone of the story changed a week after losing the election, when Weiner finally opened up and expressed his remorse for hurting wife Huma Abedin, while still maintaining that his sexting was 'meaningless'. Weiner explained, that to him, sexting women like Leathers was like playing a video game. 'You ask about the higher meaning of sexting, but it was remarkably meaningless. It was almost like a video game you played in that didn't have much connection to reality.' To further illustrate the point, Weiner mimuics typing on a keyboard: 'Clicky clicky clicky - send! Clicky Clicky send. The intellectual part of my brain was saying, ""Why was this so bad?""' Together: After the second sexting scandal emerged in July, Weiner's wife Huma Abedin continued to stand by her man by saying she forgave him at a press conference . Weiner stepped down from Congress in 2011 after accidentally tweeting a lude picture of himself. His past came back to haunt him in July when sexting partner Sydney Leathers, above, released more pictures and texts from the candidate . While he may not have been thinking about it at the time, Weiner now recognizes that those actions impacted his wife. 'This weird synapse in my mind fired in a different direction, and I realized ""Wait a minute. It's not very significant to me. But it's significant to Huma. It doesn't really matter what I think about it. It kinda matters, the impact it's having on her."" And that switch going off made the game no longer interesting. It wasn't like playing Madden! It wasn't like playing an online role-playing game.' Second chances: While the two haven't been pictured together since Weiner's primary loss, they are reportedly still living together in their Central Park South apartment . Despite the hurt he caused her, wife Huma has seemingly stood by her husband this second scandal and even after losing the election - despite rumors that she has been told to dump him if she wants to work on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. 'We've had a very rough time,' Weiner said. 'It causes me a great deal of pain in the way she gets reported and the way she gets discussed. Her treatment in the press has been rough. It pains me because I deserve it. She doesn't. 'I duck it as best as I can. But her reputation has come the Woman Who Married an Idiot and Stuck with Him. More of it rolls of my back, because that's the way I am constitutionally. She's more sensitive. I'm just an empty soulless vessel, so it doesn't hurt me as much.' Still, Weiner wouldn't directly answer the question of whether or not the two would be sticking together after his second betrayal, brushing off the question with a critique of the media's curiosity about his personal life. Stay-at-home-dad: Since losing the race with . only 5 per cent of the vote, Weiner has returned to his role as dutiful . dad - escorting son Jordan to the park . Lost: Weiner told GQ that if it weren't for the internet, he probably would have been elected mayor . 'She'd stay with me if I broke twenty points! And actually if I made the runoff, she'd recommit the vows, in a Hawaii vacation. If I won, she'd have a second child with me! I don't know how people think,' he said. Sella ends the conversation by asking Weiner if he would still run for mayor, if given the opportunity to go back and do it all over again. While Weiner defended his run throughout the race, after losing he makes a more realistic statement. 'If I could go back? If you tell me I'm gonna get 5 per cent, you tell me how I'd answer that question. The process I went through to decide to run was the right one; the way I talked about sexting was...not right.'","In GQ's latest story on Anthony Weiner, the former-New York City mayoral candidate said he might have won the race if it weren't for the internet .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 04:47 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:28 EST, 17 October 2013 . A secretive New York financier is expected to be one of the biggest winners when Twitter goes public in the coming weeks. Suhail Rizvi, 47, guards his secrecy so zealously that he employs a person to take down his Wikipedia entry and scrub his picture from the Internet. Over the past two years the founder of New York private equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management, has quietly amassed a stake of more than 15 percent in the microblogging phenomenon for himself and his investors at a cost of more than $1 billion, according to three people with knowledge of his investments. Ambitions: Twitter is getting ready for its public market debut . While Rizvi was known to be an investor in Twitter, the extent of his involvement had not previously been reported. Twitter made its IPO registration documents public late Thursday, setting the stage for the most closely watched initial public offering since Facebook's in 2012. Rizvi Traverse is listed as one of the institutional shareholders with at least a 5 percent ownership stake, but no further details were disclosed. The shares Rizvi purchased were distributed among investors via multiple vehicles, sources said, and the size of his personal stake is not known. People with direct knowledge of his investment activities say that Rizvi, backed by Chris Sacca, a former Google executive and Twitter investor, was instrumental in attracting large private investors to the microblogging site, serving as matchmaker between the company's founders and global financiers from Wall Street to Riyadh. Rizvi declined to comment for this article. Sacca, a longtime friend, gave him an entree into tech investing in 2011 - when Twitter was still struggling to make money. From there, Rizvi scored stakes in some of the most sought-after Internet start-ups, from Facebook Inc before it went public to Square and Flipboard. Rizvi's string of tech deals came amid intense competition among hedge funds and private equity investors to secure shares in startups, highlighted by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner's 2009 investment in Facebook. With tech companies waiting later than ever to go public, some investors believed they may miss out on the biggest gains if they wait to buy shares in public markets, when a company's value may no longer rise exponentially. Rizvi helped Hugh Hefner, right, take Playboy Enterprises private and bought and then sold the Hollywood film studio behind the 'Twilight' series, left . The son of an Iowa psychology professor, Rizvi has networked with rich and powerful people including Queen Noor of Jordan and Google Inc's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, devising financing schemes that leveraged his access to deep-pocketed investors, according to people who know Rizvi. Those who invest with Rizvi include British billionaire Richard Branson and Jeffrey Skoll, the former eBay executive and film producer, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It is not clear whether they are among the investors he brought into Twitter. Before turning his attention to the Internet, Rizvi's deal-making focused on Hollywood. He helped Hugh Hefner take Playboy Enterprises private; bought and then sold the Hollywood film studio behind the 'Twilight' series; and led the buyout of a leading talent agency, International Creative Management (ICM). Rizvi is not alone among entertainment investors who have turned their focus to Silicon Valley. Former News Corp executive Peter Chernin's Chernin Group has invested in Tumblr, Pandora and Flipboard, while Michael Ovitz, the talent agent and former Disney CEO, has invested in Ron Conway's SV Angel funds, the tech incubator Y Combinator and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. But few have operated on the scale of Rizvi. Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman . Men behind the machine: Biz Stone (left) and Evan Williams (right) helped Dorsey launch the company . Twitter has a policy of restricting outside investors to only a handful, but Rizvi has had more freedom to bring in additional investors since he bought a large slice of the company. 'He's not to be underestimated. His approach to traditional media as well as technology has put him in a great position,' said Jeremy Zimmer, chief executive of United Talent Agency, a competitor of ICM. 'His ICM investment was viable and gave him a seat at the table and a chance to make a sound investment in Twitter.' In late 2010, Sacca approached Rizvi with an offer: Sacca's friend Evan Williams had stepped down as CEO of Twitter and was seeking to sell 10 percent of the company. Rizvi soon snapped up the shares for $340 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Following that first transaction, the two men formed a highly efficient tag team, the sources said. Sacca would seek shareholders who wanted to cash out, while Rizvi helped raise money to purchase the stock. The friends successfully pitched JPMorgan Chase & Co on a deal to buy more than $400 million worth of Twitter shares in 2011. Months later, Rizvi recruited Kingdom Holding Co, Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investment company, to buy an additional $300 million in stock in a separate vehicle. JPMorgan Chase and representatives for Alwaleed did not respond to requests for comment on the deal. By mid-2013, investment vehicles managed by Rizvi and Sacca had collectively bought more than $1 billion in shares, a stake that at one point amounted to nearly 20 percent of Twitter before it was diluted in recent months, sources said. Twitter declined to comment. Rizvi's Twitter connections opened the doors to other investing opportunities. Last year, Rizvi led a $200 million investment in Square, the mobile-payment processing company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, at a $3.25 billion valuation. On September 24, Rizvi led a $50 million financing round for the news reader app Flipboard, whose founder, Mike McCue, once sat on Twitter's board. But he has not always got his way in Silicon Valley. Although Rizvi indirectly owns some shares of Pinterest, he failed to purchase a significant stake when the online scrapboard site raised $100 million in 2012 and $200 million this year . Although Rizvi indirectly owns some shares of Pinterest, Rizvi failed to purchase a significant stake when the online scrapboard site raised $100 million in 2012 and $200 million this year. It was unclear what stymied his attempts. 'He fought tooth and nail for an allocation' but failed, an angel investor in Pinterest recalled. 'He was willing to pay.' It also remains unclear whether Rizvi's Internet investments other than Twitter will pan out. Some industry insiders note that he missed out on the huge gains that were made with very early investments in social media, and companies including Square and Flipboard remain unproven. Rizvi was able to buy only $100 million in Facebook shortly before its IPO, thus limiting his returns, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Rizvi, who owns a sprawling three-home compound in Greenwich, Connecticut, and a 1.65-acre Palm Beach, Florida, estate near Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg, was born in India but moved to Iowa Falls, a town of 5,200 people, when he was five. Along with his older brother Ashraf, a hedge fund manager, Rizvi graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school. Both now serve on the undergraduate school's executive board. Rizvi worked as a real estate analyst while at Wharton, then he started and sold a telecom company. With the proceeds, he financed his first big buyout in 1995, when he bought the electronic manufacturing business of a Puerto Rico phone company. Growth by numbers: The company has only been in existence for seven years but has clearly made a dent . Refocusing it on making higher-cost equipment, he spent the next four years boosting the company's annual revenue from $10 million to $450 million. He did not break into the elite circles of media investing until 2004, after he founded Rizvi Traverse with John Giampetroni, a New York private equity investor. In 2005 the ICM talent agency, which represented stars like Mel Gibson and Robert Redford, was looking for financing as it struggled with the defection of key agents and stars. Rizvi took a controlling stake in ICM for $100 million, including $95 million in debt financing from Merrill Lynch & Co, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. Rizvi Traverse put up just $5 million. Later, he refinanced the agency for $300 million against future revenue from assets like 'Friends,' the popular show in which ICM holds a stake. That $300 million was enough to repay Merrill Lynch and provide a hefty return for Rizvi and his partners. Even as Rizvi's circles have broadened, he has continued to keep a low profile, both in his personal style - sometimes flying commercial, one Hollywood executive said - and in his hands-off approach to tech investing. Despite bringing capital, he has not taken a board seat at Twitter, Square or Flipboard. Rizvi's trusted lieutenant, Ben Kohn, has instead been the face of the firm on the West Coast, several entertainment industry executives said. Known for an aggressive negotiating style that contrasts with Rizvi's more reserved stance, Kohn manages a dozen employees out of a small office in Los Angeles. Rizvi's growing network includes the likes of Vivi Nevo, the secretive Time Warner Inc shareholder who also famously prided himself on being 'UnGoogleable,' mutual friends of the two men said. But while Nevo is now easy to find online, Rizvi maintains an elusive Web presence. The only readily found picture of Rizvi is a snapshot of him sitting with Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and Alwaleed in a New York hotel after the prince bought Twitter shares. The photo, on a Saudi news outlet, had irked Twitter executives and Rizvi, as they had preferred to keep the transaction quiet. Twitter was created back in March 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day.

If any parent was ever in two minds about letting their teenager use Facebook, their reservations may be about to increase as Facebook has allowed young people make posts public. This means anyone on the social network will be able to see the posts, click through to the young user's profile and see any other publicly shared information. By adding this option to users aged between 13 and 17 it also means they can let strangers 'follow' their public posts. The privacy for Facebook posts by users aged between 13 and 17 were previously restricted to Friends of Friends, but can now be made visible to anyone. Public posts can also be 'followed' by strangers . Facebook faced a backlash from users and privacy campaigners earlier this week after announcing it was changing its privacy settings for adult users. Facebook previously let people hide their profiles in search results using the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' setting, but the social networking site is retiring this feature. The option was removed from the accounts of people who hadn't enabled it last year, and Facebook has announced it is removing the feature from everyone else's accounts starting from now. If a friend then interacts with the post - either by liking or commenting on it - the status appears on that friend's news feed - making it visible to even more people. Before the update Facebook prevented under 18s making posts public; the widest audience they could reach was Friends of Friends. In a blog post, Facebook said: 'Teens are among the savviest people . using social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, . or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard. 'So, starting . today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post . publicly on Facebook.

The blog continues: 'In addition, teens will be able to turn . on Follow so that their public posts can be seen in people's News Feeds. As always, followers can only see posts they are in the audience for.' Before a post is made public, . Facebook said it will display a warning message to remind users what . posting publicly means and to make sure they understand the . consequences before posting. Before a post is made public Facebook has said it will display a warning message, pictured, to remind users what posting publicly means. The site adds it takes the safety of its young users 'very seriously' As Facebook explains: 'We take the safety of teens very seriously, so they will see an extra reminder before they can share publicly.' Facebook allows people aged 13 and over to sign up to the site, but new users only need to put in their date of birth to confirm their age - the company does not verify the information. Commenting on the news, Jeffrey . Chester, executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy in the . U.S said: 'Facebook is claiming they are giving [parents and teens] more . options to protect their privacy. But in reality, they are making a . teen's information more accessible.' He continued the announcement 'actually removes a safeguard that teens currently have.' However, a spokesman from the National Crime Agency said: 'It's important that children and young people manage understand the consequences of what they share online, especially with anything that is available publicly.

After spending yesterday evening in the company of the literary world's biggest names, the Duchess of Cornwall's week took on an earthier tone as she arrived at a harvest festival today. The duchess was the guest of honour at Westminster Abbey's autumn celebrations and despite the inclement weather, appeared in good spirits as she arrived at the cathedral. Resplendent in a royal blue collarless coat, a matching hat and an exquisite pair of weighty pearl earrings, the duchess was greeted by the Dean of Westminster, John Hall, on the abbey steps before being ushered inside. Radiant: Camilla appeared to be in good spirits as she mingled with the crowds on a rainy day in central London . Greeting: The duchess was met by John Hall, the Dean of Westminster, on the abbey steps ahead of the service . Before making her way into the UNESCO listed abbey, Camilla spent a few moments chatting with the assembled crowd and was presented with a stunning bouquet made up of autumnal orange roses and crimson rosehips. Later, she was shown a pair of enormous Shire horses, their black manes entwined with gaily green and red ribbons, and obligingly gave one a pat on the nose. It was all a far cry from last night's engagement, which saw the duchess take centre stage at London's Guildhall during the presentation of the Man Booker prize. Elegant in a black velvet gown and diamond earrings, she presented 28-year-old author Eleanor Catton - the youngest winner ever - with the prestigious prize for her novel The Luminaries. Good spirits: The Duchess of Cornwall even had a smile for the waiting press pack as she arrived at the abbey . New friends: The duchess obligingly stopped to give a pair of gargantuan Shire horses a friendly pat . In a speech made ahead of the prize giving, the duchess, who is known to be an avid reader, said: 'The whole point of this prize is not just to reward the masters of well-honed prose, but to celebrate the astonishing and intoxicating breadth, depth and beauty of the written word. 'I get as much pleasure reading to my grandchildren as I do getting lost in my own favourite writers. 'The power of great literature is immense, a key to other kingdoms, an escape from the dull and mundane. And many will discover this great and lifelong pleasure thanks to the Man Booker Prize.' Despite arriving home late, Camilla was up early this morning for a private meeting with Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, during which the pair discussed the problem of falling literacy rates, according to Clarence House. During the meeting, the duchess and Princess Laurentien, who is the wife of King Willem-Alexander's younger brother, Prince Constantijn, appeared to enjoy each other's company and chatted happily.

The small-town prosecutor who sparked a national firestorm by dismissing rape charges against two popular athletes in Maryville, Missouri, is reopening the case and asking for a special investigator to review the evidence again. Robert Rice, who has been widely criticized for dismissing charges in the alleged sexual assault of Daisy Coleman and Paige Parkhurst, announced Wednesday that he would ask for a new prosecutor to re-examine the case. The national spotlight appears to be taking its toll on the city of 12,000. At the end of the prosecutor's news conference, a woman claiming to be the mother of one of the suspects - Matthew Barnett - grabbed the microphone and said threats against her son and her family 'must stop.' Rice also vehemently denied that small-town politics influenced his initial handling of the case. Barnett is from a prominent family in Maryville and his grandfather was a longtime State Representative. On the defensive: Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice said he would ask for a special prosecutor to be appointed to look into the rape case . Victim: Daisy Coleman (right) was found by her mother Melinda (left) after she was allegedly raped by a boy from her high school. Charges against him were dropped . Renewed questions: Missouri's lieutenant governor has called for a grand jury to review the case after sexual assault charges were dropped against Matthew Barnett, sparking online furore . Daisy and Paige, who have both spoken out publicly, were just 14 and 13 in January 2012 when they sneaked out of Daisy's house to attend a party with several older athletes from Maryville High School. The teens allege they were both heavily intoxicated when Barnett, then 17, had sex with Daisy while she was passed out. They then allegedly dumped Daisy, who was passed out drunk, on her front porch in 22-degree weather. Barnett, a friend who allegedly recorded the sexual encounter, and a 15-year-old boy were all arrested in the case. Rice dropped all charges just a few weeks later, citing a lack of evidence. Barnett, now a student at Southern Missouri State University, acknowledges that he had sex with the 14-year-old, but maintains it was consensual. The Colemans, who were outsiders in tight-knit Maryville, say they suffered constant threats and Daisy was subjected to relentless cyber-bully. Mrs Coleman said she had no choice by the flee town. Months after moving away from Maryville, their house - which was for sale - burned down. The cause of the fire remains 'undetermined,' but Mrs Coleman is suspicious that it could be connect the the rape case. The charred remains of the fire-damaged home of Melinda Coleman and her children earlier this month. The cause of the fire could not be determined . On Wednesday, following heavy pressure from the national news media - as well as Missouri's Lieutenant Governor - Rice re-opened the case. Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder had earlier today released a statement saying that recent reports of the alleged sexual assault 'raise all kinds of questions that it is now clear won’t be put to rest.' Rice said he would ask the county's chief judge to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the case. The prosecutor would be from outside the county and would, in theory at least, be free from the perception of local biases. Rice claimed that recent media interviews showed that the Coleman family now wants to cooperate with the investigation. Mrs Coleman denies claims that she didn't cooperate fully with investigators. Barnett, 19, was initially charged with sexual assault and endangering a child's welfare as one of three teenagers who took part in a night of alleged assaults. Barnett's friend was charged with recording at least a part of the incident on an iPhone. Two months later, all charges were dropped in a case that has sparked online protests and widespread outrage. A second girl, identified only as Paige came forward with her mother to say that she was identified on the same night as Daisy by another high school football player . In a public statement, Mr Kinder . said on Wednesday: 'Since Sunday I have read with growing dismay the . media accounts of the Daisy Coleman case in Nodaway County. 'I . make no claim to knowledge of all the facts. Still, facts revealed in . exhaustive media reports, including the 4,000-word piece in the Kansas . City Star, raise all kinds of questions that it is now clear won’t be . put to rest. 'These questions will fester and taint the reputation of our state for delivering impartial justice to all.' He added: 'I . hope that responsible officials will join me in this call for a grand . jury to make the final call on whether criminal charges should or should . not be filed.' A spokeswoman for Missouri's attorney general said her office cannot reopen the case. A former attorney for Barnett also released a statement on Wednesday claiming that the charges against his client were dropped after the girl and her family refused to cooperate in the investigation. Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder called for a grand jury to review the alleged rape case of Maryville teenager Daisy Coleman . Attorney Robert Sundell says Daisy Coleman and her mother Melinda refused to answer questions during a May 2012 deposition and later offered inconsistencies in another deposition. Sundell said the boy cooperated with investigators and 'freely admitted' to the sexual encounter. The attorney said while the boy's behavior might be reprehensible, it was not necessarily criminal. The mother denies she and her daughter were uncooperative. Mrs Coleman told CNN: 'I told them everything. 'That's absolutely not . true, and it still kind of shocks me that they're lying about it.' Mrs Coleman and her four children had moved from Albany, New York to Maryville, Missouri for a fresh start after her doctor husband was killed in a car crash. Following the alleged rape, Daisy was targeted by cyber-bullies, began self-harming and attempted suicide. Mrs Coleman lost her job as a veterinarian as her employer is a friend of the Barnett family - who carry considerable political weight in the small town. Matthew Barnett's grandfather Rex is a former state representative. The Coleman family have since left town following the ostracization and threats they have received since the incident. In April, the Colemans' Maryville home -- . which had been vacant and for sale -- burned to the ground. An examination could not be conducted due to the 'unsafe nature of the structure'. Maryville city and school officials reported on Wednesday they are on heightened alert in response to negative attention the city is receiving over a sexual abuse case.. Friends: Paige, pictured right, with Daisy, said that she remembers the night of the attack that she and her school friend were allegedly sexually assaulted . City, school and police officials say . they are concerned about reaction expressed on social media and in . phone calls after the Nodaway County prosecutor decided to drop the . sexual assault charges last year. On . Monday, the activist group Anonymous released an online statement . criticizing the city and police for not prosecuting the case. However, . the case was handled by Nodaway County, not the city. The . Maryville Daily Forum reports police are increasing patrols to protect . anyone involved with the case and school officials met on Monday at all . three city schools to discuss security. Daisy's friend Paige, who was at her . house for a sleepover, came forward on Tuesday to reveal that she was also raped . while her friend was being attacked in a nearby room. Paige did not name her 15-year-old attacker but said that unlike Daisy, she remembers all of the details of the attack. Her case was settled in juvenile court. She . told CNN: 'After he was done and we went out to the living room we . waited for Matt to come out with Daisy and he opened the door and I saw .

Their wedding was so secret that the first most knew of it was when a solitary picture of the glamorous couple was released to a stunned public. Now, these never before seen pictures, provide a tantalising glimpse into the lost weekend 13 years ago when John F Kennedy Jr married Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. The candid shots, seen here for the first time, form part of a new documentary which offers a fascinating new insight into John F Kennedy Jr, his relationship with his bride and his sister and his tragically short marriage. Scroll down for video . Everything to play for: John Jr and his best friend William 'Billy' Noonan relaxing on the eve of John Jr's secret wedding on Cumberland Island, off the coast of Georgia. Noonan was the last person to speak to John Jr . Lost youth: John Jr playfully grabs his nanny Marta on the weekend of his wedding to Carolyn Bessett in September 1996. Behind wedding guests mingle at an informal barbecue . Speaking for the first time those closest to John Jr, then 35, and Carolyn, then 30, have recalled a young couple ‘madly in love,’ and filled with optimism on the eve of their marriage on 21 September 1996. They have revealed the poignant speech made by the groom at the rehearsal dinner and the hauntingly prophetic words of his uncle, Ted Kennedy, on the day itself. Seen today, Ted Kennedy’s words seem to foreshadow the crash that claimed John Jr, Carolyn and her sister, Lauren, less than three years later when, in a storm on the night of 16 July 1999, the small plane John Jr was piloting plunged into the Atlantic off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. In ‘Coming Home with the Kennedys,’ filmmaker Daphne Barak was allowed unprecedented access to the family as . they made an emotional journey to Ireland, recreating in almost every . aspect the historic trip made by JFK, 50 years after his assassination. Beloved son: The picture that melted the hearts of a nation. John Jr plays beneath his father, JFK's desk in the White House's Oval Office in October 1963 . Laid back: John Jr pictured with his Uncle Ted's dog in his Manhattan apartment. John John as he was often known was charismatic and fun, easy and much missed company . Carolyn hugs John Jr's nanny, Marta, as, left, Jackie Kennedy Onassis's butler, Daniel Efgenio, prepares an informal supper in the kitchen of Jackie Fifth Avenue home . Power couple at play: Bill and Hillary Cilnton chat to Marta while John Jr looks on. Hillary became firm friends of John's mother Jackie when she sought advice from her on raising children in the White House on Bill's election win . JFK was the first American president of Irish ancestry to visit his homeland, travelling to New Ross, Co Wexford in June 1963. The journey made by 35 of the Kennedy clan this June was intended, in part, to honour the promise to return that he could never fulfil. Four months after his visit JFK was shot dead in Dallas. 'Carolyn...You changed my life in a way I never knew was possible,' John F Kennedy Jr to his bride on the eve of their wedding . During this recent  visit the family, led by JFK’s daughter, Caroline, 55, and her cousin Kathleen, 62, rededicated the Kennedy Homestead in New Ross, opened a visitor centre and lit the Emigrant Flame with a flame carried from the Eternal Flame that burns on JFK’s grave in Arlington. Many times over, according to Barak, thoughts turned to the other ‘lost sons.’ She said: ‘You’d hear people say, “I wish John Jr was here.” Or they would comment on how much Caroline’s son Jack looks like him.’ Unfulfilled promise: John Jr at his mother's Manhattan home on the christening of a friend's baby. John had spoken to friends of his desire to start a family with Carolyn . John Jr with Marta and Daniel Efgenio, his dog Friday sits at his master's feet. Following John Jr's death Daniel took Friday back to his home in Portugal . The fact that Caroline . and John Jr visited Ireland together as small children when, in 1966, . Jackie took her children ‘home’ made John Jr’s presence all the more . keenly felt. Abandon all hope: The wreckage of the plane that John Jr was piloting on the night that he, Carolyn and her sister Lauren perished in stormy weather on 16 July 1999 . United once more in grief: The Kennedy family and members of the Bessette family gather on the Vineyard Sound on 22 July to scatter the ashes of John Jr, Carolyn and Lauren . John Jr’s charisma and sense of fun was often recalled during the June visit and those qualities shine out from these previously unseen pictures. 'Even as a child his fate was on his head,' Daphne Barak on John F Kennedy Jr . In a series of candid moments John Jr is shown messing around on the beach at Cumberland Island, the little known spit of land off the coast of Georgia. Bare-chested and brimming with all the promise of his youth, John Jr, playfully holds his nanny  Marta in a bear hug as wedding guests enjoy a relaxed beach barbeque the day before the ceremony. Madly in love: John F Kennedy Jr and Carolyn Bessett pictured in May 1999, two months before their death. Their marriage was beset with rumors of infidelity and drug abuse but friends who saw them wed dismiss such talk . In another he poses with best friend William Noonan. They appear mismatched beach tennis partners as the athletic John Jr clutches a beach bat while the slightly portly Noonan grins by his side. Out of sight: The Greyfield Inn on Cumberland Island, pictured on 23 September 1996 - two days after John Jr and Carolyn's wedding. Many wedding guest stayed here for the secret ceremony that caught the world by surprise . Noonan, 55, was the last person ever speak to John Jr. Now he reflects: ‘What’s most interesting about John is that everybody knew who he was but few people outside of his closest friends knew exactly what he was.’ The night before the wedding John Jr made a clumsy toast to his wife, giddy with love he muddled his dates as he addressed her: ‘Carolyn, I am looking forward to call you my wife on Sunday..’ The raucous wedding crowd yelled: ‘Not Sunday: Tomorrow! Saturday!’ John blushed before raising his glass and continuing: ‘To Carolyn…You changed my life in a way I never knew was possible.’ The following day it fell to his uncle Ted Kennedy to toast the couple following the evening ceremony in Cumberland Island’s tiny wood-frame church. In words that, Barak said, now seem a chilly premonition he recalled a gift made to JFK by the Irish Ambassador on John Jr’s birth. ‘The Irish ambassador came and gave my brother after John was born a wonderful silver mug cup, from Wexford. 'At the time he read a poem that had been written by a friend in Ireland about HIS son, when his son was born. ‘And let me take a moment to read these lines…It was read to my brother Jack. '”We wish to the new child…As the wind leaves as it passes over the grasses, after a summer shower….A heart than can recognize… the gifts that life holds for the wise..And when the storm breaks for him, may the tree shake for him…In the night that he is troubled, may the friends wait for him, so that his time be doubled. And at the end of all the loving and love, may the man above give him the crown.”’ Carolyn relaxes with Marta at her parents' home in Connecticut during the holiday season, while she visited them with John Jr. Marta has dismissed any notion that the Kennedy's did anything other than welcome Carolyn . Barak pointed out: ‘All the talk of storm and the night that he is troubled…John Jr’s plane went down on a stormy night when his friends were waiting for him at the other end of that journey. ‘To me it’s quite chilling that this poem was read to his father on his birth. It is as if even as a child his fate was on his head.’ 'They never did anything without each other. Every decision. They were two but they were one,' John Jr's nanny Marta on the bond between John Jr and sister Caroline . But before tragedy struck pictures of John Jr and his wife Carolyn, just 33 when she died, at home show a couple seemingly relaxed and happy together. They are seen posing with John Jr’s nanny Marta and Jackie Onassis’s butler Daniel Efgenio in the kitchen, of what used to be Jackie’s Fifth Avenue home. The same kitchen in which John Jr can be seen chatting animatedly to Bill and Hillary Clinton a few years earlier – according to Barak one of the first things Hillary did on Bill’s presidency was contact Jackie. Daphne Barak's book of the visit. Half of the proceeds will be donated to the JFK Foundation in Ireland . She said: ‘She asked her for lunch because she knew that Jackie had experience of raising young children in the White House and they had Chelsea. They became very good friends after that.’ But as scion of the Kennedy family and the founder of George magazine, John Jr’s public profile brought much to live up to and much to bear. By the time of their death rumors of marital difficulties were rife. There was talk of infidelity and drug abuse and the allegation Caroline Kennedy did not approve of John Jr’s bride and that the siblings had grown distant as a result. Now, speaking to camera, John Jr and Caroline’s nanny, Marta, has dismissed these rumors as nonsense. She insisted that any ‘distance’ was simply the natural effect of two people marrying and leading more separate lives. There was no breakdown of relationship, she said. To the very end of John Jr’s life she said: ‘They never did anything without each other. Every decision. They were two but they were one.’‘Coming Home With The Kennedys’ will be released worldwide in November .

A successful male model has bravely given up his career to start all over again - as a female model. Chloe Lapper, 28, used to be a man called Shane, and walked the catwalks of some of the most famous fashion houses in the world. But now Chloe, from Banbury, Oxon, is finally on the way to achieveing her lifelong dream of becoming a woman, and is determined to make waves in the fashion industry once again. Shane, pictured in a Dolce & Gabbana show (left) hopes to re-create the same success as Chloe (right) Chloe said: 'When I started working as a male model at the age of 22, it was an amazing experience, but I would be so uncomfortable when people complimented me or told me I was gorgeous. 'I knew I was in the wrong body, so it just felt wrong. 'Making the transition to a woman is the best decision I ever made - I wish I’d done it sooner.' Now, dressed in heels and and mini-dress and with long curly hair, it is hard to believe that Chloe, was once a male model who worked for the likes of Dolce & Gabbana. But Chloe - as Shane - was scouted after moving to London six years ago and was immediately thrust into the limelight. Chloe has finally achieved her lifelong dream of becoming a woman, and says the modelling industry has been very supportive . Chloe as Shane, who walked the runways of some of the most famous fashion houses in the world during his career, meeting Tyson Beckford . Shane enjoyed a successful modelling career, meeting numerous celebrities, and even launching a PR company. Chloe said: 'I’d thought about modelling before but I never really believed I could do it. 'When . I was scouted I was quite shocked, but with my strong jaw and good . height, I was told that I had the right look, and suddenly it took off. 'I couldn’t believe it when I started getting booked for jobs.' But the pretty red head had known since an early age that she’d been born in the wrong body. Chloe said: 'I think I was about seven when I realised I should have been born a girl. 'I have five sisters, and I’d watch them all dress up and put on make up and I’d be so jealous. After years of psychological assessments Chloe has now started hormone treatments, and is raising money for her gender reassignment surgery . 'I desperately wanted to be like them. I’d paint my toes as I knew it was the one thing I could do without people noticing. 'I used to try on my sisters’ clothes when they were out - once I was trying on my auntie’s clothes and my uncle caught me out. 'Everyone knew from fairly early on that I wanted to be a girl - I even announced it on Facebook when I was 18. Chloe says she is finally proud of the person that she has become and would like to do TV as well as model . 'But everything finally fell into . place about four years ago - I was in a relationship with a woman and I . was finding it really difficult. 'I knew I wasn’t being true to myself, and I realised I was mentally ready to make the transition. Chloe says even as a young child she felt she was in the wrong body . 'I was nervous about people’s reactions - especially from people in the industry - but everyone’s been really supportive.' After . years of psychological assessments Chloe has now started hormone . treatments, and is raising money for her gender reassignment surgery. 'I’ve already noticed a few changes in my body and in myself. 'My facial features have changed a bit and my voice is higher, but I’ve also started to think more like a woman too - I think much more logically about things now. 'I’d really like to have a boob job soon as I think this will be a big step in my transformation.' Chloe’s change has been so dramatic that she says people rarely notice that she was ever once a man. 'I go out a lot in London to some of the biggest clubs in Mayfair and I hardly ever have any negative comments. 'I’m not too loud or over the top - I’m just myself, so nobody bats an eye lid. 'I was out once and I even had two men fighting for my attention. 'It was such a confidence boost for me.' Now, Chloe can’t wait to continue her transformation and make a name for herself in the fashion industry. Chloe said: 'Now I live my life as a woman, and I couldn’t be happier. 'I’m looking forward to seeing what direction my modelling career will go in, and I’d love to do TV too. 'I’m finally proud of the person that I’ve become, and I’m looking forward to a bright future as the real me.'","Shane Lapper was scouted as a model six years ago at age 22 .

Hillary Clinton last night paid a £40 fine on a credit card after she was given a parking ticket by a fearless traffic warden in London, MailOnline can reveal today. It comes after extraordinary photographs showed the former US secretary of state’s security staff getting into an argument with the warden after he issued her silver Mercedes with a ticket. The Westminster City Council warden put an £80 penalty notice on her car last Friday while she was attending an event at Chatham House - but the fine was halved because she paid within 14 days. However, Mrs Clinton's payment will do little to ease the £7.5million owed by US diplomats in London, who have picked up 66,372 penalty notices for failing to pay the congestion charge over ten years.

A 74-year-old woman faced the man who raped her in New York City's Central Park with composed anger, calling him a ‘sexual terrorist’ and an ‘evil infestation.’ ‘You, David Albert Mitchell, for the pain you inflicted on me and, by association, my loving family and friends, may you rot in hell for all eternity,’ she said during his sentencing to 30 years in prison for attacking her as she watched birds in September 2012 a week after authorities say he noticed her using a camera to document his lewd behavior. Mitchell, who had previously been charged with sexually attacking other women over age 70, pleaded guilty this month to rape and robbery. His sentenced was settled then. Monster: David Albert Mitchell has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to raping and robbing an elderly woman in Central Park last September . While the plea deal prevents her from having to testify about her ordeal at a trial, she made plain Wednesday that she wanted Mitchell to hear about it from her before the case was closed. ‘Make no mistake: This is a sexual terrorist,’ the woman said, urging a judge ‘to do the right thing so that nobody else is every hurt or menaced by this evil infestation.’ While the woman, 73 at the time, pursued her favorite pastime, Mitchell pounced on her from behind, slammed her to the ground and threatened to cut her throat when she screamed, scratched at him and tried to poke his eyes out, she said. ‘I stopped fighting. I figured I was a goner,’ she recalled. Mitchell had pleaded guilty to the charges which had prevented his victim from having to testify about her ordeal, but she insisted on speaking to him in court . Police: Officers are shown cordoning off the area in Strawberry Fields in Central Park, New York where the attack took place . Mitchell raped her twice, told her to stay prone and count to 100 while he left with her camera bag, and admonished her to stay put when she looked up early, she said. The attack left her with injuries including a broken finger, a smashed tooth and a damaged jaw. Roughly a week before, the birdwatcher had photographed Mitchell in a lewd moment, and he had confronted her, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Mitchell and his attorneys declined to speak at his sentencing, where he showed little reaction as his victim spoke. The Associated Press generally does not identify sexual assault victims unless they come forward publicly. Mitchell comes from tiny Jenkinjones, West Virginia, where he was charged at age 18 with raping and killing an 86-year-old woman. Mugshot: An undated mugshot shows Mitchell, who was charged at age 18 with raping and killing an 86-year-old woman . Acquitted in that case, he was then charged with raping a woman in her 70s; the sexual assault charge was dropped as Mitchell pleaded guilty to other charges, his attorney at the time has said. Later, Mitchell was suspected but never charged in the death of a 54-year-old woman. He served prison time in other cases, including the abduction of his ex-girlfriend. When he was released in 2011, some Jenkinjones residents bought guns to protect themselves from him. His New York arrest, plus a convicted sex offender's arrest in a rape in another Manhattan park about two weeks later, led local officials to call for tougher penalties for sex offenders.

Tortillas are now outselling popular American fast-foods including burger and hot dog buns. As the population of Hispanic people in the US grows, the consumption of Latin American food continues to increase. Research suggests people across the US now consider Hispanic foods 'American'. Scroll down for video . Tortillas are now outselling burger and hot dog buns as Americans embrace more Hispanic foods in their diets . Research suggests that people across the US now consider Latin American foods 'American' Salsa, meanwhile, has become the best-selling condiment in the US - making it even more popular than ketchup. Experts have suggested Hispanic food is being integrated into US culture in the same way Italian food was. 'When you think about pizza and spaghetti, it's the same thing,' said Jim Kabbani, CEO of the Tortilla Industry Association. 'People consider them American, not ethnic. It's the same with tortillas.' The first tortillas date back approximately 12,000 years, according to estimates. They were made of corn with dried kernel. Today, they are made from corn in a lime-based solution or with cornflour. According to Mayan legend, they were invented by a peasant keen to feed his hungry king. The change in diet across the US comes as the number Latin Americans - who already represent nearly 20 per cent of the population - continues to grow. Hispanic foods and beverages were an $8 billion market in the US last year, according to consumer research firm Packaged Facts. And by 2017, that number may reach $11 billion. Even in 2000, the Tortilla Industry Association estimated Americans consumed approximately 85 billion tortillas a year. According to InfoScan Reviews, a . retail tracking service, tortilla sales increased at a faster pace (3.7 . per cent) in supermarkets than potato chips (2.2 per cent) this year. Although . potato chips continue to be the top-selling salted snack in terms of . pounds sold, 'the growth of tortilla chips is a little bit more robust . than the growth of potato chips', Dempsey said. Graph showing the percentage of the US population that are of Hispanic (light green) descent, from 1980 (less than 10 per cent) to 2060 (projected to be more than 30 per cent). Olive represents 'multiracial', dark green shows the black population, blue shows Asian and Pacific Islander, dark blue American Indian and red shows white people . The darker states on the map show areas where there is a higher proportion of Hispanic people. The four shades of blue represent (from lightest to darkest) 15% or less, 16-30%, 31-50% and more than 50%. The darkest colour is shown in Texas, New Mexico and California . Along with the increased proportion of Hispanic people in the US, research by Associated Press suggests those born between the early 1980s and 2000 have embraced the foods. 'They are looking for products that are not necessarily big brands anymore,' said Michael Bellas, chairman of the Beverage Marketing Corporation. 'They like brands that have character. They are looking for authenticity and purity, but they are also looking for new experiences.' Traditional American fast-foods, the hotdog and burger, are being overtaken in popularity by Hispanic foods . And it's not just food diets that are changing. In 2006, nearly 107 million of litres of tequila were exported to the US, a 23 per cent increase on 2005, according to Judith Meza, representative of the Tequila Regulatory Council. Rice has also become more popular in the American diet, according to Darren Seifer, a food and beverage analyst for The NPD Group, a consumer marketing organisation. This is despite the fact that 'side dishes' have generally become less popular. In 2006, nearly 107 million of litres of tequila were exported to the US, a 23 per cent increase over 2005 . Research suggests one of the reasons Hispanic food has been embraced is that it is considered more healthy. 'When it comes to health, the Mexican cuisines cater better to that with salsas and vegetables,' said Alexandra Aguirre Rodriguez, an assistant professor of marketing at Florida International University. A healthier option many Americans are choosing is the tomato-based salsa, which beat ketchup sales two-one, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Terry Soto, president and CEO of About Marketing Solutions, said: 'If I would look at 10 shopping carts, about half would have taco shells, the Americanized components to make enchiladas or tacos, or frozen chimichangas. 'There is a larger segment of the population that wants the real thing. 'It's not so much the products becoming mainstream. It's about ethnic food becoming that much more of what we eat on a day-to-day basis.'","Research suggests many Hispanic dishes are now considered 'American'

So it may come as a surprise to find Julian Clary once dated a woman -  and almost became a father. The 54-year-old star made the revelation during an intimate interview, in which he chose not to reveal the name of the woman, but described her as  ‘unique’. He only discovered she was expecting after they parted and she subsequently lost the baby. The prospect of having come close to being a father is a matter he clearly thinks about. Piers Morgan's Life Stories: Julian Clary delves deep into his past in the TV show which will be aired this Friday . Appearing on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, he said: ‘I was very sad that she’d had to go through a miscarriage and thrilled that I was fertile, in a strange sort of way. ‘I couldn’t help imagining what the child would have been like. Now it would have been 35. ‘It’d be marvellous, wouldn’t it? It could drive me round and do the shopping.’ Mr Clary said he stayed in touch with the woman and Mr Morgan asks him: ‘You’ve suggested that when you see her, ‘Your heart still races and you imagine a life other than the one you have lived.’ To which Mr Clary replies: ‘She is unique in that she is the one woman that I had that sort of relationship with, so, yes, one does ponder these things.’ Warming to the theme of fatherhood, Mr Clary, who rose to fame as The Joan Collins Fan Club, and has appeared as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing, said he thought about having a baby with a lesbian friend many years ago but would not be sure about it now. Broody: Mr Clary (shown here exiting the Big Brother House last year) revealed he thought about fatherhood . He said: ‘I certainly was [broody] in my forties, yes. I think it’s inevitable, you get to that age and if you haven’t, you just kind of wonder what it would be like. ‘Yes, we [his lesbian friend and him] talked about it, I was going to need a mother to do it for me at some point, wasn’t I? ‘So, yes, I discussed it with a lesbian friend. We got as far as her working out her cycle, and all this, when I would have to turn up with the turkey baster. Exactly what would be the optimum moment.’ Mr Clary suffered a fall from grace when in 1993 at the televised British Comedy Awards he made a lewd joke about the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, who was in the audience. As the show was televised live, it was beamed into shocked homes across the nation. London Weekend Television was required to make a primetime apology. The incident coincided with Mr Clary contemplating taking his own life.  Describing the moment he checked into a hotel on Park Lane and considered taking an overdose, Mr Clary said: ‘It was nothing to do with saying something rude and then being infamous for that, that wasn’t why I was depressed. ‘There were lots of other factors. When I said what I said about Norman Lamont, it was a joke that came to me that evening and I thought I’d get a laugh. ‘I was having anxiety problems and it was manifesting as sort of day long panic attacks. ‘It’s very hard to describe but I was so worked up that I was prescribed valium for during the day and rohypnal to take at night. Television programme: Your Face Sounds Familiar. Picture shows: Julian Clary and Emma Bunton. ‘I remember I’d been driving around and I did check into that hotel and I did get all my pills out and I thought, ‘I’ll just lie down for 20 minutes before I take this major step’, and then I fell asleep or I thought better of it.’ Mr Clary has been in a relationship with 36-year-old Ian Mackley, an advertising executive for nine years. The pair met on a yacht in Ibiza. The star, who was last seen on ITV’s Your Face Sounds Familiar, said he was ‘very keen on gay marriage’ but would wait until he was asked. The interview will be shown on Friday evening at 9pm on ITV.","Comedian Julian Clary tells all on Piers Morgan's Life Stories .

A 21-year-old woman had acid thrown in her face as she prepared for her engagement party after telling her attacker she already had a fiance. Hong Kim Huoi, 21, suffered 30 per cent burns to her body, including face, arms and thighs in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Seven other people were also burned when Nguyen Van Dung attacked the woman and her friends as they prepared to leave for their engagement party. Hong Kim Huoi was waiting for a cab with her friends in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (pictured) when a jilted suitor threw acid in her face . Dung was arrested on Sunday after the terrifying attack, which he carried out on a scooter while Huoi and her friends were waiting for a taxi. The group of girls were heading to the airport to return to her hometown on Phu Quoc Island for the engagement ceremony. He splashed acid on them and ran after them, continuing the acid attack as they tried to escape. Three bystanders including a 45-year-old woman and two children, both 11 years old, suffered burns. Dung tried to escape on his scooter but was seized by locals who handed him over to the police. He confessed to police he had declared his love to Huoi who told him she was engaged to another man. Two British teenagers, Kirstie Trup (left) and Katie Gee (right), were also hurt in an acid attack in Zanzibar earlier this year . Huoi's fianci Dang Minh Tri, 22, said he and Huoi have been in relationship for more than two years and their betrothal ceremony was planned for Tuesday. The news follows in the wake of a spate of similar attacks, including on two British tourists in Zanzibar in September. Two 18-year-old girls, Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, were left badly injured after two men on a moped threw acid at them while they walked to dinner on the Indian Ocean island. Terrorist group Al Shabaab have been linked to the attack after several of the 15 suspects arrested were confirmed to be members. They were taken into custody following another acid attack on Catholic Priests shortly after the Britons were targetted. Tara Quigley, 28, (left) was sprayed with acid by 16-year-old Liam Sibbons while Jitendra Sakhpal, 21, (right) tried to force his ex-girlfriend to drink acid when she rejected his marriage proposal . Last month 16-year-old Liam Robert Sibbons was jailed for eight years for spraying Tara Quigley, 28, with chromic acid after he knocked on her door. Sibbons, who was also burned during the attack, admitted the offence but refused to say why he did it, claiming that he could not remember how he had ended up at the house. Just two weeks ago Indian newspapers reported that a jilted lover met up with his ex-girlfriend before trying to force her to drink acid. Jitendra Sakhpal, 21, had proposed to the unnamed 18-year-old girl but she had refused because her family did not approve of him. According to police, he allegedly met up with the girl, held her mouth and tried to pour acid into it before pushing her into the sea. Some of the acid spilled on her face and she suffered 10-15 per cent burns, leaving her in critical condition.","Hong Kim Huoi told suitor Nguyen Van Dung that she had a fiancee .

A woman who hit international headlines for allegedly being fired from Citibank because was 'too sexy' is now suing a medical lab for hurting her while drawing blood. Debrahlee Lorenzana - who in 2010 publicly accused Citibank of sacking because her double D implants made her 'too attractive' and 'too distracting' to male co-workers - is now claiming to have suffered 'serious and severe permanent injuries' following a visit to Quest Diagnostics. In papers filed in Queens Supreme Court that were obtained by New York Daily News, the 36-year-old said she went to a Quest lab in Bayside on July 3, 2012, and was treated by a nurse 'who lacked the requisite skills to draw blood without inflicting harm on her subjects'. The suit claims the phlebotomist, identified as 'Jane Doe', and the lab 'failed to properly diagnose, treat (and) prescribe for the condition from which the plaintiff was suffering'. Back in court: 'Too sexy for Citibank' banker Debrahlee Lorenzana has filed a new lawsuit, this time against a Quest Diagnostics clinic in Queens, claiming to have suffered 'serious and severe permanent injuries' while having blood drawn . Debrahlee Lorenzana shot to notoriety in 2010 for alleging her male bosses at Citibank New York found her work attire too steamy and fired her for it . The lawsuit brought forward by Debrahlee Lorenzana is said to have occurred here, at the the Quest Diagnostics lab in Bayside, Queens, New York . They also allegedly 'failed to properly advise and instruct the plaintiff concerning post-procedure care'. Strangely, the suit does not explain Lorenzana's medical condition or clearly identify her injuries. It does however say she experienced 'severe shock and damage to her nervous system and certain internal injuries'. The visit also 'damaged her physcophysical motor skills'. Psychophysics is defined as 'the branch of psychology that deals with the relationships between physical stimuli and sensory response'. While Lorenzana declined to comment on the case, her lawyer, Frank Panetta, said the suit was not as strange as it sounds. Debrahlee Lorenzana underwent xtensive plastic surgery to look like a 'cross between Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra' In vein: Personal banker Debrahlee Lorenzana has been vague about the injuries she sustained when filing her current lawsuit. Her lawyer said it related to 'nerve damage' He claims the lab tech was struggling to draw blood from his client and 'she got nerve damage' 'What’s unusual about that?' Panetta said. 'Sometimes they screw up.' The same lawsuit, filed in March, names a Queens driver who rear-ended her in a car accident in Long Island City in December 2012. Panetta said both were named because his client developed more severe nerve damage after the car accident and 'we’re not 100% sure which incident caused the injury'. Presumably Lorenzana is expecting a more successful outcome with her current complaint than with her infamous Citibank lawsuit. In 2003, Lorenzana took part in a 2003 TV show called Plastic Surgery New York Style for the Discovery Health Channel. In the show she was filmed giggling at a plastic surgeon's office as she discussed having a fourth boob job. 'That's what I want to be - tits on a stick,' she said on the show. In 2003 Debrahlee Lorenzana appeared in a plastic surgery documentary and spoke about her want for bigger breasts . In 2010, she went up against the banking giant Citi claiming discrimination in the workplace. Having undergone extensive plastic surgery to look like a 'cross between Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra', Lorenzana said she was sexually harassed because of her figure. She said she was ordered to stop wearing turtlenecks, pencil skirts, three-inch heels or fitted business suits. A 33-year-old single mother at the time, Lorenzana said other female colleagues wore much more revealing outfits than she did. 'They said their body shapes were different from mine, and I drew too much attention,' she said at the time. Despite the far-reacing publicity her lawsuit agianst Citibank garnered in 2010, Debrahlee Lorenzana received not a cent in damages, according to the banking giant . The case eventually went in to arbitration, but Citi have since confirmed they did not pay her a thing in damages. Lorenzana later went to work for Chase at branches in Brooklyn and Queens. Public records show she left Chase in the summer and has since relocated to Florida, where she’s working for Wells Fargo. The new lawsuit seeks unspecified money damages.","Debrahlee Lorenzana became world-famous in 2010 for suing her former employee Citibank, claiming they fired her after having breast implants because she was 'too attractive' and distracted male co-workers .

But behind the scenes it is clear David Cameron’s language can be less than prime-ministerial, after it emerged that he labelled Nick Clegg ‘an idle f***er’. The Tory leader is said to have used the term – in jest – as he urged a friend to tease his deputy for slacking off to go for dinner with his wife. Frank friendship: It seems David Cameron's language is less than ministerial after calling Clegg an 'idle f*****' But it is the second time this week that the Prime Minister has raised eyebrows with his language after allegedly privately expressed a desire for the Government to ‘ditch the green c**p’ on energy bills. He previously got into hot water when dismissing Twitter with the phrase ‘too many tweets make a t**t’. Despite the language used, the latest incident seems to be a remarkable insight into the frank friendship Mr Cameron has with his deputy. A senior Tory revealed how the PM used the profanity last week when he called a friend who by chance was dining in the same restaurant as the Lib Dem leader and his wife Miriam. Slip: It is the second time this week that the Prime Minister has raised eyebrows with his language after allegedly saying the Government should 'ditch the green c**p' Mr Cameron urged his friend to tease his Coalition partner for ‘chillaxing’ while he was on an arduous foreign trip. The source claimed he said: ‘Tell him he’s an idle f***er. I’m out here batting for Britain while he’s having a nice dinner.’ The friend, who works in the racing industry, was asked by Mr Cameron  for information about race horses owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. The Prime Minister met the Sheikh last Saturday in a effort to persuade him to buy Eurofighter Typhoon jets for the United Arab Emirates. Mr Cameron wanted information on Sheikh Mohammed’s horses so he would have some ‘small talk’. But when Mr Cameron called his friend, the man pointed out that he was dining near Mr Clegg – at which point he made the ‘idle f***er’ comment. Mr Cameron visited Abu Dhabi after a four-day foreign trip that included two stops in India, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka and a brief layover in Dubai. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said the message from Mr Cameron was not passed on. ‘Nobody has approached Nick in a restaurant to pass on a message from the Prime Minister – and I’ve heard that from the horse’s mouth,’ he joked. The spokesman also rejected claims that Mr Clegg is lazy. ‘Sometimes he is allowed to have dinner with his wife after working hard throughout the day,’ he added. Mr Cameron is a regular restaurant goer with his wife Samantha. The couple regularly go out on ‘date nights’ around London. Some will see it as ironic that Mr Cameron is criticising another minister for slacking off. Games: Mr Cameron urged his friend to tease his Coalition partner about 'chillaxing' while on a foreign trip . The most recent biography of the Prime Minister quoted a close friend as saying: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for “chillaxing”, he would win it.’ Mr Cameron has a penchant for playing mindless games like Fruit Ninja on his iPad and also enjoys singing My Way during  karaoke sessions.’ It is not the first time he has gently mocked Mr Clegg either. The PM likes to practise tennis at the weekend with a tennis machine he calls ‘the Clegger’. Mr Clegg is also a keen tennis player, but Mr Cameron has won their head-to-head matches. It was revealed this week how the PM privately ordered ministers to ditch the ‘green c**p’ – a far blunter way to describe his public view that green taxes must be removed to cut fuel bills. A senior Tory source said: ‘He’s telling everyone, “We’ve got to get rid of all this green c**p”.’","Second time this week the Prime Minister has used a profanity .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . PUBLISHED: . 15:00 EST, 18 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:01 EST, 18 November 2013 . Europe's most active volcano Mount Etna has erupted - spewing molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside. The two-day explosion last weekend was the third major burst of activity in under a month, after eruptions on October 26 and again on November 10-11, with the latter burying a seismic station and the access road. The latest outburst sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night. It was at its height between midnight and 5am on Sunday morning. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Glowing: In the early hours of Sunday morning, the white ash cascading across Catania's mountain slopes was lit up by molten lava and a full moon . Searing lava: The molten ash burst out at midnight on Saturday, turning the pitch-black night into a sea of flames and smoke . Violent: Tom Pfeiffer, the German geologist who captured the moment, said the eruption was violent and forceful - but he expects another to come soon . And it was captured on camera by German geologist, volcano photographer and tour operator Tom Pfeiffer, 43, from the Schiena dell'Asino on the southern rim of Valle del Bove, around 4km from the crater. The breathtaking footage shows the volatile volcano emitting streams of hot lava from the earth's core. Mr Pfeiffer said: 'Etna had started a . series of violent eruptions from the same crater in February 2013 until . April, then was relatively quiet throughout the summer until October, . when another paroxysm occurred. 'Everyone then thought there would be a second one relatively shortly after, but it took about two weeks to occur. 'Now, we're waiting for the next one. The general feeling and opinion is that something big is going to happen soon.' Contrast: One thick, orange block of smoke coated half the night sky, as the moon set and the sun rose, casting morning light across the mountains . Colourful: Photographer and geologist Tom Pfeiffer stayed up through the night to capture the contrasting colours as molten lava burst out into indigo skies . Outburst: The eruption lasted two days and sent streaks of lava kilometres into the air. Residents of Catania woke to see a mist of orange smoke bathing the sky . Endless: The night came and went, but Mount Etna was still bubbling and bursting, transforming the surrounding land into black and white craters of ash . There . have been more than 40 paroxysmal eruptions since January 2011, always . at the New SE crater, which formed during this period and has now become . a grown-up summit cone in just two years. The . November eruptions also changed the volcano's vent geometry, causing it . to produce a series of perfect steam rings - a rare phenomenon. 'I . saw a perfect steam ring racing over the sky, something I had last seen . at Etna back in 2000, when it had a phase of several months to produce . frequent rings. Late night activity: This is a shot around midnight, when the lights in the town below are still on. People in Catania could see the explosion but escaped harm . The volcano, in Sicily, Italy, has been relatively quiet over the summer months, but erupted into life on October 26, with a further eruption following on November 10-11 . Escaped danger: Despite spitting lava for two days, civilians in Catania were not endangered. However, staff at Catania Airport closed the airspace. Breathtaking: The images look like paintings as long, think lines of bright orange lava stream across the landscape towards the slopes below . 'I . shouted at my girlfriend Ingrid to look and grab her camera and started . to take some pictures myself. The steam puffs shot out from the weather . cloud as small mushrooms and many of them ""gave birth"" - I have no . better way to describe it - to rings. 'The . most amazing was to see their rotation, how they detached from the . plume, and how stable they were despite the storm-force wind up there. 'They . lasted several minutes, perhaps up to 10, becoming smaller and smaller . with distance, but always stood out as a clear sign in the sky. Some . penetrated even other clouds at distance.' Breathtaking: Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, spews molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside during its latest eruption . Fiery sight: A group of men engage in conversation, seemingly unaware that the volatile volcano is emitting streams of hot lava from the earth's core . Explosive: The eruption was captured on camera from Acireale, near Cantania. It is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year . Powerful: The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night - forcing airport officials to close airspace over Mount Etna . The explosion  - which is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year - did not endanger any of the . villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain. However, staff at Cantania Airport have been forced to close airspace above Mount Etna, which is the largest and most active volcano in Europe. This is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft, as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass. This would ultimately cause the planes' engines to shut down. Incredible: The explosion - which lit up the Sicilian sky - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain . Mount Etna's last major eruption was in 1992 - causing a fast-flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain. Despite the town of Zafferana being endangered by the streams of the red-hot liquid, successful diversion efforts saved the town and only one building was destroyed. However, the fiery volcano, currently standing at 10,925 feet tall, is still in constant activity. Astonishingly, it is steadily growing, and has been for 500,000 years, when eruptions began. Its latest eruption was preceded by a violent tremour on Monday, which sent hundreds of perfect smoke rings into the air. Risk: However, staff at Cantania Airport have been forced to close airspace above Mount Etna, which is the largest and most active volcano in Europe . Danger: This is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft, as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass. This would ultimately cause the planes' engines to shut down . No signs of stopping: The fiery volcano is still in constant activity. It is situated on the geological boundary where the European and African plates collide . Experts believe the eruption may have sparked a change in the structure of a vent, perhaps into a particularly circular shape - allowing Mount Etna to spew the unusual smoke-like formations. The volcano, which came into existence almost one million years ago, has been well-documented since 1500BC, when its eruptions forced civilians to migrate for safety. Since then, there have been more than 200 eruptions - from the almost undetectable to the catastrophic. In . 122 BC, an explosive eruption spewed so much ash onto the town of . Catania - crushing hundreds of houses - that the town's inhabitants were . exempted from paying taxes to Rome for ten years. Horrific: Mount Etna's last major eruption was in 1992, pictured, causing a fast-flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain . The most powerful eruption to date was in 1669, when the explosions destroyed part of the summit and the lava flows reached the sea more than ten miles away. This disaster prompted town leaders to attempt to control the flows of lava - to no avail. An extremely violent eruption in 1852 produced more than 2 billion cubic feet of lava and covered more than three square miles of the volcano's base, while the longest eruption began in 1979 and went on for thirteen years. Near-miss: The town of Zafferana was endangered by the streams of the red-hot liquid; however, successful diversion efforts saved the town from much damage . Mount Etna's current activity consists of . continuous summit degassing, explosive Strombolian eruptions, and . frequent basaltic lava flows. It has proved a constant concern for Sicily - with more than 25 per cent of the island's . population living on Etna's slopes. The volatile volcano is also the main source of income . for the island due to a combination of agriculture - stemming from its rich volcanic . soil - and tourism.","Mount Etna's latest eruption was caught on camera from Acireale, near Cantania, by German geologist Tom Pfeiffer .

A man paralysed from the waist down after being crushed during the World Trade Centre rebuild has miraculously completed a gruelling walk - thanks to a $70,000 bionic suit. Architect Robert Woo was working on Goldman Sachs' World Trade Center headquarters in New York on December 14, 2007, when a crane collapsed sending seven tons of steel plummeting 25 storeys onto his makeshift office. Rescuers found Robert folded in half underneath the rubble - his head by his knees and his spine crushed. Doctors told him he would never walk again. Bionic man: Robert Woo defied the odds and walked more than a mile for charity as part of Generosity NYC - an event in New York which raises money for numerous charities . The accident: Robert was working on Goldman Sachs' World Trade Center headquarters in New York on December 14, 2007, when a crane collapsed sending seven tons of steel plummeting 25 storeys onto his makeshift office (pictured) But on November 17, Robert, now 45, incredibly defied the odds and walked more than a mile for charity as part of Generosity NYC - an event in New York which raises money for numerous charities. He used a bionic suit, called ReWalk, which is equipped with motion sensors detecting when patients are ready to take a step and then uses a number of motors and gears to take the step for them. Following his accident Robert sank into depression - he said life as a paraplegic was not one he was interested in living, spending three months in hospital where he refused to look under the blanket at his legs. Walking again: He used a bionic suit, called ReWalk, which is equipped with motion sensors detecting when patients are ready to take a step and then uses a number of motors and gears to take the step for them . Huge help: Robert said the $70,000 suit reduced his need for everything from bladder to muscle spasm medication, built muscle in his legs and helped him avoid the bowel accidents that had plagued him since he became paralysed . He and his wife also divorced eight months after the accident. But his depression didn't dissolve his determination to walk again and almost immediately after the accident he started researching treatment for paraplegics. One solution he came across was bionics, with several companies creating exoskeletal suits helping patients get out of their wheelchairs and on their feet. Robert, who no longer works with the same architectural firm, helped bring a trial program to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where he was undergoing outpatient treatment. In October 2011, he took his first steps since the accident and over the next six months trained with the ReWalk three times a week, two hours at a time. Challenge: Robert walked the 1.06 mile course in 58 minutes and six seconds . He called the training regime 'life-changing' and said using ReWalk reduced his need for everything from bladder to muscle spasm medication, built muscle in his legs and helped him avoid the bowel accidents that had plagued him since he became paralysed. Robert, using the $70,000 bionic suit, walked the 1.06 mile course in 58 minutes and six seconds. He said: 'Finishing the walk brought tears to my eyes - it gave me a sense of purpose. 'When I saw the ReWalk suit and saw someone paralysed walking, my eyes opened up and I thought 'wow - I want to walk.' 'At the time of the accident things went black - I knew being paralysed meant more than just losing the use of your limbs. Determined: Following his accident Robert sank into depression - he said life as a paraplegic was not one he was interested in living - but refused to give up his dream of walking again . 'It's not a life I wanted to go through. 'I was bedridden, not doing anything, all I felt is a lot of pain and it wasn't a life I wanted to continue. 'Like a baby I was helpless - I had to be fed, I had to be changed, washed and cleaned up. I'd lost my manhood. 'I was just a wreck and hated being in this life unable to function completely.

Apparently too busy to attend in person, 29-year-old Brenner decided to send his brother Dan instead. Mike Brenner, right, may be a CEO but he still loves a good prank and couldn't resist sending his identical twin brother Dan along in his place, much to the ire of Baltimore Business Journal editor Joanna Sullivan, left .

She was so incensed at having the wool pulled over her eyes that she then ran a story exposing the scam and explaining how she had called Mike Brenner to express her outrage and ask him not to attend the magazine’s 40 Under 40 bash next month, although she said his brother Dan could come along. ‘I’m just a stick-in-the-mud newspaper editor who still worries about our readers getting the correct information. The BBJ’s credibility is everything. When we make a mistake, we correct it. And in this case, a mere correction wasn’t enough,’ wrote Sullivan. In on the joke: Dan Brenner, left, took his brother's place at the photo shoot for the Baltimore Business Journal . Following an angry call from Sullivan, Brenner sent her an apology for offending the BBJ, its readers and other 40 Under 40 awardees. ‘It was intended to be in good fun and to be harmless but after talking with one of the editors, I clearly upset the publication. For the BBJ and their staff, their readers, and the other award recipients that have felt offended or deceived, I do apologize,’ wrote Brenner on his Facebook page. He also encouraged his friends to leave comments on the original article to try and get his invite reinstated. To date the article has received more than 170 comments almost overwhelmingly in support of Brenner. No word yet from Sullivan on whether she is prepared to change her stance.

I’m sorry for this. 'I was certain I did not have concern for Simran’s well-being otherwise I would have not discharged her. Released: The doctor at Sandwell General Hospital told Simran Dhesi's mother that her daughter's lips were blue because she was cold . 'I would certainly have been aware if there had been an enlarged liver and I would have requested a paediatric opinion.' The inquest heard Tarlochan, a care home worker, took Simran to her GP the day after she was discharged from Sandwell General Hospital when her condition worsened. But the following day, on September 9, Simran’s condition had become so serious she was rushed to Birmingham City Hospital where doctors realised she had liver failure and fluid in her abdomen. She was later transferred to Leicester Royal Infirmary where she underwent an emergency operation . to drain the fluid from her heart and take the pressure off her liver. However, she went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead. Dr James Greening, a paediatric consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary, told the inquest doctors at Sandwell Hospital had failed to carry out the correct blood gas tests on Simran. He said: 'With the benefit of hindsight if we had had the blood gas it would have helped us to know what was going on.' Expert witness Dr Robert Sunderland, a consultant pediatrician at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, said there were 'warnings available' to the doctors from the tests done on Simran which would have flagged up her heart condition. He said: 'With hindsight there was a warning there available because from the readings there was a possible problem with the liver which wasn’t identified.' Death: Simran died after going into cardiac arrest at Leicester Royal Infirmary while undergoing emergency surgery . Returning a narrative verdict, Black Country Coroner Robin Balmain said: 'I have borne in mind these are natural causes but natural causes would not reflect this situation. 'Simran’s death was due to a rare complications in a congenital heart defect which had been corrected. 'The opportunity to treat and prevent the causes did not arise in time to prevent death.' Simran’s parents Jatinder and Tarlochan said said they were considering taking legal action against the hospital she was discharged from. In a statement they said: 'It has taken over three years for this inquest to take place. 'Even now, one of the key doctors who saw Simran first, did not give evidence, which was disappointing. 'Simran was a happy, playful little girl who had a beautiful smile bringing happiness to us and everyone in her life. 'She leaves a loving extended family whose lives have been shattered as a result of her tragic death and we can now only take comfort from happy memories of her short life. 'We believe the coroner’s inquiry has shown Simran was a very sick child who needed urgent specialist medical attention which sadly she never received.' The family’s solicitor Rankeshwar Batta added: 'The tragedy of Simran’s death was, in our view, avoidable had appropriate and urgent steps been undertaken when she first attended hospital as her condition began to worsen in September 2010. 'This case was all about taking personal responsibility to diagnose a high risk condition and to ensure adequate treatment and a specialist referral was in place for a very sick child. 'We will now consider next steps with Simran’s parents in respect of any formal action they may wish to take against the hospital trust involved in her care.'","Simran Dhesi was sent home despite her mother's concern, inquest hears .

British archaeologists have made a breakthrough discovery in dating the the birth of Buddhism. A group of 15 archaeologists led by Professor Robin Coningham of Durham University, have excavated an ancient shrine dating back to the sixth century BC which lay within the Maya Devi Temple in Lumbini, Nepal. The Unesco heritage site has long been identified as the birthplace of Buddhism, but the discovery of the shrine, believed to be the place where Siddhartha Gautama, the man who became Buddha, was born been hailed as the first archaeological material pinpointing the life of the deity. Birthplace: The Maya Devi Temple at Lumbini, Nepal, above, is still used by monks today and is considered the birthplace of Buddha . The British team worked alongside monks, nuns and pilgrims at the sacred site in collaboration with conservationists and planners. They wore only slippers or went barefoot during the excavation work, as shoes are forbidden in the sacred temple, over three winters in Nepal, when the water table is at its lowest. Buddhist tradition records that Queen Maya Devi, the mother of the Buddha, gave birth to him while holding on to the branch of a tree within the Lumbini garden, midway between the kingdoms of her husband and parents. Prof Coningham and his colleagues have speculated that the open space in the centre of the shrine they discovered may have accommodated a tree. The discovery of a shrine inside the temple means scientists can, for the first time, place the birth of Buddhism in the 6th century BC . He said the birth of Buddha had been placed in a wide spectrum from the early 400s BC to the 7th or 8th Century BC by different traditions within Buddhism. The discovery made it likely that the Buddha lived in the 6th Century BC, he said. 'It is one of the most exciting discoveries in terms of Buddhist archaeology since the early discoveries of the sites because we now have an idea of what the earliest Buddhist shrine looked like', he said. 'The significance for us is that the shrine is built around a tree and the fact that the Buddhist birth story is connected with a tree. Archaeologists wore only slippers or went barefoot during the excavation work, as shoes are forbidden in the sacred temple, over three winters in Nepal, when the water table is at its lowest . Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, was a real person, born in what is now Nepal. His father, Suddhodana, was a king and and Siddhartha grew up living the luxury life of a young prince. Siddhartha's father feared that his son would be upset by the suffering and pain of normal people ordered that he live a life of total seclusion. But one day Siddhartha ventured out into the world and was confronted with the reality of the inevitable suffering of life. The next day, at the age of twenty-nine, he left his kingdom and newborn son to lead the life of a monk. For six years, Siddhartha commited himself to rigorous ascetic practices, studying and following different methods of meditation with various religious teachers. One day he was offered a bowl of rice from a young girl and he accepted it. In that moment, he realised that physical austerities were not the means to achieve liberation. From then on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance rather than extremism. He called this The Middle Way. That night Siddhartha sat under the a Fig tree called the Bodhi tree, and meditated until dawn. He purified his mind of all defilements and attained enlightenment at the age of thirty-five, thus earning the title Buddha, or 'Enlightened One'. For the remainder of his eighty years, the Buddha preached the Dharma in an effort to help other sentient beings reach enlightenment. 'It is one of those really rare occasions when belief, tradition, archaeology and excavation actually come together.' Buddhism is based largely on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, commonly known as the Buddha and is one of the world's oldest religions. Many hundreds of thousands of Buddhists from around the world make the pilgrimage to Lumbini every year. The excavation work was funded by the Japanese government in partnership with the Government of Nepal as part of a Unesco project aimed at strengthening conservation and management of the temple. Buddhism spread after the birth of Siddhartha Gautama, now known as The Buddha. It is one of the world's oldest religions .","Group of 15 scientists excavated the Maya Devi Temple in Nepal .

His daughters claim they are entitled under Italian law to some of his assets, given he lived so long in Italy . Forty years ago Lord Lambton was photographed cavorting in bed with two prostitutes, prompting a huge scandal. He was forced to resign his post and fled to Italy where he spent the remaining 30 years of his life living in a Tuscan mansion with his mistress, Claire Ward. When he died aged 84 in 2006 he left his fortune to his only son Edward Lambton, the seventh Earl of Durham, under the British tradition of primogeniture, by which the male heir inherits not only the title but also the entire estate. In the years after his death, three of his five daughters demanded a chunk of the family fortune because all children have a right to an equal share under Italian law.

The sisters Lady Beatrix Neville, 64, Lady Anne Lambton, 59, and author and former TV presenter Lady Lucinda Lambton, 70, claim they are entitled to a proportion of the £12million estate plus further assets under Italian law.

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 11:50 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:50 EST, 25 November 2013 . Jailed: Steven Hughes, 50, was jailed for three years after blackmailing his employee into paying £30,000 . An innocent man was forced to pay £30,000 to his boss who threatened to derail his marriage by exposing a fake affair. The victim had been awarded £40,000 in damages from his previous employers after he was fired over false claims he made inappropriate advances towards a woman. Suffering marriage problems after having a stroke, the unnamed man eventually found casual work in a furniture business with close friend Steven Hughes. But when he told Hughes about the ordeal, his new boss devised a series of scams to steal the money - including a bizarre 'kiss and tell' threat. Father-of-three Hughes, 50, recruited a friend to pose as the victim's former colleague and told her to demand £10,000 - or she would expose their 'liaison'. In a hand-written contract that he was forced to sign, the woman made false claims the victim had groped her breasts. The man was said to have felt 'backed into a corner' and agreed to pay the cash. Today, Hughes, who has not repaid the victim, was jailed for three years after he admitted fraud and blackmail at Manchester's Minshull Crown Court. The court heard how the victim, from the Greenfield area of Oldham, confided in Hughes about asking a former colleague to go for a drink in what was described as 'inappropriate circumstances'. He then told him about a 'settlement fee' of £40,000 he received from his former employer. In September 2011, the victim was called by a woman who claimed to be the same woman he was accused of inappropriately approaching through work. She demanded £10,000 from him and threatened to 'tell her story' to a newspaper and make false accusations of sexual assault if he failed to pay. The distressed victim told Hughes about the threat - but the boss falsely said his business had also received a phone call from the same woman. Hughes falsely told the victim that his solicitor had advised him that the allegations could be so damaging that the furniture company would be shut down. The victim felt backed into a corner so agreed to pay the money. Kiss and tell: Hughes offered to take the victim's money and give it to 'the woman'. He returned with this receipt . Hughes then told the man he would take the money to the woman, and returned with a handwritten statement to confirm she had received the payment. It read: 'This payment is for harassment and sexual advances. Touching my breasts, We will have no contact with anyone or speak to anyone about this matter. This is the end of the matter.' In early 2012 year, the victim gave £13,000 to Hughes, who told him about an investment where specialist furniture could be bought from Malaysia and sold for 'handsome profit' in the UK. When he was then told by Hughes that a return on the furniture investment had been 'delayed', the victim became suspicious and contacted the police in May 2012. It emerged he had also paid Hughes a further £2,000 after he falsely claimed he could get a quick sale for his house through a property firm. In court Hughes claimed he was 'deeply remorseful.' But Judge Maurice Green told Hughes: 'These were extremely serious and particularly mean offences.' After the case, PC Rebecca Gross of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The victim considered Steven Hughes to be a friend, but now we know that he was manipulating this man for financial gain. 'Over a period of time, Hughes took complete advantage of the trust that had been placed in him, seizing on the victim’s vulnerabilities. 'These vulnerabilities included a sense of distress and embarrassment at the way in which he left his job, and that became the fuel for this man to become a victim of blackmail. 'Hughes has now been put behind bars for his dishonesty and I hope that this gives the victim some closure so he can take steps to rebuild his life.'","Unnamed man had received £40,000 damages from previous employer after being fired over false claims he made inappropriate advances to woman .

Giovanni Di Stefano earned £3.4million between July 2004 and June 2012 while posing as a qualifed lawyer . A bogus lawyer known as the 'Devils Advocate' earned an income 'worthy of a footballer' by taking on cases of notorious criminals, a court has heard. Giovanni Di Stefano, 58, earned £3.4million over eight years, the equivalent of more than £35,000 a month, while fraudulently claiming he was legally trained. The former Dundee FC director claimed to have represented people such as Saddam Hussein and Ronnie Biggs and boasted of meetings with Osama Bin Laden and Robert Mugabe. He described Dr Harold Shipman’s conviction as ‘absolutely outrageous’ in a 2004 BBC documentary, adding that he would defend Adolf Hitler if he was alive - and even Satan if possible. The Italian gave himself the title of 'avvocato' and posed as a qualified lawyer for eight years, despite only having an honorary degree from the University of Belgrade. In March he was locked up for 14 years for his ‘wicked’ con from July 2004 to June 2012. A confiscation hearing at Southwark Crown Court was told by prosectuor Patrick Moran how Di Stefano used ‘grains of truth to build mountainous lies’ to secure ‘an income worthy of a footballer’. It was agreed by both the prosecution and defence that he profited by £3,417,697.25. But Di Stefano’s defence barrister Nathaniel Rudolph claimed his client had blown every penny of his ill-gotten gains. Judge Alistair McCreath reserved judgement on the amount Di Stefano must repay until a later date. The ruling is expected to be announced before Christmas. Di Stefano was locked up in March for 14 years for his 'wicked' con from July 2004 to June 2012 . Di Stefano was convicted of 29 fraud, money laundering and forgery charges following a trial at the court. He pocketed a £150,000 insurance payout from Anthony Chatzfotiou, whose left arm was amputated after a horrific coach crash in Argentina on New Year’s Eve 2009. He also ripped off £160,000 from David Brown, an engineer for Hertfordshire Police Authority, after acting as his legal advisor in an employment dispute. Di Stefano used the money to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, living in luxury properties in Monte Carlo and Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills. He also dined in top restaurants such as The Ritz and Le Caprice and shopped in designer stores including Prada. Di Stefano claimed to have 'enjoyed a friendship' with Slobodan Milosevic’s daughter and lived in the former Serbian president’s home in 1993. Di Stefano claimed to have represented people such as Saddam Hussein and Ronnie Biggs and boasted of meetings with Osama Bin Laden and Robert Mugabe . He also recalled a ten-minute meeting with Bin Laden in Baghdad’s Al-Rashid hotel in 1998, during a trip to meet Saddam Hussein while he ruled Iraq. Di Stefano boasted about his connections in BBC documentary, 'Notorious: The Devil’s Advocate'. He joked about being dubbed ‘Mr Murder’ during a phone call to discuss representing mass murderer Jeremy Bamber, who was handed a life sentence for killing five family members. Di Stefano described Dr Harold Shipman's conviction as 'absolutely outrageous' in a 2004 BBC documentary . Di Stefano moved to Yugoslavia in 1992 after being thrown out of the US for being an ‘undesirable alien’, and wound up meeting notorious warlord Arkan. He told programme makers the Butcher of Belgrade is ‘a lovely man, a great man’, and went on to say that if Hitler needed legal advice: ‘I would not even need to think about it, I would take Satan’s case too’. Di Stefano fleeced further clients after his documentary was broadcast, including convicted killer Paul Bush who was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2003 for murder. Bush’s wife paid £10,000 to the Italian to secure bail for the killer, but the money was quickly withdrawn from the bank account before Bush was told there was no possibility of him being released. Convicted cocaine smuggler Laurent Penchef lost 10,000 Euros in June 2005 after Di Stefano agreed to lead his bid to be moved to France to serve his 18-year jail sentence. When one judge challenged Di Stefano on his legal credentials, he claimed the records had been destroyed in an earthquake. He admitted in evidence he was not a qualified lawyer, but said he only realised this ‘in hindsight’. Di Stefano, of Marshside, Canterbury, Kent, denied nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, one of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception, one of obtaining property by deception, three of acquiring criminal property, one of using criminal property, eight counts of fraud and two counts of using a false instrument. He admitted two further counts of fraud, with two further counts of fraud and another count of theft, relating to a stolen BMW, left on the court file.","Giovanni Di Stefano posed as a qualified lawyer for eight years .

And Terence Brady, Barker's co-star and co-writer, said he was unlikely hero: '(He was) probably the most boring man in the world,' he told The Times newspaper. 'A quite singularly dull man and yet he did an enormous amount of good work. We all liked him very much, but to do comedy with him was really weird, because he was one of these people with no sense of humour at all.' The show featured a series of off-the-wall sketches and characters including Barker as a 17th century character with two heads. When Mr Wilson died in 2011 the collection of tapes was passed on to a voluntary organisation in the West Midlands devoted to classic television and radio called Kaleidoscope. The Ronnie Barker tapes were then passed to sound engineer Keith Wickham who has restored them for the BBC. BBC Radio 4 Extra has confirmed it is actively considering how it may be able to use the new tapes, The Times reports. One of Britain's best-loved comedians, Ronnie Barker died of heart failure in 2005 aged 76. Earlier this month, his paedophile son Adam Barker, 44, was freed from jail 13 weeks after being jailed and is expected to inherit more than £1.4million left to him by his mother Joy Barker. Adam was jailed in October last year for child porn offences after being on the run in Hungary for eight years.","Third series of 'Lines From My Grandfather's Forehead' cancelled in 1970s .

An Iranian unhappy at being refused asylum by the Home Office has fought nine legal battles in less than five years, judges said today. The 20-year-old lost the latest round of his fight to stay in the country in the Court of Appeal today. But he still has another avenue of appeal open to him and could take his case to the Supreme Court. Appeal: The 20-year-old Iranian today lost a Court of Appeal fight against an earlier immigration tribunal hearing . The man, who was not named in the written judgment, came to Britain unaccompanied in January 2009 when he was 15, and claimed asylum. Since he has been in Britain, the man has fought his case at immigration tribunals and the High Court - mounting appeals and launching a judicial review. Three judges today dismissed his latest appeal following a hearing in London. The man was appealing against a decision by an upper immigration tribunal decision to refuse him permission to challenge a decision by first-tier immigration tribunal. 'We heard the appeal on 12 October 2013,' said one appeal judge, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, in a written ruling. 'This was the ninth occasion on which the appellant's case received judicial consideration.' Lord Justice Maurice Kay said the man arrived in the UK unaccompanied in January 2009 when he was 15, and claimed asylum. He said the man's claim centred on a piece of legislation which requires Home Office officials to protect the best interests of unaccompanied children arriving in the UK by trying to trace family members as soon as possible. The man claimed that Home Secretary Theresa May had failed to comply with that 'tracing duty'. Lord Justice Maurice Kay said the appeal was the latest in a series of cases in which complaints had been made about Home Office failures to comply with the tracing regulation.","Asylum seeker, 20, lost his latest legal fight in the Court of Appeal today .

Sets in children’s bedrooms or left on as background noise could be particularly damaging. Researchers believe the viewing of one-dimensional programmes on a screen and a lack of interaction with people means children take longer to develop an understanding of others’ thoughts and emotions. Concerns: Sets in children's bedrooms could be very damaging (file picture) This can make it harder for children to interact with other youngsters and raise the odds of them getting into fights and scrapes. Researchers put more than 100 boys and girls aged between three and six through a battery of tests designed to assess how well they understood other’s intentions and feelings. This ability, known as the ‘theory of mind’, develops rapidly between the ages of three and five and allows a child to realise that others have had different experiences and hold different views to their own. Leaving a television on in the background can be a distraction and lead to fewer conversations, the researchers found. This, and whether the child had a TV in their bedroom, were both strongly linked with a weaker theory of mind, according to the report published in the Journal of Communication. Long-term effects: Researchers from Ohio University said viewing one-dimensional programmes can mean children take longer to understand thoughts and emotions . Ohio State University researchers said this may be because parents who rely on television to educate their children spend less time interacting with them. However, the US-based research team did find that children benefited if their parents talked to them about the programmes they were watching. In their report, the researchers concluded: ‘Television may have a direct effect on theory of mind development by presenting the child with uni-dimensional portraits of characters and situations that only require superficial processing to understand.’ Dr Amy Nathanson, of Ohio State University, said: ‘When children achieve a theory of mind, they have reached a very important milestone in their social and cognitive development. Children with more developed theories of mind are better able to participate in social relationships. ‘These children can engage in more sensitive, co-operative interactions with other children and are less likely to resort to aggression as a means of achieving goals.’","Ohio University researchers said sets make it harder to interact with others .

A blind woman who is unable to have children of her own has created her own family using lifelike dolls. Louise Keel, 46, from Caerphilly, South Wales, was heartbroken after finding out she couldn't have children of her own - but found comfort in a £1,000 doll of a curly-haired toddler as well as two other 'babies' and a chimpanzee. Appearing with her doll Bert, who she helped create, on ITV’s This morning, Louise revealed how her dolls have helped filled a void in her life. Scroll down for video . Louise Keel, who is blind and suffers from osteoporosis appeared on 'This Morning' with her reborn doll Bert . Louise says her lifelike dolls have helped her come to terms with the fact that she can't have children of her own . Louise and her husband Brian even used Bert as a pageboy at their wedding . Registered blind and suffering from osteoporosis, Louise treats  Bert like a real child, to the extent that she had him as a pageboy at her wedding to partner Brian, 48. ‘I’ve always desperately wanted children. I had baby dolls as a baby girl, I had tea sets, I played house,' she said. ‘I always thought it would be marriage and family. That’s all I ever wanted out of life.’ However, after marrying at the age of 22, Louise endured six gruelling years of fertility treatment. ‘After so long, you then have to decide to stop. You have to decide are you going to go on and on and on. And it’s heartbreaking. But you have to decide for the sake of your own sanity.’ Louise says that adopting wasn’t an option due to her disability, but her life changed on a trip to New York in 2005. ‘I was in a big toy store looking at the dolls. One of the sales assistants asked if I wanted to hold a baby doll. ‘I picked it up and I was smitten.  It weight about four pounds, it was about 19 inches long. ‘It felt so lifelike, like a real baby. I thought, ""I’ve never felt like this before, I’ve got to have it.""’ Louise says that her dolls have had a profound and positive effect on her health. Louise, who has several medical conditions, says that as well as helping her deal with not being able to have children, her dolls help with her pain . ‘I found then and I find now that on bad days, when pain meds won’t touch my health issues I could hold one of the babies and they would help take the edge off. ‘It is a really amazing, amazing feeling.’ Though she says initially she never thought she would take her doll out in public, when she acquired a second doll her attitude changed. ‘In 2009 I got a little boy and I thought well, I see all these nice things on websites. ‘I got a bottle and thought let’s just see what it feels like, and it’s an amazing thing. ‘I just did a little bit at first, I fed him and it was a lovely feeling. ‘The way I describe it is it filled a hole inside me that I hadn’t released was empty. It just gave me a feeling of completion.' As well as Bert Louise has two other lifelike dolls, Leah-Rose (right) and Cassidy-Anne (left) who are babies . Bert, who appears with Louise on This Morning was created based on a character from a script by her writer husband. Louise helped design him and gave him the pixie ears as his character in the stories is a lepricorn. She also has two other lifelike dolls, known as reborns. They are named Leah-Rose and Cassidy-Anne, and both are babies. She buys them presents, sings them lullabies to get them to sleep and takes them out to the park. The silicone dummies are hand-picked for their realistic weight and soft feel but they lack the sounds - and smells - of a real baby. Nonetheless every morning she wakes up early to warm bottles of formula and feed her family. Her home is filled with all the equipment new mothers need, including baby bouncers, bottles and comforter blankets. ‘If Brian is around the house and not away on a business trip then obviously he’s the real person in the house and he gets the attention,’ Louise explains. ‘But if I’m on my own it’s cool to be able to do things with the babies; to feed them and change them and cuddle them. Despite receiving negative comments about her dolls, Louise says she has gone public with her passion because many others are too scared to admit they love reborns. ‘I’ve met so many people who have said I’d love to do what you do, I’d love to have reborns and take them out but I’m too scared. ‘I’m not hurting anyone and its help me come to terms with not being a mother. But it’s done so much more than that. It’s brought me so much joy and so much help. It’s been such a force for good.’ The latest member of Louise’s family is a reborn chimpanzee named Ozzy and she says she will definitely be continuing to add to her clan. ‘In January, another little girl is coming who’s going to be about the size of a nine month old, 26 inches long, so a little smaller than Bert.’ To watch the full interview go here .","Louise Keel, 46, from Caerphilly, South Wales, can't have children .

A council that spent £26,000 pounds on concrete flower pots plans to remove them after drunk locals used them as urinals and ash trays. Portsmouth City Council is being forced to re-think its decision to put the seven planters in the pedestrianised zone in Southsea, Hampshire, in light of the anti-social behavior. But local residents who branded them a 'waste of money' that should never have been put in place are happy to see the flower pots go. The flower pots on Palmerston Road cost the council £26,000 but have been used by drunk revellers as urinals and ash trays . Linda Symes, whose anti-pedestrianisation petition attracted 1,400 signatures, said: 'The concrete planters are being used as a receptacle for cigarette ends and are being used by people to go to the toilet and be sick in. 'The council could have put trees there instead and that would have given the place a nicer feel. 'We are having to close things down and reduce services in the city, yet money can be thrown away like this all because the council didn’t think to do its homework. 'If it had, it would have realised putting planters in there would have been a terrible error.' Another resident complained that the council's latest proposals are having a negative effect on local business. Marion Wren, owner of Preloved Portsmouth clothes shop . said: 'I want the high street opened up. 'The planters could be replaced . with some parking spaces. Local business owners would be happy to see the flower pots go, with some suggesting they should be replaced with trees or parking spaces . The road used to be buzzing but it’s now a ghost town.' The removal of the plant pots comes after £9,000 was spent building bollards on a nearby road to stop lorries from using it. But, . three months later, the bungling council was forced to tear them down . when the local fire service warned their engines could not get past. Portsmouth South MP, Mike Hancock says it was more important that the council got things right, adding any plans for the flower pots to be used to improve another road in the city should be reconsidered. 'It seems we have to rethink the whole idea of what we are going to do. 'If we have done something and we genuinely appreciate that it’s a mistake, that problems are being caused, and the quality of the setting is being affected, then the best way forward would be to take the planters out. 'People thought the planters would improve Palmerston Road, but they have turned out to be a focal point for problems.
