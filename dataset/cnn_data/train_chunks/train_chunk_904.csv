"By . Ollie Gillman For Mailonline . A man who feared he would have to sell his 'wonderland' home because he lost his job has taken it off the market after strangers donated thousands of pounds to his cause. On first glance, John Trevillian's former council house in a quiet cul-de-sac in Great Dunmow, Essex, looks nothing special. But on the inside Mr Trevillian has transformed it into the extraordinary, with different rooms designed to reflect a different time and place in history - including a 1950s New Orleans kitchen, Victorian dining room, Moorish bedroom, Cambodian tree-house loft and Scottish Edwardian hall. After spending almost 25 years and £700,000 on the home, he was forced to put it on the market for just £350,000 because he could not afford the £2,000-a-month upkeep after being made redundant. Scroll down for video . The extraordinary Moorish-style bedroom, which Mr Trevillian calls the 'room of dreams', is just part of the house's £700,000, 24-year renovation . The sitting room, which Mr Trevillian calls the 'watchtower', is filled with ornate artefacts. His home, called Talliston House and Gardens, has more than 1,650 objects, costing around £500,000 altogether. The other £200,000 spent on the house paid for building materials . Mr Trevillian opens up his 'wonderland' home for visitors' tours, as well as photoshoots and murder mystery nights. The home includes this 1950s New Orleans kitchen . The Victorian dining room is fortified with stone walls, which had to be lifted in by crane, and the tree-house in the loft is supported by a real trunk. The smells have been engineered too - nutmeg and coffee waft through the New Orleans kitchen whilst jasmine fills the tree-house air. Even the sounds have been tweaked to help muster the right mood - and visitors quickly forget outside is suburban Essex. But the £2,000 a month costs, which include the mortgage, insurance and general upkeep, became unaffordable when Mr Trevillian, 49, lost his job on a magazine earlier this year. He was forced to put the house up for sale in June, but set up an online fundraising site in the hope other people would share his passion for Talliston House and Gardens - Old English for ‘secret place in the woods’. He was in luck, with strangers donating £6,000 to his cause - enough for the delighted homeowner to take the property off the market. Mr Trevillian said: 'I'm just emotionally exhausted. It's been such a rollercoaster ride but there's been so much positivity and it really shows how important Talliston is, how much people love it. 'Talliston is the thing I would hold above my head if I was drowning. It affects so many people in such a positive way and I needed to do whatever it took. Some people think it’s totally mad but others say it’s like being in one of those novels where a secret door opens up to a different world and fall in love with it.' Rich foliage and bright-coloured lights fill the fountain courtyard, which was almost sold along with the house but was saved by donations from strangers . From the outside, the three bedroom property looks unremarkable, but inside it has been transformed into a 'wonderland' Emotionally exhausted: Mr Trevillian, 49, said the past two months had been a 'rollercoaster ride' and that the donations show how much people love his house . More than 1,650 objects from 27 countries fill the incredible home, which he bought in 1990 for £73,000, with the artefacts costing him £500,000. John, who lives in the house alone, spent a further £200,000 on building materials, and says he has spent 'every penny' in the last 24 years on his labour of love. ‘I’ve always been interested in English history but being from an ordinary East End of London family, I was never going to afford the sort of house I wanted,’ Mr Trevillian said. ‘It’s every penny I’ve had for last 24 years – and every weekend too.I was into writing speculative fiction at the time – fantasy, horror and science fiction – so originally the idea was to have a place I could write. ‘I picked the most normal house. I didn’t want character because I knew I was going to start from scratch. In fact, it was hideous – the bathroom leaked, it had everything wrong with it and it wouldn’t sell. I thought, “perfect!” I started with the office and then moved onto the bathroom and have gone on from there.’ Quite a transformation: The bedroom - now the 'room of dreams' - before the renovation. Mr Trevillian bought the council house for £73,000 in 1990 . A shadow of things to come: This dingy kitchen is what welcomed John in 1990 when he moved into the worn out house. Now it is an extraordinary 'wonderland' Mr Trevillian opens the house to visitors, and even hosts murder mystery nights and photoshoots. He holds them in the living and dining room, which is arguably his greatest achievement. The room took Mr Trevillian four and half years to complete, with authentic stone walls which are a foot in depth and had to be lifted into place by a crane. The walls are defined with £4,600 worth of oak paneling and he then rendered them using limestone. An open fireplace, carved table, and velvet curtain complete the look. Mr Trevillian said: ‘To me, it’s the perfect place for entertaining. People walk into the room and are transported to a different place. ‘I want Talliston to be a centre of creativity. I want it to inspire people.'","John Trevillian had to put the extraordinary Talliston House in Great Dunmow, Essex, on the market after losing his job .

"By . Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . He follows in the rather large footsteps of notable Defence Ministers of yesteryear, notably James Killen, Kim Beazley, Robert Hill, Robert Ray and Stephen Smith... so just who is Senator David Johnston? He has had the Defence portfolio for a year now but not much is known about him except, according to his web page, that he's 58, was born in Western Australia, lives in Perth with his wife Toni and three adult children. Most recently, however, he's been dragged into the debate over whether Australia would deploy troops to Iraq, clearly at odds with the Prime Minister. Tony Abbott will not rule the possibility out, a stance which has irked his Defence Minister. Scroll down for video . Name the politicians. Most would be able to name Julie Bishop (Australia's Foreign Minister, second from left) and John Kerry (US Secretary of State, second from right) but who are the other two? Far left is Australia's Defence Minister, David Johnston and far right, US Defence Secretary, Chuck Hagel. Senator Johnston lists his interests as being cycling, sailing on the Swan River and that he is 'an avid West Coast Eagles supporter' but he also tops a list of little-known or anonymous ministers in the Abbott Government. There are more than 2 million businesses registered in Australia, Bruce Billson is the Minister for Small Business. He has just over 4000 followers to his Twitter account. If you think that is a low count for a government minister, then Warren Truss is the Deputy Prime Minister and just 3,500 bother to read his tweets. Guess who? From left to right: Bruce Billson (Minister for Small Business), Senator Michael Ronaldson (Minister for Veterans Affairs) and Senator Marise Payne (Human Services Minister) Curiously, the Deputy PM shares the name of a famous type of bridge, the 'Warren Truss' was patented in 1848, it consists of longitudinal and angled cross-members. David Johnston (Defence Minister) Warren Truss (Deputy Prime Minister) Peter Dutton (Health Minister) Mathias Cormann (Finance Minister) Bruce Billson (Small Business Minister) Michael Ronaldson (Veterans' Affairs Minister) Marise Payne (Human Services Minister) Perhaps his greatest claim to fame though is how he came to, bizarrely, rate a mention in the popular TV series 'Lost', a few years back. In one episode one of the main characters, Sawyer, is challenged over the apparent headbutting of the 'honourable Warren Truss, Minister for Agriculture'. His Labor counterpart, Anthony Albanese put it bluntly. 'No one knows who Warren Truss is, that's because he's not doing anything,' Mr Albanese said. He's not the only one suffering from an identity crisis with voters. Queensland MP Peter Dutton is a former police officer who scored the plum dual roles of Minister for Health and Minister for Sport. He did make a name for himself four years ago though, when he refused to attend parliament for the official apology to the 'Stolen Generation' by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Belgium-born Senator Mathias Cormann may be well thought of within Coalition ranks but is hardly a household name as Minister for Finance. He visited Perth in 1994 after learning English during a one-year exchange program in England, migrating to WA a short time after. Little-known Finance Minister Mathias Cormann did come to some prominence when he shared a cigar with Treasurer Joe Hockey after the budget . 'Given Joe Hockey's performance this past week, if he's the best they've got it's in the government's interest for people not to know who the ministers are,' Mr Albanese added. 'Perhaps on the other hand, the government should promote some of these no-name ministers,  they'd have to be able to do a better job than Joe Hockey, Tony Abbott and the other so-called big names.' Victorian Senator Michael Ronaldson, 60, is also on the list. He worked as a barrister and solicitor in Ballarat before choosing a political career. He's now the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Labor MP Anthony Albanese did not mince words, suggesting the 'no-name ministers' should be given a chance to enhance their public credentials because 'they'd do a better job than Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott' On paper they are three government ministers of note (left to right) Warren Truss (Deputy PM), Peter Dutton (Health Minister) and Mathias Cormann (Finance Minister) Ben Chifley (1931-32) Robert Menzies (1939-41) John Curtin (1941-45) Malcolm Fraser (1969-71) James Killen (1975-82) Kim Beazley (1984-90) Robert Ray (1990-96) Robert Hill (2001-06) Stephen Smith (2010-13) We know that Marise Payne, who has the Human Services portfolio, has just moved into a newly built home in Mulgoa and 'cooks for therapy'. David Johnston graduated with a law degree from the University of Western Australia in 1979. At the same time James Killen was midway through his tenure as one of the longest serving Defence Ministers in Australia's history. Johnston entered politics as a member of the Senate in 2002 after a career as a barrister. He had earlier made an unsuccessful bid to enter the House of Representatives during the 1987 election, when the lost Kalgoorlie race to Graeme Campbell. Johnston had served in the shadow defence role under Malcolm and Tony Abbott from 2010, taking over the ministry when the Coalition won power last year. Other prominent ministers to have occupied the portfolio include former Labor leader Kim Beazley (1984-1990) and Stephen Smith (2010-2013).","West Australian Senator David Johnston has the key portfolio of defence .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . A child inside the Nauru detention centre has painted a grim and disturbing picture of what it is like to behind the gates of the facility. A drawing done by an unidentified 16-year-old shows graphic images of suicide and depression. The submission was made to the Australian Human Rights Commission's (AHRC) National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014. The disturbing drawing was done by a 16-year-old child while living inside the Nauru offshore processing centre . The visual diary of the child's daily life included an image of a wrist being cut by a razor blade with the words 'Suicide of children under the age of 18' More than 230 public submissions were made to the inquiry and have come from a range of sources, including children inside the Nauru detention centre, teachers who work at the facility and mental health experts who have visited the off-shore processing centre. The latest one is a visual diary documenting the daily life of the 16-year-old who writes in Arabic: 'We have no cameras here to take films. 'We are suffering here as the marquees have no air-conditioning and it is very hot. 'We also have no water at times. 'I want to be free of this life. This is our lives.' Another part showed stick figures hanging by their necks from nooses above a passage which read: 'This is our lives' This child's drawing is one of more than 230 public submissions made to the Human Rights Commission for its inquiry into the mental health of young people in detention . Surrounding these haunting words are images of a wrist being sliced open by a razor blade and stick figures hanging by nooses as well as a stick figure of a man who is believed to be Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with phrases of a derogatory nature written around him. The drawing of the wrist is accompanied by the words: 'Suicide of children under the age of 18'. Underneath it is what appears to be an angel in a kneeling position with its head bowed. The child wrote 'Everyone here is depressed', 'You cannot live here, even for one day' and 'F*** my life' accompanying a drawing of a hand giving the middle finger. There are 983 children in immigration detention as at July 2014 on Australian soil as well as off-shore . Written in Arabic around this picture of a Nauru official trying to help children out says: 'You can help us but you only pretend you want to help us' This is another drawing done by a children inside Nauru submitted to the AHRC inquiry . According to the AHRC, there are 208 children who are being held at the Nauru detention centre (pictured) Other recently revealed drawings from children inside Nauru include a face crying tears of blood with its lips sewn up. It comes after the inquiry heard evidence last month that claimed the Federal Government was attempting to conceal the extent of mental health issues of children inside detention centres, according to the ABC. Between January 2013 to the end of March this year, it was reported by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that 128 children had self-harmed. According to the AHRC, there are 983 children in immigration detention as at July 2014, with 775 children held in immigration detention facilities in Australia while 208 children are at Nauru. On top of this 304 are being detained on Christmas Island and are awaiting offshore transfer to Nauru as per Federal Government police. As at March 31, there are 34 unaccompanied children who are being housed in Australia detention centres, while 128 babies have been born inside onshore facilities between January 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. The inquiry was launched by AHRC president Gillian Triggs and explored the effects of detention on the mental well-being of children who are under the age of 18.","The drawing was submitted as part of an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry .

"By . Marielle Simon For Daily Mail Australia . One of Tony Abbott's top advisers has warned that Australia has become obsessed with global warming and instead should be worried about global cooling. In a comment piece written for The Australian, Chief Business Adviser Maurice Newman claimed that the country was 'ill-prepared' for plummeting temperatures and dismissed scientific research that suggest the earth is getting hotter. 'The warmth the world has enjoyed for the past 50 years is the result of solar activity, not man-made CO2', he wrote in a controversial blog published on Thursday. Under attack: Maurice Newman (right) has claimed that the planet is at risk of global cooling not global warming. He is a business adviser to Tony Abbott (left) He claimed that politicians have 'put all (their) eggs in one basket' and 'made science a religion... ignoring at its peril and ours, the clear warnings being given by Mother Nature'. The former ABC chairman laid the blame for current policy on the government's 'biased research to pursue “green” gesture politics.' However, his comments have provoked a furious backlash from scientists who said that his ideas were not based on any scientific evidence. Adam Bandt, Green's Deputy leader, labelled Mr Newman's ideas 'almost deranged' and said that Tony Abbott had 'no choice but to dump him as head of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council'. Ian Dunlop, scientist for the Climate Change Taskforce, also criticised Mr Newman, branding his comments 'arrogant'. 'The reality is that virtually all the informed scientists around the world and every major institution like the world bank and UN, are investigating climate change in great detail because it is an incredibly complicated problem', he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The vast majority of scientists are saying it is a big problem and we need to get on with addressing it'. Adviser to the Abbott Government, Maurice Newman claims citizens are ill-prepared for global cooling because of biased scientific research led by governments . Adam Bandt twitter . Labor's environment spokesperson Mark Butler took to Twitter to express disbelief over Mr Newman's claims . He said that the government had avoided addressing the issue because of the implications for the economy. 'Unfortunately the governments have been finding it very difficult to take any actions because it means fundamentally changing the way the economy works,' he said. Mr Dunlop said that inaction to tackle the problem was down to fear. 'It all sounds quite scary and it is a huge thing to do, but we do have solutions, we just have to do it,' he said. 'Both Labor and Liberal have agreed that we have to cut emissions down by five per cent by 2020 but the real action we require is that we need to reduce it 50 per cent by 2020.' Global warming scientist Dr Bradley Opdyke dismissed Mr Newman's claim that there the climate was getting cooler rather than warmer. 'The ocean actually says it is getting warmer. 'If you are looking for evidence, good data comes from the ocean because it has a much higher heat capacity,' he said. 'Almost every year over the past 10-15 years there has been a record temperature highs, compared to the 20th centuries temperatures.' Dispute: Climate change scientist Dr Bradely Opdyke said that scientists lacked faith that the government would take action on the issue . Dr Opdyke refuted Mr Newman's claim that climate change is from the sun, rather than CO2, based on no evidence to support that the 'sun's output is increasing over the years.' 'If these people who are meant to advise the government are saying these things, well they are clearly advising the wrong things,' he said, adding that Mr Newman's comments were based on 'absolutely no evidence' and that the research supporting global warming came in a 'truck load.' 'If he had any evidence to support those claims that it was cooler we would probably give him a Nobel Prize,' he said. Speaking to The Guardian, Professor Mathew England described Mr Newman's comments as 'weird' and 'uneducated'. 'The idea that solar cycles can override climate change driven by greenhouse gases is fanciful', he said. 'Saying we aren't prepared for global cooling is like saying we aren't prepared for an alien invasion. There is no credible scientist saying this is on the horizon.'","Maurice Newman said world was 'ill-prepared' for climate cooling .

The officers were able to unlock the cuffs using a key found in the apartment and said there was no evidence of foul play.

"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . and Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . An Australian couple have allegedly left Thailand with their newborn twins, born last month via surrogate, according to ABC NewsRadio. The report says that the same-sex couple are already in Singapore with their babies. The news come after couples from the US and Australia, who were flying out with surrogate babies, have been barred from travel by immigration officials in Thailand, as its local government continues its crackdown on surrogacy laws. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) tells Daily Mail Australia, 'The Australian Embassy in Bangkok is currently assisting Australians with children born by surrogacy in Thailand who have been prevented from departing the country in recent days. DFAT warns that the new protocols in place by the Thai authorities will affect all Australians travelling to Thailand. 'The Australian Government's Smarttraveller travel advice for Thailand was updated on 14 August to advise that Thai authorities are enforcing strict documentation requirements upon exit of the country when they suspect a child has been born by surrogracy in Thailand,' said a DFAT spokesperson. Scroll down for video . The alleged abandonment of baby Gammy - a child carried by surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua (pictured with the seven-month-old - sparked a surrogacy crackdown in Thailand . It is believed the couples, including the Australia were leaving from Bangkok international airport when they were stopped on Thursday afternoon, according to the ABC. One of the couples was with a surrogate mother. This discovery came after two American couples were also stopped for the same thing in the past 24 hours. An Australian couple were also sent home from Bangkok on Sunday when they tried to leave the country with a baby born via a surrogate mother, Fairfax Media reported. Unless a court order directs otherwise, immigration officials have the authority to stop surrogate babies leaving the country. 'While regulation of surrogacy is a matter for Thailand, we continue to encourage Thai authorities to adopt transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce, so concerned Australians are not unduly affected,' said the spokesperson for DFAT. Consular assistance is available to Australians affected in Thailand by contacting the Australian Embassy in Bangkok or DFAT's Consular Emergency Centre. Thailand's new government looks to push through legislation looking at halting commercial surrogacy. Two Australian couples were stopped at Bangkok international airport on Thursday while trying to travel out of the country with surrogate babies . Wendy and David Farnell, from Western Australia, were accused of abandoning Gammy and taking only his twin sister, Pipah, when they found out he had Down syndrome . Members of the Thai parliament are from the militia and its army general is trying to prevent Thailand from becoming a surrogacy hotbed for overseas couples by criminalising it. The country's sudden crackdown on the industry was sparked by an Australian couple who caused international outcry when they were accused of leaving behind a Thai-born baby named Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome, instead taking his twin sister home with them. Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, was the one who levelled the accusations at Western Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell. In another twist in the story, it emerged David Farnell had been convicted of 22 child sex offences - including a victim aged just seven - in his 20s. The couple appeared on 60 Minutes on Sunday to hit back at the claims made by Ms Pattaramon, 21 . Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10. The couple hid their home for a week while media was camped outside and Western Australian government officials from the Department of Child Protection sought them out for a meeting after the news of Farnell's past surfaced. David and Wendy Farnell appeared on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday to hit back at reports circulating they had abandoned Gammy. 'It's been very stressing. We miss our little boy. I come home from work some days and Wendy has dressed our little girl (Gammy's twin sister Pipah) all in blue because she wants to remember the little boy,' Farnell told the news program. 'We said we want both babies to be born and we will think about this.'","Reports couple left Thailand with their twins, born last month via surrogate .

"By . Wills Robinson For Mailonline . A gang of robbers have today been jailed for ransacking a jeweller’s home before bundling him into his own car and taking him to his own showroom so they could steal nearly £100,000 pounds worth of gems. Damon Denham, Stephen Evers and Eugene Gunderman burst into Mark Reid’s house, in Ockham, Surrey, tied him up, put a pillowcase over his head and then plundered £22,000 worth of jewellery from his personal collection. They then drove the 48-year-old victim to Gordon Marks Silver and Goldsmiths, in nearby Cobham, in his own car and forced him to unlock the shop. The group barged in and smashed open display cases with a crowbar to get to the diamond jewellery inside. Sentenced: Stephen Evers, 42 (left), and Damon Denham, 27 (right), were jailed for 13-and-a-half years each after they broke into Mark Reid's house in Ockham, Surrey, before stealing £100,000 worth of gems . With them distracted by the shiny trinkets, Mr Reid seized his chance and fled into the road, shouting for help. Jailing the trio for a total of 39 years at Guildford Crown Court, Judge Peter Moss said of the victim’s ordeal: 'It’s difficult to imagine how terrifying that must have been.' A DNA sample from a crowbar at the shop matched 27-year-old Denham, while another from Mr Reid’s jeans from his bedroom matched 42-year-old Evers. Jurors during the trial heard that Mr Reid had been home alone in his large, detached house on the evening of October 14, 2012. He was sitting on the sofa, watching television, when the gang struck. Prosecutor Graham Smith told the court: 'Without warning, he was confronted by several intruders, bursting through his patio windows. These men were wearing balaclavas, dark clothing and gloves.' The robbers had hurled two concrete breeze blocks through the double-glazed doors before piling in to the building. Driver: Eugene Gunderman, 27, was jailed for 12-and-a-half years for his part in the terrifying double raid . The shocked victim leaped up and tried to flee the men up the stairs to his bedroom, where he had a panic alarm button. The victim himself later told the court: 'Two of them were fast behind me. I got to my bedroom. There are two bolts on the door. I just got to the bolt and a crowbar came through and separated the door. 'They pushed the door open. They kicked me a couple of times and trod on my arm and said: ‘Don’t mess about’.' They tied his hands, placed a pillow case over his head and then rifled through his entire house, tearing a grandfather clock from the wall and taking a bronze sculpture. One man held what Mr Reid thought was a knife to his leg as he told them he did not have a safe. In total they stole about £22,000 pounds worth of items from his house. Mr Smith said: 'Whilst at the house they started asking him about the jewellery shop, whether there were valuables there. He had not mentioned he had a jewellery shop.' They bundled him into his Toyota iQ and, with him and at least three of them in the vehicle, drove to his shop, where one of them cut the tie to allow Mr Reid to unlock his business. He went to get keys to unlock the silverware cases but one robber told him: 'I don’t want that s***. Let’s go for the big stuff.' But as he fumbled for the right keys in the dark, the thieves began forcing the cases open with crowbars. Mr Reid was left in the dark. 'I thought: ""No one’s watching me"" and I legged it,' he said. They took £98,700 pounds worth of jewels. Mobile phone analysis revealed calls between Denham and Gunderman, 27, and also that Denham and Evers had both called the same two phone numbers around the time of the raid. Some of the jewellery was recovered after Gunderman had given it as presents to his then girlfriend, Danielle Church. Plundered: The gang forced a terrified Mr Reid to open up Gordon Marks Silver and Goldsmiths in Cobham, Surrey, before they barged in and smashed the display cabinets with a crow bar . The judge told the trio: 'It’s totally plain that this was a professional operation, a gang operating for high stakes, at night, with careful planning. You were all party to a professionally planned and organised robbery of the most serious kind. 'I bear in mind this (charge) was a conspiracy to rob but it was a conspiracy which was carried through completely.' Yet he added: 'I cannot and do not sentence any of you as taking a leading role in this.' All three men had criminal records but none for anything similar to this offence. The judge jailed Denham, from Old Windsor, Berkshire, and Evers, Feltham, Middlesex, for 13-and-a-half years, and reduced the sentence for Gunderman, of Queens Close, Old Windsor, to 12 years because of his guilty plea. Afterwards Detective Inspector from Surrey Police, Jake Nuttall said: 'The sentences handed out to Denham, Evers and Gunderman reflect the severity of the incident, which was a terrifying and traumatic experience for the victim.' Denham and Evers had both denied the charge of conspiracy to rob, claiming cross-contamination was behind the genetic evidence. Gunderman admitted the charge on the first day of trial but on the basis that he had driven others to a location near the house. He abandoned this basis after Judge Moss suggested it was implausible.","Mark Reid, 48, was tied up by the trio and had a pillowcase put over his head .

"By . Sara Malm For Mailonline . Bathroom break-ins: Residents in a block of flats in Sweden have had their homes broken in to, only for the culprit to use their toilet . A series of break-ins in a block of flats in a small town in Sweden has left police baffled, as it appears the culprit has only needed to use the bathroom. Instead of raiding the homes of valuables, the culprit has been defecating without flushing and leaving behind boxes of teabags in flats in Mariestad, south-west Sweden. Residents have spoken of feeling violated and terrified after the mystery person paid them several visits, defecating in their homes, leaving everything else untouched. After first blaming their partners or forgetfulness, residents realised that they were all being visited by the same person, now referred to as ‘the poop man’ in local newspapers. ‘Someone walks in when you are not at home, s****, and walks out again,' victim Markus Andersson, 25, told GT.se. 'I didn’t believe it at first, but now I’ve understood it’s been happening to my neighbours as well.' For the past few months, several flats in the block have been visited by a person who uses their bathroom without flushing, and then leaves. Mr Andersson first blamed his partner, Maria Gard, 22, but after it happened another three times, they realised it was neither of them, complained to the landlord and had their locks changed. Their neighbour, Emmeli Johansson, 22, has also been paid several visits by ’the poop man’, and she says the last time, things escalated. ‘It started two months ago and has happened maybe four times, and on Monday when I came home from work it got worse.’ Ms Johansson says she found three boxes of tea in her kitchen, which she had not bought, and her games console was hidden between two packets of biscuits. When she went to get her locks change this week, she found out that a third neighbour was also a victim. Mystery: For the past few months, several flats in the block have been visited by a person who uses their bathroom without flushing, and one resident was 'gifted' with boxes of tea . Crime spree: The break-ins have been taking place for the past months in Mariestad, Sweden . The doors to all the flats have been locked, but there have been no signs of forced entry, indicating that the culprit has access to the main key. ‘It is a very aggressive action which should be taken very seriously,' says psychiatrist and criminal profiler Ulf Åsgård. 'The perpetrator knows when the resident is away from the property and perhaps also how long.' Mr Åsgård believes that the culprit is most likely male, living in the neighbourhood and looking to feel power over his victims, which appear to have been chosen at random. The landlord is now in the process of installing new locks in the buildings to keep their tenants’ bathrooms safe.","Swedish police baffled after series of break-ins where culprit uses toilet .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . The unnamed woman who was discovered in her home six months after she died . A television network and forensic cleaning company could face legal action after allegedly filming without permission inside the home of a Sydney woman who lay dead in her home for six months before being found. Six month-old expired milk still in the fridge, the chair of unnamed woman fell off at the time of her death and even the remains of her scalp was just some of the graphic footage aired on the SBS current affairs show The Feed on Wednesday. Following the broadcast, the NSW Trustee and Guardian, acting as executor of the woman’s will because she had no next of kin, claims there were no permission granted to film inside the home in Auburn, western Sydney. The almost 90-year-old woman had been undiscovered for so long that when the film crew and forensic cleaner arrived that her body was decomposing through the floor boards.

The remains of the woman's scalp was also show in the SBS segment of The Feed on Wednesday night . The milk in the woman's fridge with an expiry date of January 7 . Trustee chief executive Imelda Dodds told Fairfax Media the only permission approved was for Lee Iordanidis , the owner of a recently deregistered forensic cleaning company, to assess the cleaning job to give a quote. Ms Dodds said the agency would never release any details about the deceased, her assets or her will publically and had not ruled out pursuing charges against either party after being in contact with NSW police over the matter. She also said SBS had been asked to remove the segment from its site but so far the network had refused. ‘The NSWTG will be lodging a complaint with the Australian Communications and Media Authority on the basis of a breach of privacy, Ms Dodds said. The NSW Trustee and Guardian, acting as executor of the woman's will because she had no next of kin, claims there were no permission granted to film inside the house . The woman lived with her husband, who died in an aged care facility in 2001, in their Auburn house from 1966 . Ms Iordanidis, owner of All Gone Extreme Clean, claims she was misled about the focus of the show and that she begged the producer not to run the show. The footage shows Ms Iordanidis pointing to a chair in the kitchen saying 'obviously she was sitting at this seat and the seat has fallen - we’ve got maggot activity and fly activity.' Then she holds up the remains of the woman's scalp while stating ‘that’s her scalp that’s come off her head’. She then went on to describe in graphic detail about what happens to the body after a person dies. ‘Within six minutes the fly lands on the body to lay maggots then you fill up with gases – it actually turns a greeny black and the body  explodes – you’re virtually left with bone,’ she explained to the camera.' Meanwhile, SBS commented that it was acting in ‘good faith’ that Lee Iordanidis had the right and authority to complete the cleaning job. The deceased woman was born in the Czech Republic in 1924 and studied medicine before travelling to Egypt where she was married. She worked as a bilingual translator in Morocco before immigrating to Australia in 1957. Then she lived with her husband in their Auburn house from 1966. He died in 2001 in an aged care facility.

"By . Gemma Mullin . Presenter Evan Davis has been announced as Jeremy Paxman’s replacement on Newsnight. Paxman bowed out of the BBC2 news programme after 25 years in June. BBC director general Tony Hall said that Davis, best known for his role on Dragons’ Den and Radio 4 flagship breakfast news show Today, would do an 'outstanding' job. Evan Davis has been announced as Jeremy Paxman's replacement on BBC2 news programme Newsnight . The news comes after a turbulent period for Newsnight in which an investigation into Jimmy Savile’s sex crimes was dropped and a separate story led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse. The show’s female presenters, Laura Kuenssberg, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis, had all been tipped for the plum role. The director general said: 'Evan is an outstanding journalist, an extraordinarily clever and intelligent interviewer. 'He has a wonderful presence on TV. I’ve got no doubt he will be a really great presence on Newsnight.' Davis said on Twitter: 'I didn’t believe it when I read about it in the papers but now it’s official. I’ll be leaving @BBCr4today and heading off to Newsnight. 'I had been determined to outlive John Humphrys on @BBCr4today so I have failed. But you can’t turn down Newsnight.' Jeremy Paxman said he was quitting because he wants to 'go to bed at much the same time as most people' Davis will be the anchor for the programme three nights a week from the autumn. A former economics editor on the programme, he has been a Today programme host for six years. Davis, 52, studied at St John’s College Oxford and at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies at the London Business School before joining the BBC in 1993 where he became economics editor of Newsnight. In April 2008 he made his debut on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A role presenting business reality show Dragons' Den soon followed. In 2011 he presented Made in Britain, a three-part BBC2 series with an accompanying book on how the country pays its way in the world. He was also one of a number of journalists involved in a BBC1 Panaroma special called Breaking into Britain. Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis and Laura Kuenssberg will all continue to present Newsnight. The programme’s editor Ian Katz said: 'Evan brings a rare combination of curiosity, intelligence and mischief to his broadcasting - just the qualities I want Newsnight to be known for. 'I’ve admired him from afar as a listener and viewer for years, and I’m thrilled that he’s joining us to help reinvent the show where he made his name in the 90s.' Davis, who was formerly an economist before joining the BBC, said: 'While it is a scary prospect, it will be an adventure and a challenge, and I hope the viewers will be happy with the result.' He pointed out that he felt 'terribly sad' to leave his present role and he paid tribute to the team: 'I have been there for over six years and those have been some of the most satisfying of my career. 'That programme is put together by remarkably few people, and I can’t praise them highly enough for their professionalism and companionship,' added the Oxford graduate, who also hosts BBC2’s Dragon’s Den. The move came as a surprise to bookmakers, who had either Laura Kuenssberg, Eddie Mair or Krishnan Guru-Murthy pegged as favourites for the lead role. Betting shop Ladbrokes said it took just one £3 bet on Davis landing the role. David Williams from the company said: 'In bookmaker terms it is what is described as an absolute skinner. 'The odds were 25-1, which sounds like big odds but they were so big because so many people had gambled for the others, especially Laura Kuenssberg.' Evan Davis announced his thoughts on the promotion on Twitter and said he 'didn't quite believe it' Both Kirsty Wark and Michael Crick have taken to Twitter to congratulate Evan Davis on the new role . The BBC Newsnight editor, Ian Katz, also took to social media to congratulate the new host . Kirsty Wark has presented Newsnight since 1993 and was tipped for the spot along with fellow presenters Emily Maitlis and Laura Kuenssberg . Gwyneth Williams, the controller of Radio 4, said: 'I would like to thank Evan for his inimitable contribution to Today, marked by intelligent enquiry, wit and the exposure of hubris. His loyal audience of seven million listeners will miss his take on modern Britain. 'I, personally, would like to wish him every possible success at Newsnight. And I am delighted that he continues to present our idiosyncratic business discussion programme, The Bottom Line, on Radio 4.' Davis's appointment ahead of Newsnight's Kuenssberg, Wark and Maitlis, came as the Trust pointed to a 'continued gender imbalance in BBC output'. It said there needs to be 'a co-ordinated plan from the Executive' to address the issue. It added: 'There have been notable individual examples of a new commitment from the Executive to improve the representation of women on air, and some broader initiatives, such as the commitment for 50 per cent of local radio stations to have a female breakfast presenter by the end of 2014.' On a separate report on diversity, the BBC said it had 2,522 ethnic minority staff in 2012, rising to 2,553 in 2013. The BBC's senior management boards are participating in 'unconscious bias training to address the challenge not to recruit"" in their 'own image'. The report said that women at the BBC have a redundancy rate of 51.9 per cent compared with the 48.6 per cent staff population. George Osborne (left) came under fire in an interview with Evan Davis on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme . Evan Davis has been no stranger to controversy in his time presenting the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. In 2012 he came under fire following an interview with George Osborne where he repeatedly spoke over the Chancellor as he tried to answer questions. The interview began with the presenter asking Osborne if government borrowing would have gone up without income from selling the rights to operate 4G mobile phone services: . EVAN DAVIS: Just to be absolutely clear, if you strip out all of the accounting changes, the Royal Mail, post, the different treatment of banks, the asset purchase facility, all those things, if you take those out and you take out the 4G licence, borrowing would actually go up this year? It’s a simple, simple question, and I am asking you if that’s the case or not. GEORGE OSBORNE: Well, I just don’t think you can strip out... DAVIS: It’s extraordinary you can’t answer. OSBORNE: I am sorry, I am answering your question, it’s not that I am not answering it, it’s like saying if we went ahead with the fuel duty rise in January, which is the same month that the 4G receipts are scored, well what would happen then? DAVIS: Well that would be a perfectly reasonable question but I didn’t choose to ask it. OSBORNE: Or, indeed, what happens if we do or don’t go ahead with the big increase in investment allowances. DAVIS: Another interesting question which I didn’t choose to ask. OSBORNE: I would say the money we get from the 4G receipts, which is an independent number, that money enables us in the round, with all the other things going on, to help small businesses to help fund capital investment, for example in further education colleges and schools. So it’s all part of a whole... what I am saying is that it’s a pretty desperate attempt... DAVIS: Well it’s not a desperate attempt. OSBORNE: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, as you know this is what the Labour Party put out to try and explain the fact that they put out for weeks in advance saying that the deficit was going up when in fact the deficit is coming down. DAVIS: Mr Osborne, everyone was surprised, the Labour Party was surprised, the Institute for Fiscal Studies was surprised, a lot of people, I was surprised, people covering it on telly were surprised, everyone was surprised. Downing Street complained to the BBC following the 13-minute encounter on Radio 4’s Today programme because of the ‘unacceptably hostile’ tone of the interview. His interrupting tactic also caused backlash in an interview with Rochester and Strood Conservative MP Mark Reckless over the issue of increased rail fares, where it was argued he imposed his own bias on staying in the EU. He concludes: ‘I don’t want to get into a big debate over welfare right now. We have got the point. You want to cut benefits. We are out of time.’ Earlier in 2012, whilst presenting the same radio programme, he controversially asked Boris Johnson whether Conservatives were as comfortable as Labour supporters with the Olympic Games as ‘a really fantastic advert for multicultural, multiethnic Britain’.","The show's presenter of 25 years announced he was quitting show in June .

"By . Darren Boyle For Mailonline . Bloodied: Paul Kohler was left with 'life changing' injuries following the brutal attack at his family home . Detectives probing an attack on a lawyer in his own home are investigating whether the assault was linked to a London cabaret bar he runs. Paul Kohler was beaten so badly at his home in Wimbledon, South West London, that his brother described him as looking like the 'Elephant Man'. The 55-year-old academic tried to fend off the four men but suffered 'life-changing' facial injuries. Police say they have launched a 'meticulous inquiry' and believe the attack was 'pre-planned'. Mr Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Aldwych, central London, with Gordon Anderson, who told the Daily Telegraph that he had no idea why his colleague was set upon. He told the newspaper: 'Paul is a beautiful human being. I can't understand how anyone could do this to him.' The 52-year-old explained that the bar was part of the London cabaret and drag scene and that the venture was 'successful and fun'. Asked whether he believed the assault may have been linked to the bar in some way, he added: 'I have no idea. That is a matter for the police.' Yesterday, Mr Kohler's brother Marcus said: 'Seeing him was unbelievable. I have never seen injuries like it. 'His face is like a flower blooming - it’s changing colour every day because of the bruising. 'He’s like the Elephant Man, it’s terrible.' Mr Kohler told the Wimbledon Guardian: 'We’re hoping he will be out soon.' Mr Kohler described his brother as 'a leader' and 'a tough guy'. However, he is facing several more facial operations.' The victim married his long-term partner and the mother of his four daughters, Samantha MacArthur, 50, at Jesus College Cambridge in April. The couple have been together since the mid 1980s. At the time of the attack, Mr Kohler and his wife were sitting inside their £2 million home when the gang approached. The gang were well dressed and wearing balaclavas. Two men have since been arrested and appeared in court in connection to the attack. Yesterday, Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, from Poland with an address in Tooting, South London appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court where he was charged with aggravated burglary and grevious bodily harm. This morning, a second Polish national, Pawel Honc, 23, of no fixed abode also appeared in Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on the same charges and was remanded in custody to reappear alongside Tomaszewski at Kingston Crown Court on August 27. Happy family: Mr Kohler is pictured with, from left, his daughters Eloise and Saskia, wife Samantha and daughters Bethany and Tamara. He is currently undergoing operations in hospital to rebuild his face . The university lecturer desperately tried . to fight off the attackers as they hit his wife and attempted to hood . her and tie her to a chair with gaffer tape. He was probably saved from a worse fate thanks to his daughter who locked herself in her bedroom after hearing the commotion and dialled 999. Police are still searching for the two remaining suspects, who are believed to be in their 20s or 30s and of eastern European heritage. They are also looking for a silver VW two-door cabriolet car used as a getaway vehicle. Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who is leading the inquiry, said the house was left ‘covered in blood’ in the most brutal assault he has seen in more than 20 years of policing. Detectives believe Monday night’s robbery – as the family played a board game – was well-planned and targeted but are perplexed by the motive behind the ultra-violent attack. One line of inquiry is that Mr Kohler, who is head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, is the victim of mistaken identity or that the gang simply struck at the wrong house. Couple: Mr Kohler (pictured with his wife Samantha),  is Head of Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Last night, Samantha said her husband fought tirelessly to survive, saying: 'He was so brave' Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, of Merton Burglary Squad, said: 'The victim and his family are distraught and they cannot understand why they were targeted in this way. We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.' Proud parents: Mr Kohler and his wife Samantha are pictured with their daughter Eloise, who dialled 999 . Mr Kohler remained in hospital where he has already undergone six operations to rebuild his face. He will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead. Mr Kohler’s wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as ‘cowardly and wicked’ and praised her husband’s bravery. The couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids. Miss MacArthur, 50, said: ‘This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat him for no reason?’ ‘He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating him up and he didn’t stop. He fought the whole way and I’m sure if he hadn’t it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.’ The attack took place as the couple played a board game with daughter Eloise, 24, and her boyfriend at their home in Wimbledon, south-west London. Couple: Mr Kohler (left) had gone into the kitchen of his home (right) when he heard the doorbell at about 10pm . During a break in the game, Miss . MacArthur and the youngsters went upstairs and Mr Kohler went into the . kitchen when he heard the doorbell at around 10pm. He . answered the door to a smartly dressed man who proceeded to pull a . balaclava over his face before barging into the house and punching Mr . Kohler in the face. Three masked accomplices then charged inside and . knocked Mr Kohler to the ground. One sat astride Mr Kohler’s chest and pummelled his face as the others kicked him and attempted to wrap his head in tape. Miss MacArthur said: ‘I heard him starting to shout “Help” so I ran out of the bedroom and met two masked men on the landing. CCTV footage in Wimbledon Town Centre shows the suspect running across the street at 10.03pm . Metropolitan Police are appealing to anyone who saw the man or a silver Volkswagen on the night in question . ‘One . of them pushed me over on to the ground and put clothing over my head. I . could just hear Paul shouting, “Why are you doing this?” He was just . screaming in pain as they hit me.’ Police arrived at the house in minutes after her daughter locked herself in her room with her boyfriend and rang 999. After . arresting two men, officers found a trail of discarded stolen property . including iPhones, laptop computers and jewellery. A large kitchen knife . was also tossed away. Scene: Mr Kohler's daughter was upstairs with her boyfriend in the house in Kings Road, Wimbledon (pictured) A CCTV camera caught one of the escaped robbers as he ran off towards Wimbledon town centre. Miss . MacArthur, who runs the popular Cellar Door bar London’s Covent Garden with her husband, . said the family is ‘shaken’ but added: ‘We stayed at home last night and . we are not going to let this stop us living in our own house.’ Mr Kohler . has also taught law at University College London and New College Oxford. He is a chief examiner at the University of London and a member of the . Bar Standards Board.

"By . Laura Clark . Universities will struggle to fill their places because teenagers are increasingly choosing vocational courses instead of traditional A-levels, a report warned today. Teenagers face finding it harder to win degree course places because growing numbers are shunning A-levels in favour of options such as BTECs - perhaps to dodge attempts to make A-levels tougher. As the popularity of A-levels has dipped, the number of top A* grades awarded has slumped nine per cent in just two years. Teenagers face finding it harder to win degree course places because growing numbers are shunning A-levels in favour of vocational options such as BTECs. The trends emerged in a report for  Universities UK (stock image) Universities are now preparing to look elsewhere in the European Union for undergraduates amid increasing competition among campuses for home-grown students. The trends emerged in a report for vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK (UUK) just a week before sixth-formers across the country receive their A-level results. It reveals that universities have identified ‘key challenges’ in their efforts to recruit enough students to courses. These include a decline in the overall population of teenagers and ‘changes in entry qualifications’ including a shift towards BTEC qualifications. While demand for university appears to have recovered since £9,000-a-year tuition fees were imposed, there is forecast to be a ‘weakening in demand’ for full-time degrees among ‘traditional populations’. The report notes that A-levels are still the most widely-held qualification among young entrants to university, with 56.6 per cent declaring them as their highest qualification. But it also reveals that the number of A-level exams taken by UK candidates declined 1.9 per cent between 2011 and 2013, with top A* and A grades falling particularly sharply – by nine per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively. This year’s results are expected to show a steeper fall in entries of about three per cent. But the proportion being accepted to university with BTECs has nearly doubled in five years, from three per cent in 2008 to 5.8 per cent in 2013. The trend towards BTECs will dismay traditionalists who see them as easy alternatives to A-levels. One teacher has labelled them the qualification equivalent of a ‘sub-prime mortgage’. Some have predicted a growth in BTEC numbers as pupils attempt to avoid reforms to A-levels set in train by former Education Secretary Michael Gove. Some experts have predicted a growth in BTEC numbers as pupils attempt to avoid reforms to A-levels set in train by former Education Secretary Michael Gove (above) Pupils already have fewer chances to resit and revamped A-levels being phased in from next year will feature a return to end-of-course exams instead of bite-sized modules and new demanding content compiled by universities. The report warns that ‘changes in student attainment’ have been identified by vice-chancellors as a ‘potential challenge for recruitment in future’. ‘In particular vice-chancellors noted the shifting balance between traditional qualifications for entry into higher education, such as A-levels, and other level three qualifications,’ it said. Universities face further turbulence due to Government moves to unleash market forces in higher education, which will remove a strict cap on recruitment and allow private providers to compete with established institutions. They will increasingly look elsewhere in the EU to ensure their courses are filled, it emerged. ‘A number of vice-chancellors noted undergraduate recruitment from the EU as a potential opportunity for growth, particularly in the context of increased competition among higher education institutions, and decreasing supply of UK-domiciled undergraduates due to the demographic dip in young students,’ the report said. The report follows warnings from UCAS, the university admissions service, that pupils with BTEC qualifications were practically guaranteeing rejection from top universities, and limiting progression at middle-ranking institutions. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to hold vocational qualifications, which were virtually shunned by independent schools. Mary Curnock Cook, UCAS chief executive, warned last year it was ‘quite clear that higher-tariff institutions want to recruit those with academic qualifications such as A-levels’. ‘I think it’s worth thinking about - if you have a done a BTEC in health and social care, you are very likely to progress on to a course in higher education in health and social care whereas if you’ve got three A-levels, you’ve got a choice of probably literally thousands of different courses to choose from. So it’s also a narrower progression route,’ she said. And she warned: ‘We all know about new tougher, more rigorous A-levels and these indeed might be desirable in themselves but I can’t help anticipating that a public understanding that A-levels are getting more difficult is likely to increase this big trend towards vocational qualifications that we’ve seen.’ Earlier this year, she said applications received by UCAS indicated a further drop in the total of students predicted to score three A grades this summer. ‘Taking into account the shrinking population, in five years’ time there could be 10,000 fewer English 19–year–olds with Alevels and more than 20,000 more holding vocational qualifications. The trend could restrict recruitment at more selective universities,’ she said. The report coincided with separate research which delivered a stark warning to the Government over its policy of scrapping controls on student numbers and allowing universities to recruit as many undergraduates as they like. The Higher Education Policy Institute cautioned that costs could ‘spiral’ and the policy had been ‘put together quickly and remains fuzzy'.","Rising number choosing vocational BTEC courses over traditional A-levels .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A Queensland woman claims she found a maggot in  chicken aioli wrap on Sunday . A 'big dirty maggot' was the last thing a Queensland woman expected to find while eating a McDonald's chicken aioli wrap on Sunday. Georgia McDonald, of Gladstone, was two bites into the wrap she bought at the Kin Kora McDonald's when she found what she claims was a maggot. ""It revolted me to the point that I will never eat at any McDonald's restaurant ever again,"" she told The Queensland Times. She said finding the surprise 'creature' in the wrap was a gut-turning experience and should never happen. 'This is not only a health concern for myself, but also a health concern for the hundreds of patrons eating at this McDonald's store on this day or days leading up to this incident.' 'I know McDonald's is not the healthiest option on the market, but when I pay for food from anywhere, I expect that the products used will be fresh, and to a quality which the owner would eat,' she said. McDonald's believes the woman found a fruit grub and not a maggot inside the wrap . Local McDonald's licensee Tony Ward said the fast-food company was disappointed by the incident. Mr Ward said it was likely Ms McDonald had found a fruit grub rather than a maggot and that the restaurant chain implements strict processes and systems to ensure food quality. A McDonald's spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia fruit grubs can sometimes be found in fresh produce. 'We take food quality very seriously,' the spokesperson said. 'We have spoken with the customer and will continue to keep her informed.' The fast-food company said it was disappointed the incident happened and that fruit grubs can sometime be found in fresh produce.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Candace Sutton . and Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . She was born into Australia’s political aristocracy, educated at the finest schools and stands to share in her late father’s $40million fortune. But this week the drug addict daughter of Neville Wran, the late premier of New South Wales, was facing a murder charge. Harriet Wran, 26, told police she was  ‘numb on ice’ at the time of the attack in the inner-Sydney suburb of Redfern on Sunday and had been ‘off her guts for days’. Ex-premier's daughter Harriet Wran is 'addicted to ice' and had been living rough in the weeks before a man was stabbed to death in run-down Sydney unit . Neville Wran died in April this year. He is pictured here with his wife Jill and his two children, Harriet and Hugo . Her spectacular fall from grace was documented in a dramatic few minutes at Liverpool Local Court where she was jointly charged with the murder of Daniel McNulty, a musician and suspected drug dealer. The 45-year-old was stabbed twice, once in the left knee and once in the back, which fatally punctured his lung. A second man, Brett Fitzgerald, 42, was also wounded during the incident and remains in a stable condition at Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital. Wran told police she had gone to the address because she was desperate to buy drugs but never thought that the two men she was with ‘would do what they did’. She claimed that she ‘froze’ and only did what she was told to do because she was terrified of co-accused Lloyd Haines, 29 and Michael Lee, 35, her boyfriend of two weeks. Full from grace: Wran is seen leaving Cabramatta police station on Thursday morning in a grey police forensics suit . Charged: Michael Lee (green jumper, left) and Wran (right) are both accused of taking part in the murder . Police believe that the killing happened after a $70 drug deal went wrong. Wran was described as a self-confessed ice addict who had been living rough after leaving her family’s luxury home in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Woollahra. She is understood to have been battling drug addictions for several years and had been in recovery, only to relapse after her father’s death in April. Wran, who faces charges of murder, attempted murder and break and enter, did not apply for bail. Her lawyer Winston Terracini SC, said that she would plead not guilty and the matter was adjourned until October 8. Lee will appear in court on the same day while Haines is due to appear at Sydney’s Central Local Court on October 9. Wran was last seen in public at her father’s state funeral on May 1, when she and her younger brother Hugo read poems at the service. She wore long sleeves, apparently to cover the tattoos on her arms. Harriet Wran (pictured with her brother Hugo), 26, is reportedly being questioned by police in Cabramatta over a stabbing murder that happened in Redfern on Wednesday . Support: Wran's mother Jill Hicks (left) arrives in Sydney from Brisbane after her daughter was charged with murder. She is being represented by high profile lawyer Winston Terrancini . At the time of her arrest, she had no cash and no cards, and appeared dishevelled. The troubled heiress was born in 1998 into a privileged existence created by her barrister turned politician father and his glamorous second wife Jill Hickson. The couple sent their daughter to elite private schools, Ascham and Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS) in Darlinghurst, before she went to the University of Sydney to study  Modern and Ancient History. She has worked as a producer on The Weather Channel. On her Facebook page, she talks of being 'interested in men', lists 'twisties and chocolate in the afterlife' as her religious views, while to the question of political views she responds with a 'meh'. Ms Wran (right) was by her father Neville's bedside when he died in April this year at he age of 87 . Glamorous life: Photographs of Harriet show her in more carefree times before drug addiction took over her life . Wran had been on a days-long drug binge before the killing and had been living rough in Sydney's inner suburbs . Wran’s father was the son of a seaman and coal lumper who ended up as a Queen's Counsel to the NSW bar, premier of the state from 1976 to 1986 and an icon of the Australian Labor Party. His longevity as leader, coupled with the successful career enjoyed by his glamorous wife Jill Hickson Wran, gave the family an almost aristocratic air, enabling them to mix as easily with the general public as they did with kings, queens and billionaires. This was perhaps best exemplified by the choice made by Diana, Princess of Wales ahead of a 1996 charity ball attended by some of the country's biggest names. 'The People's Princess' decided to give first dance to Neville Wran and the charismatic politician nicknamed 'Nifty' quite literally swept Diana off her feet, to the delight of hundreds of onlookers at the Victor Chang Institute Charity Ball. Stabbed to death: Daniel McNaulty suffered two wounds during the attack on Sunday night . A second man (pictured), 42, was stabbed multiple times in the attack and he remains in St Vincent's Hospital in a stable condition . Mr Wran reportedly agonised over being an 'older father' to his second family, but his younger children were devoted to him as he retired from public life and entered his senior years. He died on April 20 this year aged 87. Both Harriet and her brother Hugo were at his bedside. His death sparked a bitter family battle over the estate; which included a $10 million mansion in Woollahra, as well as multi-million-dollar properties in Woolloomooloo, Palm Beach and the Yarramalong Valley. Mr Wran had two children and an adopted son from his first marriage to Marcia Oliver. He had separated from his second wife in 2006 but they were reconciled in 2011. Ms Hicks is reportedly embroiled in a dispute with her late husband’s daughter Kim Sheftell about the contents of his will.

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the horrific state of a family home left gutted by flames after an e-cigarette exploded while it was charging, killing the neighbour's cat. Victoria Newton, 34, and her three children are 'lucky to be alive' according to fire crews but have now been left homeless. It is the latest in a series of incidents across the country caused by the devices, sparking calls for . tighter safety measures on the new trend. Devastated: Victoria Newton and her children (left-right) Dylan Thomas-James, Millie Anne James, and Lauren James, have been left homeless after an e-cigarette exploded in their house, engulfing it in flames . Gutted: The entire house in Leigh, Greater Manchester, has been destroyed, leaving the family homeless . Ms Newton was at home with her four-year-old son Dylan and her two daughters Millie-Anne, nine, and Lauren, 13, when they heard a bang and the house in Leigh, Greater Manchester, became engulfed in flames. She said: 'It was a nightmare. My daughter Lauren had some friends round and one of her mates had plugged in her e-cigarette and they'd gone out playing. 'About 15 minutes later, I was doing housework and I heard this crackling noise coming from Lauren's bedroom. 'I didn't know what it was and when I reached the landing I just remember this huge bang and I was thrown to the floor by the force of it. 'It had been left on the floor and the explosion sent it flying across the room and it ended up under Lauren's bed. Horror: Just a few of their possessions escaped the blaze, which fire fighters said the family was lucky to survive . Escape: Ms Newton grabbed Dylan, four, as she fled the house after hearing an enormous bang upstairs . Ashen: Even the floorboards have given way after flames crashed through the windows and ceilings . 'I was crawling around and when I looked I couldn't believe my eyes. There was smoke everywhere and the room was on fire. 'The force of the blast had blown out all the bedroom windows and blown the door off the hinges. 'I couldn't breathe and my instinct was just to grab Dylan and get out.' Ms Newton says her two daughters were in the front garden playing when she ran outside covered in soot carrying her four-year-old son. Her neighbours' cat Tinker, who was in the house at the time, sadly died in the blaze. Ms Newton said: 'My first thought was to make sure my kids were safe. Lucky: The devastated family described the incident as a nightmare, the children couldn't stop screaming . Battered: The house looks almost unrecognisable after the device shot out of its plug and exploded . 'My son was screaming and when my girls saw us run outside they heard me shouting 'fire' and they burst into tears too. 'I thought the cat was in the house so I left Dylan outside and I ran back in but I couldn't see or breathe because there was so much smoke. 'It's awful that Tinker died but I'm grateful it wasn't my kids. It could have been so much worse.' Ms Newton added: 'Lauren's bedroom was covered in flames and she's lost everything and the smoke spread to the rest of the house. Devastated: Nathan Huyton, 10, and his sister Ebony, six, are mourning the death of Tinker (pictured) after a fire started by an e-cigarette which exploded in their neighbours house while it was charging . 'Everything is covered in black soot . and the roof is destroyed too. We can't even enter our house because . it's not safe so we don't have any of our belongings. 'I'm staying with my partner and Dylan and the girls are staying with their dad, otherwise we'd be homeless.' She hopes the ordeal will act as a warning to others. Tinker's devastated owner Sean Huyton, 42, said: 'We’re all heartbroken. 'The kids are absolutely devastated. Ebony, our daughter, cried herself to sleep on Saturday night. 'Tinker was just a really good cat, really friendly. Everybody on the street loved him and bought him toys. The majority of explosions and fatalities caused by e-cigarettes is down to people using the wrong chargers, fire crews warn. Though they have a USB connection, they need to be charged using specific e-cig chargers, not be plugged into laptops or iPad chargers, which cause them to overheat. Many people also over-tighten the screwed connection, which damages the battery cells, creating heat. And while mobile phones can be left charging for an extensive period of time, the batteries in e-cigarettes do not have in-built protection to prevent overheating. Therefore, if left too long, the lithium-ion battery will combust and explode. 'We buried the cat yesterday in the front garden. Our other cat Sparkle spent four hours sitting on top of the grave.' Blasting the new tobacco-free trend, Mr Huyton urged for companies to do more to prevent fatalities. He said: 'These e-cigarettes come from all over the world. 'You never really know if they’re safe. Something needs to be done about it.' E-cigarettes are used by more than two million Britons – three times the number in 2012. Last year, Evelyn Raywood, 68, died as a result of a blaze apparently started by the battery of her device. It is the only fatality linked to e-cigarettes, but there have been a number of close calls. Last month a hotel barmaid was engulfed in flame when one exploded as it was being charged with an iPhone charger. A pensioner was also badly burned when her e-cigarette ignited her oxygen supply. And in Leicester, a woman’s car was set on fire when her e-cigarette exploded as it was being charged in the vehicle’s auxiliary socket. Loyal: The Huyton family paid tribute to their moggie and called for tighter safety regulations on e-cigarettes . David Acton, chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, added: 'The family had a lucky escape with discovering the fire when they did, although their house is damaged and they have lost their pet. 'Please can we remind people to take extra care when it comes to electrical items, not leaving them plugged in too long and making sure wires, plugs and chargers are in good working order.' The use of e-cigarettes is also the source of controversy. Last week, the British Medical Association . called for e-cigarettes to be banned in public places and claimed they . are just as dangerous as smoking.","Victoria Newton and children aged 4-13 heard loud bang upstairs .

A British man was detained by Greek police after furious locals accused him of taking photographs of children on a beach. Holidaymaker John Anthony Lane was chased by an angry mob before being held to the ground near a beach in Malia, Crete. The drama unfolded moments after the 51-year-old was challenged by a suspicious parent of a ten-year-old, according to eyewitnesses. When police arrived, they looked at his camera and made the arrest, holding him in jail for five days before he appeared in court charged with taking indecent pictures of children. After the hearing yesterday, at which he was told to pay £3,208 in bail money before being released, Mr Lane told The Mirror: ‘I’m innocent. 'I’ve been in prison for five days. I’m frightened and I just want to go home.’ He was seen visiting a string of cash machines with his lawyer on the holiday island to withdraw the money to pay bail, it is believed. The newspaper reports that the money will be given back to him if he goes back for trial at the island’s capital Heraklion. But under Greek law he does not have to return in which case the cash will be forfeited and the case will be closed.

"By . Christian Gysin for Daily Mail . Controversial MP George Galloway is being investigated by police after declaring his constituency an ‘Israel free zone’. The Respect MP – who has represented Bradford since 2012 – started the row when he spoke to activists at a meeting in Leeds and attacked Israel for the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Calling on party members to boycott goods from Israel, their services and academics, he said: ‘We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone…we don’t want any Israeli goods. Scroll down for video . George Galloway: The Respect MP - who has represented Bradford since 2012 - started the row when he spoke to activists at a meeting in Leeds and attacked Israel for the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . ‘We don’t want any Israeli services. We don’t want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college. ‘We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford, even if any of them had thought of doing so. We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel. And you have to do the same.’ However, just eight days after Mr Galloway’s comments, a Jewish and Israeli group led by Rabbi Shneur Zalman Odze visited Bradford to ‘prove a point’ and claimed they had received a ‘nice reception even from those who weren’t pro-Israel’. The group wanted to show they would not be intimidated by what they described as Mr Galloway’s ‘extreme, arrogant and discriminatory’ remarks. Rabbi Odze even took the time to post a Tweet directly to Mr Galloway along with a picture of the visiting group with the words: ‘In Bradford today with my Israeli friends, we got a tremendous reception – how’s your ban going?’ Destruction: A man heats water for tea on a small fire today under a destroyed tower of an apartment complex that was heavily damaged in fighting between Israel and Hamas in the northern Gaza strip . Speaking after the visit Rabbi Odze said: ‘Britain is renowned for being an open, tolerant and fair society, so for Galloway to appoint himself as a spokesman for the city in such demeaning and dismissive tones is unacceptable.’ 'We don’t want any Israeli services. We don’t want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college' George Galloway . He also dubbed Mr Galloway’s Leeds outburst as a ‘hate speech’. A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘We have received two separate complaints about comments attributed to George Galloway MP during a speech he gave at a public meeting in Leeds on August 2. We are currently investigating the complaints.’ George Galloway has been involved in numerous anti-Israeli comments in the past. During a July 2006 demonstration he stated: ‘Hezbollah has never been a terrorist organisation.’ In 2009 he received a Palestinian passport from a senior Hamas official. Controversial: MP George Galloway has been involved in numerous anti-Israeli comments in the past . In the same year Mr Galloway also helped arrange a series of aid convoys to Palestine after helping to raise more than a million pounds to pay for humanitarian aid. 'We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford, even if any of them had thought of doing so' George Galloway . In November 2012, during an anti-Israeli demonstration in his Bradford constituency, he told those present: ‘We do not hate Jews. 'We hate Zionism, we hate Israel, we hate murder and injustice. Israel blasphemes against the Torah (books of Jewish scriptures) by calling itself a Jewish state.' He later also called for the outlawing of British-Israeli citizenship. In February 2013 Mr Galloway walked out of a debate at Oxford’s Christ Church College when he discovered his opponent was an Israeli, declaring: ‘I don’t recognise Israel and I don’t debate with Israelis.’","Respect MP started row when he spoke to activists at meeting in Leeds .

"By . Mark Duell . The furious granddaughter of a First World War hero today called for church officials to remove a shed which was built over his grave. Private Walter Perry, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, was a member of the Territorial Army and signed up to fight for his country in November 1914. The soldier - from the Northamptonshire Regiment 1st Battalion - was wounded during the Battle of Givenchy in France just one month later, and died of septicaemia in January 1915 at the age of 34. Removal plea: A shed was built over the grave of Private Walter Perry in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire . Location: Pte Perry's granddaughter has visited his grave at St Mary's Church (pictured) since she was a child . His granddaughter, Ann Dallas, 72, has been visiting his grave at St Mary's Church in Bletchley since she was a child. She has recalled how her mother Winifred Chandler was shocked when she went to visit the grave 64 years ago and found a brick triangular building sitting where her father's grave should be. At the time builders had even moved Pte Perry’s headstone without the family's consent to make way for the shed. The headstone now sits less than 4ft away from the shed wall - and Pte Perry was more than 6ft tall. Church officials are said to have continued to refuse to remove the ramshackle structure, which also covers Pte Perry’s grandparents' graves - despite it being derelict and covered in rubbish. Relatives: Pte Perry kept this image of his family while at war. Pictured is his mother Amy (centre), the standing girl is Elizabeth Perry, the boy on her lap is Robert Perry, and the other baby is Winifred Chandler . 'Dark and dank': Pte Perry's granddaughter says the area is 'full of beer bottles, rubbish and even human excrement' Pte Perry’s widow Amy, who died in 1954, had purchased the adjoining plot - but when she died she had to be buried in Reading, Berkshire, because of the shed. 'It would be wonderful if, during this WW1 centenary year, the shed could be demolished and my grandfather could be brought out of this horrible dark place and into the light once again' Ann Dallas, granddaughter of Pte Perry . Mrs Dallas who is a former publishing assistant of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, hopes with all the centenary commemorations for the Great War this week that her grandfather's will be given due recognition. When her mother died at the age of 93 in 2006, she promised to keep fighting to save Pte Perry’s grave. She said: ‘It's a dark, dank and horrible building that obviously attracts the wrong kind of people.  It's full of beer bottles, rubbish and even human excrement. ‘To me it is painful beyond belief that my grandfather's grave should be treated this way. I just don't want to be the third generation of my family to not see this resolved. 10784: Pte Perry's details on a Grave Registration Report from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . Cemetery in Bletchley: This Grave Registration Report form shows Pte Perry's details (in the middle) ‘I believe it is a criminal offence to desecrate a war grave. He fought for our country and his grave have been treated with no respect whatsoever. 'It's a dark, dank and horrible building that obviously attracts the wrong kind of people.  It's full of beer bottles, rubbish and even human excrement' Ann Dallas . ‘My family had lived in Bletchley since the 16th century and there are seven relatives buried in that area.  But my grandmother had to be buried miles away because the shed took up her plot. Every time my mother and I tried to do something about this we got the brush off. ‘It would be wonderful if, during this WW1 centenary year, the shed could be demolished and my grandfather could be brought out of this horrible dark place and into the light once again.’ Iain Stewart, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South, has joined her campaign. He said: ‘I was very saddened to learn that the grave of Private Walter Perry has not been treated with the respect it deserves over many years. Official documents: These papers provide details of what was actually inscribed on the soldier's headstone . ‘As the world commemorates the centenary of the outbreak of World War One and remembers the ultimate sacrifice that so many made, now is the time to put right this wrong.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Liberal Democrats today boasted of victory over Conservative 'siren voices' who wanted to lift people out of paying the 40p tax rate. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said he had won the battle to increase the income tax threshold to £10,500 ahead of next year's election, despite Tory MPs demanding action on the higher rate. Writing for MailOnline, he said increase the threshold is fair but 'many Conservatives don’t like this because it’s a Liberal Democrat idea'. Scroll down for video . Increases in the income tax threshold mean basic rate tax payers will be £800 better off in 2015-16 than in 2010 . The amount of money workers can earn before paying income tax has risen from £3,005 in 1990-91, and will hit £10,500 in 2015-16, George Osborne announced . Millions of workers are to be handed a pre-election tax cut worth an extra £100, George Osborne revealed today. The . amount people can earn before paying income tax is to rise to £10,500 . from April next year, £500 higher than the coalition planned when it was . formed four years ago. And . in a surprise move he will ensure the tax cut is enjoyed by almost all . workers, including most of those dragged into the 40p tax band. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the Tories do not like the income tax cut because it is not their idea . Increasing the income tax threshold was a flagship policy of the Lib Dems, who pledged to increase it from £6,475 in 2010 to £10,000 by the general election in 2015. The policy was adopted by the coalition and became the signature tax cut, despite calls from Tories for a cut in the headline tax rate. Mr Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said he had forced the rise through in the face of opposition from Tory backbenchers. Writing for MailOnline, he said: 'Many Conservatives wanted us to do something different. You . only have to listen to what some Tory back benchers have been saying in . the run up to the Budget urging action on the 40p rate instead. 'Those . siren voices in the Conservative Party also miss the point that raising . the personal allowance helps nearly all taxpayers, including the . majority in the 40p band. 'While . raising the personal allowance is fair and popular it seems that many . Conservatives don’t like this because it’s a Liberal Democrat idea.' The new increase to £10,500 means basic rate taxpayers - anyone earning less than around £41,000 a year - will be £800 better off in 2015 than in 2010. At each budget Chancellor George Osborne has announced big increases in the threshold, which means the £10,000 target will be hit a year early in April 2014. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg pushed for another rise in today's Budget of £500, allowing workers to keep an extra £100 of their earnings. He described it as a ‘workers bonus’ to offset the pain of years of austerity. George Osborne's changes to the 40p tax rate before the Budget meant that 1.3million more people had been dragged into paying it . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has tried to take credit for a £500 rise in the income tax threshold, which will almost all workers are £100 better off next year . Ahead of today's Budget he sought to . claim credit for the policy from the Tories.  'Of course it's a Liberal . Democrat policy,' Mr Clegg said. 'It was on the front page of our manifesto and it's now been transformed into the pay packets of millions of British taxpayers. 'It wasn't in the Conservative manifesto, it was only in the Coalition Agreement because I insisted that it should be. 'Everybody . knows I've been going on about this for over half a decade, while the . Conservatives have been going on about inheritance tax cuts for . millionaires, tax cuts for the very wealthiest, tax changes to give up . your employment rights for shares.' The changes mean that for this year the number of basic rate taxpayers is 24.3million, the lowest since 2006-07. However, Mr Osborne has faced a storm of criticism from some Conservatives for freezing and lowering the higher rate of tax. In 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate. But this year the threshold has fallen to £41,450, which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate.  In 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate. Increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010 . Critics say the higher rate is no longer faced only by the ‘highly paid few’ but hitting middle earners like teachers, nurses and small businesses. The Treasury insists that anyone earning less than £100,000 has benefited at least in part from the increase in the income tax threshold to £10,000, although only basic rate payers have saved  £700-a-year. A typical higher rate taxpayer will be only £56 better of this year than under inherited plans. And Mr Osborne has ensured that the full £100 tax cut in 2015 will be passed to most people paying the 40p rate, up to incomes of £100,000.","Income tax threshold to rise to £10,500 in April 2015, saving most £100 .
Tax changes since 2010 mean basic ratepayers will be £800 better off .
But Osborne offers little respite for those dragged into paying 40p rate ."
"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . When it came to appearances, the most rebellious move his predecessor Jeremy Paxman made was to grow a beard. But Newsnight’s new host Evan Davis clearly has a much more relaxed approach to style. A day after being appointed to front the flagship BBC current affairs show, where suit and tie is de rigueur, the 52-year-old stepped out in an outfit that would not look out of place on a teenager. Scroll down for video . Street style: Evan Davis with his dog Mr Whippy . Evan Davis is pictured at work on Radio 4's Today programme . Taking his whippet - called Mr Whippy - on a stroll near his West London home, Davis treated onlookers to a glimpse of his boxer shorts, visible above the waistband of his jeans, which he wore slung low under his hips like a gangster rapper. And thanks to his fitted designer T-shirt, he revealed a little of his much-discussed tattoo. Some had speculated he deliberately wore long sleeves at all times to hide a tattoo on one of his forearms. But as he enjoyed the hot weather in short sleeves, it was apparent the design is actually on his upper right arm. The presenter - who is often seen with heavy silver chains around his neck and hanging from his belt - completed his youthful street cred look with ripped jeans, matching grey basketball trainers and a satchel slung over one shoulder. Davis is known as ‘Tinsel T***’ to his BBC colleagues because of his alleged nipple rings. He has always refused to confirm reports of multiple piercings and inkings. Asked if he had a tattoo, he once told an interviewer: ‘I’m neither confirming nor denying.’ Newsnight's new host Evan Davis, left, is pictured with the top of his boxer shorts showing (circled red). He clearly has a more relaxed approach to style than his predecessor Jeremy Paxman, right . Jeremy Paxman, pictured, nicknamed Evan Davis Tigger because of his energetic style . To a second question about rumours of an intimate piercing, he said: ‘I’m afraid I’m not going to answer that. ‘Short of getting your photographer to pull me to the ground and unzipping and undressing me, you are going to have to think of me as a man of mystery.’ The former economist, who lives in Earls Court with his French partner, landscape architect Guillaume Baltz, currently hosts Dragons’ Den and Radio 4’s Today programme. He will not take over as Newsnight anchor until the autumn. When Davis worked for Newsnight as its economics editor between 1997 and 2001, Paxman nicknamed him Tigger because of his energetic and enthusiastic style. Paxman, 64, stepped down last month after anchoring the 10.30pm show for 25 years, saying: ‘I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.’ Now Davis will have to readjust his body clock. He currently goes to bed at 8.30pm so he can wake at 3.15am and arrive at the Today studio by 5am. He once revealed he has blackout blinds in his bedroom and uses a hypnotherapy tape to help him drop off.","Evan Davis has been appointed to front flagship BBC current affairs show .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Kenny McDowall has urged those who believe Rangers' return to the top flight next season is a foregone conclusion to exercise caution. The Ibrox club has come through two divisions with ease since being consigned to the bottom tier of Scottish football after their descent into administration and liquidation. However, the Light Blues' assistant manager is aware that the Championship is set to be the most competitive in the land after Hibernian were relegated alongside their Edinburgh rivals Hearts, and the Govan club promoted as League One champions. Level-headed: McDowall believes a third successive promotion for Rangers is not a certainty . Ahead of the visit of the Jambos on Sunday, McDowall said: 'Obviously we are one league away but it is easy to say that, we know that there is a bit of work to be done this season. 'We don't think it is a certainty, we are not saying that. I would like to think we are favourites but you never know. 'We know we have to work hard this season, probably harder than we have had to work before. 'It is an exciting league, obviously Hearts and Hibs coming down certainly makes it more exciting but it is going to be tough and you can't forget the other teams in the league. All the games will be tough. 'But we are well up for, we have a good squad if players who are up for it so bring Sunday on.' While off-field issues and controversies continue to bedevil the Ibrox club - former chief executive Charles Green re-emerged on Friday claiming to be able to raise money for the club - but McDowall, is focused solely on the football and he believes the visit of Hearts is as tough an opening day fixture as Rangers could have been handed. 'It is a great game for everybody,' he said. All ears: McDowall transmits his message to the Rangers squad in a recent training session . 'We are excited about the prospect of the new season and this is a great game to open the season with, so we look forward to it.' Skipper Lee McCulloch will unfurl the First Division flag on a day that the Govan Stand will be renamed The Sandy Jardine Stand in honour of the former Rangers and Hearts player, latterly working behind the scenes at Ibrox, who died in April after a long battle with cancer.

Doubling up: (left to right) Neven Subotic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Erik Durm and Henrikh Mkhitaryan celebrate the first of Aubameyang's two goals in the Cup win . The Super Cup came too soon for Reus, who was ruled out for three months with ankle ligament damage in the 6-1 warm-up friendly win over Armenia. It meant he missed his country's triumph in Brazil but is back in time for the new Bundesliga campaign, which begins next weekend. But Saturday's priority was progress in the Cup and Dortmund took a first-half lead at the Mercedes-Benz Arena through Mkhitaryan, who also scored against Bayern in midweek. Lukasz Piszczek created some space down the right-hand side and his low cross was finished off by the Armenian from close range.

Dortmund started the second period brightly and Kickers goalkeeper Royal-Dominique Fennell turned a shot from Aubameyang onto the post. The third tier side refused to give in, however, and the dangerous Soriano forced Mitchell Langerak to turn his shot round the post before Randy Edwini-Bonsu fired straight at the goalkeeper from inside the six-yard box.

The game was finally made safe when Aubameyang added his second with 12 minutes left from close range.

Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Phillippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson were among those in action at Liverpool's training base on Friday morning as they ready themselves for the new campaign.

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Thomas Vermaelen could be about to join the list of top class players Arsene Wenger has allowed to leave Arsenal to join one of Manchester's giants. The defender, who is wanted by Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, would become the sixth big-name star to join United or City if his transfer goes through this summer. Arsene Wenger has bagged £96million in transfer fees in the process, but was he right to cash in on some of his most talented players? Sportsmail takes a look at the others who have made that long journey – and if Wenger made the right decision. Wanted man: Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen could join rivals Manchester United this summer . Still smiling? Arsene Wenger has sold a number of players to United and Manchester City in recent seasons, but was he right to do so? EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR . BOUGHT FOR: £7million from Monaco . ARSENAL: Nicknamed 'Baby Kanu' when he arrived but failed to win a trophy in his three years at Arsenal. The closest he came was a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in the 2006 League Cup final, when he was sent off for a fracas with Frank Lamapard and received a four-match ban. He was not always known for his work-rate but he did have some magic moments, earning a place in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2007/08 season and winning Match of the Day's goal of the season for flicking the ball up on the edge of the box and smashing it on the volley over Paul Robinson against Tottenham. In 2009 he scored another memorable goal against Villarreal in the quarter-final of the Champions League,  when he controlled the ball with his chest while running backwards then scored a bicycle kick into the bottom right corner. SOLD FOR: £25million . MANCHESTER CITY: He signed a five-year contract, only lasted three and almost half of that was on loan. Adebayor got off to a flyer when he scored in his opening four City games, becoming one of only six players to do so for a new club. But it went downhill from there. Again, he won nothing there, his most memorable moment being when he scored against Arsenal and ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of his old fans. In another controversial incident, again against Arsenal, Robin Van Persie accused Adebayor of kicking him in the face and he was subsequently banned for three matches for it. VERDICT: HIT . Red to blue: Emmanuel Adebayor became a figure of hate among Arsenal fans after joining Manchester City . GAEL CLICHY . BOUGHT FOR: £250,000 from Cannes . ARSENAL: Wenger personally went to Clichy's family household in Tournefeuille, France, to convince him to sign for Arsenal and in 2003 he joined the club. In his first season he was largely back-up to Ashely Cole but played enough to become the youngest player, at 18 years and 10 months, to win the Premier League in Arsenal's undefeated campaign. He added the 2005 FA Cup and 2004 Community Shield to that and was part of the side that was runner up in the 2006 Champions League. But he was another Arsenal player who grew tired of their failure to win trophies and ended his eight-year spell there in 2011. After signing for City, he said: 'It got to a point for me where I didn’t just want to challenge for the titles only to be disappointed in the final weeks of the season. I wanted to play for a club that would win them.' Ouch. TRANSFER FEE: £7million . MANCHESTER CITY: Clichy's comments on leaving Arsenal may have been barbed, but, like Nasri, he has found silverware has followed his move to City. The left-back has twice won the Premier League – again helping the club to their first ever title – and also the League Cup and Community Shield. He was initially back-up to Aleksandar Kolarov but managed to oust the Serbian from the flank and make it his own. Injuries have hampered him recently, but he signed a new four-year contract at the club last year which will keep him there until at least 2017 – so plenty more trophies could be on their way. VERDICT: MISS . Fresh start: Gael Clichy has won two Premier League titles since leaving the Emirates for the Etihad . ROBIN VAN PERSIE . BOUGHT FOR: £2.75million from Feyenoord . ARSENAL: Robin Van Persie's eight-year Arsenal career was both prolific and frustrating. He was plagued with injuries throughout and in the early stages fans were unsure if he was ever going to reach the potential with which he joined the club. But by the time he departed he had established himself as one of the hottest strikers in the world. At Arsenal he won the FA Cup in 2005 and Community Shield in 2004 and was their top goalscorer for four of the seasons he was there - half of them - and twice their player of the year. He also won the Premier League Golden Boot award in his last season at the club, before his shock move to rivals Manchester United. SOLD FOR: £24million . MANCHESTER UNITED: The Dutchman continued from where he left off at Arsenal and won the Golden Boot award again in the first season at his new club. He was unstoppable that year and his 26 league goals fired United to the Premier League title and they won the Community Shield at the end of that summer too. The 31-year-old was one of the few bright sparks in David Moyes' disastrous spell at the club and he ended the season with 30 goals. Under his former Holland boss Louis Van Gaal, who he finished third at this summer's World Cup with, he has the chance to flourish even further. VERDICT: MISS . Danger man: Arsenal fans were left frustrated by Robin van Persie's departure for Manchester United in 2012 . BACARY SAGNA . BOUGHT FOR: £6million from Auxerre . ARSENAL: Sagna spent seven years at Arsenal during which he was one of the best full-backs in the country. He was part of the FA Cup winning side last season, but that was the only trophy he won at the club. He was chosen as right-back in the PFA Team of the Year in his first season in 2007/08 and again in the 2010/11 campaign. Slightly soured his exit from the club by publicly turning down the offer of a two-year contract then joining one of their title rivals. SOLD FOR: Free . MANCHESTER CITY: Cynics would say he has only gone for the money, but the defender vehemently denied that after securing a three-year deal on wages of £150,000-per-week, £60,000 more than he was on at Arsenal. Sagna said: 'First of all, I want to clear something up. I keep reading many things about me, about my salary and me being greedy. But I'm not. I stayed six or seven years with the same salary at Arsenal. It's clearly not for the money. Personally, I just wanted a change.' Only time will tell if he warms the bench or is an integral part of the side. VERDICT: UNDECIDED . On the move: Bacary Sagna is set for his first season at Manchester City after leaving the Emirates on a free . SAMIR NASRI . BOUGHT FOR: £15.8million from Marseille . ARSENAL: Arsene Wenger again used his extensive French contacts to pluck a young Nasri from the country. He was compared to Zinedine Zidane on arrival but, although showing his ability in flashes, he initially struggled for consistency and was not helped by breaking his leg in a pre-season match in 2009. In the 2010/11 season he really took off, twice winning their Fans' Player of the Month award for his displays and scoring 15 goals that campaign. He was nominated for the PFA Players' Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year award, losing out to Gareth Bale and Jack Wilshere. Wenger was forced to sell the player that summer after he refused to sign a new deal and would've been out of contract a year later, allowing him to sign pre-contract agreements in January. 'Football rules are made like that, that the player can be worth a lot of money today and nothing in six months,' Wenger said. 'So it doesn’t look completely logical but, at the end of the day, of course, we are forced into a decision like that for psychological and financial reasons.' SOLD FOR: £24million . MANCHESTER CITY: Regardless of what Arsenal fans think – and their opinion of Nasri has not been helped by his continual digs at his former club – when it comes to silverware the move has been a resounding success. In his debut season he helped City win their first ever Premier League title and then added another one to the trophy cabinet last year. He has also won the Community Shield and a League Cup there. Despite this, his attitude has been such a problem that he was omitted from France's World Cup squad this summer. Former manager Roberto Mancini once said, albeit in jest, ‘I would like to give him a punch' because of his attitude on the pitch. VERDICT: MISS .

ARSENAL: Toure joined Arsenal in February 2002 but did not make his first-team debut until the Community Shield final that summer. He was initially considered a utility player, as a defensive midfielder or right-back having played further forward earlier in his career. But in a stroke of genius, Wenger moved him to centre-back for the start of the 2003/04 season and he quickly established himself as one of the most formidable defenders in the Premier League. That season he was at the heart of their defence, alongside Sol Campbell, in the title-winning Invincibles side who were unbeaten all season. He caught the tail end of Arsenal's trophy-laden spell and also picked up two FA Cups and two Community Shields during his seven years at the club. In April 2009 he handed in a transfer request – which was turned down – after a row with William Gallas, but eventually left the club that summer. SOLD FOR: £16million . MANCHESTER CITY: Toure was appointed club captain by Mark Hughes but had the armband taken away from him at the start of the 2010/11 season when Roberto Mancini took over. He was still a part of Mancini's first-team plans and would go on to win a Premier League title, FA Cup and Community Shield. His time at the club was mired in controversy, however, after he failed a drugs test in March 2011 and was banned for six months. It was the beginning of the end of his time at the club and he moved to Liverpool on a free transfer last summer. VERDICT: HIT .

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Wayne Rooney is a bulldog of a player; he is snarling, growling, teeth baring. He kicks out, stamps, swears into cameras, criticises his own fans. Perfect for a Manchester United captain. No, seriously. The forward is set to be named as the next man to lead Louis van Gaal's side in what United fans are hoping will be a new era of success. He would not be the first maverick captain – and if the others are anything to go by it could be just what the club needs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United's fiery captains, past and present? Captain fantastic: Wayne Rooney is reportedly set to be named Manchester United's new captain . Impressive: Rooney has been given rightful plaudits after a superb pre-season for United . First of many: Can Rooney now go on to become one of United's best players of all time as the skipper . Eric Cantona became the first foreign player to lift the FA Cup as a captain in 1996 when he replaced the injured Steve Bruce. He scored the winning goal against Liverpool then let out an almighty roar as he lifted the trophy above his head. The following season, he was made club captain by Sir Alex Ferguson. Had he not announced his shock retirement after a year, he may have continued on for many more. This was a player stalked by controversy. He spat at a Leeds fan in his first season at United, following his switch from the Yorkshire club in November 1992. There is the infamous karate kick on a supporter at Selhurst Park three years later and the horrible stamp on John Moncur. Yet in equal measures he produced moments of genius. There was the sublime chip against Southampton, the volley against Wimbledon in the FA Cup and the thunderbolt free-kick against Arsenal. He scored vital goals – a crucial one away to Norwich on the way to winning the title in 1993, two penalties at Wembley in the 1994 FA Cup Final to secure the club's first league and cup double and that winner against Liverpool in the 1996 FA Cup Final. They won three league titles and two FA cups in the five years he was at the club – including one league title in his final year as captain. VIDEO United return after successful tour - Rooney favourite for captaincy . Maverick: Eric Cantona was a phenomenal talent and a huge fans favourite at United . In control: Cantona captained United in the 1996-1997 campaign - his last at the club . Cantona puffed his chest out, raised his collar, strutted on and off the pitch and was a born winner. He was an artist; the football pitch his canvas, the ball his paint brushes and the goalposts his masterpiece. It made him a leader. Rooney, too, has shown those flashes of brilliance which were so common in Cantona's career. The overhead kick against Manchester City in in 2011, the first-time volley against Newcastle in 2005 seconds after screaming at referee Neale Barry. Rooney has been doing it since the moment he announced himself on the scene aged 16 with that 30-yard curler against Arsenal in 2002. These are the moments which can fill his team-mates with confidence that their captain can conjure something out of nowhere to drag them back into a tie or win a game at the death. It was none other than Roy Keane who picked up the mantle from Cantona in 1997. His bullish aggression and flawed genius made him a perfect replacement in Ferguson's eyes. Legends: Both Roy Keane and Eric Cantona will go down in United folklore for their contributions to the club . Keane missed most of that first season, injuring his cruciate ligament in a tackle with Alf-Inge Haaland, who then stood over Keane and accused him of trying to hurt him. It was a moment he would live to regret. When Keane returned he led United to the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble. He missed the Champions League final after picking up a yellow card for a trip on Zinedine Zidane in the semi-final against Juventus, but that suspension was indicative of his style. He was another who, throughout all the trophies and silverware, refused to hold back. He entered into a furious row with the club after demanding a new contract only for officials to say season ticket prices went up to fund it. He launched a stinging attack on fans at Old Trafford after a Champions League match against Dynamo Kiev in 2000. 'Away from home our fans are fantastic,' he said. 'I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think some of the people who come to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it.' Class: Roy Keane led Manchester United to four league titles as captain at Old Trafford . Later in his reign he claimed his team-mates 'forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion.' He sought his revenge for the clash with Haaland and admitted he intentionally hurt the player when he was sent of for a disgusting knee-high challenge in 2001. 'I'd waited long enough,' he said afterwards. 'I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c**t. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.' He was banned for a further five matches, to add to his initial three. Amid all the carnage, it didn't stop them winning four league titles, two FA Cups, the Champions League and much more while he was captain. Rooney has that fire about him and his career is filled with moments of explosive anger, too. More to come?  Rooney could go on to lift the Premier League title as United captain in the future . Sharp: Rooney will be hoping he can take his game to the next level under Louis van Gaal . He stamped on Ricardo Carvalho in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final against Portugal then pushed club team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo after being sent off. He was shown a red card for needlessly kicking Miodrag Dzudovic in England's 2-2 draw with Montenegro in the final qualifier for Euro 2012 and was initially banned for all three of their group matches, although it was later reduced to two. He has pushed Rio Ferdinand, swore at David Beckham and again at England's entire bench after being substituted in a friendly against Spain then throwing to the floor a red armband worn in memory of the late Emlyn Hughes. Like Keane, he is not afraid to confront his own fans and criticised England supporters for booing the team off the pitch in their goalless draw with Algeria at the 2008 World Cup. 'Nice to see your home fans boo you,' he raged at a camera beaming back into every home in the country. As well as that he was banned for swearing into a camera after scoring a hat-trick against West Ham in 2011. It earned him a two-match suspension and he missed the FA cup semi-final. Even in accepting the ban, he refused not to have the final say. 'I am not the first player to have sworn on TV and I won't be the last,' he said. 'Unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera, I apologised immediately. And yet I am the only person banned for swearing. That doesn't seem right.' Through all the screaming and shouting and scrapping, Rooney could be the perfect captain for United after all.","Rooney is reportedly set to be named Manchester United's captain .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Richard Spillett . A British couple feared they would drop into the Atlantic Ocean when their flight home from holiday suddenly starting losing altitude at a rate of 500ft a minute. Gary Barton and his wife Caroline were on board a Thomson Airways Dreamliner jet which had to perform an emergency landing in the Azores after one of its engines stopped working. Mrs Barton, 48, said: 'We could see on our screens that our altitude was dropping about 500ft every minute. It looked like we were just dropping into the Atlantic.' Scroll down for video . Gary and Caroline Barton were on board the Dreamliner jet flying to Manchester from the Dominican Republic when its engine suddenly cut out and it started losing altitude . TheThomson Airways Boeing 787 Dreamliner similar to this one pictured at Manchester Airport was forced to make an emergency landing in the Azores (file picture) Video courtesy of Manchester Evening News . The 288 passengers flying on the Boeing 787 from the Dominican Republic to Manchester were left petrified by the mid-air drama, which unfolded miles from land. Mrs Barton, from Leigh near Wigan, said: 'Approximately an hour and a half into the flight we noticed the engine noise change and a dip in the aircraft. 'The captain announced we had an engine failure and shut the second engine down on the right side of the plane and he said we would have to land in the Azores.' Describing what happened next, Mrs Barton, who was travelling with her daughter, added: 'It was a really frightening landing. Everyone was on edge - we were told to expect a bumpy landing because they had to use double thrust on one engine and we could see all the fire engines on the ground. 'Because it was dark it seemed so scary, all those flashing lights, it made everything look worse. They said it was just a precaution but we were very, very worried. 'It was extremely tense on that plane. Our daughter was shaking - she was saying ""what if we don't make it?"".' The couple said passengers were then left to sit on the stricken jet on the military airbase's runway for five hours before eventually being allowed inside. Mrs Barton said: 'It was only when everyone became agitated that the commander let us use their rest house.' Mr Barton, 57, a print engineer, added: 'There were armed guards at the three exits with big machine guns, we couldn't move for two hours.' A passenger took this photo of the stricken aircraft after it made an emergency landing in the Azores . When their rescue plane - a Boeing 767-300 - arrived, they were loaded on before waiting another hour for take-off, arriving back in Manchester after an 11 hour, 23 minute delay. Mrs Barton said: 'We were provided with bottled water and a sausage roll and not an awful lot of explanation other than the fact the engine failed. 'We go on holiday a lot and we fly long haul often but we have never experienced anything like that before. We will not be flying on that plane again.' Mr Barton added: 'They call it the Dreamliner but it was more like a nightmare.' Fears of air passengers have been heightened this year by a series of  disasters and scares. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared from radar in March, sparking a huge international search which has so far failed to find the aircraft or its 227 passengers. Then, last month, another Malaysia Airlines flight, MH17, was shot down over Ukraine, killing all of the 283 people on board. Earlier this week, an RAF Typhoon was scrambled to accompany a Qatar Airways flight into land at Manchester Airport after a passenger allegedly made a hoax bomb threat. A Thomson Airways spokeswoman confirmed flight TOM157 experienced a technical issue and the aircraft diverted to Lajes airport in the Azores as a precautionary measure. The aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Lajes Airport, a military base in the Azores, pictured . December 2009: The first test flight of the Dreamliner takes place - three years late. July 2011: A fan shaft on an engine fails during runway tests at Charleston International Airport, South Carolina. December 2012: A United Airlines 787 makes an emergency landing in New Orleans after electrical problems and a Qatar Airways 787 is grounded after electrical power distribution problems. January 2013: A fire starts in a lithium ion battery pack of a Japan Airlines 787 in Boston in January. A day later United Airlines finds faulty wiring to battery and on the same day that about 150 litres of fuel spills from Japan Airlines Dreamliner during an aborted take-off. Later that month a cockpit window on an ANA Dreamliner cracks during a Japanese domestic flight. On January 15, another Dreamliner operated by ANA makes an emergency landing at Takamatsu in Japan after a smoke alert goes off. This forced all dreamliners to be temporarily grounded amid safety fears. March 2013: A Thomson Dreamliner bound for Sandford in Orlando, Florida, was forced to return to Manchester Airport after it developed a mid-flight 'technical issue'. She added: 'Due to overcrowding at the airport, passengers remained on board with refreshments provided. They were given further refreshments in the terminal before boarding a replacement aircraft which took them back to Manchester airport, arriving just after 5pm. 'The safety of our customers and crew is of paramount importance and we would like to apologise for the delay experienced.' She said each party would be given £100 to cover expenses incurred as a result of the delayed arrival. Launched in December 2009, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was heralded as the future of commercial flight. But the project was dogged by problems from the start.. Thomson is not the only airline to struggle with Dreamliner problems and, last month, two Air India jets destined for Birmingham and Sydney reported serious faults just before take-off. In February, a computer malfunction aboard a Dreamliner also forced LOT Polish Airlines to call off a transatlantic flight from Warsaw.","Dreamliner jet  forced to make emergency landing in the middle of the Atlantic .

Didier Drogba's previous game in a Chelsea shirt proved rather more dramatic as his final kick in a Blues jersey resulted in them winning the 2012 Champions League. But there was to be no penalty kick heroics from the Ivorian on his return to the club, as the veteran striker drew a blank in his first game back for the Stamford Bridge outfit. Chelsea left the 36-year-old on the bench for the start of their pre-season friendly at Werder Bremen's Weserstadion, with the Blues fielding an attacking trio of Diego Costa being supported by Fernando Torres and Mohamed Salah. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chelsea need games - Mourinho . Guess who's back: Didier Drogba made his second Chelsea debut in the pre-season friendly at Werder Bremen . Finding his feet: Drogba was a half-time substitute during Chelsea's 3-0 defeat by the German outfit . Calling the shots: The Ivory Coast striker instructs team-mates during the defeat at the Weserstadion . VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho . A highly ineffective first half from the trio led to Jose Mourinho making changes at the break, and following a poor first half showing, expectations rose as Drogba replaced Costa for the second period. By that point the Blues were already 2-0 down but Drogba certainly seemed up for it as he took to the pitch wearing his old No 15 shirt, pointing to the sky with both hands before the second half resumed. He was straight into the action too as he just missed out in latching on to a Fabregas pass - signs perhaps that the legs may be starting to show their age. But despite an early flurry, Chelsea failed to turn a decent spell on the ball into any serious sort of pressure and Drogba quickly faded out of the game in the central attacking role. Like Costa before him, Drogba simply couldn't make it work with a support cast of Torres and Salah and the duo were replaced 12 minutes into the second half. All yours, skip: Cesc Fabregas gave Drogba the captain's armband later in the game after John Terry departed . Not your day: Drogba reacts by lifting up his shirt after missing a chance on his Chelsea return . What did I do? Drogba's afternoon was one of frustration as the Blues played poorly in the pre-season loss . Shortly after, Chelsea had their best chance. But in a counter attacking move which started from a Bremen corner, Drogba was nowhere to be seen. A quick breakaway saw substitutes Nathan Ake and Eden Hazard combine before squaring a pass for Cesc Fabregas to chip over the crossbar. Drogba was constantly marshalled by Bremen's Assani Lukimya and it wasn't until the 70th minute until he got back into the action - albeit with a clever run into the box ending with his cut-back easily cleared. With 15 minutes to play, the former Marseille hitman had his brightest moment of the half as he collected a Fabregas pass. It looked like vintage Drogba was back, but at an angle to goal, he rifled off target at the near post with options open to him inside the box for a pass. Not that you can blame him for having the temptation to shoot in a pre-season exercise. Drogba ended the game as captain after John Terry departed late on, but rather than help lead a fightback, Chelsea conceded again a minute before time with the hosts scoring their second penalty of the afternoon. Fans will hope a couple more weeks of pre-season training will get him back up to speed with the Premier League. Fans will never forget how Drogba ended his first Chelsea spell in Munich but just as many will soon forget his rather anonymous showing in Bremen on his return two years later.

The new software, called Recruiter, hasn’t yet been fully released, but is already making an impact during this transfer window.

New way of thinking: Managers are using facets of the computer game Football Manager to recruit . Great tool: The new software, called Recruiter, is already being used by professional clubs . Created by world-renowned Prozone in conjunction with Football Manager’s developers Sports Interactive, Recruiter has an astonishing 250,000 players on its database. Details that scouts and managers can pore over include contract intricacies, ability and physical attributes. Those searches derive from the hours put in by Football Manager’s army of volunteers coupled with people from within the game, who meticulously go through their club from top to bottom in order to make the game as lifelike as possible. This evolution has improved the first stage of trying to sign a player and could go a long way to weeding out the wasted days that scouts travel across the world in an initial phase of scouting. With the level of initial detail available on Recruiter, it’s slightly less likely an over-worked scout will be found crashed out at a service station down the M1 after watching Yeovil lose at Sheffield United on a Tuesday night. ‘For years we’ve heard stories of real-life managers and scouts using our data to help with the recruitment process,’ Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson said. ‘From now on, it’s official, real managers around the world will be finding and comparing players using data and a search system that will be very familiar to players of Football Manager. ‘The information gathered by our network of more than 1,300 scouts around the world, combined with Prozone’s amazing performance data, makes this an invaluable tool for any football club that takes player recruitment seriously.’","Sports Interactive and Prozone team up to develop Recruiter .

Mo Farah relived the moment he collapsed unconscious in a bathroom with an illness that left him hospitalised for four days and medical professionals fearing he had a heart problem. Farah had been for a run at altitude in Park City, Utah when he was overcome by excruciating stomach pain, ultimately resulting in his withdrawal from the Commonwealth Games. On the eve of the European Championships, where he will race for only the second time since running the London marathon, the 31-year-old explained the dramatic events which led to his Glasgow no-show. Scare: Mo Farah was forced out of the Commonwealth Games after collapsing in his bathroom . Wednesday (6.50pm) — 10,000m final . Friday (9.15pm) — 5,000m round 1 . Sunday (3.30pm) — 5,000m final . ‘I had a tooth taken out because it was chipped and it got infected,’ said Farah. ‘I was in a bit of pain, but went for a run anyway, and when I came back I collapsed on the bathroom floor, completely knocked out. ‘I had my phone in my pocket, so when I woke up I called Cam (Levins), my training partner, and he came round and got me on to my bed. ‘I was in so much pain from my stomach. He called an ambulance and it took me to hospital. I then had to be airlifted to the main hospital as they thought something was going on with my heart — it was just crazy.’ Farah claimed he couldn’t bear to watch the Commonwealth Games on TV, particularly the 10,000 metres race in which Levins won bronze. Road to recovery: Farah is back to fitness following a 'crazy' illness . ‘It was just too painful,’ he said. ‘I saw the results and Cam did really well but I just wasn’t ready.’ Farah missed a block of training due to illness in July, but it was not until the opening morning of competition in Glasgow that he announced he was pulling out of the 10,000m and 5,000m. Farah hit out at Paula Radcliffe, who said she was ‘surprised (Farah didn’t) give himself a bit more time’ before withdrawing from the 10,000m and instead opted for the ‘much easier’ European Championships. ‘Paula said I’d taken the easy option, which is not fair as she’d seen me struggle,’ said Farah, who is often joined by Radcliffe on training trips. Speaking out: Paula Radcliffe criticised Farah for his Glasgow no-show . ‘I would’ve loved to have come back and continued the road to the Commonwealth Games. I didn’t want to disappoint my fans and all those who had bought tickets, but I was nowhere near ready. I did one track session and Paula was timing me and she told me I should stop. ‘Someone like Paula telling you to stop, you know there is something wrong and I just wasn’t right — she could see that. It took a lot out of me.’ Monday marked two years to the day since Farah won the second of his two gold medals at London 2012. Last year, he did the distance double again at the World Championships in Moscow. He then chose to focus on the London marathon, where he came a disappointing eighth. Flying the flag: Farah is in bullish mood ahead of the European Championships . ‘This year I need to do something,’ admitted Farah. ‘I thought I’d have done better. In track, you can get ready for 1500, 5,000, 10,000 and you can do a lot of speed but with the marathon it’s just a lot of running, a lot more miles and at the end you are pretty tired. ‘I feel I’m 100 per cent for the Europeans and I need to be. There are a lot of good athletes — Bob Tahri, a few Kenyan guys running for Turkey and a few other good Europeans.’ Farah has spent the last week at training camp in Font Romeu, France where he was visited by British Athletics performance director and sometime physiotherapist Neil Black. ‘I think he’s recovered remarkably well,’ said Black. ‘The only people that should be worried are the people who are going to be on the start line with him.’","Farah missed Commonwealth Games after collapsing after training .

"By . Laura Williamson . Dina Asher-Smith, the newly crowned world 100 metres junior champion, will find out her A-Level results before she runs in the 200m heats at the European Championships in Zurich on Thursday. The 18-year-old is hoping for the three 'A' grades in English, history and biology she needs to read history at King's College, London. She 'finds Mussolini really interesting' and is fascinated by the way our perspectives on key historical events have changed over time. Asher-Smith's giggly admission she is 'quite hard to please and always sets her targets high' quickly appears something of an understatement. Sprint queen: Dina Asher-Smith celebrates winning the 100m at the world juniors last month . Victor: Asher-Smith celebrates crossing the line at the 100m in Eugene, Oregon . Balancing her two passions, though, has so far proved productive, as her grades and growing medal collection, which already includes world senior 4x100m bronze, world junior 100m and European junior 200m gold, have shown. Asher-Smith also happens to be the quickest British woman over 100m so far this season. She said: 'I know that I’ve got to zone out from my school and university world if I’m on a race track because it’s not going to help me. Knowing dates and history stuff isn’t going to help me run faster down the track. 'I don’t want to let my academic performance slip and I know for a fact that I’m not going to let my athletics performance slip either. So I’ll have to find a way to make the two work out. The two have to be at quite a high level for me to be happy. 'I like modern history and I find Mussolini really interesting. I might sound really boring but I find historiography so fascinating. Something like Hitler and the Nazis, the facts of it haven’t changed but as we have gone on in time we have a different perspective on it.' Just two years ago, Asher-Smith stood behind the start line of the men's Olympic 10,000m final on 'Super Saturday'; one of 10 club runners from Blackheath and Bromley chosen to carry the boxes of athletes' clothing after the race. She was not allocated Mo Farah's kit, but says it was still 'one of those moments you are never going to forget', even if she's not about to get ahead of herself by thinking of her own Olympic potential in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and beyond. One for the future: The 18-year-old will be competing in the 200m at the European Championships . Balancing act: And she is set to find out her A-Level results just before competing in Zurich . The transition from junior to senior can be a difficult one, but Asher-Smith appears to be taking it all in her stride. She has not been picked to run in the 4x100m relay in Zurich, saying she would feel 'mean' taking the place of one of the athletes who won Commonwealth bronze earlier this month, yet she is clearly not daunted by the prospect of the 200m, her first senior individual event. 'I just think that we are just not scared,' she says. 'I know that might sound really silly but some juniors come up and they put the seniors on a pedestal. They're maybe a bit wide-eyed. I really look up to them, but there is a difference between idolising and respecting them. 'Sometimes I think the juniors can go into their first major event and they idolise too many of these people. You have to have respect for your competitors but you have to realise that, when you are on the line with them, you are going to race. 'You will run the same distance as them. You have to get to the end very quickly and hopefully quicker than them. You have to normalise them a bit and don’t tense up or start panicking. When that does happen, you shut down and you come last.' That changes of that happening to Asher-Smith, you imagine, are very slim indeed.","Asher-Smith won the 100m at the World Juniors last month .

"By . Laura Williamson . There are few summer Olympic champions who would buy a £500 pair of camera goggles to try to reach speeds of 62mph hurtling down a ski slope during the off-season. Even fewer would relish the thought of rushing head-first down an ice track on a bob skeleton sled. But then Greg Rutherford admits he is a ‘possibly a bit bonkers’. The Olympic and Commonwealth gold medallist would happily jump out of an aeroplane if he had not convinced himself his parachute would not open. He has skied since he was three, spent his childhood summers jumping off 30ft cliffs into water in the Peak District and wants to try bungee-jumping when he retires. Going the distance: Rutherford jumped further than any of his rivals yet again at the Commonwealth games . Golden boy: The Olympic champion added the Commonwealth title to his list of achievements . Rutherford, 27 and with his first child on the way this autumn, also has ambitions to try skeleton in September with a view to switching sports in 2018, believing his speed and power would transfer well from long jump to an ice track. ‘If you catch a good jump it is a beautiful feeling of flying, so there is definitely some correlation there,’ he says. His enthusiasm is refreshing, but there is just one problem: Rutherford is a notoriously fragile athlete. His former coach, Dan Pfaff, reckoned he tore his hamstrings 17 times before winning Olympic gold at London 2012, while Rutherford nearly quit athletics altogether last summer after rupturing the muscle at the back of his left thigh. ‘I’m sort of thinking it’s not as hard, being in a crouch position running with a tea tray, jumping on it and praying you don’t hit your head,’ he says, smiling. Up for it: The athlete says he doesn't care that his Olympic winning distance was the shortest since 1972 . ‘The weird thing I find in this country is that when you decide to have ambitions outside the one thing you do in life people find it very offensive. People are saying “How dare you want to do another sport?” but I’ve just got ambitions to do other things. I’ve got so much more to achieve first. ‘I want to retain my Olympic title in a couple of years, and if I get that done, I will consider that a pretty successful long-jumping career, so maybe I will turn my hand to a different sport. If I didn’t do that, I would always wonder. According to some, he was ‘lucky’ to win Olympic gold on ‘Super Saturday’ with 8.31 metres, the shortest winning distance since 1972. ‘Only’ 8.20m was enough to add the Commonwealth title last month. The legality of the new British record of 8.51m he set this year was questioned by team-mate Chris Tomlinson. On top: The ginger jumper wants to defend his Olympic title in 2016 before changing sports . He could back up Commonwealth gold by winning the European Championships in Zurich this week. A field containing the likes of world champion Aleksandr Menkov, 2010 European gold medallist Christian Reif, Louis Tsatoumas of Greece and France’s Salim Sdiri will, however, provide stiffer competition than Rutherford faced in Glasgow. Rutherford knows he may well have to break the British record again to win in Switzerland. Finally, though, that might just shut everyone up. Rutherford said: ‘I won an Olympic Games by half a foot, which you would say is a good distance to win by. But then people dwell on the fact it was the shortest winning distance since ’72... but I don’t care. I don’t care.’","Rutherford wants to defend Olympic title in 2016 before leaving the sport .

"By . Emily Crane . and Australian Associated Press . Rugby league star Darius Boyd has been admitted to a mental health clinic to seek treatment for depression. Boyd's NRL club, the Newcastle Knights, said there was no timeframe on Boyd's return to football, with their focus purely on the 27-year-old's health. 'We are ensuring Darius gets the best possible care and treatment at this time,' the NRL club's CEO Matt Gidley said in a statement on Wednesday. It comes after Boyd allegedly trashed a resort hotel room in the NSW Hunter Valley last week, causing $1,500 worth of damage. Scroll down for video . It's believed Boyd was given a few days off following his State of Origin training and had booked one night at the resort . Boyd was with a female companion, believed to be his wife Kayla (pictured) 'Depression is a serious illness in our society and we are pleased Darius has taken the first step in his recovery by acknowledging he needs help,' Gidley said. 'Football is secondary at this point, it is important Darius' focus is entirely on his treatment.' Boyd and a female companion, believed to be his wife Kayla, reportedly left behind a smashed television, broken glass and a hole in one of the walls when they checked out of the Chateau Elan in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, last Thursday. The Daily Telegraph reports that the manager of the Hunter Valley resort, Joe Spagnolo, said the the incident had not been reported to authorities after the Newcastle Knights player called to apologise and offered to pay for the damage. It's believed Boyd was given a few days off following the State of Origin with Queensland and had booked one night at the resort. The revelation comes just two days after it was announced that Boyd's coach and career mentor Wayne Bennett was leaving the club to return to the Brisbane Broncos - where they first worked together in 2006.'I don’t know what the two of them were doing and I don't want to know. As long as he came good with the money to repair it. The bill came to $1,500 and he's paid it so that's where it's been left,' Mr Spagnolo said. He said the pair had spa treatments on Wednesday and believed the damage could have happened later that night. 'It's disappointing but I've seen a lot worse. We've had the CEOs of banks driving cars on to the golf course and doing doughnuts and causing all sorts of damage,' Mr Spagnolo said. Boyd and a female companion, believed to be his wife Kayla, reportedly left behind a smashed television, broken glass and a hole in one of the walls of their hotel room . The resort's general manager Joe Spagnolo said the incident had not been reported to authorities because Boyd rang to apologise and offered to pay for the damage . 'We get a lot of footballers come in and nine times out of 10, there are no problems.' Knights CEO Matt Gidley said he was not aware of the incident involving Boyd and damage caused to the hotel room. Boyd has been in the headlines since Queensland's State of Origin series loss, with rampant speculation about Bennett's future prior to Monday's announcement. The fullback was immediately linked to Bennett's movement because he's played under the coach his entire career - following him from Brisbane to St George Illawarra, then to Newcastle. Boyd is now tipped to follow his coach yet again back to the Broncos next season.

"Men who wonder how good they are in bed and want to find out if their partner actually faked that orgasm can now find out the truth - all thanks to modern technology. Applying a device to monitor their performance may sound like something of a passion killer but the makers promise it will improve the wearer's sexual prowess. Bondara, a British online retailer of intimate toys, are developing the product which they've called a 'SexFit'. Need help in the bedroom? A new app can monitor a man's performance and then tell them what rhythm to stick to (posed by models) It states: 'The SexFit is worn on the male genitalia and once connected to the mobile app via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, records key statistics and uses vibrations to set a recommended pace. 'Users can track how well they are keeping to the pre-programmable 'training' sessions through LED lights at the top of the tracker. When the centre light is lit, the user is hitting peak performance and matching the rhythm set by the training programme. Too many lights and the user will need to slow down and not enough lights will advise them to pick up the pace.' It added that users will be able to use a button on the gadget to adjust the speed of their 'training session' during their 'workout'. Once recovered, the men can then embrace their inner geeks by logging on to the free accompanying SexFit app for a full appraisal of their performance. Attach before 'working out': The device called a 'SexFit' lights up and has speed controls . They will be able to find out how many calories they burnt between the sheets and their number of thrusts per minute. Those without inhibitions can ever share and compare their results on social media - although most of your friends and family would probably prefer it if you didn't. Speaking about the prototype, Louise Bagley, head buyer for Bondara said: 'The digital health and quantified-self craze has started to infiltrate all aspects of our lives. Too much information: The app even allows you to share your results on social media . 'Our device is a natural fit alongside the influx of these personal health trackers and with the added benefit of improving an individuals sex life, we expect it to be a huge hit when it becomes available. 'With over half of all couples in the UK using a sex toy, this is a massive market driven by innovation. 'That's why we've invested in developing the next evolution of toys, which we hope will bring joy to millions of couples who want to upgrade their intimacy.'

"By . Wills Robinson . While Steve was on a night out in Dublin, he met a woman called Jess and asked for her number. She said yes and, being a gentleman, he decided to send her a polite text message to see how she was the following morning. But in a cruel twist of fate, the number ended up being wrong - and instead he sent a message to the administrator of Paddy Power's Twitter account. Scroll down for video . Prank: The administrator of the Paddy Power betting account tells 400,000 followers that they have received a text from a wrong number and decides what to do . Wrong number: The message is from a man called Steve, believing he is texting a girl he met the night before. The company begin replying to him . Coverage: The conversation is broadcast over Twitter - but Steve still believes he is talking to a girl called Jess . Without telling Steve he had the wrong number, the member of the company's social media team started replying to his messages, pretending they were the girl from Diceys Bar in Dublin. They then decided to broadcast the exchange on the social media site, keeping their 400,000 followers up to date with the flirtatious exchange. The poor punter was known as 'Wrong Number Steve' throughout the conversation, but his number was never revealed. He began by saying: 'Hey Jess, this is Steve from Dicey's. How's the head today?'

They also start to mention sport when Steve asks about Jess's plans . Lucky pants: The pair start talking about their plans for the evening. Steve asks whether Jess is free tomorrow evening . 'Uncle Paddy': The social media team member jokingly pretends that their uncle - named after the company - is taking them to the races at Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland . Scene of the encounter: Steve met Jess at Diceys bar in Dublin and asked for her phone number . Paddy Power then, deciding on what to do next, posted on their account: 'Well this day just got interesting, potentially. I've just received a text that wasn't meant for me. 'Right, I've blocked out Steve's number because I'm sound that way. Help me out Twitter, what do I reply?' After followers share their ideas, they then reply pretending to be Jess, saying: 'Hiya! Heads [sic] a little tender could use some tlc. How about u [sic]?' The conversation then carried on, with every text message being posted on the social media site alongside some commentary - including how many 'kisses' they were putting at the end of every message and how long it was taking him to reply. 'Tease': The conversation escalates after football is mentioned - but Steve is interrupted by a trip to the gym. However, he makes sure he can keep the exchange going when he returns .

When they reveal their true identity, the betting company decide to give him a reward for being a 'great sport'.

"By . Dan Bloom . The hidden loft said to have inspired the 'madwoman in the attic' of Jane Eyre is being opened to public tours for the first time. Charlotte Brontë was reportedly captivated when she saw the room in the stately home of Norton Conyers, North Yorkshire, on a visit in 1839. The novelist heard how in the 18th Century, a 'madwoman' nicknamed Mad Mary was locked in the attic so she would be hidden away from the niceties of life in Britain's upper class. Scroll down for video . Foreboding: This attic in Norton Conyers, North Yorkshire, will be opened to pre-booked tours for the first time next year and is likely to be a hot ticket among book-lovers - as it reportedly inspired the events of Jane Eyre . Secret: This dilapidated staircase to the attic room made headlines around the world in 2004 when the home's owners, Sir James and Lady Graham, discovered its existence and found it related closely to one in the book . ]When Brontë wrote her 1847 classic Jane Eyre, she created the character of Bertha Mason - Edward Rochester's Creole first wife who he locks away in the upper floors of his sprawling manor. The link between the two homes was cemented in 2004 when Norton Conyers' owners, Sir James and Lady Graham, discovered a forgotten stairway in their home which is described vividly in the book. Now the public will be able to book tours of the attic for the first time after a long-running £500,000 conservation project to stop the house from falling into disrepair. Sir James and Lady Graham, who emptied the house for the overhaul in 2006, made the announcement as their project won a major award. The restoration prize, to be announced tomorrow by the Historic House Association and auction house Sotheby's, recognises a long struggle by the couple to make the attic accessible to more people. Enduring: Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre focused on the life of the governess of the same name (pictured) Lady Graham told MailOnline: 'While we're restoring other parts of the house, we wanted to leave the attic exactly as it is. It wouldn't have the right atmosphere if it was given a new coat of paint. 'The house itself is extremely ancient - we've discovered it has Viking origins and the timbers including in the attic date to the late Medieval period - so we can't have hordes of people.' Although the uneven, wonky staircase will not be suitable for everyone, the couple hope to open the attic rooms to pre-booked small groups from July next year. The Mad Mary story was unsurprising given the times in which she lived, Lady Graham added. 'If you had a relative that was mad or eccentric it would be a social disgrace,' she said. 'If you had someone with symptoms of madness you would hide them as far away from everybody as you could.' The house made headlines around the world in 2004 when the owners, who have had Norton Conyers in their family since 1624, found a hidden staircase to their attics. Historic: The oldest parts of the building including its timber frames date back to the late Medieval period . Desolate countryside: Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre in a 2011 film adaptation of the classic Victorian novel . Many believe the stairway, which leads eventually to the furthest room where the 'madwoman' was said to have lived, is the same one described as leading to the attic in the fictional Thornfield Hall. In the classic book, Bertha Mason lives hidden in the attic as her husband Edward Rochester courts his home's young governess, Jane Eyre. But on the eve of her wedding, his spurned wife sneaks into Jane's room at night and rips her wedding veil in two. Eventually the secret is discovered and ends in tragedy, when Mr Rochester's first wife burns down the house and takes her own life. Her 'madness' has been interpreted by many scholars as a study of how Englishmen of the time unfairly stereotyped foreigners - from Jamaica, in her case - as wild people who had to be tamed.","Secret staircase to room rediscovered at Norton Conyers, North Yorkshire .

"By . Lucy Crossley For Mailonline . A mechanic has been found guilty of stabbing his ex-lover, who was also his stepdaughter, to death in a jealous rage after discovering she was in a new relationship. Simon Meecham, 43, launched a 'determined, focussed and wholly unprovoked attack' on 26-year-old Leanne Meecham at her home in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, in February. Meecham, who had been married to Miss Meecham's mother Jane before embarking on the six-year relationship in 2007, attacked her the day before Valentine’s Day after hearing she had a new partner. Guilty: Simon Meecham, 43, (left) was found guilty of murdering his stepdaughter and former lover Leanne Meecham, 26, (right) after learning she was in a new relationship . Today, a jury of eight women and four men found him guilty of murder following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. During the trial, Jocelyn Ledward, prosecuting, told the court that Meecham had been driven by 'possessiveness and jealousy of the fact she was moving on with her life'. He bombarded the victim with phone calls begging her to take him back before telling her that 'if he could not have her, nobody else could'. Police were called to Miss Meecham’s home at around 8.30am on February 13 this year, where she was found with multiple stab wounds. She was immediately airlifted to the Royal London Hospital, but later died from her injuries. Meecham then fled across Southend-on-Sea in Essex before he was arrested and taken to hospital under police guard for treatment of self-inflicted knife wounds. Probe: A police officer stands guard outside Miss Meecham's home in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, while forensic experts search the area outside the house . Investigation: Police forensics officers examine Simon Meechum's Landrover Discovery shortly after he was found in it with knife-wounds following the attack in February . In court, he had attempted to claim that he had stabbed his stepdaughter by accident but the jury refused to believe his lies and found him guilty of murder. 'Leanne Meecham was much loved by her . family and was a devoted mother,' said Senior Investigating Officer DCI . Mark Hall, from the Kent & Essex Serious Crime Directorate. 'On the morning of February 13, Simon Meecham went to Leanne’s home armed with a knife. 'He had discovered that she had started a new relationship and he was consumed by jealousy. 'Shortly after he arrived he fatally wounded Leanne, stabbing her multiple times. 'She was totally defenceless against what was a determined, focussed and wholly unprovoked attack. 'My thoughts are with Leanne’s family and I hope that his conviction brings them some small comfort. 'This tragic case illustrates the dangers faced by those who suffer violence and abuse within their homes.' After the verdict, Miss Meecham's family paid tribute to the 'precious' young mother. 'In February our family lost our precious Leanne at the hands of Simon Meecham. 'She was a special sister, daughter, mother and friend. 'The past six months have been especially hard for us as we struggle to come to terms with how Leanne was taken from us. 'Despite the conviction of her killer, his term of imprisonment will never be sufficient punishment for taking Leanne from us. 'We will now try to move on with our lives, remembering Leanne and the wonderful times that we shared.' Meecham, from Shoeburyness, Essex, is due to be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday.","Simon Meecham, 43, attacked Leanne Meecham, 26, at her Essex home .

"By . Amanda Williams For Mailonline . A teenager accused of murdering a mentally disabled man for his coat and mobile phone was identified from CCTV footage and taken to police by his own mother, a court has heard. Dean Mayley, 24, who was vulnerable due to a brain disorder, was targeted for his North Face jacket as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the Old Bailey heard. Images of the alleged attack were released to the media, and the 17-year-old, who cannot be named, handed himself in. When asked why he had come to the police station, the 17-year-old replied ‘I don’t know’. Dean Mayley, 24, hugging his seven-year-old nephew Callum. He was targeted for his North Face jacket as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the Old Bailey has heard . But his mother told officers: ‘I have come here to get him eliminated from this investigation. I know it’s my son.’ The court heard Mr Mayley suffered from microcephaly, a developmental condition that meant he had a mental age of around nine years, and was naturally trusting and vulnerable. It is claimed the teenager was one of three youths who approached Mr Mayley and tried to rob him of his jacket at knifepoint. Following his arrest, the 17-year-old gave a prepared statement admitting the CCTV image showed  him at a nearby KFC but denying he was involved in the robbery or the murder. He told officers: ‘I went to get some food and was hanging out with my friends. I didn’t see anyone with a knife and was not aware of any knife on them. I am shocked and distraught I have been arrested for this offence.’ Pic shows cctv still image of Dean Mayley, walking along the street after exiting the E9 bus. The court heard Mr Mayley suffered from microcephaly, a developmental condition that meant he had a mental age of around nine years, and was naturally trusting and vulnerable . It is claimed the teenager was one of three youths who approached Mr Mayley and tried to rob him of his jacket at knifepoint . The 17-year-old was later charged with murder alongside alleged getaway driver Michael Mensah, 18, Ryan Beresford, 19, and another 17 year-old who is said to have inflicted the fatal stab wound to Mr Mayley’s chest. Jurors heard Mensah has previous convictions for carrying knives. On 21 September 2013 he was arrested with a 12cm blade in his trainer and a samurai sword in the boot of his Fiat Punto. Four months later on 12 January 2014 a locknife was found underneath the driving seat of the Punto when he was stopped by police. The 17 year-old who is accused of stabbing Mr Mayley during the attempted robbery made no comment in police interview, the court heard. But when police searched his prison cell on 23 May 2014 they found a handwritten letter from Mensah on his desk. In it Mensah told the 17 year-old to claim he was on ecstasy at the time of the killing and could not control himself. The letter continued: ‘Stop acting like a f***ing kid and come correct big man ting. Someones died and if you don’t f***ing get serious and work with man to buss this your loosing your life to jail. ‘And your gonna cry like a b***h, your smiling now but you’ll cry like a b***h so fix up and come in my class so we can chat and get shit right before we go Court.’ Mensah also warned the teenager: ‘Never in your life say out loud I told you to rob anyone on a Big Man Ting, on my life never say it out loud, its not a joke.’ He added: ‘I can’t get joint enterprise because there was never an enterprise to join. I wasn’t involved in the robbery so I’m not liable. 'You did the robbery but you wasn’t in control, your mental state wasn’t correct so doing it wasn’t your fault so its manslaughter.’ CCTV footage of Beresford and the two 17 year-old boys stalking Mr Mayley as he walked home has been shown to jurors. Mr Mayley was given first aid at the scene by police and paramedics before being taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 7.02pm. Mensah, of Hanwell, Beresford, of Acton, and one of the 17-year-olds, of west London, all deny murder and attempted robbery. The second 17-year-old, of West London, denies murder but has admitted the attempted robbery of Dean Mayley. Mensah also denies robbery of a 15 year-old boy on 28 January. The prosecution have now closed their case and the trial continues.

"By . Ashley Collman For Mailonline . Daniel Colman won the second-highest prize in poker history last night, but his face gave no clue. The 23-year-old poker sensation took home $15.3million when he beat out card-playing veteran Daniel Negreanu at the final table of the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas on Tuesday. But after the final card secured his win, he kept his poker face on and refused to even grant interviews. Scroll down for video . Reserved: Daniel Colman, 23, won the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas Tuesday night but refused to smile after the victory . Unimpressed: Colman's $15.3million prize is the second-highest in poker history, but he didn't want to talk about it with reporters after the event . Don't spend it all at once: Colman pictured posing with his winnings before leaving the tournament . Colman, from Boston, Massachusetts, beat out 41 other players in the tournament to benefit the One Drop Foundation but he had to be persuaded to even pose with his cash prize and bracelet. Five minutes after the victory, he left the Rio Las Vegas hotel with a handler telling a Las Vegas Sun reporter he had 'no interest in promoting poker'. Colman's behavior was quite a contrast to that of his competitor, Negreanu, who stayed on the stage for 30 minutes after the event to talk to reporters. He holds no ill-opinion of Colman for his behavior after the win though. 'I respect it completely,' Negreanu said of Colman. 'To each his own. If it’s not something he wants to do then I think we should all give him a break.' Colman's opponent Daniel Negreanu was much more livelier during the event, before Colman won . No big deal: Colman pictured going all in on the last hand . Negreanu certainly wasn't grieving the loss too much, since placing second in the tournament earned him  $8.3million - making him the new all-time winningest  player with a $29.8million poker fortune. Colman's behavior should be understood considering the difference between professional poker players and athletes when it comes to TV. While athletes have TV contracts included in their pay, poker players do not and have to front their own entrance into tournaments -  therefore getting nothing from a network like ESPN televising their game or interview. It is also rumored that Colman may have only invested 10 per cent of his $1million entry into the tournament, meaning his actual winnings from Tuesday are just $1.53million.","Poker player Daniel Colman, 23, won the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas on Tuesday, but refused to get emotional about the victory .

Bound to be his day: The sun shines down on McIlroy as he hits his tee shot on the 12th hole . Victory in the Masters, which he led by four shots before collapsing to a closing 80 in 2011, would also take the Northern Irishman three quarters of the way to holding all four major titles at the same time, ahead of the US Open at Chambers Bay. Woods is the only player to have achieved that feat by winning the US Open, Open and US PGA in 2000 and the Masters in 2001. 'When I won the Open Championship I said that there would be a lot of hype going into Augusta, which there obviously will be,' said McIlroy, who admitted winning 'ugly' was more satisfying than his previous more emphatic major victories. 'And if I was somehow to win there, it would obviously be a lot of hype going into the US Open. 'We'll take it one step at a time. We can't get ahead of ourselves here. I'm playing some great golf at the minute and I want to keep this run going as long as I can, and hopefully I'm in just as good form heading into Augusta next year and have a chance to win the career Grand Slam. 'If that happens, then we'll turn our attention to Chambers Bay and I'll try and get the job done there. 'I said I thought winning the Open Championship a few weeks ago had sort of put me on a higher level in this game. But then to win a fourth major here, to be one behind Phil (Mickelson), one behind Seve (Ballesteros), level with Ernie (Els), level with Raymond Floyd.... I never thought I'd get this far at 25 years of age. 'It's something that I'm just going to have to come to terms with. I was happy being a two-time major champion coming into this year and all of a sudden I'm a four-time major champion and going for the career Grand Slam at Augusta in 242 days - not that I'm counting!' Even before Sunday's one-shot over Mickelson, which was completed in near-darkness after a lengthy rain delay, there had been talk of Woods' era being over and McIlroy's just beginning. But the world number one knows he has a long way to go before getting near the 14 majors won by Woods and the record of 18 held by Nicklaus.

VIDEO PGA Championship - Day 2 highlights . 'I think I've got to take it one small step at a time,' added McIlroy, who will parade the Claret Jug - and possibly the Wanamaker Trophy - at Old Trafford ahead of Manchester United's game with Swansea on Saturday. 'I think the two next realistic goals are the career Grand Slam and trying to become the most successful European player ever in the modern era. Nick Faldo has six majors. Seve has five. 'And hopefully, when I achieve those, I can start to think about other things.' Whether it was intentional or not, it was noticeable that McIlroy said 'when' rather than 'if' in that sentence. A year after labelling his own play 'brain dead' after missing the cut in the Open and struggling with his new equipment, McIlroy is riding the crest of a wave that shows no sign of slowing down. 'I've got that sense of belief in myself now that I go into every tournament I play knowing that I can win,' added McIlroy, who won his first World Golf Championship event at the Bridgestone Invitational between his major triumphs. 'It's a great feeling to have. 'I think I've always had that sense but after this run of golf, it's confirmed that I can turn up at any tournament anywhere in the world and know that if I play my game, I can walk away with a trophy.'

"By . Richard Spillett . Impressionist painting is most commonly associated with the banks of the River Seine in Paris or the haystack-studded fields of Normandy. But according to a magazine advert this week, the famous art movement has a new home - Weymouth, Dorset. The seaside town was mistakenly pictured in a Radio Times travel promotion this week, which showed a photo of local attraction, Bennetts Water Gardens, instead of the pond in Giverny, France where Claude Monet painted his famous water lilies. The family-run centre on the south west coast looks very similar to the garden where Monet lived and worked and to which the Radio Times is advertising seven-day trips for £699 per person. The advert in the Radio Times (above, left) mistakenly featured Bennetts Water Gardens in Weymouth instead of Monet's garden in Giverny, France, where he painted the famous masterpieces (below) The image used to illustrate the trip being offered to readers shows a footbridge that crosses the main lily pond at Bennetts Water Gardens, a former clay pit which gets 20,000 visitors a year. Though impressive, the number of tourists visiting the Dorset attraction is somewhat dwarfed by the 500,000 visitors a year who head to Monet's garden. The pond in Giverny, along with the Japanse footbridge which spans it, were immortalised in a series of 18 paintings by the French impressionist over a 20-year period from 1899. In 2008, one of the paintings sold for nearly £41 million at auction in London. Bennetts decided to build a replica of Monet's Japanese bridge over its main lily pond in 1999 after an old one fell into a state of disrepair. The green-painted walkway leads tourists to the attraction's gift shop. The cafe has also been renamed the Cafe Monet in honour of the famous artist. The gardens at the  Dorset centre (above and below) are modelled on the famous impressionist paintings but Monet never visited the ex clay pit in south west England . James Bennett, the curator at Bennetts, said: 'We had a bridge over our main pond before but it needed replacing in 1999 which was the 100th anniversary of Monet's water lily series. 'We built a Japanese bridge to recreate Claude Monet's famous gardens. We get a lot of visitors here who have been to Giverny and they do make comparisons between the two. We also get lots of photographers taking pictures of the view. 'I have never been to Giverny, simply because the best time of the year to go is now when the lilies are out which is also our busiest time. 'I saw the photograph in the Radio Times and realised, without a doubt, that it is our lily pond in the picture.' The curator of Bennetts said he was 'bemused' when he saw the picture of his workplace in the magazine . He added: 'We are a bit bemused by it but I suppose it is a bit of a compliment to us. We must be doing something right. 'We haven't yet told the Radio Times but they probably need to know that the picture they are using is a copy of Monet.' A spokesman for the Radio Times said: 'The advertisement was produced by a third party company, who sourced the image from a picture library where it was labelled incorrectly. 'However, having studied the very small picture the similarity is indeed remarkable and our readers will be pleased to know they can experience Monet's garden in Weymouth as well as France.'","Mix-up meant advert featured pond in Dorset  rather than French countryside .

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . Food and fashion isn't the most likely of pairings (unless it involves kale), however one North London bakery is determined to marry the two together. Bunny Little's Bakery in London's Tuffnell Park runs with the ethos 'food is my fashion' and creates delicious bespoke cakes inspired by the latest catwalk trends. The bakery is the brain child of Katy Taylor and her wife Anabel Fielding and draws on Katy's experience in the fashion industry to create the stylish sweets which such as 'Stella McCartney star biscuits' and 'Erdem cupcakes'. Fashionable foodie: Katy set up Bunny Little's bakery where she combines her style knowledge with her passion for baking . Katy  is no stranger to fashion having worked as a fashion writer, editor and stylist for top global magazines including Vogue and Tatler. She had previously dipped her toes into the catering world by helping to cater for events hosted by Anabel in her role as CEO of global event company for the stars Quintessentially Events. Katy had always dreamed of opening her own bakery and finally quit the fashion rat race to pursue her passion nine months ago. If anyone is able to fuse the unlikely pair of fashion and food Katy is the woman for the job but even she admits that it isn't the most obvious combination. 'As a stylist, for me I have always related fashion back to food which is a bit of a weird combination but it comes down to the same concept. 'It's about creating a look and editing it down, both industries are very entwined.' Celebrity favourite: Bunny Little attracts all sorts of famous faces including Damian Lewis and Kate Beckinsale . For Katy the process of turning haute couture into hot cakes is one that requires a lot of thought. The pieces that inspire her creations affect everything from the decoration right down to the texture of the cake. 'I look at the brand and the latest catwalk images and I examine the colours and get a feel for the trend. I look at the fabrics, are they light? Then I might create a lighter cake.' Katy is well aware of the fashion industry's mild phobia of sugary food and has catered accordingly. 'I think about who would buy the clothes if they were female then maybe I would make a brownie bite rather than a great big slab.' Bunny Little's bakery gained it's title from Katy's nickname after friends compared her to the Energiser bunny. However, Katy is not one to lend her name to a company she isn't involved with and insists on being as hands on as possible. Katy was inspired by the floral design of Erdem, right, when she created these lemon and pistachio cupcakes . Knows her stuff: Before opening the bakery had worked at many fashion publications including Vogue and Tatler . 'The bakery has been open nine months now and I am there every morning. We are a little local bakery and opening a small business is really competitive. 'I think it is really important to go in every day in order to build up a relationship with your customers.' Katy has entered an industry that is booming. The first episode of this year's Great British Bake Off fetched viewing figures of 6.3million and Mary Berry's empire is currently worth a tasty £5m. Katy agrees that she has entered the business at the right time and she believes that we all deserve a treat. 'Oh there’s definitely a huge trend for baking right now. Everyone works so hard these days I think baking provides that bit of escapism especially during the winter when you’re nesting a bit more. 'It's great to produce something where you know where all of the ingredients have come from. I think that is really important to people these days because we are all so educated about food origins.' That's another thing about Katy, she knows her audience and isn't as complacent to believe that she can make a business out of pretty cakes alone. The 32-year-old has now expanded the bakery into a deli too selling gourmet sandwiches every lunch time. 'And we have three different kinds of sausage rolls!' she adds. 'We have also just got a license to sell alcohol which is great so customers can buy a lovely red or rose that I have picked out and take it away for dinner.' Despite having been open for less than a year, Bunny Little has gained itself quite the reputation with several celebrities frequenting the bakery. 'Damian Lewis comes in all the time,' says Katy adding that her bakery is soon to make an appearance in a Hollywood blockbuster. 'Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale have been filming Absolutely Anything together and they set some of it in the shop. We closed it for four days so I hope they don't edit us out!' Although Katy is thrilled to have attracted several A-listers her ambitions for her shop lie much closer to home. 'We want people to come and buy their morning coffee from us rather than a coffee chain where it all tastes a bit burnt. 'Me and Anabel always regret the things we don't do and we wanted to make something that our community would be proud of.' TIE-DYE CUPCAKES . Ingredients: . Method for the Cupcakes: . 1.

"By . Julian Robinson . A quarter of Britons have had an affair according to a study which reveals that most people are not satisfied with their sex life. One in four people admit to being unfaithful at one time in their lives and a fifth of those surveyed have felt tempted to cheat in their current or past relationships. Nearly one in three men and more than one in five women claim to have had more than ten sexual partners. But the majority are still not satisfied, with less than half enjoying a rewarding sex life and a . quarter saying they were left unfulfilled. Scroll down for video . A quarter of Britons have had an affair according to a study which reveals most people do not enjoy a rewarding sex life (file picture) The . figures were released by the charity Relate in a report called The Way . We Are Now which documents the state of the UK's relationships in 2014. Four years ago a similar report found that one in three people admitted to having been unfaithful. ‘Changes in attitudes towards separation and divorce may mean that it’s now easier to leave an unhappy relationship rather than be unfaithful,' the report says. Meanwhile less than half of those who took part in the survey claimed to enjoy a rewarding sex life and a quarter said they were left unfulfilled. But nearly 60 per cent said they had never had an affair and had not even been tempted to do so, the report adds. And only a third of those asked believed a relationship could survive an affair. Relate researchers found that the number of sexual partners peaked among those aged between 35 and 44 with more than 20 per cent reporting they had bedded 20 or more people. Less than half of those who took part in the survey claimed to enjoy a rewarding sex life and a quarter said they were left unfulfilled (file picture) At the other end of the scale, the report adds, nearly one in ten reported that they had never had a sexual partner with a fifth only ever having slept with one person. The report says: 'When it comes to our sex lives, it seems that we’re a nation divided – around half of those surveyed are fairly or very satisfied with their sex lives but for a significant minority, experience falls short of expectations. 'Despite – or perhaps, because of – the wealth of information available about sex on the internet, in magazines and on TV, our survey found that many people don’t know where to go to get practical advice or who to talk to about problems in their sex life.'","Quarter of Britons have had an affair according to the latest sex survey .

"By . Nasser Hussain . The key to this series will be whether India’s seamers manage to bowl as well as their Sri Lankan counterparts did in England recently. We all know what superb batsmen India have, but the problems they have had winning overseas Tests in the past three years have stemmed from their inability to take 20 wickets. And that places a huge onus on the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma. Scroll down for video... Due a performance: Alastair Cook needs to score some runs for England against India . Stepping up: England pair Ben Stokes (left) and Gary Ballance also need to perform with the bat . VIDEO Cook focused on form change . When India won in England in 2007, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh bowled beautifully. Even when they lost here 4-0 three years ago, Praveen Kumar enjoyed success by pitching the ball up. But if their frontline trio — plus Stuart Binny, if he plays — fails to fire this time, they could be in trouble. Looking at this England batting line-up, there is an obvious approach India can take, because so many of the batsmen like to hang back — Alastair Cook, Gary Ballance and Joe Root. Even Sam Robson, who tries to get forward, has been vulnerable to the fuller delivery. The days when you had four different styles in Cook, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen are gone. Now, if you pitch the ball up in the right place — just outside off-stump — five times every over, you’ll have a chance against all of these back-foot players. India could do worse than take a leaf out of Sri Lanka’s book. The Sri Lankans arrived here with an unheralded seam attack of Shaminda Eranga, Dhammika Prasad and Nuwan Pradeep, but they ended up bowling better lengths than England’s seamers, even at Headingley. While India’s coach Duncan Fletcher may still have concerns about his bowling attack, he will not have any at all about the batsmen. When he first took the job three years ago, he was aware of the batting talent that was coming through — and Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli are a joy to watch. Sometimes when you watch overseas players, you fear for their techniques in English conditions. But these guys seem to be the complete package. And the amazing thing is that they want to keep getting better. Concerns: India coach Duncan Fletcher may be worried about his bowling attack for the series . Star: Virat Kohli is the new name of Indian cricket following the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar . Since the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli has probably passed MS Dhoni as the biggest name in Indian cricket, yet he has the demeanour of a player who wants to learn as much as he can. Good isn’t good enough: he wants to be great. I’m not expecting him or Pujara to settle for any flashy 40s or 50s in this series: they will want to bat big. And that could hurt England. The reality is, though, that both sides go into this series low on confidence. India have not won any of their past 14 away Tests and are not used to playing five-Test series, while England haven’t won any of their past eight — either home or away. You would expect England to start as favourites, but then we said that against Sri Lanka. The key for England will be for Cook to get all the individual performances we saw against the Sri Lankans to mould into a match-winning team effort. It’s up to India’s seamers to stop him.","Alastair Cook, Gary Ballance and Ben Stokes amongst those that need to perform with the bat for England .

The Glee Club took legal action against Twentieth Century Fox accusing show bosses of stealing their name and won. Mark Tughan, 45, registered the name for his chain of comedy clubs as a trademark in the UK in 1999 - ten years before the US musical show first aired in Britain on Sky One. Copyright: Mark Tughan trademarked The Glee Club in 1999 - a decade before Glee appeared on British television screens .

Glee: The television show could potentially be pulled off screen for infringing the Midlands nightclubs' trademark. The judge will decide what action to take at a future hearing . He argued that customers were being put off attending his venues in Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford and Cardiff because people associated them with the teen musical drama. Senior executives from Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV were flown in to contest the claims, saying they had no prior knowledge that the comedy clubs or their trademark existed . But following a two-and-a-half year case, High Court judges sitting in London today agreed with Mr Tughan and ruled in Mr Tughan's favour. It means the popular US series could now be axed from UK screens after a judge ruled it 'diluted and tarnished' the reputation of Mr Tughan's chain of comedy clubs. However, Fox has said that it intends to appeal against the ruling. Deputy Judge Roger Wyand QC said Fox had infringed the Glee Club's registered trademark. He said: 'I have found that there is a likelihood of confusion and Twentieth Century Fox's use causes dilution and tarnishing... the damage suffered by Comic Enterprises is caused by its venues being confused with the TV show and its potential customers being put off.' Speaking after the case, Mr Tughan said: 'I had no desire to resort to such a David and Goliath legal action which could potentially result in depriving Glee fans in the UK of their favourite show.

'But the High Court has looked at the evidence and agreed that the programme makers have confused the public and damaged my business, brand and reputation for cutting edge comedy and music, over a period of more than four years so far. 'I tried to resolve this before it reached court, however Fox's refusal to get round the table with me leaves matters in the hands of the judge.' The ruling means future episodes of the show and repeats could be scrapped. It could also mean the show would need a full re-branding and Glee CD's, DVD's and music downloads could also be banned from sale in this country. A judge today ruled that Twentieth Century Fox had 'infringed' a trade mark. But he said Comic Enterprises had not been damaged. Deputy High Court Judge Roger Wyand QC . made no mention of any compensation in a written ruling published . following a High Court hearing in London. He said any subsequent issues . would be analysed at another hearing.

'Twentieth Century Fox denies infringement and passing off.' The . judge concluded that Comic Enterprises' claim on infringement . succeeded. But he said the company's claim on 'passing off' failed. 'I believe that (the) evidence taken as a whole shows that there is a likelihood of confusion,' he said. 'Twentieth . Century Fox's use causes dilution and tarnishing.

Mr Tughan, who opened the first Glee Club branch in Birmingham in 1994, said previously: 'Glee's performers sing covers and the programme is aimed at a young demographic while mine starts at 18. 'It's manifested itself in the under-performance of newer outlets in Oxford and Nottingham. 'Members of staff said people were walking along the street and pointing to the entrance, asking if it was something to do with the TV show.' A spokesman for 20th Century Fox Television said: 'We intend to appeal and are confident that, as the case plays out, we will ultimately prevail.

"By . Mark Prigg . Scientists have uncovered a mysterious structure that surround the earth rather like a giant zebraprint jacket. The strange structure has never been seen before, and initially baffled scientists. Stripes extend through the inner radiation belt, moving as the Earth rotates. Scroll down for video . The stripes that surround Earth: Two giant belts of radiation surround Earth. The inner belt is dominated by electrons and the outer one by protons. The radiation belts are dynamic doughnut-shaped regions around our planet, extending high above the atmosphere, made up of high-energy particles, both electrons and charged particles called ions, which are trapped by Earth's magnetic field. Radiation levels across the belts are affected by solar activity that causes energy and particles to flow into near-Earth space. Scientists discovered the new, persistent structure in one of two radiation belts surrounding Earth. NASA's twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft spotted the pattern, which that resembles slanted zebra stripes. The structure is produced by the slow rotation of Earth, previously considered incapable of affecting the motion of radiation belt particles, which have velocities approaching the speed of light. Scientists had previously believed that increased solar wind activity was the primary force behind any structures in our planet's radiation belts. However, these zebra stripes were shown to be visible even during low solar wind activity, which prompted a new search for how they were generated. 'It is because of the unprecedented resolution of our energetic particle experiment, RBSPICE, that we now understand that the inner belt electrons are, in fact, always organized in zebra patterns,' said Aleksandr Ukhorskiy, lead author of the paper at The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, or APL, in Laurel. Because of the tilt in Earth's magnetic field axis, the planet's rotation generates an oscillating, weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt. The stretching and folding process results in the striped pattern observed across the entire inner belt, extending from above Earth's atmosphere, about 500 miles above the planet's surface up to roughly 8,000 miles. 'The RBSPICE instrument has remarkably fine resolution and so it was able to bring into focus a phenomena that we previously didn't even know existed,' said David Sibeck, the mission scientist for the Van Allen Probes at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. 'Better yet, we have a great team of scientists to take advantage of these unprecedented observations: We couldn't have interpreted this data without analysis from strong theoreticians.'","Electrons in the inner radiation belt display giant zebra pattern .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . These eerie pictures shows some of the nearly 40,000 abandoned or empty buildings in Detroit, as they wait to be either demolished or renovated as the city nears the completion of its bankruptcy proceedings. Thousands of shops, homes and offices sit empty and rotting on Detroit's streets, as well as two beautiful former synagogues - one of which had become a theatre. Many of the dilapidated buildings are now covered with graffiti, while others are boarded up, with the sad signs of once bustling local stores fading in the sun. The Michigan city filed for chapter nine bankruptcy on July 18 last year, becoming the largest municipal bankruptcy by debt in U.S. history. This debt is estimated at around $18-20billion. Chapter nine bankruptcy is the chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code designed for towns and cities which aims to help them restructure their debts. The city's progress is currently being threatened as a major creditor is objecting to the debt restructuring plan, who say it will fail, and they want it ditched before the trial, which is due to begin next week. Detroit's bankruptcy is down to problems which started all the way back in the 1950s, with elected officials failing to make important economic and political decisions that might have saved it from the state it is in today. The once great city of Detroit is now full of abandoned and empty buildings which are falling into ruin as its bankruptcy proceedings near completion . Many of the Michigan city's buildings are now covered with graffiti and sit eerily empty - like part of a ghost town . The former Temple Beth El on Woodward Avenue was a synagogue  used between 1922 and 1973. Beth El, founded in 1950, is the oldest Jewish congregation in Michigan . This building is now covered with graffitied words, including 'care' in huge stencilled lettering, 'September 11' and also 'justice' and 'the local police' There are thousands of houses left empty, including this pair of beautiful former homes, one of which has been bricked up and is being invaded by ivy .

"By . Paul Logothetis . Spain's World Cup squad struggled to stay upbeat for their final few days in Brazil after reports that players were upset with Xabi Alonso for his unrepentant critique of the 2010 world champions. Alonso said Spain lacked hunger and commitment to win following defeats to the Netherlands and Chile, and said changes were necessary. 'There's a lot of talk about this but we're a group that is united and Xabi Alonso is part of that,' midfielder Santi Cazorla said on Friday at the team's training base.

We all need to learn from this.' Questions are swirling around the team's future, with coach Vicente del Bosque's tenure also under scrutiny after the No. 1-ranked Spain, which entered the tournament as the world and European champion, lost its opening matches by a combined total of 7-1. 'Vicente has total support from this group,' said Cazorla, as Spain prepared for its last Group B match against Australia at Curitiba on Monday. 'I think the future is bright for Spain, there are a lot of young players ready to come through.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . Taxis and buses will automatically switch to electric mode when they enter some of Britain’s most polluted streets as part of a new scheme to eradicate emissions. New technology will allow the vehicles to switch to ‘zero emission’ mode when they enter areas at risk of high air pollution such as Oxford Street in London. It comes as London Mayor Boris Johnson revealed plans for all taxis in the capital to be hybrid in four years’ time. Scroll down for video . New 'geo-fencing' technology will allow taxis and buses to switch to ‘zero emission’ mode when they enter areas at risk of high air pollution such as Bond Street and Oxford Street in central London (file picture) By 2016, there will be 1,700 hybrid buses in London and by January 1, 2018 it will be compulsory for all new cabs to be ‘zero emission capable’. Matthew Pencharz, the mayor’s environment advisor, said the advanced technology would allow vehicles to recognise when they are in highly-polluted areas, prompting them to switch to the greener mode. He told The Times: ‘With geo-fencing technology, when the vehicle crosses a particular line, it will go into electric mode. Some of our buses in future will also be doing this. ‘The technology can be responsive, so if one bit of town is more polluted than another, then the buses and taxis would switch to electric mode where the pollution was worse.’ He said the technology could be fitted to private cars in ‘due course’. Although the exact area where taxis and buses will ‘switch’ to electric mode has not yet been confirmed, it will no doubt include the most polluted roads in London as highlighted by a study earlier this year. In February, figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs claimed that traffic travelling along the A302 - known as Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to Buckingham Palace, produced the highest levels of the toxic gas at an average of 152 micrograms per cubic metre of air in 2012. London Mayor Boris Johnson has revealed plans for all taxis in the capital to be hybrid in four years’ time . The study also found that Oxford Street was highly polluted, registering at an average of 150 micrograms near Marble Arch, while Trafalgar Square has an average of 138 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air. Park Lane, Knightsbridge and Covent Garden were also all found to have seriously high levels of the pollutant. The latest news comes after it was announced that drivers of diesel cars could face a congestion charge-style daily fee of about £11.50 to enter central London, in a bid to further tackle air pollution. The payment could come if diesels fail to meet tough EU emission targets when an ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) is introduced in central London from 2020. The zone would have the same boundaries as the Congestion Charge zone, and only diesel vehicles that meet the Euro 6 emissions standard would be exempt from the charge. Motoring organisations have had a mixed reaction to the plans, with some unhappy about the possible charge. Findings released in February revealed the most polluted roads in central London, with Oxford Street, Park Lane and Buckingham Palace being among the polluted hotspots in the capital . RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘This isn't quite a miss-selling scandal, but for years ministers took their eye off the ball and encouraged drivers to buy diesels to help fight climate change. ‘That has come at a cost: local air pollution. Today 10 million cars in Britain are powered by diesel engines - a third of the total. ‘Part of the problem is regulation. In laboratory conditions diesel cars have met strict test criteria. Unfortunately that performance hasn't been matched on the road and now we have a significant health issue because of the dash for diesel.’ AA president Edmund King added: ‘It is somewhat ironic that cars are banned from the most polluted street in London - Oxford Street. The vehicles that have most effect on air quality in London are buses, taxis and trucks. ‘The first move should be to target the gross polluters and get them off our roads in order to have a greater and more immediate impact on air quality.’","'Geo-fencing' technology will let vehicles switch to electric in certain zones .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Scores of NHS jobs could be shipped off to India under cost-saving plans being considered by health chiefs, unions have claimed. The country's biggest health union, Unison, said the cuts could cost 900 British workers their jobs - with many going to the subcontinent. NHS England managers are set to consider the plans at a crunch board meeting tomorrow. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is not in control of the day-to-day running of the NHS. A new body called NHS England was created and put in charge by his predecessor Andrew Lansley, in his controversial overhaul of the health service . Most of the roles under threat are low paid 'back office' jobs, such as dealing with prescription charges, payments to GPs and crucial referrals for cancer screening. Unison has written to board members urging them to reconsider the plans, which emerged in agenda papers published last week. A spokeswoman for NHS England confirmed to MailOnline that the proposal was due to be debated tomorrow. She said: 'There's going to be some discussion at our board meeting tomorrow.' An NHS England spokesman later added: 'This is a very important set of changes that we are considering for the benefit of patients and the public. 'The aim is to free up funding from administrative costs for frontline health services. 'We have worked closely with our staff and the unions to ensure we understand their views and concerns. No final decision will be made until June.' One of the proposals being considered is that the number of staff currently working in India would rise from about 20 to about 60. Christina McAnea, Unison's head of health, attacked the plan and called on NHS England to keep the jobs in Britain. She said: 'These proposals have been hammered out behind closed doors and are mired in secrecy. 'Staff are being kept in the dark about their futures and this is very upsetting and disruptive for them personally and for the service. 'The potential loss of at least 900 jobs and the closure of dozens of offices across the UK will be a bitter blow to workers and their families. 'At a time when many companies are bringing back services from abroad, it is shameful that NHS England is seeking to make quick savings by outsourcing some work to India.' Ordinary health staff will be furious at the revelation that British jobs could be outsourced to India. It comes just days after the expenses claims of former health service chief Sir David Nicholson and his NHS England colleagues were revealed . The controversial proposals come after it emerged nine health officials from NHS England spent almost £200,000 last year on fine dining, taxi fares and hotels at up to £500 a night. Patients’ groups said it was 'an absolute disgrace' that officials cutting jobs across the NHS were able to enjoy such perks. NHS England was set up by ministers, as part of Andrew Lansley's overhaul of the health service, and was headed by Sir David Nicholson until he stood down recently. Sir David billed taxpayers for a total of £32,000 during 2013-14, the figures show, including £6,700 on taxis. The 69 claims for taxis and cars include one fare of more than £500 for a journey from London to Preston. The highest individual bill was for Tim Kelsey, national director for patients and information, who spent £46,000 during the year — including more than £21,000 on hotels and dining, with claims of up to £370 a night. Mr Kelsey, who is responsible for the troubled programme to centralise GP records, also spent almost £7,000 on air fares. Jane Cummings, NHS chief nursing officer, spent more than £27,000 in total, including £8,000 on hotels and dining, the records show. Bill McCarthy, who recently resigned as national director for policy, spent more than £23,000, the figures show. The sums claimed include £491 on a four night stay in a hotel in Berkshire, following a £313 train journey from Leeds. The new head of the health service, Simon Stevens, has now announced a clampdown on lavish spending and a ban on first-class travel, telling staff at NHS England to 'think like a patient and act like a taxpayer'. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: 'It is an absolute disgrace when patients are waiting longer for care, when frontline staff are so overloaded, and when there are such difficulties in some parts of the service, to see this scale of excess at the top of the organisation. It truly beggars belief.' Roger Goss, from charity Patient Concern, added: 'It’s ludicrous for the organisers of the NHS to live a lavish lifestyle while trying to persuade the rest of the health service to save billions on providing care to patients. It really is an outrage that these sorts of sums have been diverted from the taxpayer, when they were intended for patient care.'","NHS England set to debate proposal at board meeting tomorrow .

"By . David Kent . Sami Khedira was ruled out of the World Cup final after suffering a calf injury in Germany's warm up at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, but didn't have to look far to be cheered up. The Real Madrid midfielder had model girlfriend Lena Gercke to fall back on after being ruled out of the showdown with Argentina, who was watching on from the crowd. The injury forced manager Joachim Low to put . Christoph Kramer in the side for his first-ever competitive start, but the 23-year-old lasted just half an hour himself.

The youngster, though, was injured after clashing his head with Ezequiel Garay's shoulder and had to be substituted after 31 minutes for Andre Schurrle. As for Argentina, Angel Di Maria was absent after struggling with a thigh injury. The Real Madrid star missed the semi-final win over Holland, and was a blow for Alejandro Sabella ahead of the World Cup showdown.

Then, however, he suffered a cruel twist of fate, as a nasty head collision saw him exit the match after just half-an-hour. Here, Sportsmail provides all you need to know about the unfortunate Kramer.... So . tell me a little bit about Christoph Kramer, the poor German who headed . off the pitch just half-an-hour into the World Cup Final... The .

He . emerged through the youth team at Bayer Leverkusen, where he will . return to next season, and is recognised as one of the standout talents . in Germany after a previous impressive loan spell in the second division . with Bochum. What kind of player is he? An . indefatigable midfielder, who works relentlessly in the central . positions for his team. He does much of the unseen work and he is not . dissimilar in style to Sami Khedira, who he replaced after the warm up . in the World Cup final. So has he been a fixture in the Germany national squad? No, Kramer wasn't even picked in Joachim Low's first provisional squad for the World Cup at the beginning of May. However, . the coach soon decided that he required extra midfield bodies as . players such as Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger recovered from . injury, while Ilkay Gundogan had already been ruled out. Kramer . replaced forward Andre Hahn in the squad and then impressed in training . to such an extent that he was included in the 23-man pool for Brazil. Has he been called into action at the World Cup? He . has barely featured, appearing only as a substitute in the 89th minute . against both Algeria and France. The World Cup final on Sunday evening . marked his first competitive start for Die Mannschaft. That seems like a brutal induction...? Well, . it wasn't planned that way. Khedira pulled up in the warm up and Low . handed Kramer the nod. Sadly, though, it was destined to be a . short-lived experience. How was he injured? Argentine . defender Ezequiel Garay crashed into Kramer as the two challenged a . bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area.

"By . Stephanie Linning . A father has set up a fake speed camera outside his home in a bid to slow down drivers after the family cat was run over by a car. Antony Cull said his daughter was 'devastated' when their black-and-white cat Millie, who he called 'part of the family', was hit on a busy stretch of road near their home in Shrewton, Wiltshire. The father-of-two decided to take the situation into his own hands, creating the dummy out of a painted kitchen cupboard and putting it up outside his home. Scroll down for video . Taking control: Antony Cull made the camera out of wood from a kitchen cupboard and put it up outside his home in Shrewton, Wiltshire, after the family cat was run over. He said other residents supported his idea . Mr Cull, 27, said: 'Millie was a very happy, friendly cat. It really upset my children so I decided something had to be done. 'My speed camera has had a huge effect - drivers slow down and slam on their brakes when they see it. 'Someone . in the village wrote on Facebook asking drivers to honk when they drove . past if they supported me and we hear so many horns beeping. 'People have stopped and knocked on my door to say ‘Well done’ and tell me they agree with me.' He said traffic collisions happened . regularly on the 30mph road, which has a number of bends, and wants to . see the speed limit dropped to 20mph. The first fake camera, which was attached to a 5ft-stick in his garden, was pulled down and burnt on Saturday. Mr Cull and a neighbour made another one to replace it and had screwed it into a fence panel - but it has since been stolen. Now Mr Cull, a recovery driver, has vowed to weld a metal version to replace it. Effective: Mr Cull said that the fake camera had been effective and that drivers on the busy stretch of road often slowed down when they spotted the distinctive yellow box. This version of the 'camera' has since been stolen . Wiltshire Council said that the fake speed camera is on council land and wants it removed. Mr Cull argues that it is on his land and added 'the main thing is that it works'. But one councillor conceded that the makeshift speed camera was ‘very effective’. Ian West, a Liberal Democrat, said: 'We want action. That fake camera is action. 'Although it’s probably not what authorities want to see it’s very effective at slowing traffic down and that’s what people are clearly for.' Wiltshire Police said it was not illegal to put up a fake speed camera, as long as it was on the resident’s property. A spokesperson said: 'You can put anything up on your property unless it’s distracting drivers and causing hazards. Third time lucky: After having the first 'camera' stolen, Mr Cull built a second, pictured. This has since been stolen and he swears he will build a third, which he will weld on to the pole to stop it from being taken . 'If Mr Cull had put it up on council land, it could then become a civil issue for them.' Wiltshire Council said it has a ‘robust’ system for handling speeding issues. A spokesman said: 'The council has a robust system for dealing with speeding issues raised by local communities. 'Issues should be referred to the local community area board, who will work with the local community to examine what speed control measures are appropriate for that particular road. 'The considerations to deal with speeding issues will include the use of the volunteer speedwatch scheme, installation of speed indicator devices or other direct measures. 'It is vital that any scheme introduced is effective and delivers the required result. 'The council would ask everyone to follow the approved procedure to ensure the best scheme is delivered to meet the community needs.' A traffic survey monitoring vehicle movements on the A303 and through the surrounding villages started this week. The monitoring exercise uses automatic number plate recognition technology to individually track the behaviour of motorists in the survey area.","Antony Cull said his daughter was 'devastated' when cat Millie was hit .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A former England youth rugby player and his friend died after their car flipped over several times and crashed into a tree as it was being chased by police. Jack Christian, 22, and Lee Perris, 23, had been drinking and taking drugs when they took Mr Perris’ mother’s car on an icy night without clearing the windscreen properly. The pair crashed the VW Polo after taking a bend at around 60mph while in pursuit with a police patrol car, which had its emergency sirens turned on. Friends Lee Perris (left) and Jack Christian (right) were killed after the car they were driving crashed into tree . Floral tributes left at the scene of the accident in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, after the crash in 2012 . At an inquest into the death of the two friends the police officers said they had spotted the car go past them at speed and had concerns because it appeared that the windscreen of the vehicle was obscured by either ice or condensation. They began to pursue the car but within seconds caught up to the vehicle to find it had crashed. Witnesses said the car had flipped four times through the air before coming to halt on its roof. Mr Christian, who ran his own electrician business, was taken from the vehicle, which he was not insured to drive, and resuscitation attempts were made but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Perris was pronounced dead whilst still in the car. The jury at the four-day inquest in Oldham, Greater Manchester, found that Mr Christian died as a result of a road traffic collision and Mr Perris as a result of an accident. They ruled that they ‘didn’t know’ if the pair were aware that the police were following them at the time of the crash but they did find that it was the manner of Mr Christian’s driving that contributed to their death. Reading the jury’s verdict the coroner Lisa Hashmi said: ‘On December 2, 2012 on Bury Rd, Radcliffe the car Mr Christian was driving collided with a tree, as a result of loss of control whilst drinking at excessive speed whilst under the influence of drugs and alcohol. ‘Conclusion, the deceased died as result of a road traffic collision. ‘Lee was travelling as a passenger in a vehicle that subsequently collided with a tree. The deceased died as a result of an accident.’ The inquest heard that Mr Christian and Mr Perris had been drinking on the night at Mr Perris’s flat in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, but had run out of alcohol. They took at taxi to Mr Christian’s mother’s house, also in Radcliffe, to get more drink before they took the keys to his mother’s car and attempted to drive back to Mr Perri’s flat. The jury was told that a police car noticed them at around 3.20am on December 2, 2012 and had been concerned that the driver’s visibility was impaired. After activating the emergency sirens a brief pursuit ensued before officers lost sight of the VW. Jack Christian, 22, (left) was driving the car which belonged to the mother of Lee Perris, 23, (right) At an inquest into their deaths, police officers said they had spotted the car go past them at speed and had concerns because it appeared that the windscreen of the vehicle was obscured by either ice or condensation . The car was said to have taken a blind bend in what one witness described as ‘absolutely crazy’ and estimated that the vehicle had been travelling at around 60mph. The vehicle was then said to have swerved out of control before it flipped four times before crashing into the tree killing both men in a ‘catastrophic collision’. The inquest heard from Mr Christian’s mother, Nicola Christian who said she had heard the pair come back to her house during the early hours after earlier dropping Mr Christian off at Mr Perris’ flat in Radcliffe. She told the inquest that in the days before her son’s death she had bought de-icer because the weather ‘had turned’ and which she had kept it in the boot of the car. The inquest was told that in the early hours of December 2 she was awoken at around 3am to the voices of her son and friend who had appeared ‘jolly’. She said the pair had not seemed intoxicated and had apologised for waking her up. A witness, who was travelling in opposite direction at around 3.20am, said it had been ‘a particularly bad night’ in terms of the weather. Steven Weaver added that it was cold and icy and he had had to keep his van running in order to keep it defrosted because the van had been frozen inside and out. He said: ‘It was absolutely crazy. He was going far too fast for the road conditions. I thought that he was coming at some speed so I eased off my speed. I didn’t think the guy was going to make the corner. He was on his own side initially. When he started to take the corner he came onto my side. I applied the brakes and pulled over. I’m no professional driver, he was doing at least 60mph round the corner he must have been.’ He added that his car ‘rocked’ as the Polo went past. Floral tributes were left by friends and family at the scene of the crash in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester . The scene of the accident (left) where the car took a bend, left the road and hit a tree before landing on its roof . He added: ‘The windscreen was either condensed or still frozen. The lights seemed to bounce off so I couldn’t see anyone in it. That’s how it appeared. I couldn’t see who was in the car and it was going that fast it past me in a blink of an eye. It came round the corner and then it had gone.’ He said that as he carried on he saw the police vehicle with its blue lights on travelling in the same direction as the VW towards Radcliffe. He added: ‘I put two and two together with him travelling at speed, I thought, “he is after that fella”. The police car was nowhere near. There was 300-400 yards in between the police car and the VW. I actually thought “why are you driving like that” when the police were so far back. The speed he was going, I felt he was going to have an accident at some point.’ Taxi driver Amjid Farooq said that the VW ‘swung past’ his taxi and crashed around 50 yards in front of him. He told the inquest: ‘It was coming so fast. It just swung in, he did try to control it but he couldn’t do it. The car flipped over it was right in front of me. I put my brakes on. It just flipped over three or four times at least before it impacted the tree. ‘I was really shocked I couldn’t look at the car. I said to the passenger “did you see that”. ‘Ten seconds after the police came past me. I was just shocked I didn’t remember much.’ A post mortem examination revealed that both men suffered intracranial haemorrhage, skull fractures and multiple soft tissue injuries and bruising. Toxicology reports showed that the men had taken alcohol, cocaine and amphetamines (MDMA). Mr Perris was also found to have had cannabis in his system.

Tracy Perris (left), mother of Lee Perris, is pictured outside Oldham Magistrates Court with family members . Lee Perris' girlfriend Jessica Higgs (centre) waited for him to return to his flat on the night of the accident . In a statement read at the inquest Mrs Christian described her son as a ‘hard working scholar’ who left school with good qualifications. She added that her son was ‘an excellent’ rugby player who had played for Rochdale Rugby Club before he was selected to play for England at the age of 14. However due to a shoulder injury he quit the sport. In 2009 he qualified as an electrician and set up his own business, securing contracts for major supermarkets. Mrs Christian described him as a ‘caring young man with a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody’. She added: ‘He was very happy with his life, he had a good career and a good circle of friends.’ The court heard that the two friends had been drinking at Mr Perris’ flat in Radcliffe with his girlfriend Jessica Higgs. She told the inquest that she arrived at the flat at around 10pm and that the men were drinking two bottles of the two litre Frosty Jack cider with cordial. She added that they were dancing and listening to music but that the men had not seemed intoxicated. She said that after they had ran out of alcohol and Mr Christian said he had a bottle of alcohol at his house and called a taxi in order to get it. Miss Higgs said that she gave Mr Perris’enough money to pay for the fare there and back and also gave her bank card so that he could get cigarettes. She said she remained at the flat but became worried that they had not returned after an hour. She said: ‘I recall just waiting for a long time. I was watching the telly for about an hour. After an hour I just started to worry and looking out of the window. I was trying to ring but couldn’t get through to either phones. I was messaging Lee on Facebook in case he had access. Watching out all night the roads were white, frosty. ‘I just remember waiting. I think it was about 7am and I just remember hearing a knock on the door. I thought it was them but it was two policemen.’ She added that the weather conditions that night had been ‘really really slippy’. The inquest, which is expected to last for three days, continues.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . The two young women snapped in risque positions with the 71-year-old owner of the Dallas Cowboys say they were too drunk to remember what happened that night. The women, Lindzie and Jordan — whom TMZ claims are strippers in Houston and Forth Worth, respectively — have contacted their own lawyers out of fear that the married billionaire, Jerry Jones, will go after them in court. 'There was a lot of alcohol involved,' the women told TMZ, denying that they had anything to do with leaking the photos or being a part of an extortion plot against Jones. Racy: A man who is alleged to be Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is seen fondling a much-younger woman in a picture that surfaced last weekend. The 71-year-old has been married for 50 years . Blackmail? The photos were released by a Dallas man who says they were taken to extort Jones. Above, another shot that allegedly shows Jones with a woman who is not his wife . The photos, which were published last . weekend in a strange 20-page manifesto attributed to a Dallas . 'entrepreneur,' claim to show Jones grabbing one blonde woman's breasts some five years ago. In another shot, . a brunette woman on her knees grins as she leans her head against the man's . pelvic area. The man who published the photos, that have appeared in several publications including the Huffington Post, claims they were taken by someone else to extort Jones, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion. Jones has not yet issued a statement on the pictures. Despite their poses, the women told TMZ that a third friend snapped the pictures and that neither of them had noticed photos were being taken. The women deny that they wanted the pics to go public. Jones appears to be in a restroom with both women in the two pictures. The photos are potentially especially scandalous considering Jones has been married to his 72-year-old wife Gene for 50 years. Married man: Jones has been married to his wife Gene for 50 years. They have three children and nine grandchildren together. Pictured above at the Country Music Awards this past April .

Sources told Deadspin that the man who tweeted the link to the report 'used to be fairly well connected in Dallas' and would often attend parties with Cowboys and Mavericks players.

"By . Australian Associated Press . A self-described 'deadbeat' mother of a boy who died in a squalid Melbourne home has collapsed in court, as she and her husband faced charges over his death. The five-year-old died after cutting his foot on a tin of cat food left lying among piles of rubbish inside the house in 2012. The mother and father, both aged in their 40s, pleaded guilty to two charges each of reckless conduct endangering their two sons. Prosecutor Susan Borg said the floor of the couple's home was covered with rotting food, faeces, open packets of food, bottles and cat food. The five-year-old boy died after cutting his foot on an open tin of cat food that was buried beneath piles of rubbish on the floor . The parents face charges over the boy's death in clearly horrific living conditions . 'Two years prior (to the boy's death) the premises was one of squalor,' she told their Victorian County Court plea hearing on Thursday. 'The walls were covered in filth.' As Ms Borg was speaking the mother collapsed in the dock, which prompted calls for medical help. The mother earlier described herself as a 'deadbeat' when asked to detail her occupation. Ms Borg told the court the boy almost severed his toe in the house several days before he died. But she said an autopsy could not directly link the cutting of his toe to his death, or determine a clear cause of death. The mother told the court 'deadbeat' when asked about her profession. The prosecutor says there faeces and rotting food were found at the home . The two boys were placed in danger of bacterial infection by the faeces in the house and physical danger by the open tins of food littering the floor, Ms Borg said. The couple, who cannot be named, married in the late-1990s and had two boys. They also pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to register the birth of their deceased son. After the mother's collapse, Chief Judge Michael Rozenes adjourned the case to have her assessed medically. The matter will return to court on October 22.

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . An eclectic example of some of the best architectural work from across the globe designed by Australians have been recognised at the 2014 International Architecture Awards. The Australian Institute of Architects’ has announced the winners of five awards spanning public, residential, commercial, interior and small project architecture which were decided by a jury led by 2013 Institute Gold Medallist, Peter Wilson. The Stonehenge Exhibition and Visitor Centre by Denton Corker Marshall received an Award for Public Architecture. 'This is a building that does justice to a UNESCO World Heritage site; its lightness and reversibility giving dignity to the solidity and timelessness of the standing stones 2.4 km away beyond the horizon,' Jury Chair Peter Wilson said of the Melbourne architects. Kerry Hill Architects dominated the Residential Architecture category receiving an award for The Sukhothai Residences in Bangkok and a commendation for Urban Suites. The highly-acclaimed PARKROYAL on Pickering, Singapore, was further applauded with an award for Commercial Architecture, 'achieving a fine balance of the natural and the cultural,' the jury said. The Interior Architecture category belonged to Queensland’s BVN Donovan Hill with the jury presenting the award to the ASB North Wharf building in Auckland’s Wynyard Quarter. While a longhouse in the depths of the jungle in Borneo took out the Small Project Architecture gong designed by by Marra and Yeh Architects . The five projects now progress to the National Architecture Awards to be announced in November in Darwin and will compete for the Jørn Utzon Award for International Architecture. The Residential Architecture category was won by The Sukhothai Residences in Bangkok .

The Stonehenge Exhibition and Visitor Centre in Wiltshire, England, received an award for Public Architecture . A longhouse in the depths of the jungle in Borneo took out the Small Project Architecture gong . The Sukhothai Residences in Bangkok: . The residential slabs wear a concrete Mondrian brise soleil frock . The hedonistic landscape has shady and light filtering a nine-metre-high colonnade and three bamboo filled light wells . A pool house pavilion updates and abstracts an Indian typology, stripped of Mogul decoration, with a bar and gym lurking behind glass wafers . PARKROYAL on Pickering in Singapore: . The front faces north-east over a park with tree canopies into the landscape of the pool terrace . The poolside cabanas in the hotel that is located in downtown Singapore . The block-sized hotel consists of three linked towers in an E-shaped plan on a podium shared by a speculative office building . The swimming pool on level five cascades into a garden that loops the podium-top; heavy timbers project over the water with light gangways spanning to suspended cabanas . ASB North Wharf building in Auckland: . The office is organised by perpendicular atria, one above a common laneway bisecting the site at ground level . Ultra modern blue bulbous pod-like rooms are used for meeting places . The day-lit volumes are used to great effect with crisscrossing bridges allowing visual connectivity between floors . Bright colours signpost the collaborative areas while the base building palette is neutral grey, white and natural timber . The Stonehenge Exhibition and Visitor Centre in Wiltshire, England: . The Visitor Centre feels Australian - a sheep-pen and wool shed to shear the visitor flock of their spare change while dispensing a basic understanding of where and why they are there . The multiple poles that hold the wafer thin roof aloft is reminiscent of the Aboriginal activist delegation that landed on the shores of England in the 1970s . The two pavilions, one timber clad and the other glass, puts the visitor conceptually and physically into the mysterious landscape of the Salisbury Plain . A longhouse in of the jungle in Borneo: . This house boasts an exemplary list of ecological and environmental credentials: sustainable re-forestation, locally harvested materials, solar energy, rainwater collection, biotechnologies and minimal site disturbance . The shiny roof is such a familiar Australian trope that it is almost surprising to see it here returned to its locus and reference of origin . The technology and detailing are more than appropriate to the location and climate while the spaces are rich in seductive atmosphere and ambience .","The Australian Institute of Architects’ has announced the winners of the 2014 International Architecture Awards celebrating the work of Australians abroad .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Sidelined Essendon coach James Hird says he was threatened and pressured into accepting responsibility for the AFL club's supplements program, and disagreed with the Bombers' decision to self report. Hird claims he was at odds with Essendon's decision to request both the AFL and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority investigate the club over doping allegations. Speaking for the first time about the allegations, Hird told the Federal Court he did not believe the club had done anything wrong, but agreed to toe the club line. 'I was asked by the Essendon Football Club not to shirk the issue,' Hird told the court on Monday. 'I was told it would be better for the club if we went along this path.' Scroll down for video . James Hird (left and with his wife Tania right) speaks out for the first time about the supplements allegations . James Hird claims his that then AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou (pictured) had tipped off Essendon about a pending ASADA investigation the day before the club went public but Demetriou denies the claims . Hird denied the club reported its 2012 supplements program to the AFL and ASADA. Hird said that he disagreed with repeated public statements by club officials that the club had self-reported to the anti-doping authority. ‘I do not believe the club proactively invited ASADA to investigate these matters,’ he told the court on Tuesday. ‘I don't believe the club agreed to self report.’ ASADA:Its legislation allows it to conduct joint investigations and share information with the AFL about Essendon's ""derelict governance""'Possible governance and management issues were the very thing which prompted senior Essendon officials to approach ASADA,' Tom Howe QC said. Essendon football club:Argues ASADA should not have given information to the AFL which was used to fine the Bombers and bar them from the 2013 finals for bringing the game into disrepute'The prejudice to the players will effectively rebound to the prejudice of the employer and effectively destroy the business,' Neil Young QC said. Suspended coach James Hird:Hird attacked senior managers at Essendon and the AFL, saying he was threatened and induced into toeing the company line'I was told by the club, by David Evans and Ian Robson, that we should co-operate with ASADA and with the AFL, because if we co-operated it would go well for our players,' he said. 34 past and present Bombers players:It would be an injustice if doping findings were made against them based on the 'unlawful' investigation, David Grace QC said. Hird said former AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou and chief operating officer Gillon McLachlan told then Essendon chairman David Evans that the club had been guilty of doping and should self report. ‘He (Mr McLachlan) said it would go better for the club if we came forward in a proactive way,’ Hird said. ‘It was on their advice we came forward.’ However, Demetriou has denied pre-warning the club. Hird said he did not believe the Bombers had done anything wrong, but agreed to toe the club line, having been asked ‘not to shirk the issue’. He said he only signed a deed of settlement with the AFL, which held him partly to blame and resulted in his 12-month suspension, after ‘threats and inducements’ were made. Hird and Essendon are claiming the AFL and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority's joint investigation was unlawful and say the resultant show cause notices, alleging doping by 34 players, should be thrown out. But ASADA says its probe was legal, and to suggest otherwise would be 'nonsense on stilts'. At a February 2013 press conference Hird said he took full responsibility for what had happened in Essendon's football department in 2012. The club and Hird signed deeds of settlement with the AFL in August 2013, which resulted in the club being fined, thrown out of the finals and Hird's 12-month suspension. 'I was told by the club, by David Evans (left) and Ian Robson (right), that we should co-operate with ASADA and with the AFL, because if we co-operated it would go well for our players': James Hird . Hird said he only signed the deed, which held him partly to blame, under duress. 'There were threats and inducements to get me to sign that deed,' he told the court. Hird repeated his allegation that then AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou had tipped off the club about a pending ASADA investigation the day before Essendon went public at the press conference. Hird said the AFL made it clear to Essendon it was in the club's best interest to self report, with then AFL chief operating officer Gillon McLachlan - now the CEO - making the case. 'Gillon McLachlan said to us it was his belief that the Essendon Football Club had taken performance enhancing drugs,' Hird said. 'I disagreed with what they said. I said ""I don't think that is true"".' Hird said he was told to participate in the investigation by the club's then chairman David Evans and CEO Ian Robson. 'I was told by the club, by David Evans and Ian Robson, that we should co-operate with ASADA and with the AFL, because if we co-operated it would go well for our players. 'The players are the most important thing and I followed David Evans' and Ian Robson's lead.' Court clerks delivering documents  to the Federal Court before the Australian Sports Anti Doping Authority inquiry into Essendon's supplement program . Essendon's lawyer Neil Young QC said ASADA should not have given information to the league which was used to accuse the Bombers of bringing the game into disrepute. He said the process was unlawful and could crush the club. 'The prejudice to the players will effectively rebound to the prejudice of the employer and effectively destroy the business,' Mr Young said. But ASADA counsel Tom Howe QC said Essendon's 'seriously derelict' and 'toxic' governance and management were a major part of the investigation. 'Possible governance and management issues were the very thing which prompted senior Essendon officials to approach ASADA,' he said. Mr Howe said ASADA was not prohibited from conducting a joint investigation and if the court ruled against it, it would compromise the body's stated aims. 'Indeed the expression 'nonsense on stilts' comes to mind,' Mr Howe said. David Grace QC, on behalf of the players, said it would be a grave injustice if findings were made against his clients on the basis of the 'unlawful' joint investigation.","Sidelined Essendon coach James Hird says he was pressured into accepting responsibility for the AFL club's supplements program .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . A hooded cyclist is one of possibly three offenders . A hooded cyclist is believed to be one of up to three men preying on women as they travel to and from work or go for a jog. The women were all indecently assaulted between the hours of 6am and 8am and 6pm and 8pm in the Melbourne suburbs of Altona North and Newport. Every victim - except the most recent - was grabbed from behind and several victims were wearing headphones. Two women saw a man ride off on a mountain bike. Police believe as many as three men could be involved in the 13 attacks which have occurred in the past four months. 'We're not convinced it's the same individual because some of the offending is different,' Detective Inspector Martin Allison said on Wednesday. 'With the exception of the most recent incident, all victims were grabbed from behind. Every victim - except the most recent - was grabbed from behind with several of the victims wearing headphones . 'He doesn't speak, there's no exchange and consequently ... most of the offending is done from the rear. 'We're not at liberty to disclose the method of his offending but we have some concerns that his offending is escalating.' The most recent attack was on Seventh Street in Altona North on Sunday night. The offender was described as Caucasian and wearing a dark-coloured hooded top pulled over his face, and dark trousers. Police are urging victims to contact them immediately as late reporting had led to 'the trail going cold'.

Christy Mack is in hospital and Jon Koppenhaver, known in the ring as War Machine, is wanted by police. There was allegedly a third person involved in the fracas who also sustained injuries, but police have not revealed that person's identity. Both are described by TMZ as having sustained 'severe but non-life-threatening injures.'

"By . Ruth Styles . With an elegant spiral staircase, chic pale decor, roaring log fires and spectacular mountain views, Chalet Eidelweiss in Courchevel is the epitome of alpine chic.

Along with eight bedrooms, each of which has been individually decorated, the seven-floor chalet boasts two massage rooms, a hammam and a library bulging with books. Scroll down for video .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Capital city house prices continue to rise across Australia with a boost by the very strong Sydney housing market. Property prices rose 1.8 per cent in the three months up until June outdoing the one per cent rise predicted by economists. The Australian Bureau of Statistics' index of house prices rose 10.1 per cent during the 12 months until June - the third month in a row of the annual rate sitting above 10 per cent. Scroll down for video . Capital city house prices continue to rise in Australia with a boost by the very strong Sydney housing market which has risen 15.6 per cent in the year to June . The nation's next best performer was Melbourne with a 9.3 per cent gain in house prices in the same period . Leading the charge was Sydney where prices rose 15.6 per cent in the year to June. The nation’s next best performer was Melbourne with a 9.3 per cent gain while Brisbane came in third at 6.8 per cent - although Queensland’s capital city climbed 1.8 per cent in the last quarter - .5 per cent higher than Melbourne in the same period. Meanwhile, Adelaide grew one per cent in the last quarter from June - now at 5.6 per cent. JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said it was too early to say if surging house prices might spark an interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank of Australia. ‘At this stage we think the RBA is pretty comfortable with the housing sector,’ he said. ‘We don't think that this is enough to get them over the line but certainly it would be something on their radar and they would be monitoring it quite closely.’ Brisbane came in in third at 6.8 per cent with an impressive 1.8 per cent climb in the last quarter until June . However, national house price growth was being inflated by the outsized gain in Sydney, Mr Kennedy said. ‘The details suggest that this strength is landing in one property sector,’ he said. ‘We think that prices will moderate a little bit further as activity cools, particularly in Sydney where price growth remains very strong at levels that won't be sustainable.’ Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Workman said the rapid pace of house price increases might be a concern for the central bank. ‘While rising asset prices are positive for household sentiment for households that own a dwelling, increases in property prices pose affordability issues and increase household debt,’ he said. ‘Dwelling price growth momentum is likely to ease over the near term as the housing supply increases, given the pick up in dwelling commencements, and rental yields take a hit given the rise in dwelling prices.’","Property prices rose 1.8 per cent in the three months up until June outdoing the one per cent rise predicted by economists .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Misinformation about allergic diseases is causing serious consequences as some children are not being immunised due to misconceptions. Australian experts attended the first allergy summit in Sydney on Friday in a bid to develop a national strategy to combat the escalating issue as one in five are affected by food, drug and insect allergies - and that number is expected to increase to one in four over the next 30 years. Immunologist and Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy president Richard Loh said the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of allergies was frighteningly inconsistent. Misinformation about allergic diseases is creating serious consequences as some children are not being immunised due to misconceptions . ‘Patients with an egg allergy are being incorrectly told they can't get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine,’ Professor Loh told the ABC. ‘And for over 10 years we have known that is incorrect.’ Allergic diseases are currently costing Australia an estimated $30 million a year. Professor Richard Loh calls for a united approach . Some sufferers develop skin reactions or breathing problems while others can go into anaphylactic shock when exposed to food such as nuts, egg, milk and seafood which can be life-threatening. Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia President Maria Said says allergies can perceived as trivial when they can in fact affect a person’s quality of life. ‘We have two-year waiting lists to see specialists and most of the people that end up in the room of a specialist really need to be there - they're not just people who have a transient rash,’ she told the ABC. Both experts agreed there needed to be an urgent cohesive approach across all medical fields in every state throughout the country. Prof Loh said an alarming one in 10 infants now suffer from food allergies. ‘Even simple things like the introduction of when solids should [be fed to] infants. 'There is conflicting advice,’ he said. ‘When you've got someone with a life-threatening reaction, you don't want to wonder “oh, which one is right?”.’ Some allergy sufferers can go into anaphylactic shock when exposed to food such as nuts, egg, milk and seafood which can be life-threatening .","Misinformation about allergic diseases is causing serious consequences .

He also picked the dog up and punched it in the ribs, causing several injuries that need to be treated by a vet. The incident happened at the Mexican police training ground in the city of Cuautitlan Izcalli, in central Mexico. The abuse is videoed for several minutes and only ended when officers finally stepped in to order him to leave the animal alone. At this point he denied he had done anything wrong and insisted he was simply disciplining the police hound. Mexican policemen try to rescue the dog that was being beaten by the  police dog handler . Kovalev was initially suspended for 30 days as a punishment but after officers considered the case and the fact that he had been drunk on duty, he was fired.

Cecilie Herlovsen can remember the terrfiying scenes of the 2011 Oslo shooting massacre like it was yesterday but plans to use overcoming the tragedy to inspire others to do the same. Not only was her right arm blown apart by crazed gunman Anders Breivik on July 22, 2011 but he also took the life of the then 17 year-old’s best friend along with 76 other innocent humans. ‘I wish I'd gone over to her to take my last goodbye, because the second I saw her, I knew she was dead,’ Herlovson told 9 Stories. The fresh-faced teen was staying on the isolated island of Utoya at a youth camp where every single person was completely oblivious of the horror that was about to unfold when Breivik went on a cold-blooded rampage.

Breivik took the life of the then 17 year-old's best friend along with 76 other innocent humans on the island . Anders Breivik killed 77 people on Utoya Island . Ms Herlovson, now 19, recalls hearing the first shot when they were in the main building at the camp. ‘At first, no one understood what the shot was, because it was such an absurd noise to hear at a summer camp. We heard several more shots before we saw a person walking towards the building, turn and point a gun at us,’ Ms Herlovsen said. What followed was an hour and a half of an unimaginable living hell, as Breivik systematically hunted and shot anyone who crossed his path. 'Everyone began running towards the other end of the building to get away from him. I remember getting lost in the crowd and not finding my best friend, Andrine,"" Herlovson said. ‘We ended up stuck in a hallway, because we couldn't get the door open.' 'I remember the eerie silence right before the loud thud of him kicking in the door. Then the shooting started again.’ The first two bullets that struck the petrified teen were hunting pellets that explode on impact blowing off her right arm. She considers herself lucky that the third was a normal bullet which hit her right cheek. Breivik preceded his rampage at Utotya (pictured) by detonating a car bomb outside the office block housing Norway's Prime Minister which killed eight and left hundreds injured . She eventually escaped the building with her friends and took cover in some ‘small trees’ which she described as ‘a stupid decision' because they were quite visible. ‘I don't know how long we waited there, but suddenly I saw him coming towards us. When he started shooting, the best we felt we could do, was just lie down, and hope to survive,’ she said. The first two bullets that struck the petrified teen were hunting pellets that explode on impact blowing off her right arm. ‘I remember the pain just swallowing me whole. It was so intense, and the burning feeling was so surreal. 'I remember looking down on my own arm and thinking, ""This is not my arm. It has to be fake. This cannot be my arm”.’ 'The second bullet hit my shoulder, but I have no memory of it. I didn't pass out, but my brain just didn't register it.' Ms Herlovson considers herself ‘lucky’ that the third and final bullet was not of the explosive kind as it hit her right cheek. ‘I remember it as just a force pushing my face into the stone, but I never knew what had actually happened until they told me at the hospital.’ 'I don't use my time feeling my hate towards him,’Ms Herlovson said. ‘When I finish school, I want to get a job working with troubled teens’ After being separated from her best friend during the carnage, Herlovsen didn’t find her until the gunfire finally stopped.

I have friends and family who have supported me through it all,’ she said, adding that she rarely, if ever, thinks of her attacker. ‘I hate him. I really do.

The celebration included a groundbreaking to launch a project restoring the Mariposa Grove, which consists of 500 mature giant sequoia trees that are among the oldest living organisms in the world. National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis said the anniversary should be a reminder of the ancient treasures within the park. 'We stand in awe among these giant trees that are thousands of years old and are reminded about the importance of protecting our natural resources so that future generations can experience what John Muir called 'nature's forest masterpiece,' Jarvis said. President Abraham Lincoln's signature on the Yosemite Land Grant bill on June 30, 1864, set a precedent for the preservation of the young country's wilderness, becoming the first instance of the U.S. government setting aside scenic wilderness for public use and preservation .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . That momentary decision to answer the phone while driving a car ended the short life of a young Sydney model, an inquest has revealed. Sarah Durazza’s final words were heard by her boyfriend Scott Bidder as they spoke on the phone before she lost control of her car and slammed into a tree on the Wakehurst Parkway at Narrabeen on Sydney's Northern Beaches about 7.30pm on August 26 last year. The tragedy should serve as a ‘terrible warning’ of the dangers of inattention while driving, Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon said in delivering his findings on Friday into the 26-year-old's death. Sarah Durazza's final words were heard by her boyfriend Scott Bidder as they spoke on the phone including her losing control of the car . Sarah's parents Paul (left) and Fiona (centre) Durazza have called for a safety audit of the Wakehurst Parkway road where their daughter lost control of her car . Ms Durazza crossed lanes after she lost control of her car on the Wakehurst Parkway, then rolled the vehicle and smashed into a tree in August last year . ‘A motor vehicle can be transformed into a deadly weapon in a moment by inattention or distraction,’ Magistrate Dillon said. The Mona Vale resident, who also worked as a beautician, had been talking on her phone with Mr Bidder with whom she had argued with earlier in the day. ‘The fact that she was on the phone immediately before the accident and said, 'Oh shit...' as she answered the phone call from Mr Bidder is highly suggestive that it was the act of answering the phone ... that caused her to take her eye off the road momentarily but sufficiently long for her to run onto the verge,’ Magistrate Dillon found. Mr Bidder and Sarah's mother, Fiona Durazza, were among the first at the scene. ‘Mrs Durazza immediately understood that Sarah was either very badly injured or dead. She fell to her knees in distress,’ he said.

A man who faces life imprisonment for raping and killing a University of New Hampshire student in 2012 does not want to appear for his sentencing this week. Seth Mazzaglia was convicted June 27 of first-degree murder and other felonies in the death of Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts. Prosecutors say he strangled, then raped the 19-year-old Marriott in his Dover apartment after she rebuffed his sexual advances. Seth Mazzaglia wants to skip his own sentencing for the rape and murder of Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, a 19-year-old college student . Mazzaglia, 31, is scheduled to be . sentenced Thursday and at least 11 family and friends of the victim are . expected to give statements. In a brief motion filed Friday, Mazzaglia . said it is his constitutional right to not appear. Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts was choked to death by Seth Mazzaglia in 2012 . In his response, prosecutor Peter Hinckley wrote, 'To be sure, the defendant has a constitutional right to be present, and can waive that right.' But he said Mazzaglia has not set forth any reasons he should be absent, . and that the interests in having him present outweigh his objection. Prosecutors will argue against the motion at a hearing Tuesday in Dover. Mazzaglia's girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, 20, is already serving jail time for hindering prosecution. McDonough testified that she lured Marriott to their Dover apartment because Mazzaglia, a karate instructor, wanted another woman to join their sexual escapades, which . included bondage. She at first told investigators that Marriott died during rough sex between the . two women that involved restraints. After getting immunity from . prosecution, McDonough changed her story and said Mazzaglia strangled . Marriott, then raped her. Mazzaglia did not testify. In court, she testified that Mazzaglia was the sexually dominant partner in their relationship and became angry when she left for nearly two weeks at theater camp without recruiting a sex partner for him. As what she called punishment, Mazzaglia told her to lure a woman — Marriott — to the apartment on Oct. 9, 2012. After a game of strip poker which prosecutors say Marriott willingly joined, Mazzaglia suggested she kiss his girlfriend. Miss Marriott said no, saying she was in a committed relationship. Mazzaglia then asked if she would watch as he and McDonough had sex. She again said no. Deadly duo: The killer's girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough (right), lured Marriott to the couple's apartment for bondage play as punishment for having upset Mazzaglia . Prosecutors said the domineering Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to being rejected so, as the two women watched a movie, he sneaked up behind Marriott and choked her with a rope. McDonough testified that she left the room briefly and when she returned, found Mazzaglia raping Marriott's limp body. The two of them threw her in a river that feeds into the Atlantic Ocean. The victim's body has never been found. Hinckley said Mazzaglia should be held accountable for the crime, that his presence in court will help avoid any unnecessary and unwanted confusion, and that the interests of the victim and her family are 'hardly more compelling than in this case.' 'The defendant received his fair trial,' Hinckley wrote. 'It is now fair for him to personally receive the sentence that will result from such.' Jurors heard testimony over the course of 19 days and convicted Mazzaglia after a full day of deliberations.

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . Luxury department store Barneys has agreed to pay $525,000 to resolve allegations that minorities were singled out as suspected shoplifters at its flagship store. Barneys shoppers and ex-employees last year complained that detectives followed minority customers around — even after staffers identified them as frequent patrons — and disproportionately investigated their credit-card use. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said some salespeople subsequently avoided serving African American and Hispanic shoppers to avoid getting calls from store investigators. Scroll down for video . Review: Barneys New York Chief Executive Mark Lee, standing at the podium beside Reverend Al Sharpton (second from right) in October 2013 following complaints the luxury department store was racially profiling customers . Besides the $525,000 in fines and expenses, Barneys will hire an 'anti-profiling consultant' for two years, update its policy and record-keeping on detaining customers suspected of theft, and improve training of security and sales personnel. 'This agreement will correct a number of wrongs, both by fixing past policies and by monitoring the actions of Barneys and its employees to make sure that past mistakes are not repeated,' Schneiderman said in announcing the settlement on Monday. Barneys CEO Mark Lee said in a statement that the company was pleased with the settlement, first reported by the Daily News. 'Barneys New York has prided itself on providing an unparalleled customer experience to every person that comes into contact with our brand — open and welcoming to one and all,' Lee's statement said, adding that the store doesn't tolerate discrimination. Taking legal action: Trayon Christian (left) and Kayla Phillips (right) claim they were harassed by police at Barneys in New York after buying expensive items . Community outrage: Reverend Conrad Tillard speaks in front of a Barneys luxury department store in New York on October 30, 2013, as demonstrators protest the unfair security policies at Barneys and Macy's . Schneiderman's investigation came after two Barney's shoppers, both of whom are black, said last year they were detained by police after making expensive purchases at the Madison Avenue luxury emporium. In February, 21-year-old nursing student Kayla Phillips said she was surrounded by four plainclothes . cops who accused her of credit card fraud after she bought a $2,500 . orange suede Celine bag. In April, 19-year-old student Trayon Christian said he was followed by NYPD plainclothes cops outside the store and accused of fraud after he bought a $349 Ferragamo belt. No charges were filed in both cases, but the customers filed lawsuits against the store and the NYPD. The suits are pending. Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton met with Lee to discuss the issue, and the furor spurred an online petition asking rapper Jay-Z, who was collaborating with the luxury retailer for a holiday collection, to disassociate from it. He ultimately decided to move forward with the project, which raised money for his charitable foundation, under the condition that he helped lead the store's review of its policies. Reform: Barneys says it has trained security staff following allegations minorities were harassed at their New York flagship store (pictured) Sharpton said in a statement that Barneys' agreement with the attorney general was a 'move in the right direction towards fairness and equal respect for all consumers, but we must monitor and continue to be vigilant.' Meanwhile, minority shoppers — including actor Rob Brown — also made similar complaints last year against other New York stores including Macy's, which had paid a $600,000 fine and promised changes in 2005 after the then-attorney general made similar claims. Macy's and the 'Treme' actor reached a settlement in principle last month in his federal civil rights suit over the matter, both sides said, declining to detail the terms. In December, Barney's, Macy's and several other major retailers agreed to create and publicize a customer bill of rights.

Wassef Ali Hassoun at the gates of the Marine Corp. base in Quantico, Virginia on July 19, 2004. Hassoun turned himself in Sunday after fleeing the country amid pending desertion charges in 2005 . Hassoun's saga began in 2004, when he allegedly constructed a hoax to make it appear that he had been kidnapped from Camp Fallujah, in Iraq. Hassoun, who served as an Arabic translator, left the base on June 20, 2004. On June 27, a photographs surfaced of him being held blindfolded with a sword held above him. The picture aired on Al-Jazeera, with the message that he was being held captive by a group called the National Islamic Resistance, who would decapitate Hassoun unless their demands of freeing prisoners from U.S. detention were met. On July 3, Al-Jazeera reported that the terrorist group Jaish Ansar al-Sunna released a statement that they had beheaded Hassoun. However, these reports were later denied and proven untrue, when Hassoun returned to the U.S. embassy in Beirut unharmed on July 8. Hassoun blindfolded with a sword held over his head, broadcasted by Al-Jazeera on June 27, 2004. Hassoun allegedly deserted Camp Fallujah, and had promised to renounce his being a U.S. Marine . Hassoun with his mother in Tripoli, Lebanon, in an undated photo . Hassoun denied claims that he had agreed to renounce his membership with the U.S. Military, and took to the press following his return to the United States to argue that he had not deserted his post. 'I did not desert my post,' he told reporters at a July 19 press conference held at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. 'I was captured and held . against my will by anti-coalition forces for 19 days. This was a very . difficult and challenging time for me.' A five month investigation concluded with Hassoun being charged for desertion and theft of military property, including a military-issued M9 pistol he carried with him. Hassoun had not yet been formally charged when he fled the United States in January 2005. During the course of the investigation, he was not deployed but his freedom was not limited, allowing him to take authorized vacations. He did not return to Camp Lejeune from a trip to see relatives in Utah, prompting the military to official label him as a deserter and place him on the most wanted list. Had he been convicted at that time, Hassoun faced a dishonorable discharge, in addition to 5-10 years incarceration. Hassoun returns to the United States facing two charges of desertion, the first being his initially allegation of it and the second for his disappearance in January 2005. It was not said what Hassoun had been doing in Lebanon during the nine years he hid there. Hassoun (pictured facing center) with his unit at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

His brother claims that Hassoun chose to flee to his homeland of Lebanon because of pressure from the initial allegations, as well as a purported anti-Muslim bias in the military. 'Instead of them giving him medals and making him feel good about his . service and what he was doing for his country, they gave him an Article . 32,' Hassoun's brother said of the military court proceedings that his brother was . to have faced in January 2005. The Marine Corps denied any anti-Muslim sentiment in their handling of Hassoun. Hassoun was born in Lebanon, but was a naturalized American citizen. His family claimed that the last time they had spoken to their son was on December 29, 2004. Officials say that this case is completely unrelated to the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who disappeared from his post in Afghanistan in 2009.

The three-time World Series champion updated his fans through social media on Wednesday, as he thanked the Boston medical team treating him. Schilling has not said what cancer had been diagnosed, but he had been adamant from the start that he would not be letting the disease beat him. Winning: World Series champion Curt Schilling, pictured at a Red Sox game in May with his son Garrett, has announced his cancer is in remission . Relief: A tweet sent by Schilling on Wednesday announced that the baseball star was in remission .

When he announced he was in remission, the post was retweeted 2,500 times, and 'favorited' by more than 5,000 followers. In April, his daughter Gabby shared a photo on Twitter of Schilling receiving his last bout of chemotherapy. 'Beyond blessed to be able to say that my dad finished his LAST chemo today! just 3 more days of radiation,' she tweeted. Schilling had told fans in February that he had cancer, and that he planned to 'embrace this fight, just like the rest of them, with resolute faith, and head on'. In a statement released by ESPN on his behalf at the time, Schilling said: 'With my incredibly talented medical team I'm ready to try and win another big game.'

"By . Associated Press Reporter . An Oregon teenager identified Monday as one of two women whose bodies were found in suitcases in Wisconsin had a hard time after giving up her son to his father, but she was turning her life around and had won a college scholarship before she disappeared, her foster mother said. Investigators believe Jenny Gamez was killed in Wisconsin in late 2012 or early 2013, when she was 19. Steven Zelich, a 52-year-old security officer and former cop, was arrested last week and charged with two counts of hiding a corpse, though prosecutors say they expect homicide charges to be filed. Gamez had moved from her home in Cottage Grove, Oregon, to be closer to a community college about 20 miles north in Eugene. She lived with friends and visited her family, but eventually fell out of touch, said her foster mother, Lorraine Ericksen. Scroll down for video . Jenny Gamez of Cottage Grove, Oregon, as the second woman found in a suitcase June 5 in the Town of Geneva, about 35 miles southwest of Milwaukee . Friends and family described the 19-year-old upbeat and loved by all. She is believed to have been killed in 2012, when she disappeared . Steven Zelich, a 52-year-old former suburban Milwaukee police officer linked to a sadomasochistic online forum, was charged last week with two counts of hiding a corpse and is being held on $1 million bail . 'I was surprised that I didn't hear from her,' Ericksen said. 'I knew she spent some time in California with friends, but her friends in Cottage Grove said she stopped texting with them, and after that we could not get in touch with her.' She said Gamez, who had been in foster care with numerous families since she was 5, 'was a joy to be around'. Gamez gave birth to a son in 2008, and the boy's father gained sole custody in 2010, court records show. She then went to live with Ericksen. Ericksen said she was shocked when police showed up at her door Friday, looking for a hair sample and telling her Gamez might have been murdered. 'We were all wondering what had happened to her,' she said. Zelich was arrested after highway workers discovered the two suitcases while cutting grass June 5 along a highway in Town of Geneva, about 50 miles southwest of Milwaukee. The other body previously was identified as Laura Simonson, 37, of Farmington, Minnesota. 'It is one of the more horrific crimes I've been involved in,' said Geneva Police Chief Steven Hurley, who has worked for 36 years in law enforcement. 'It has taken a lot of twists and turns in the past few weeks.' Jenny is believed to have met Zelich online and then met him at a hotel in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, where she was killed . He said one reason for the delay in identifying Gamez was that she had never been officially reported missing. Ericksen said she last saw Gamez more than a year ago, when Gamez visited and brought her a plant. 'She was an upbeat kid who wasn't afraid of trying new things, she even took a sculpture class. Other kids all loved her. We were pretty close and it was devastating what happened to her,' Ericksen said. 'I'm also surprised she was involved with a man that age, it wasn't what she would do here,' Ericksen added. 'She never ran around with kids that were more than a year or two older than her.' According to a criminal complaint, Zelich told investigators he met the women online. He said he killed Gamez in late 2012 or early 2013 in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, and Simonson in November in Rochester, Minnesota. Rochester police have said they believe Simonson died in a hotel there because she checked in with Zelich on Nov. 2, and he left alone the next day. Gamez was identified through dental records, said Kurt Picknell, undersheriff in Walworth County, which includes Town of Geneva. Town of Geneva Police Chief, Steven Hurley, announces  Monday June 30, 2014, in Elkhorn, Wis.,that Jenny Gamez of Oregon has been identified as the second murder victim found in a suitcase midway between Elkhorn and Lake Geneva, Wis., on June 5, 2014 . He declined to detail how investigators linked Gamez to the bodies in Wisconsin. Walworth County District Attorney Daniel Necci has said he expects homicide charges to be filed in the counties where the women were killed. But Zelich's public defender, Travis Schwantes, said the deaths may have been accidents and perhaps something that happened during consensual sex. Zelich had been working as a licensed private security officer for Securitas Security Services USA when he was arrested last Wednesday. He worked for the police department in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, Wisconsin, from February 1989 until his resignation in August 2001, a few months after a prostitute told police the two had struggled when she tried to flee Zelich's home. According to a police report, Zelich told investigators the two struggled over money the woman tried to steal from him.","Jenny Gamez, 19, from Cottage Grove, Oregon, disappeared in late 2012 .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A nun who intervened to stop Billy the Kid murdering four doctors could be made a saint to honor her work in setting up hospitals and schools in New Mexico. Italian-born Sister Blandina Segale was dedicated to helping the sick and immigrants, but her encounters with Western outlaw Kid became the stuff of legend. The Archdiocese of Santa Fe is now making moves to grant a sainthood for Sister Blandina, who was known as The Fastest Nun In the West after her life inspired a TV show. This undated photo provided by the Palace of the Governors shows Sister Blandina Segale, who co-founded the first hospitals and schools in New Mexico and reportedly challenged Billy the Kid. Archbishop . Michael Sheehan has received permission from the Vatican to pursue the possibility of the nun, who also worked in Ohio and Colorado, being made a saint. It . is the first time in New Mexico's 400-year history with the Roman . Catholic Church that a decree opening the cause of beatification and . canonization has been declared, church officials said. 'There are other holy people who have worked here,' said Allen Sanchez, president for CHI St Joseph's Children in Albuquerque, a social service agency Segale founded. 'But this would be a saint [who]started institutions in New Mexico that are still in operation.' Segale, a nun with the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, came to Trinidad, Colorado, in 1877 to teach poor children and was later transferred to Santa Fe, where she co-founded public and Catholic schools. Miracle: Billy the Kid had several encounters with Sister Blandina, who stopped him killing four doctors and prevented him from robbing a wagon . During her time in New Mexico, she . worked with the poor, the sick and immigrants. She also advocated on . behalf of Hispanics and Native Americans who were losing their land. Her encounters with Old West outlaws later became the stuff of legend and were the subject of an episode of the CBS series Death Valley Days. The episode, called The Fastest Nun in the West, focused on Sister Blandina's efforts to save a man from a lynch mob. But her encounters with Billy the Kid remain among her most popular and well-known Western frontier adventures. According to one story, she received a tip that The Kid was coming to her town to scalp four doctors who had refused to treat his friend's gunshot wound. Sister Blandina nursed the friend back to health and when Billy came to Trinidad, Colorado, to thank her, she asked him to abandon his violent plan. He agreed. Another story claimed that when The Kid spotted Sister Blandina during an attempt to rob a covered wagon he called off the attack. 'He just tipped his hat and left,' Archbishop Sheehan said. Many of the tales were recorded in letters that the nun wrote to her sister, which were later published in the book, At the End of the Santa Fe Trail. Still relevant: Archbishop Michael Sheehan says Sister Blandina's work with poverty and immigration are still important issues today . 'She was just amazing. It's tough to live up to her example,' Victoria Marie Forde, of the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, said. The nun found St Joseph's Hospital in Albuquerque before returning to Cincinnati in 1897 to start Santa Maria Institute, which served recent immigrants. Sister Blandina died in 1941 at the age of 91, but her work still resonates today, with poverty, immigration and child care still high-profile issues, Sanchez said. Officials said it could take years - possibly a century - before Sister Blandina becomes a saint. The Vatican has to investigate her work and monitor for miracles. Those miracles could come in the form of healings, assistance to recent Central American immigrant children detained at the U.S. border or some other unexplained occurrences after devotees pray to her, Sanchez said. 'She's going to have to keep working. She's not done,' Sanchez said.","Vatican agrees Santa Fe diocese where Sister Blandina helped set up schools and hospitals can pursue sainthood cause .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press Reporter . A Brooklyn cab driver's daughter testified against him in court this week, more than a year after she fled an arranged marriage and he allegedly ordered a hit on her lover's family. Both Amina Ajmal, 23, and her father Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry cried in court as prosecutors asked the young woman to identify him. It was the first time either had seen each other since December 2012 - at Ajmal's depressing wedding ceremony in their native Pakistan. During her testimony on Wednesday and Thursday, Ajmal described the once-loving relationship she had with her father - detailing her happy childhood growing up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. 'Honor killings': Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry, a Brooklyn cab driver, stands accused of conspiring to murder the family of his daughter's boyfriend after she fled her loveless arranged marriage . But their relationship soured when Ajmal left her loveless marriage and ran away to America with boyfriend Shujat Abbas. She told the court that her father threatened to kill her and members of her boyfriend's family in what has been described as 'honor killings'. Choudhry stands accused of conspiring to kill Abbas' father and sister and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. He has plead not guilty. The defense claims that Choudhry, who was in Brooklyn at the time of the deaths in Pakistan, had no hand in them. They say government agents coached the daughter on how to manipulate her father into making empty threats that were recorded for use as evidence against him. Ajmal, 23, was born in Pakistan where she lost her mother at a young age. She moved to Brooklyn with her Muslim father in 1999 when she was nine, where she grew up living a Westernized life. Asked earlier to describe their relationship, Ajmal responded, 'We were very close. ... He loved me.' She spoke highly of how he drove his taxi seven days a week to provide for the family. Ajmal says she was allowed to have a cellphone, use Facebook and watch TV. She also attended school all the way through college. But many parts of her life were still anchored in conservative Pakistan. She says she first heard about the arranged marriage to cousin Abrar Ahmed Babar when she was just 10 years old. Her father organized the union so that Babar could gain U.S. citizenship to move to America as well. Ajmal and her father first came to a head when he found her messaging Abbas on Facebook in 2009, after meeting the young man from her village at her sister's wedding. That year, the father and daughter traveled back to their native village of Chiryawala for another marriage, but Ajmal got a surprise when her father said she wouldn't be returning home to New York. 'He told me I was too Americanized, and I need to learn my culture,' she testified. Stuck in Pakistan, Ajmal continued to communicate with Abbas using a secret cellphone, until caught by her uncle. 'He told me ""your father gave me permission to kill you if you don’t marry Babar,""' she said. Inevitably, Ajmal gave in and married Babar in a sad ceremony in December 2012. Footage of the wedding was shown in court this week. Both the bride and groom looked downcast. Footage of Ajmal's sibling's weddings was used as contrast, and showed actual joy, dancing, rifle shooting and money throwing. Clearly depressed in her marriage, Ajmal soon decided to flea the country and return to America early last year with Abbas where she lived in hiding. However she continued to retain some contact with her father, over the phone. When Choudhry began threatening to track down the man and kill him unless she returned home and restored the family's honor, she agreed to let federal agents record their phone calls. On tapes played for the jury, he can be heard repeatedly bemoaning the humiliation he felt over her disobedience. In their culture, sons were free to come and go, he explained. But, he added, 'When a daughter runs away, parents are demeaned forever.' He warned in another recording, 'If you don't come back, there is only death.' Shortly after Ajmal learned that the victims had been gunned down in Pakistan, she called her father and asked, 'Have you done this?' He responded that another person 'killed this time and made me part of it.' But he also repeated the threat that he would 'not leave a single member of their family alive' if she didn't return home. News of the killings had made him 'a man of no honor,' he lamented. 'My daughters are whores. ... You still have time. Think about it in the next 24 hours.' 'What will you do after 24 hours?' 'What else? Another person will be gone.'","Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry stands accused of conspiring to kill the father and sister of his daughter's boyfriend to restore 'honor' to their family .

Bergdahl, 28, had been receiving inpatient treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston. He is now receiving outpatient care on the base in San Antonio, according to the statement. The Army said his 'reintegration process' is proceeding with exposure to more people and a gradual increase in social interaction.

No accidents have been reported related to Monday's recalls. Honda Motor Co. recalled 2.03 million vehicles for the airbag problem, including 1.02 million in North America and nearly 669,000 in Japan. It said they were manufactured between 2000 and 2005. Scroll down for video . Honda Motor Co and other Japanese automakers on Monday recalled almost 3 million cars with potentially explosive air bags supplied by Takata Corp, bringing the total recall so far to about 10.5 million vehicles over the past five years . Honda, Mazda and Nissan are recalling millions of vehicles globally for defective airbags manufactured by supplier Takata Corp. that could possibly explode. No accidents have yet been reported . That came on top of a million vehicles Honda recalled last year for similar Takata airbag problems. Nissan Motor Co. recalled 755,000 vehicles globally manufactured from 2001 through 2003, while Mazda Motor Corp. recalled nearly 160,000 vehicles manufactured from 2002 through 2004. Like Honda, both companies announced recalls last year, but in smaller numbers. Takata recently realized that the earlier recall had not included all of the problem airbags, the automakers said. Toyota Motor Corp. announced an airbag recall earlier this month for 2.27 million vehicles, including some that were recalled last year. One fire was reported related to the defect, but no one was injured in that incident, Toyota said. Toyota, the world's No. 1 automaker, was also investigating a crash in Puerto Rico in which the driver suffered a minor cut on the forehead which may have been caused by an abnormal passenger-side airbag deployment. Toyota's affected models include the Corolla, Matrix, Tundra, Yaris and Camry. Takata Corp. cited how explosive material used to inflate Takata passenger-side air bags had been handled and processed in 2000-02 at plants in the United States and Mexico . The models recalled at Honda include the Fit, Element and CR-V, while those at Nissan are the Cube, X-Trail and some Infiniti models. Recalled at Mazda were the Atenza and RX-8. Tokyo-based Takata is a major manufacturer of airbags, seat belts, steering wheels and other auto parts. According to Reuters, Takata Chief Executive Officer Shigehisa Takada and Chief Operating Officer Stefan Stocker said the company was working with safety regulators and car makers. 'We will aim to further strengthen our quality control system and work united as a company to prevent problems from happening again,' they said in a statement. A Takata spokeswoman said it was unclear what the financial impact of the recalls would be, but last year's recalls cost the supplier $300 million. The 2013 recalls were intended to close the book on a problem that emerged as early as 2007 and has been linked to two deaths.","Air bags, created by Takata, may explode and shoot shrapnel inside cars .

Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was briefly taken from a jail to a hospital this weekend for an undisclosed problem, a Massachusetts sheriff said. Hernandez was brought to St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford Saturday and was back at the Bristol County jail in Dartmouth about an hour later, Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Sunday. Hodgson said he can't disclose what happened because of medical privacy laws. Medical treatment; Aaron Hernandez, seen left in this file photo, was briefly taken to a hospital this weekend for an undisclosed problem . Hodgson earlier told WBZ-TV in Boston, which first reported the hospital visit, that the trip was not because of a fight. Hernandez, a Bristol, Connecticut, native, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges in connection with the killings of two men in Boston in 2012 and the killing of another man found near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. The hospital visit, came a day after his attorneys said in a transfer request that Hernandez should be moved to a jail closer to Boston because communication with his attorneys and his personal safety are being compromised. Boston-based attorneys Michael Fee and James Sultan complained their client has dealt with 'bizarre and unprecedented' restrictions in his communications with his lawyers. Hernandez cannot always speak privately over the phone and in-person visits are limited to a specially-designated visitation room at the prison, they said.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Zoe Szathmary . A Turkish man who beat a New York City woman to death with a rock last year has been sentenced to life in prison by a Turkish court. Ziya Tasali, 47, was additionally sentenced by the Istanbul court on Tuesday to eight years in prison for sexual assault and theft. Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old married mother to two sons, was found dead on February 2, 2013 amid Istanbul's ancient city walls, days after her family reported her missing in January during a solo trip to take photographs. Authorities said Sierra was killed by a blow to the head. Sentenced: Ziya Tasali, pictured, has been sentenced to life in prison killing Sarai Sierra - plus an additional eight years for sexual assault and theft . Victim: Sarai Sierra, pictured, is seen at a NYC subway stop wearing the leather jacket she was wearing on the day she died-- which police say Ziya Tasali then sold at a nearby Bazaar . Tasali, a scrap-paper collector, has been on trial for Sierra's death since September. Sierra travelled to Istanbul alone after her friend dropped out because of financial reasons. Tasali admitted to killing Sierra in September during the trial but denied accusations that he had sexually assaulted her, the private Dogan news agency reported. Tasali was arrested near the Syrian border in March, and had been on the run since Sierra's body was found and was believed to be in hiding in Syria. During the trial, Tasali described himself as a scrap-paper collector with no fixed address. He admitted fatally hitting Sierra with a rock but disputed charges of sexual assault. 'I was sitting beneath the walls. I had sniffed paint thinner (vapors) and was high,' Dogan quoted him as telling the court in Istanbul. Deadly struggle: Surveillance footage shows Sierra and Tasali struggling next to train tracks . Last seen: This is the last image of Sarai Sierra, and was captured on CCTV on January 21 . 'I approached her and wanted to kiss her. But she hit me with her phone between my two eyebrows. I pushed her and she fell on the ground,' he said. Tasali said Sierra fought him back and hit him in the face with a rock, which made him 'totally lose control.' He said he then struck Sierra with a rock. Questioned about traces of his sperm found over the victim and some of her belongings, Tasali denied rape. Crime scene: Sierra's bludgeoned body was found in this spot . Husband: Steven Sierra is seen in this file photo . A defense lawyer said he did not believe his client was 'capable of grasping the meaning and results' of his actions. Judges hearing the case at the time ordered state forensic medical experts to place Tasali under observation and report back on his mental health, the news agency said. Sierra's husband Steven, who went to Istanbul last year during the hunt for his wife's killer, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday about Tasali's verdict.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . The huge sinkhole that swallowed up eight cars in Kentucky's National Corvette Museum is to become a permanent attraction. The museum's owners decided to keep the gaping hole after visitor numbers soared in the months after it appeared. They have even considered putting a couple of the Corvettes that were damaged when they plunged into it back into the sink hole. Attraction: The Corvette Museum plans to keep part of the sinkhole that opened up in February . Attraction: Visitors have flocked to the museum to see the crater that swallowed up eight cars . At a meeting in Bowling, Kentucky on Wednesday the museum board voted to preserve the 40ft wide crater that appeared in February. What . started as a tragedy soon turned into an opportunity to lure more visitors off a nearby interstate to visit the museum, which struggled in recent . years to keep its doors open. 'This gives us one more asset  ... to be able to attract those folks that maybe just having Corvettes on display would not get them to come here,' Wendell Strode, the museum's executive director, said. 'We think it will continue for some time to be of great interest,' he added. The damaged cars toppled like toys amid rocks, concrete and dirt when the sinkhole opened in the museum's Skydome. The cars carry a total value believed to exceed $1 million. The extent of damage varies widely from vehicle to vehicle. Unique: After a 60 percent surge in visitors the museum decided to make the hole a permanent fixture . The cars were eventually pulled out of the giant hole to great fanfare and visitors were invited to take a close look at the sinkhole and the damaged vehicles. Attendance at the museum, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, was up nearly 60 percent from March to the start of this week, compared to the year-ago period, officials said. Sign-ups for museum memberships also rose sharply, as did merchandise and cafe sales at the museum, which has started to sell sinkhole-related shirts, post cards and prints. Museum board members considered three options for the sinkhole: fill it in, preserve the entire sinkhole or keep a portion of it. They opted to maintain about half the 40ft-wide, 60ft-deep sinkhole, Strode said. There's a 'strong probability' that one or two of the damaged cars will be put back in the hole, he said. The project's estimated cost is $3 million to $5 million, Strode said. How much insurance will cover is still being determined, he added. Salvaged: Some of the cars that were plucked from the 60ft deep hole could be dropped back inside . Plans are to leave the entire sinkhole and the eight Corvettes on display through the end of August, and construction on the 'revised' sinkhole would then begin in September, the museum said. The last cars had been pulled out of the sinkhole in April, revealing far greater damage than had been expected. ‘The last . three or four cars that came out of the sinkhole ... we didn't expect . them to come out looking quite that bad,’ Dana Forrester, lead Corvette . restoration member of the museum', said. Among the wrecked vehicles was a custom-made car that was able to hit 175mph before it was reduced to ‘just a tire'. Jason Swanson, a University of Kentucky assistant professor in hospitality management and tourism, said keeping some of the hole is a smart decision. 'It's definitely a good thing to maintain some of that attraction that happened, to continue to capitalize on that,' he said. 'Putting the cars down there is a great idea. It lets people see some of the actual damage that can be done by nature.' Damage: This 1993 40th anniversary car was one of the vehicles left mangled by the sinkhole . No final decision has been made on how many of the cars will be repaired. Chevrolet stepped forward to oversee restoration efforts. The cars that took the plunge were a 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette, a 1962 black Corvette, a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder, a 1984 PPG Pace Car, a 1992 White 1 Millionth Corvette, a 2009 white 1.5 Millionth Corvette, a 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil and a 1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary Corvette. The museum owned six of the cars, and the other two were on loan from General Motors. Sinkholes are common in the Bowling Green area, which is amid a large region of karst bedrock where many of Kentucky's largest and deepest caves are. The museum is close to where Corvettes are made at a plant in Bowling Green. The museum is an hour north of Nashville, Tennessee, and less than two hours south of Louisville, Kentucky.","National Corvette Museum decides to keep hole as tourist attraction .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Officials say the search for a prominent outdoors writer on Mount Rainier was suspended after a woman's body was found, but the remains weren't immediately identified, officials said. Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Patti Wold said that the body was recovered about 3 p.m. PDT in the general area where teams had been searching for 70-year-old Karen Sykes. She said that the woman's body was found off the trail near Boundary Creek in rough, steep terrain - an area difficult to access and not commonly traveled. There was no immediate word on the cause of death, and Wold said the medical examiner would determine the woman's identity. Park officials had announced earlier in the day that the search had been suspended but did not elaborate. Missing: Crews continue to search Mount Rainier National Park for Seattle hiker Karen Sykes, who was reported missing late Wednesday . Sykes hasn't been seen since she separated from her hiking partner on Wednesday. She was reportedly working on a story when she and her partner encountered snow about 5,000 feet. Her partner stayed as she went on, with the idea that they'd reconvene, but she never turned up. The partner, who made it safely back to the trailhead, reported her missing at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. Six ground crews, including two dog teams, combed an expanded search area near the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Rainier's east side Saturday. Rescuers also searched by air. Sykes, had adequate survival gear to camp overnight in an emergency, Wold said. Her friends had hoped that searchers would find her safely sheltered. Safety concerns for Sykes and search crews included snow bridges, tree wells and steep, wet, slippery terrain, Wold said. A searcher was hurt Thursday when he punched through a snow bridge and was airlifted out of the search area. Sykes is well-known in the Northwest hiking community and has written numerous hiking stories for online publications and newspapers. She is also a photographer and has authored a book about hikes in western Washington. Her disappearance comes weeks after six climbers are believed to have fallen to their deaths while attempting to climb a challenging route to the summit of the 14,410-foot peak southeast of Seattle. Karen Sykes (left), an experienced hiker and writer, had adequate survival gear to camp overnight in the event of an emergency, officials said. She was working on a story when she went missing . Crews scoured the Owyhigh Lakes area of Mount Rainer hoping to find Sykes. They focused on the length of the eight-mile trail on Thursday. Six ground crews combed an expanded search area near the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Saturday. Rescuers also searched by air . Lola Kemp, a close friend who planned to hike with Sykes this weekend, said in an email Friday that she was anxious but still hopeful that searchers will find Sykes, safely sheltered somewhere. 'She is the guru of trails,' said Kemp, adding that Sykes hikes at least twice a week and has a background in climbing and scrambling. 'I find it difficult to imagine that she would get lost. I think it's more likely she's injured and waiting, perhaps impatiently, to be rescued.' Greg Johnston, a former outdoors writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said Sykes was an avid, strong hiker who knew the mountain extremely well. 'She's the last person anyone would expect to get lost, particularly on Mount Rainier,' said Johnston, who recruited Sykes to write a weekly hiking feature for that newspaper, which ran for more than a decade. 'If anybody can survive it, it's her. She's really tough and really savvy.' Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano located near Seattle, spawns six major rivers and is a well-known hiking destination . Search teams were scouring steep, rugged terrain in the Owyhigh Lakes area for a second day Friday. They were focused along the length of the 8-mile Owyhigh Lakes Trail. In a separate search, an injured climber was airlifted Thursday off Double Peak after crews responded to a spot-locator beacon.","A woman's body was found on Mount Rainer Sunday in the general area where teams had been searching for 70-year-old Karen Sykes .

"By . Damien Gayle . A cyclist is making his way more than 1,900 miles across Europe fuelled only by food he is able to rescue from bins along the way. Baptiste Dubanchet set off from Paris, France, in April and is cycling all the way to the Polish capital, Warsaw, in a bid to raise awareness of how much food we waste. The 25-year-old from Bordeaux has already travelled through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, surviving only on food destined for landfill. Baptiste Dubanchet pictured raiding supermarket bins in Berlin, Germany, during his 1,900-mile odyssey across Europe eating only food that others have thrown away.

A wealth of food: This picture shows how much edible food is thrown away by businesses every single day . Along the way he has stayed with locals met online, who agreed to put him up for free, but he has refused any food - or even a beer - other than what has already been discarded. When he's been unable to find a sofa to sleep on he's camped out in the open. 'The objective is to make this trip relying only from food destined to be thrown away, from hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets and markets, in order to denounce food waste,' he says on his website. Campaigners in Britain have welcomed his project, pointing out that even as we throw away hundreds of thousands of tons of edible food, there are people who do not have enough to eat. Mr Dubanchet chose to make the journey by bicycle to keep his carbon footprint as close to zero as possible. He set off on April 15 and last weekend he arrived in Konin, Poland, for the last leg of his journey. Yum: Mr Dubanchet eats a calabrese during a snack break during his trans-continental bike ride . Mr Dubanchet during a stop off in Belgium: He chose to cycle to keep his carbon footprint as low as possible . Mr Dubanchet in the Netherlands: He said the idea came to him when he was travelling in the developing world . As he travelled throught Germany, he told a reporter for The Local that his first objective when arriving at a new town is to track down sources of food. 'I have to find food fast because after all the cycling I am tired and I need the energy,' he said. 'Is my stomach full or empty? That is the most important thing, not what I am eating.' He has a sign written in each country's language to explain his project, but said many businesses have a policy of not giving anything away - even if it's to be thrown in the bin. Some workers, he says, have even risked their jobs to help him out. Mr Dubanchet said the idea came to him when he want travelling in Latin America and South East Asia after he graduated. He said the sight of so many people going hungry compelled him to do something to highlight how much food we waste in Europe. He wrote on his blog: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable. 'I find some food thrown away just because the packaging is wet or damaged, whole bags of fruit in the bin because one of the fruit is bruised, yoghurts, cheese, or other products discarded because of irrelevant expiry dates.' Mr Dubanchet and a friend with food he'd raided from a bin: The Frenchman has stayed with strangers met online during his journey and, when he couldn't find anyone to put him up, he camped out in the open . In a host's kitchen in Frankfurt: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable,' he wrote on his blog . Epic journey: Mr Dubanchet has visited six countries on his trip across Europe, and not spent a penny on food . Mary McGrath, chief executive of British charity FoodCycle, which takes food destined for the bin, cooks it up and serves it to people at risk of food poverty, welcomed Mr Dubanchet's initiative. She said: 'Baptiste has highlighted the unacceptable level of food waste that exists at all stages of the supply chain - from farm to fork. 'In the UK it is estimated that over 400,000 tonnes of food is thrown away at retail level yet over 4 million people are affected by food poverty. 'Food poverty and food waste shouldn’t co-exist in the same communities but unfortunately they do. 'We should be doing everything possible to ensure that as much edible surplus food as possible is going to help people who are struggling to get by.'","Baptiste Dubanchet's project aims to show how much food Europeans waste .

"By . Damien Gayle . Prime suspect: John Matthews, 34, who police believe hit and choked a woman in an on-street argument then stabbed a man who came to her aide . A man is on the run from police who say he choked and beat a woman in the street then stabbed a man who tried to help her with a screwdriver. It was the early hours of the morning when John Matthews, 34, began hitting and throttling a woman outside Play Sports Bar in Annadale, Staten Island, New York City, police said. When a passing driver who saw the attack pulled over to help the woman, Matthews is alleged to have pulled a screwdriver from his trousers. He then stabbed the man repeatedly in the back, before fleeing the scene when a bouncer from the bar ran outside. 'He saw a scuffle in the street,' a Play Sports Bar worker told silive.com. 'And he ran out immediately.' The worker, who asked not to be named said the incident was not connected to the bar. Paramedics took the 36-year-old victim to Staten Island University Hospital, where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. The woman refused treatment at the scene. Police blocked off a road in Arrochar after reports that Matthews had barricaded himself in a home there, but it subsequently turned out that he wasn't inside. Police are now asking for help tracking down Matthews, their prime suspect in the incident, which happened at about 3.30am on Friday morning.

"By . Damien Gayle . 'There's pot and there's pot': Bill Clinton said that the decision on whether or not to legalise marijuana should be left to individual states . Bill Clinton says individual states should decide whether to legalise pot without interference from the federal government. The former president, who famously said he smoked the drug but 'didn't inhale', said he thought there was 'a lot of evidence to argue for the medicinal marijuana thing'. But he added there were 'unresolved questions' and it was up to states to to decide whether legalisation was in the public interest. His remarks on medicinal marijuana . appeared to contradict comments made by his wife, Hillary - the former . secretary of state who is now mooted as a future Democrat presidential . candidate - earlier this month. 'I . think we should leave it to the states,' said Mr Clinton in an . interview with NBC's David Gregory, recorded in Colorado - where weed is . legal - and broadcast yesterday. 'This really is a time when there should be laboratories of democracy, because nobody really knows where this is going. 'Are . there adequate quality controls? There's pot and there's pot; what's in . it? What's going to happen? There are all these questions.' Federal . law currently classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug - the most . dangerous kind - but both Colorado and Washington have nevertheless . legalised it for recreational use. A . further 22 states and the District of Columbia have either legalised . weed for medicinal use or decriminalised its possession, or both. Clinton's . opinion chimes with America's changing attitudes towards the use of . marijuana. A Pew Research Center poll conducted last year found 52 per . cent backed legalisation, against 45 per cent who do not. The . UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates one in eight Americans smokes . dope regularly, far more than the UK, where just more than one in 20 . uses the drug, and even Jamaica, where nearly 10 per cent smoke it. Liberal view: In an interview with NBC's David Gregory, left, Mr Clinton, who famously said he smoked weed but 'didn't inhale', said he thought there was 'a lot of evidence to argue for the medicinal marijuana thing' Mr Clinton added: 'I like where it is now. If the state wants to try it, they can. And then they will be able to see what happens.' Last month Mrs Clinton told a CNN 'Town Hall' event that there weren't enough facts to decide on whether marijuana could be an effective medicine. 'I don’t think we’ve done enough research yet,' she said. 'Although I think for people who are in extreme medical conditions and have anecdotal evidence that it works, there should be availability under appropriate circumstances. 'But I do think we need more research, because we don't know how it interacts with other drugs.' A spokesman from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws - a pro-legalisation group - welcomed Mr Clinton's comments and hoped his wife would follow his stance. The spokesman said: 'President Clinton's comments illustrate just how far the issue of marijuana legalization has come since the 1990s. 'During his tenure in office, Bill Clinton oversaw one of the largest increases of America's prison population in U.S. history - one largely fuelled by drug arrests - and also lead a rather severe crackdown on states that were moving towards implementation of medical marijuana programs. 'His embrace of federalism on this issue is a welcome evolution and denotes the power overwhelming public support, and the political pressure that comes with it, has on the topic of marijuana law reform. 'Hopefully this signifies the type of rhetoric we will also see coming from a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.'

"By . James Nye For Mailonline . Lawsuit: Joe Rogers Jr. is suing his former housekeeper over claims she secretly recorded a sex tape of the two together and tried to extort him over it . The married CEO of the Waffle House restaurant chain who claims his former assistant tried to extort him with a sex tape of them together appeared in court in Atlanta on Wednesday. Joe Rogers Jr. is suing Mye Brindle and her three attorney's claiming that his ex-housekeeper tried to blackmail him to settle her own sexual harassment claims. The legal battle is being fought over a video of a sex-act between Rogers and Brindle which the fast-food chief claims was recorded without his knowledge and set-up by his assistant at the instruction of her legal team. A Cobb Country Superior Court judge heard the lawsuit, which was filed on May 30 in which Rogers accuses attorneys David Cohen, Hylton Dupree and John Butters of colluding with Mye Brindle to obtain evidence illegally. 'As part of their scheme, Defendants decided that a video clearly depicting the sexual encounters would enable them to force Rogers to pay exorbitant sums under the threat that they would disclose publicly the sexual encounters which had occurred between Brindle and Rogers,' the lawsuit states according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The lawsuit alleges that Brindle, who served as Rogers' assistant and housekeeper from May 2003 to June 2012 did have 'infrequent consensual sexual encounters' with him. Scroll Down for Video . Mistakes: Waffle House CEO Joe Rogers Jr (left) has the support of his wife Fran (right) and though admitted the affair said . he did not do anything legally wrong . However, he completely denies any sexual harassment and claims that Brindle launched her sexual suit to extort money from him. Waffle House has over 2,100 locations across the United States, predominantly in the South and was founded by Rogers. The family is estimated to be worth upwards of $400 million. All three attorneys named in the suit and Brindle deny the claims that Rogers has made. 'Mr. Rogers’ baseless allegations are an act of desperation,' Dupree told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We will respond in court at the appropriate time.' Accusations: Rogers' housekeeper, who cannot be identified, worked for the businessman for almost a decade before handing in her notice in June of 2012 . Last year a  judge took custody of the DVDs recorded in secret, which included a video and about 15 audio recordings, and viewed them in a closed court hearing. During those proceedings, Cobb County Court Judge Robert Leonard II ruled that the housekeeper was a willing participant in the sexual encounter and was not a 'victim of sexual battery'. Leonard II wrote in the order: 'The defendant's arguments that she was a victim of the crime of sexual battery and was permitted to record plaintiff's actions to gather evidence of a crime is extremely unpersuasive to the court. 'The video recording makes it clear that defendant was a willing participant in the sexual encounter and is not the victim of sexual battery.' Also last year, details of how the woman recorded the sexual encounter were revealed, ABC reported. The court document states that the woman's attorneys met with her in a private investigator's office where she was ordered a 'spy camera' disguised as a cellphone. The lawsuit stems from accusations made by Rogers' former employee, who cannot be identified, who says she was forced into sex. The former employee filed a police report saying Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts to keep her job. Rogers said they had a consensual sexual relationship and that the woman is attempting extortion. Claims: The 43-year-old housekeeper told Atlanta police in 2012 that the Waffle House CEO demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job . The 43-year-old woman told Atlanta police in September 2012 that Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job and that he also tried to force her to have sex with him despite her repeated protests. She said that he touched her breasts, tried to remove her clothes, made lewd comments, appeared naked before her and insisted she perform sex acts on him at least once or twice a month. She said this occurred for nearly a decade, from 2003 through June of 2012 until she handed in her resignation. Rogers said she is not telling the truth. He released a statement at the time saying: 'Over an almost eight-year period when I was separated, single and re-married, I had a series of infrequent, consensual sexual encounters with my housekeeper.' He said the woman worked for 15 hours a week from 2003 until she was let go in 2008. He said she later was rehired as his house manager and quit her job in June . 'Shortly thereafter, on July 16, 2012, I received a letter from her attorney containing false allegations and strong threats,' Rogers said. 'According to her attorneys, she now wants millions of dollars from me.' Rogers said he shared the letter from the woman's attorney with his wife and they hired lawyers to look into the situation. Rogers and the woman sued each other, but documents in those cases were sealed. Rogers' attorney, Robert Ingram, said a Cobb County judge lifted a gag order in Rogers' lawsuit Tuesday 'so Joe could get his version of the story out'. 'They were tapes that [she] recorded, which is a crime in the state of Georgia to record somebody when that person had an expectation of privacy and doesn't consent to the recording,' Ingram said. David Cohen, the woman's attorney, said: 'We understand he's obviously trying to spin his wrongful actions in some positive light. 'We believe attempting to attack the victim will only make matters worse and that the parties just need to let a jury decide the issues. Our position and facts as they have evolved thus far are stated in our verified counterclaim filed in the courthouse, which is part of the record unsealed by the court today.' In the police report, the woman identified herself as a single mother. She said she stayed in the job and submitted to Rogers because she couldn't find other employment with comparable pay. She said she gave Rogers a letter of resignation in June after her son secured a full college scholarship. Rogers said he was wrong to have sex with the woman during a period when he was separated and later remarried. 'That was wrong of me and I am very sorry for the pain and embarrassment I've caused my wife and family. There is no excuse for what I have done,' he said.

"By . Sara Malm . A British man has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing underage girls in Cambodia after he was seen walking hand-in-hand with an 11-year-old girl in Phnom Penh. Geneva-born Michael Jones, thought to be from South Wales, is said to have taken at least one underage girl to a rented room in the city on several occasions, and was seen ‘hugging and kissing’ her in public. The 55-year-old was also pictured with half-dressed eight and nine-year-old girls and with a small child nestled on his lap. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Suspected paedophile Michael Jones was arrested by Cambodian police after he was snapped strolling hand in hand with an 11-year-old girl in Phnom Pen . The images led to Jones' arrest on suspicion of sexually abusing girls in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. One 11-year-old has made allegations to police that she was paid £3 for sex after being taken three times to a rented room by a man. Charity Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) took the pictures of Jones while investigating him after suspicions were raised on his last visit in 2013. ‘On April 9, 2013, an APLE investigator commenced the investigation into Michael Jones when he was contacting two under-age Cambodian girls along the river front,’ an APLE spokesman said. The children were thought to be 12 or 13. ‘Shortly afterward Michael Jones brought the same two under-age girls to a shopping centre, where APLE investigators witnessed him buying some unidentified stuff for the same two girls and he gave some money for the girls to play games. Video courtesy of One Body Village . Accused: The 55-year-old, believed to be from South Wales, was also pictured with half-dressed young girls and with a small child nestled on his lap . ‘After entertaining the two girls, he brought them back to their houses.’ On April 12, 2013, Michael Jones left Cambodia. His destination was unknown. Upon his return in June this year, APLE reactivated the investigation. APLE found that Jones was in contact with an under-age girl whom he took into a rented room in the Lake Side area. They discovered that although he was staying in a hotel in Phnom Pen, he kept returning to the rented room with the same 11-year-old, an APLE spokesman said. The charity say Jones took her shopping, bought her food and went to the cinema with her. He is alleged to have been seen ‘hugging and kissing’ the girl and was seen to ‘groom’ three others. The charity spokesman claimed Jones was seen promising to pay the rent for one family. It is alleged he then abused youngsters under a bridge. Suspect: Jones walks with the children in Phnom Pen in June this year, after returning to Cambodia . ‘On June 24, the police from Phnom Penh Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Unit arrested Michael Jones at Olympic taxi station,’ the APLE spokesman said. Six girls were taken to the police station to be interviewed. Four claimed they had been abused by Jones, who is said to be from South Wales. ‘On June 27, 2014, Michael Jones was officially charged by Phnom Penh's court prosecutor and he was remanded to Prey Sar prison awaiting further court proceedings and trial,’ the APLE spokesman said. He was charged with carrying out indecent acts against minors and paying for child prostitution. If found guilty he faces eight years in jail. ‘After the rescue, one victim was referred to a secure shelter while the other three remain on the street with their family,’ the APLE spokesman said. Laws exist to ban convicted paedophiles from travelling abroad, however UK police have no records of Jones offending in Britain. ‘South Wales Police Specialist Crime has not been made aware by the authorities in Cambodia of this arrest and are not involved in this investigation,’ a South Wales Police spokeswoman said. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We were informed of the arrest of a British national in Cambodia on June 24 this year. We are providing consular assistance.’","Michael Jones arrested in Cambodia on suspicion of paedophilia .

"By . Sara Malm . Experts are recreating the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand to establish whether a contemporary bulletproof vest could have prevented WWI. By using a replica of a silk vest said to have been owned by the Archduke, and a pistol of the same type used to murder Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, researchers at the Royal Armouries in Leeds hope to find out whether the Great War could have been stopped. It is thought that the Archduke owned a piece of silk bodyarmour, but that he did not wear it on the fatal morning in Sarajevo in June 1914. Could this have stopped the war? Researchers in Leeds are set to test a replica of a silk bulletproof vest thought to have been owned by Archduke Franz Ferdinand and a pistol like the one used to murder him in 1914 . Historic moment: Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg, pictured in the back of their car shortly before the assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 . The assassination of Franz Ferdinand . and Sophie by Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914, is . widely acknowledged to have sparked the outbreak of the First World War. The . idea of the re-creation of the event came after Lisa Traynor, a Royal . Armouries' First World War researcher,  found a pistol almost identical . to the one used by Princip. ‘I stumbled across a Browning Model 1910 self-loading pistol, the same type used to assassinate the Archduke,’ Ms Traynor said. ‘Upon . examining its serial number, I realised it was only 516 away from the . actual pistol used in the assassination and would probably have been . manufactured around the same time. ‘This . made me think about the 'what if scenario' surrounding the death of the . Archduke. If he hadn't been killed, would the war have been delayed? It is thought Franz Ferdinand owned a silk bulletproof vest like the one pictured here, but he did not wear it on the fatal morning in Sarajevo . Historic event: An painting from July 1914, depicts the moment Serbian separatist Gavrilo Princip shoots Franz Ferdinand and Sophie . ‘After months of independent research . in international archives and with the assistance of international . academics on the subject, I discovered that it was entirely possible . that the Archduke may have owned a piece of body armour.’ Now . experts at the National Firearms Centre in Leeds have tried to . replicate the conditions of the Archduke's assassination, to make . testing as accurate as possible. Royal Armouries' tests involve recreating replica silk vests, made to the original patent's specifications. Sharpshooting: The researchers will test the vest against the 1914 pistol . These replicas have been fired at with the same type of pistol and ammunition and from the same distance as the original event. Ms . Traynor said: ‘Our First World War team thought it would be interesting . to test the theory of silk body armour against the Browning Model 1910, . to understand the ballistic capabilities of 19th century body armour . against 20th century firepower.’ ‘I don't want to pre-empt the next round of tests, however I can report that silk does have bullet-stopping capabilities! So this research could result in very exciting results.’ The vests were created by a priest-turned-inventor Casimir Zeglen, whose product were sold globally and were bought by European royalty and heads of state. His armour comprised organic layers, most notably silk, which had the ability to resist bullets. Further experiments to test the capabilities of late 19th century body armour against20th century firepower will go ahead in early September. However, initial results have borne out a widely-held theory that silk does have bullet-stopping capabilities. This research will also form part of a new permanent exhibition at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, called 'Bullets, Blades and Battle Bowlers', which is due to open in September. Ms Traynor will also present an international paper focused on the research at the . International Committee for the History of Technology's Conference in Romania, which runs from July 29 to August 2.","Franz Ferdinand and wife Sophie were shot dead on June 28, 1914 .

Bourne Identity director Paul Greengrass is rumoured to be leading the project, based on Danish-born Morten Storm’s autobiography; Agent Storm: My Life Inside Al Qaeda and the CIA. Storm, 38, hit the headlines earlier this year with his non-fiction book, which follows his journey from a violent youth in Denmark via radical Islamism to life as a spy. Storm Bourne: Danish-born radical Islamist-turned MI5 spy Morten Storm is set to see his autobiography turned into a Hollywood movie . A member of a biker gang in his home country, Storm moved to Britain in the late 90s and converted to Islam. After falling in with controversial hate preachers such as Sheik Omar Bahri Muhammad in London and Luton, developed extreme jihadist views. Storm then moved to Yemen in 2001 and grew close to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Anwar al-Awlaki. As he became trusted by fundamentalists, he met shoe bomber Richard Reid and, at one point, was offered the chance to meet Osama Bin Laden. Spy game: The 38-year-old biker from Denmark converted to Islam after moving to Britain where he became raised and later moved to Yemen before becoming a double agent in 2006 . Under cover: While in Yemen and Somalia, Storm worked for CIA, MI5, MI6 and the Danish intelligence service . Game on: The film about Morten Storm is set to be directed by Brit Paul Greengrass, who is the man behind the Bourne-trilogy and Captain Phillips . In his book he reveals he turned his back on fundamentalists after he was prevented from travelling to fight in Somalia in 2006. He was stunned that he had been denied what he considered his fate and looked up 'contradictions in the Koran' on the internet in frustration. In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, broadcast last night, he said: 'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world.' He was later recruited by the CIA, MI5 and the Danish intelligence service, PET, as a double agent to inform on operations in Yemen and Somalia and prevent attacks in Europe. Storm's life is rumoured to be brought to the big screen by Paul Greengrass, director of the Bourne Identity spy-trilogy, The Guardian reports. Sony Pictures are said to have bought the rights to turn the book into a film after Greengrass took it to American producer Scott Rudin, who worked with him on the Oscar-nominated Captain Phillips.","Danish-born Storm radicalised in London and joined extremists in Yemen .

"By . Sara Malm . An award-winning physics student who murdered a teenage girl he had lured to his home with promises of a modelling job has been arrested a year after he committed the brutal killing in Mexico City. Javier Mendez Ovalle, described as a ‘genius’ who had represented Mexico in several international physics competitions, has admitted to strangling and dismembering 19-year-old Sandra Camacho in June 2013. Mexican police were finally able to track down the 23-year-old this month after he called his parents and told them the name of the cafe where he was working, local media reports. Killer: Award-winning student Javier Mendez Ovalle, 23, has admitted to strangling and dismembering 19-year-old Sandra Camacho in his Mexico City flat in June 2013 . Mendez Ovalle had met Miss Camacho on Facebook and has told police he killed her after she discovered he had made up the promised modelling work to get a date with her. Mendez Ovalle has been described as an introverted and extremely gifted physics student and the year before the murder, he won bronze for Mexico in International Physics Olympiads. Despite his academic success, Mendez Ovalle had been complaining to friends that although he understood science he could not understand women and was depressed that he could not get a girlfriend. In June last year, he began speaking to Miss Camacho and the pair agreed to meet in Mexico City after he made false promises to help her find a job as a model. The pair were caught on CCTV on June 27 as they met at a subway station in the city. The remains of Sandra Camacho were found in plastic bags near the home of Mendez Ovalle in June last year . Brutal murder: Mendez Ovalle told police he strangled Miss Camacho after she discovered that he had been lying about being able to help her find a modelling work in Mexico City . ‘He met the victim on a social network where he pretended he could help her find a job,’ Mexico City's attorney general Attorney General Rodolfo Rios Garza said. ‘He says that when she realised there was no job they started to argue and then he pushed her and injured her head. ‘Moments later the girl started to scream and then he strangled her until she was dead. ‘He says that he then panicked and he dismembered her body. He cut her legs off and then her head and put all the pieces into garbage bags and threw them out with the rubbish,’ he added. The 19-year-old victim's dismembered body was found scattered in plastic bags near Mendez Ovalle’s flat on June 30 last year, and police were soon on his trail after reading through the young girl's Facebook messages. Mendez Ovalle managed to stay hidden for more than a year, living under a fake name in nearby San Juan del Rio and working as a waiter. A prosecutor's office spokesperson said: ‘He never came back to his apartment or his old life and there was a worldwide search for him until we found him here right on our doorstep.’ Mendez Ovalle has admitted guilt, the spokesperson added.","'Boy genius killer' has been arrested in Mexico after a year in hiding .

"By . Sara Malm . and Mia De Graaf . and Gemma Mullin . Four teenagers were yesterday questioned on suspicion of murdering a former company director, who died after being knocked down by youths tearing along a seafront promenade on a ‘quadricycle’. John Wilcock’s devastated wife Lynne released the last picture of the 65-year-old grandfather, taken moments before he was struck from behind by the rented pedal-powered vehicle. The retired marine engineer, who had been battling cancer, was discharged after hospital treatment but died six days later. John Stuart Wilcock, 65, had been walking along the promenade with his wife when he was knocked over . Mrs Wilcock said her husband leaves behind three sons and two grandchildren. Detectives questioned four teenagers – two aged just 15 – on suspicion of murdering Mr Wilcock after witnesses said the four-wheeled bike had been driven antisocially along the promenade at New Brighton on the Wirral. They were later released on bail. Officers previously released a CCTV image of four teenagers said to have been acting anti-socially on the quadricycle in a bid to trace them. This CCTV image shows the quadricycle with the four youths before they knocked over Mr Wilcock . Detective Inspector John Griffith, from Wirral CID, said: ‘We are carrying out a thorough investigation into what happened on New Brighton prom involving the people on board this quadricycle and the gentleman who sadly subsequently died. ‘A number of passers-by went to this man’s aid after he had been knocked over and I would also encourage those people to also contact the police as they may have information important to this case.’ It is understood the Wilcocks were walking their two boxer dogs along the pedestrian promenade, between Bubbles play centre and Home Bargains, when the blue quadricycle came up behind them. The youths were earlier spotted riding and acting aggressively towards other people, according to witnesses. The quadricycle struck Mr Wilcock, knocking him to the floor. The group stopped momentarily and got back onto the quadricycle and left the scene in the direction of Fort Perch Rock. He was taken to hospital with swelling, bruising and head trauma before being discharged back to his home in West Derby, Liverpool. But two days later Mr Wilcock was readmitted after his condition deteriorated, and he died in the early hours of Monday morning. DI Griffith added: ‘At this stage it is too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the man’s death and it is unhelpful to speculate. We are treating it as an unexplained death until the results of a post-mortem examination are known’. The incident took place on July 22, at New Brighton, Wirral, and the four teenagers were seen fleeing the scene towards Fort Perch Rock .

A female brown bear roar inches away from the snout of a male with such fury that it must surely have been about something more serious than taking out the trash. The quarreling couple were spotted in a natural park in northern Spain, proving that the 'Latina temper' is not just a myth. 'I said ORGANIC frozen yoghurt!': A female brown bear has an almighty go at a male companion at a natural park in Spain . Spanish photographer Manuel Bruned, 25, was visiting the Cabarceno Natural Park in Santander, when he saw the angry bear. ‘This female bear let out a huge roar at one of the other bears,’ explains Mr Bruned, of Zaragoza, Spain. ‘She must have been angry at him for something, but it was so loud and powerful that I still hear the sound in my mind. ‘When I was a kid I watched many wildlife documentaries and this was the first time I was able to capture bears in their natural environment. ‘It was a dream come true.’ Getting an earful: The two bears were spotted in Cabarceno Natural Park in Santander, northern Spain . Size doesn't matter: The male brown bear shies away from the outraged - but much smaller - female as she roars in his face . In the bear house: Following true Latina stereotype, the female Spanish bear is definitely not backing down . Manuel watched from 150ft away as the female slowly approached the male bear, before letting out her huge roar. The natural park is located in a former open cast iron mine in northern Spain. Cabarceno Natural Park has two roles: one is the conservation of endangered species and the other is environmental education. Manuel says: ‘I do not like zoos as I feel most of the animals have issues when they are kept inside. ‘However, Cabarceno is different, as they have a very natural habitat and they look very happy to be there. ‘We have to change the idea of what a zoo should be.’ Queen of the mountain: Satisfied that her message has got through, the female bear looks satisfied as the male bear scurries away .","Female bear was spotted having a mighty go at a male companion .

"By . Sara Malm . A former top Chinese general has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party after he allegedly accepted bribes. General Xu Caihou, a former deputy chairman of the party's Central Military Commission is accused of taking money and property in exchange for promotions and favours. A party statement reported by the official Xinhua News Agency said he has been thrown out of the party and the case handed over to military prosecutors. Court-martial: General Xu Caihou, a former deputy chairman of the party's Central Military Commission is accused of accepting bribes, and has been expelled from the Communist Party . Xu Caihou retired as vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission last year and from the ruling Communist Party's decision-making Politburo in 2012. Three other senior officials, including a former deputy police minister, have also been expelled from the party to face corruption charges. President Xi Jinping who took power in 2012, has vowed to root out the corruption among the Chinese elite that has fuelled public anger in recent years. He has warned Communist Party officials that accusations of bribes and corruption could threaten the party's grip on power. President Xi heads the Central Military Commission, which controls the 2.3 million strong armed forces, the world's largest, and has repeatedly reminded them to be loyal to the party. Facing justice: General Xu pictured left with shamed former Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai, right, is the most senior person to date to have fallen victim to president Xi Jinping's campaign to root our corruption within China's ruling elite . Xi has made weeding out corruption in the military a top goal. It comes as Xi steps up efforts to modernise forces that are projecting power across the disputed waters of the East and South China Seas, though it has not fought a war in decades. ‘This is earth-shaking. To the entire party and the country, this is heartening news that sends a strong signal. It's a clap of thunder,’ said Ni Lexiong, a military expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. Xu had been expelled from the party and would be handed over for a court martial after being accused of taking bribes, the official Xinhua news agency said. The military and judiciary both take orders from the party and will not likely challenge the charges against Xu. ‘The party will never allow a hiding . place for corrupt elements. The military will also never allow corrupt . elements any place to hide,’ Xinhua said. Cleaning out: President Xi Jinping has vowed to root out the corruption among the Chinese elite, telling party officials it threatens their power . Both . the party and the army, the agency said, had to understand ‘the . long-term, complicated and arduous battle against corruption, and the . need for the fight against corruption to be put in a more prominent . position’. ‘Upon investigation, Xu Caihou took advantage of his office, helped others be promoted to positions and accepted bribes directly or through his family, used his position to influence others for profit and his family members accepted valuables from others.’ In separate and similarly brief stories, Xinhua also announced the expulsion of Li Dongsheng, former vice minister of public security; Jiang Jiemin, the former head of the state asset regulator; and Wang Yongchun, former deputy head of state energy giant China National Petroleum Company, all for graft. The party's official People's Daily, in a commentary on its website, said that the party should not be disheartened by setbacks represented by a few bad apples. ‘There's nothing scary about degenerates - clear them out and be done with it,’ it said. ‘Only by continually drawing the poison and lancing the boils can you ensure the body remains healthy.’ Xu has been under virtual house arrest for months while helping in the probe into Gu Junshan, who has been under investigation for corruption since he was sacked as deputy director of the logistics department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 2012. Gu was charged with corruption earlier this year. Xinhua said that Xu had been under investigation since March 15, though this was the first time the government has made a public announcement about his case. ‘Military anti-corruption efforts have not reached this rank before. It's very serious,’ said Zhang Ming, an expert on domestic politics at Beijing's Renmin University, noting that the fall from grace of earlier prominent military leaders like Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai were not related to corruption issues. The party leadership had faced a dilemma over whether to prosecute Xu, who is undergoing treatment for bladder cancer, sources have said. Reuters has not been able to reach either Xu or Gu for comment. It is not clear whether they have lawyers. The Xinhua dispatch made no mention of Gu. President Xi has launched a sweeping campaign against graft since becoming party chief in late 2012 and president last year, vowing to take down powerful ‘tigers’ as well as lowly ‘flies’. Xu is the most senior person to date to have been felled. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","General Xu Caihou 'took bribes' in exchange for promotions and favours .

"By . Sara Malm . and Sam Webb . A 16-month old girl who was killed by her own father in a tragic car accident outside their home has now been named. Angel Pitts died in hospital after she was hit by the reversing vehicle in Leeds, West Yorkshire, earlier this month. Angel, who had just learned to walk, had wandered out into the garden while her mother Megin was distracted and ended up behind the car.

"By . Sara Malm . Welsh rugby player Ian Gough has been found guilty of assaulting his ex-partner, just days after she got engaged to former pop star Dane Bowers. The 37-year-old attacked Sophia Cahill, 30, as he dropped off their young son outside the home she shares with Mr Bowers in south London earlier this year. The international rugby star, who is 6ft 5in and weighs nearly 19 stone, was said to have ‘manhandled and shoved’ the mother of his two children, after arriving an hour late to leave the youngest in her and Mr Bowers' care. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sophie Cahill in TV promo . Guilty: Ian Gough, 37, attacked ex-girlfriend Sophia Cahill, 30,  a former glamour model who was crowned Miss Wales in 2000,  when dropping off their son in January this year . Ms Cahill, who was crowned Ms Wales in 2000, split up with Gough in 2011 while she was still pregnant with their second child. The incident took place on January 5 this year, not long after Ms Cahill had announced her engagement to 90s singer Mr Bowers, 34. Ms Cahill was fighting back tears as she told Croydon Magistrates how the Newport Dragons player shoved her into the passenger door of his white VW campervan a week after she had suffered whiplash in a car accident. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Ms Cahill said she had been at home with her fiancé and her oldest child, waiting for Gough, who was running late in dropping off their son. She said: ‘From the house I was looking out the window. He parked at the right exit almost as if he did not want to come in.' Witness and victim: Former pop star Dane Bowers and Ms Cahill, pictured outside Croydon Magistrates' Court in south London, had got engaged shortly before the attack . ‘It was raining so I went out to the van. I was half expecting Ian to get out but he didn't and was on his phone. ‘It was almost as if he was mocking me by leaving me standing in the rain. ‘My son was in the passenger seat in his car seat. I opened the door and Ian stormed round the front of the van. ‘I . was a little bit taken aback but wanted to get my son out of the car. He was up and round like a shot as I tried to unbuckle him. ‘He grabbed me by the shoulder, the right shoulder, so I did not get to unbuckle my son and shoved me round.' ‘He grabbed me by the shoulder and flung me back and was saying 'Get away'. ‘I went back to get my son and said to him 'No Ian, it's fine, I can get him, it's fine'. ‘I went to get my son again and he got me by the shoulder again and flung me so I hit the door.’ Ms Cahill said Gough then unbuckled their son and handed him to her, after which she fled in tears back to her house where her fiance Mr Bowers was waiting for her. She called police about ten minutes later and Mr Bowers sent an angry text to Gough, the court heard. The assault took place outside the home Ms Cahill, a former glamour model, shares with Dane Bowers, left . Shaken: Miss Cahill, pictured with rugby stars Gavin Henson, left and Shane Williams, right, had been in a car accident shortly before the attack and was suffering from whiplash when she was 'manhandled' by Gough . The court was told that former Another Level star Mr Bowers wrote: ‘Did you just lay your ****ing hands on Sophie?’ Mr Bowers earlier told how he had seen the attack from the window of their home. He . said: ‘He grabbed Sophie and moved her away from the car. It was . forceful enough that I wondered ... I couldn’t hear what was said. ‘But in my eyes he had no reason or permission to grab her and move her out of the way.’ Just a few days before the alleged attack Ms Cahill had been in a car accident and suffered whiplash which required hospital treatment. She told magistrates that Gough’s alleged attack made her injuries worse. She said: ‘I had existing injuries. I was suffering from whiplash. I was in a car accident and it made it worse.’ Mark Haslam, defending, insisted Gough, of Penllergaer, Swansea, did not attack Ms Cahill but told her not to open the passenger door because he feared it could trigger her back injury. He also accused the model of being ‘abusive and swearing at’ Gough. But Ms Cahill denied this saying: ‘Absolutely not. There is absolutely no way I can imagine Ian offering any kind of help to me.’ Gough denied assault by beating at the house in the private street in south Croydon, but was later found guilty. After the verdict, Mr Bowers tweeted: 'I don't think there is ever a ""good"" result in situations like this but fingers crossed we can move forward and just concentrate on family!'","Ian Gough, 37, guilty of assaulting his ex-girlfriend Sophia Cahill .

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Sara Malm . The sun has been shining on the muddy fields of Worthy Farm as festival revellers enjoyed a final day of music and debauchery at Glastonbury. Country queen Dolly Parton wore the crown during the famous 'Sunday afternoon legend's slot' as she took to the Pyramid stage at 4pm. But behind the scenes at Glastonbury, it is a slightly different story, where volunteers are wading through mountains of rubbish bags fit to burst, already up to their necks in the clean-up in a bid to protect the fields from yet more damage. Scroll down for videos . Mountains of waste: This is just a fraction of the rubbish at Glastonbury in the morning of the third and final day, which volunteers must now wade through . Hold your breath: Covering their noses with face masks, the litter pickers made an early dent in the piles of rubbish, which will take days to shift . Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset, has been marred by torrential rain - and the trampling of 175,000 revellers - this weekend. Transformed into a mudbath by day one, the plains took a battering last night as crowds descended from their camp sites for Metallica's explosive set. It followed performances from Lana Del Rey, MIA, Haim and Lily Allen. After last night's heavy metal, the next act to grace the venue were dancers from the English National Ballet this morning, ahead of Dolly Parton's set on the Pyramid Stage at 4pm, commonly known as the 'Sunday afternoon legend's slot'. Excitement had been building ahead of . the Jolene singer's performance, with a flash mob or 'Dolly mob' as it . has been called, planned for the morning along with a singalongaDoll. The rubbish is deep but spirits are high: Excitement was brewing on Worthy Farm in Somerset this morning ahead of Dolly Parton's set on the Pyramid Stage . Mammoth task: The six-week clean-up will require the help of thousands as the Eavis family, who run the farm, aim to separate all recyclable goods from waste . Many fans were paying homage to the star today with specially-made T-shirts and fancy dress outfits. Speaking ahead of her set, the Jolene singer said: ‘I'm just a country girl and now I feel like a rock star.' Dolly was speaking as she was presented with an award backstage at the festival in recognition of her having sold 100 million records worldwide. Parton said she planned to play some of her more upbeat tracks from her extensive back catalogue. ‘I can't do a bunch of sad songs because everyone is drunk and high,’ she added. Parton said was ‘excited’ about playing the festival and could not believe she had never appeared before. As promised, Parton appeared in white, dressed in a skintight jumpsuit and huge heels, saying previously that the colour went well with the brown mud. Woops! Alva Hallerstrom, 21, who travelled over from Stockholm in Sweden for the event, took a tumble in the mud, falling flat on her face . Viking-style celebrations: That is going to be an effort to clean later as the sun is starting to dry the mud - but Alva seems more than content continuing like this . Unrecognisable: The once-green fields have been battered by torrential rain and the trampling of 175,000 revellers, transforming it into a mud bath . Swamped: Festival-goers are today hoping for sunnier skies and less rain after days of relentless wind and showers that have swamped the grounds . Binned: Thankfully the sun is out as these mud-caked umbrellas are completely destroyed. This poor reveller seems to be heading home just as the weather perks up . Murky: Three girls walk across what was once a luscious green field. Forecasters said the dry weeks before the rain made the mud situation even worse . As the crowd cheered, she told them: . ‘Thank you so much. It is such an honour and such a thrill to be here at . Glastonbury Festival. ‘I've been waiting a lifetime for this and of course we want all of you to have the best time. ‘I know you're here to see a whole load of artists at the festival and we're just glad that you came to see me.’ The 68-year-old star has been the most talked about act of the festival, following other artists including Ray Davies, Shirley Bassey and James Brown. Kasabian . will headline the stage later while other acts sure to make sure . Glastonbury goes out with a bang include the Black Keys, Massive Attack . and Bombay Bicycle Club. Legend: Country singer Dolly Parton took to the Pyramid Stage in a white sequined number for the so-called Sunday Afternoon Legend slot . Dolly mob: Bounding around the stage, she belted out hits including Jolene and 9-5 as people in the crowds wearing Dolly wigs performed a flash mob . Queen of glam: Dolly Parton entertained the crowd with her greatest hits, including Jolene and 9 to 5 . Dollywood: The crowd packed themselves to watch the 68-year-old, one of the most talked about acts of the Glastonbury festival . Having a Dolly good time! Two fans dressed up as Dolly Parton ahead of the concert at the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon . Cheeky: The 68-year-old Jolene singer said she would not be singing her sad songs such as I Will Always Love You, 'because everyone is drunk and high' Brave choice: Ahead of her performance Dolly said she had chosen the white outfit as it would go well with the brown mud . After two days of stop-start showers, many festival-goers will be hoping for a drier finale as previously promised. Temperatures are set to reach 19C, with cloudy skies but only a very slim chance of rain. Incredibly, . the bookies are already looking ahead to next year's festival and make . it long odds-on at 1/3 tickets sell out faster than they ever have . before. And looking ahead to . potential headliners it's Fleetwood Mac (5/1) who lead the way to take . to the Pyramid Stage, Kanye West is also fancied at 8/1 or it's a 10/1 . shot Kate Bush gets the bug for performing again following her temporary . residency at Hammersmith Apollo this year. Coldplay could headline for the third time at odds of 10/1 or Prince could finally take to the stage at 12/1. However, the good news is that Worthy . Farm is unlikely to be filled with 1D fans next year with their beloved . One Direction chalked up as 100/1 outsiders. Ready for the stage: Dancers of the English National Ballet prepare backstage prior to performing the Glastonbury Festival on Sunday . Unusual: Kicking off the final day, the English National Ballet made its Glastonbury debut with Dust by Akram Khan, warming the Pyramid Stage for Dolly . Worn and torn: Untouched pastures at the top of this aerial shot show just how much the fields, dotted with a swarm of multi-coloured tents, have been tarnished . Jessica . Bridge of Ladbrokes said: 'The rain might have tried to dampen spirits . this year but it certainly won't stop festival goers from purchasing . tickets in record time for 2015.' She . added: 'It's quickly becoming a case of when and not if Fleetwood Mac . headline. Michael Eavis likes to push the boundaries and we reckon Kanye . and Kardashians will be rocking up to Worthy Farm next year.' The festivities were tinged with drama . last night as it emerged woman has been airlifted to hospital from the . site after suffering spinal injuries. The reveller, who has not been named, was taken to Southmead Hospital, in Bristol, at around 5pm. It . is unknown how she came about her injuries but Dorset and Somerset Air . Ambulance confirmed the woman needed off-site attention. It . is not thought a 999 call was made and instead the festival's medical . services were the first to treat her before calling for help from the . Air Ambulance, on Saturday.

"By . Sara Malm . Missing: Arthur Jones, 73, was last seen early last week on the Greek island of Crete . A British grandfather has gone missing on the Greek island of Crete during a hiking holiday. Relatives of Arthur Jones, 73, are now desperately searching the island in an attempt to locate the keen adventurer after he failed to return to the UK last week. The retired Welshman – described as a veteran Bear Grylls-style adventurer by his family – has been missing since June 19 after going into the Crete hills, where he planned to camp for a few days. A major air and land search has been launched by the Greek Army, and helicopters are scouring the area near the resort of Chania where Mr Jones was last seen. Mr Jones, from Denbigh, North Wales, arrived on Crete last Tuesday, and sent his family a postcard in the first few days, saying he was planning a walking trip. The father-of-four has been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and had previously trained army cadets mountaineering and hill-climbing. Speaking from Crete, his son Jeff is hoping British tourists may help find his father. He said: ‘At the moment, the major problem for the authorities over here is pin-pointing an exact location. ‘We are looking for a positive sighting. ‘The area is so vast. I think that’s what’s taken us all a bit back really, now we’re here. ‘It’s not a small town. It’s not a small island. It’s huge, and there’s so many different areas where people go walking in.’ Mr Jones relatives have brought with them 1,000 leaflets in Greek and English, featuring the grandfather's picture, to hand out in the area. Lost adventurer: Mr Jones, described by his family as a 'Bear Grylls-style' hiker, had told his family he was going to spend a few days camping in the hills near Chania . Jeff said: ‘In Greece they have what is called a silver alert and when the adverts are on TV a poster to help locate my dad is being shown. ‘There is a big search underway now and we know the army are helping and there have been helicopters up with thermal imaging equipment. ‘We received information that he may have been looking to go camping for a couple or a few days so he may have taken camping packs and have shelter to survive.’ Arthur was staying in the city of Chania, but has not been seen since 19 June. Mr Jones said groups of walkers may remember seeing his father. ‘It stands out more if you see a stranger walking rough terrain, especially a 73-year-old man,’ he said.","Grandfather Arthur Jones, 73, missing on Crete since last week .

"By . Sara Malm . The tenants who last year found out that they had been living with the dead bodies of a murdered couple buried in their garden have said they have no intention of moving. Sue Bramley said she and her 15-year-old daughter, who live at the property in Mansfield where Susan and Christopher Edwards shot and killed William and Patricia Wycherley in 1998, will not move out. Ms Bramley spoke out as the Edwards, who successfully hid their crime for 16, were sentenced to life in prison for the murders and unlawful burials of William, 85 and 63-year-old Patricia. Behind bars: Susan and Christopher Edwards have been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of killing her parents William and Patricia Wycherley in Mansfield, in 1998 . ‘A lot of people have said, “How can . you possibly still live there?”,’ she told the BBC. ‘But I love our . home. We have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times . here.' Ms . Bramley said she ‘never really thought anything’ of the area in her . garden where grass would not grow, where it would later emerge the . Wycherleys had been buried in a shallow grave just a few feet down. ‘We . used to have birthday parties in the garden, which my young nieces and . nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area. My nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and I just think, “how close, how close”.’ For . years, Susan, 56, and Christopher, 57, kept claiming the Wycherleys' benefits, stealing £245,000 from them, and conning friends and relatives . that they were still alive. No clue: The current tenant of the house where the Wycherleys were murdered and buried has said she never gave much thought to the patch in her garden where grass would not grow . Not moving: Ms Bramley has said that despite having lived with two bodes leaving their home . The . Edwards, who were found guilty of murder last week, have to serve a . minimum of 25 years behind bars, a judge at Nottingham Crown Court . ruled. Sentencing the pair, . Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said the Edwards had created ‘an elaborate . charade’ which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to . what had happened to the Wycherleys. She . said the facts of the case were ‘so serious and your culpability so . high’ that she had no choice but impose minimum terms of 25 years each, . for each of the two murders, to run concurrently. The . court heard that the debt-ridden couple shot their victims at their . home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire on the May bank holiday, with the . couple then buried in a metre-deep hole in their own back garden. For the next 15 years, the couple kept up the elaborate hoax that Mr Wycherley, 85, and his 63-year-old wife were alive. The . debt-ridden pair made it appear as though the ‘reclusive’ Wycherleys . were still alive and had simply moved away, faking their signatures on . official documents, and sending Christmas cards and letters apparently . from them to family members. As . a result, they were able to rake in almost £250,000 in pensions, . credit, and the sale of the Wycherley’s home - much of which . celebrity-obsessed Susan, who also felt her parents had ‘swindled’ her . out of a £10,000 inheritance in the 1970s, spent on correspondence . signed by her favourite stars. The . 56-year-old was fixated with powerful older men - including Hollywood . actors Gerard Depardieu and Gary Cooper, legendary football manager Bill . Shankly, entertainer Frank Sinatra, and political giants Winston . Churchill and General Charles De Gaulle. Shallow grave: The bodies of Mr and Mrs Wycherley were discovered wrapped in bedding in a makeshift grave in their back garden last October . The judge said the Edwards had created 'an elaborate charade' which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the Wycherleys . Their . elaborate plot did not begin to unravel until  2012 when the . Centenarian Department of the Department of Work and Pensions wrote to . Mr Wycherley, who would would have been approaching his 100th birthday, . and asked for a face-to-face meeting. The . Edwards panicked and fled their council home in Dagenham, East London, . to Lille in northern France, renting a flat which they paid for in cash. Christopher Edwards, who could speak fluent French, attempted to find . work but was unsuccessful. By October last year, they were fast . running out of cash. In desperation, Christopher, 57, called his . stepmother, Elizabeth Edwards, back in the UK to ask for money - then . went on the stunning revelation that the Wycherleys were buried in their . garden. Revelations: The judge accepted accusations from Mrs Edwards that her father, William Wycherley (pictured) had abused her . He also gave . her the version of events that the Edwards to stick to during their . police interviews and trial - but she called the police as soon as the . conversation finished. Stunned . detectives then made the grim discovery of the Wycherley’s remains . buried three feet beneath their former lawn, and contacted Christopher . Edwards using phone numbers and an email address he had given his . stepmother. He eventually . replied and arranged to return to the UK, and the couple were arrested . at St Pancras International railway station a month after the Wycherleys . were unearthed. The only . possessions the Edwards, who had just one Euro left to their name, . brought back was a suitcase full of celebrity memorabilia. Included were . five items of correspondence signed by the 1950s film star Gary Cooper, . which Susan had splashed out more than £14,000 on during 2009 and 2011. It . was a sign of Susan’s obsession with celebrities, a fascination which . the court heard even extended to writing hundreds letters to herself . posing as the French actor Gerard Depardieu. The . fake 14-year correspondence, between 1992 and 2006, even deceived her . own husband, with Susan acquiring a machine to make it seem as though . the letters had a French postmark. Despite . stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds owed to the Wycherleys, . including selling their home complete with its macabre secret for . £66,000 in 2005, the Edwards remain deep in debt, owing around £160,000 . to creditors. Sentencing the couple on Monday, Mrs Justice Thirlwall described the killings as ‘shocking crimes’. She told the ‘self-contained couple’ that so far as they were concerned ‘only the two of you mattered’. The . judge told Susan Edwards, who sat staring intently from the dock . wearing a patterned grey cardigan and glasses, that she was ‘an . accomplished liar and a fantasist’. Mrs . Justice Thirlwall accepted ‘on balance’ that she had told the truth . about being sexually abused by Mr Wycherley as a child and that had . formed the basis of the hatred she felt for her father. ‘That background may explain why you hated him, which you did, and why you have no remorse about killing him,’ she said. The . judge said she did not believe Mrs Wycherley had ever known of that . abuse, as had been claimed in court as being the motive for killing her. Lies and deceit: A letter forged by the Edwards from William Wycherley asking that his benefits and pensions payments be paid directly into a numbered bank account, dated around six moths after the murders in 1998 . Evidence: Police believe this Second World War Commando Colt .38 calibre revolver was used in the murders in Nottinghamshire in 1998 . Mrs . Justice Thirlwall added that she was satisfied it was Christopher . Edwards ‘who held the gun’ and who shot the pensioners in the back . bedroom of their semi-detached home, and not as the couple claimed, . Susan Edwards. During . mitigation pleas, Susan Edwards’s barrister David Howker QC described . her abuse at her father’s hands as ‘an ongoing feature’ of her life . ‘that created in her, some would say, the justifiable hatred of him and . would be akin to a slow-burning, festering provocation that may explain . in some way some part of why it happened’. Mr . Howker spoke of the ‘disdain’ his client alleged her father had then . shown her in later life, including ‘his rejection of the only man in her . life, and the man she loved, Christopher Edwards’. He . said Mrs Edwards had no children, no friends and was facing the . prospect of jail apart from her husband, adding that her crime ‘already . made her a target’ behind bars, although he did not elaborate. Mr . Howker added: ‘The upshot is she will effectively serve her prison term . in circumstances akin to isolation, and from her point of view she will . be parted from her husband, which is undoubtedly a life punishment.’ Mrs . Justice Thrilwall said that she sentenced the pair ‘on the basis that . each of you intended that both Mr and Mrs Wycherley should be shot . dead.’ She added their . sentences had to reflect the serious nature of the double killing, . telling them they had planned to shoot their two victims - one of whom . was in his 80s - for financial gain. For . the offences of obstructing a coroner and theft, both of which the . couple admitted before trial, they were each handed a prison term of . five years and four years respectively, to run concurrently. Neither defendant appeared to react as they were jailed, with the pair led down from the dock in silence.","Susan and Christopher Edwards jailed for murdering her parents in 1998 .

"By . Sara Malm . Chris Christie has proved he is ready to joke about last autumn's damaging scandal over lane closures on George Washington Bridge after appearing on Jimmy Fallon. The New Jersey Governor joined The Tonight Show's host in a 'dad dancing' skit poking fun at September's events.

Governor Christie pretended to become upset with Fallon's joke during a skit called The Evolution of Dad Dancing . Ready to laugh: Governor Christie walked off camera in a fake huff after The Tonight Show host's 'surprise' quip during the sketch . After first dancing to moves with names like The Belt Grabber, The Lawn Mower and The Dance at a Springsteen Concert, Fallon introduced The Bridge is Closed – at which point Christy pretended to become upset and walk away. Fallon also 'apologised' to Governor Christie over a Born To Run cover he performed with Bruce Springsteen on his show in January which mocked the bridge scandal. Governor Christie, a favourite for Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential elections, also quipped he would beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 if they both 'hypothetically' both won their parties’ nominations - but in a dance off. The Evolution of Dancing is one of the most popular segments on Jimmy Fallon, which has previously seen Michelle Obama and Will Smith perform dance styles through history with the talk show host.

How the blue do: If the Governor and Fallon are to believe, the Democratic Convention sure looks a lot more fun . Two out of three toll lanes on George Washington Bridge, which connects the New Jersey borough of Fort Lee and Manhattan, were closed from September 9th-13th last autumn. There had been no warning to emergency services, local officials or the public and it caused severe gridlock and traffic jams in the local area. Initial reports said the closure was due to a traffic study, but it soon emerged that it had been planned by a member of Chris Christie’s staff and political appointees. Although never officially confirmed, it is believed the lane closure was an attempt to create animosity against Mark Sokolich, Fort Lee’s Democrat mayor who declined to back Governor Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. So far, four political appointees have resigned over the scandal. Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff, who is believed to have instigated the lane closure, was fired by Christie. Chris Christie has firmly denied knowing anything about the closures, and later visited Mayor Sokolich to apologise in person. Relaxed: Governor Chris Christie discussed the George Washington Bridge scandal during the interview with host Jimmy Fallon . Scandal: Two out of three toll lanes on George Washington Bridge was closed for five days last September in what later emerged had been an act of political retribution from Christie's staff against a Democrat New Jersey mayor . Governor Christie's appearance on Jimmy Fallon came as officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched an investigation into its operations after the bridge scandal. New Jersey newspaper The Record reports the Port Authority acknowledged the SEC investigation in a document it released Thursday to prospective buyers of its bonds. The newspaper says the SEC is looking at the Port Authority's justification for diverting $1.8 billion to pay for New Jersey road repair projects at the urging of Governor Christie's administration. The document also discloses the agency and related people have received several subpoenas, including from New Jersey federal prosecutors and the Manhattan district attorney's office. Additional investigations by the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, the New Jersey Legislature, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are already underway.","New Jersey governor Chris Christie appeared on The Tonight Show .

Longbottom throughout the franchise, said the Gringotts Wizarding Bank . was a new experience even for him. 'My . character never really went to Gringotts, which is why I've enjoyed it . so much because I never really got to go onto the set. ‘I never even saw it, so when I got to the bank today that was the first time and it’s pretty special. ‘I don't even know why I'm here,’ he joked. ‘I've just come down for a free ride really.’ Million miles from London: Helena Bonham Carter, who lent her voice to the attraction, unveiled the recreation of the wizarding world's London shopping street, hidden from the muggle world .

Wizarding World of Harry Potter has proved so popular to date, and I'm . sure that the attention to detail in creating the new Diagon Alley area . will make this an even better experience.’ A . small army of production staff has been working up to 100 hours a week . to painstakingly recreate the alley from Fred and George Weasley’s joke . shop through to the eerie Knockturn Alley.

'As the cub was sitting he leaned back a bit too far and rolled onto his back. 'Then, he began playing with its paws, as if he was trying to pretend that it was all part of the plan!'

'Most of people that view my work are wildlife enthusiasts, and they seem to appreciate the images with the same admiration and respect that I have for these amazing animals. 'Typically, the bears are less concerned about boats than they are with people on land. 'This is likely to be because they know they can easily escape into the forest. The photographer managed to get just 150 metres from the family of bears as he sat in a small boat . 'When you eliminate that escape route, the animal is forced into a defensive mode and typically gets aggressive.

The chance of bringing to life a T-Rex or a Diploids by extracting DNA from insects in amber, as depicted in the 1993 film, have been described as ‘highly unlikely’, according a study published in PLOS ONE. In the Spielberg movie, scientists extract dino DNA from ancient mosquitos trapped in 130-million year old amber.

The year before the film was released, scientists in California claimed to have extracted fragments of DNA from an extinct species of bee. But a study by the the Natural History Museum, London, found it was impossible to replicate. Using highly-sensitive ‘next generation’ sequencing DNA techniques on insects in copal, the sub-fossilised resin precursor of amber, researchers found the 1990’s studies provided ‘false positives’ mistaken for genuine ancient DNA. In fact they could find not detect ancient DNA in relatively young- 60 years to 10,600 years old- sub-fossilised insects and said the earlier results are thought to come from cross contamination between modern and ancient DNA. Using highly-sensitive next generation sequencing DNA techniques on insects in copal, the sub-fossilised resin precursor of amber, researchers found the 1990's studies provided 'false positives' mistaken for genuine ancient DNA . Researchers said the results raise significant doubts about claims of DNA extraction from fossil insects in amber . Study co author Professor Terry Brown, who carried out the study in full forensic suits in the ancient DNA lab at the University of Manchester, said: 'In the original 1990s studies DNA amplification was achieved by a process called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which will preferentially amplify any modern, undamaged DNA molecules that contaminate an extract of partially degraded ancient ones to give false positive results that might be mistaken for genuine ancient DNA. 'Our approach, using ""next generation"" sequencing methods is ideal for ancient DNA because it provides sequences for all the DNA molecules in an extract, regardless of their length, and is less likely to give preference to contaminating modern molecules.' Researchers said the results raise significant doubts about claims of DNA extraction from fossil insects in amber. Co author Dr David Penney, also from Manchester University, said: 'Intuitively, one might imagine that the complete and rapid engulfment in resin, resulting in almost instantaneous demise, might promote the preservation of DNA in a resin entombed insect, but this appears not to be the case. 'So, unfortunately, the Jurassic Park scenario must remain in the realms of fiction.'","In the film, scientists extract DNA from ancient mosquitos trapped in amber .

Some of his most famous creations include replicas of the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Caerphilly Castle and the Castle Keep in Newcastle. Mr Carney says his historical hobby began after he built his children a Lego castle in 1986 and he hasn't looked back since. He explained: 'Discovering the castle, hopefully finding a floor plan, often imagining what a ruin might have looked like in its heyday, and bringing it to life in Lego has been mostly joyful and relaxing.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . She credited him with making her life worth living again after a long battle with cancer. Now Jenni Murray is facing fresh anguish – after discovering her pet chihuahua Butch may also be suffering from the disease. Sharing the ‘terribly worrying’ news with her fans last night, the Radio 4 Woman’s Hour presenter said she is waiting for test results on a suspicious lump on the dog’s side. Small dog with a big heart: Dame Jenni Murray with her pet chihuahua Butch. She wrote a book called My Dog Butch, in which she credits the dog with helping her recover . She wrote on her blog: ‘Butch on Monday was very quiet and subdued. He slept and slept, woke at five on Monday morning, crying to go out. ‘He was sick, sneezing and just wanted to lie in my arms and I noticed a tiny lump under the haunch on the left hand side.’ Dame Jenni, 64, said she took him to the vet, where he stayed overnight. He ‘perked up’ the following morning and managed to eat a little. But she added: ‘Whilst his bug seemed to be passing, there was worrying news about the lump. A biopsy’s been done. ‘It could be something minor, but it could be something else. ‘I keep telling myself I had cancer eight years ago and I’m still here, but he’s only six. Please cross all fingers and toes, pray, if you do, and hope that the news, when the results come back, is good.’ Long battle: Jenni Murray, pictured when she lost her hair after chemotherapy to treat her breast cancer . When Dame Jenni bought Butch in 2007, she had already undergone months of chemotherapy and had had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Her sons Charlie and Edward – who is a vet but was ‘hundreds of miles away’ when Butch fell ill – had left home and she wanted a companion. But within weeks, she was suffering crippling pain in her legs – a side effect of the chemotherapy. She had to have a double hip replacement, and was unable to walk for months. Dame Jenni later wrote a book about the experience called My Boy Butch, in which she credits the dog with helping her recover. She said at the time: ‘Butch was there as a constant reminder that there’s life after suffering. And he encouraged me to take steps I’d otherwise have feared, leaving me with no excuse just to wallow on the sofa. ‘True, he’s only a few inches high, but he also does his utmost to protect me. He may be a mere chihuahua, but he has the heart and stomach of the fiercest rottweiler. ‘The smallest of dogs, with the biggest of hearts, he came into my life at its lowest ebb. And, quite simply, [he] made it worth living again.’ Dame Jenni – who has presented Woman’s Hour since 1987 and was awarded an OBE for services to broadcasting in 1999 – has two other dogs, Frida and Madge.","Dame Jenni's chihuahua Butch was a companion during battle with cancer .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Contrary: Jamie Oliver said that in his barbecue steak house women proved much more capable . Standing over the charcoals with tongs in one hand and beer in the other has long been seen as a man’s domain. But according to celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, the true masters of the barbecue are women. Contrary to generations of received wisdom, the 39-year-old said female chefs in his London steak house are much better at managing open flames. Men, meanwhile, panic if they cannot control the heat with a switch. He said: ‘Actually some of the best barbecuers are women. 'When we opened Barbecoa, it was the first restaurant in London that didn’t have gas or electric and for the first month, we just lost 20 male chefs and all that were left largely were women because they were a lot more sensitive to managing fire. ‘The men freaked out because there wasn’t a nozzle to turn.’ Billed as ‘Britain’s first ever barbecue steak house’, Barbecoa opened near St Paul’s in London in 2010. The menu features beef tartare, crispy pig cheeks, and seven different steak options. Last month, hygiene officers forced Oliver to shut down for 24 hours the Barbecoa butchers, which is underneath the restaurant, after they found mouse droppings, mouldy carcasses and out-of-date wagyu beef. Control: The TV chef said women were better at dealing with open flames - rather than sensitive controls . In recent years, Oliver – who shot to fame on the BBC in the 1990s as the Naked Chef - has concentrated on putting cookery videos on his YouTube channel, called Food Tube, rather than making shows for TV. He said: ‘I think Food Tube is the big one for me. If anything, I’m doing less in the next 10 years than I have been doing. I’ve had my very experimental five years and I’ve learned lots from it. ‘I’ve tried and tested lots of tiny things that were invisibly hidden in parts of other businesses and most of it has worked and a handful have failed and that’s what it’s all about.’","TV chef said women deal better with not having precise control over heat .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The official music charts will include songs that are streamed on services such as Spotify for the first time next month. As increasing numbers of music listeners choose to play songs online instead of buy physical or digital copies, the Official Charts Company has been forced to change the way it calculates our favourite tracks. From July 6, songs that are played through on-demand services, which also include sites such as Deezer and Napster, will feature in the charts, which are announced on Radio 1 each week. Scroll down for video . Popular: The song Pompeii, by British rock band Bastille (pictured), reached number two in the UK charts last year. But it is also the UK¿s most streamed track of all time, with more than 26million plays . The change could mean new bands find themselves at the top of the charts for the first time. The song Pompeii, by British rock band Bastille, reached number two in the UK charts last year. But it is also the UK’s most streamed track of all time, with more than 26million plays. The Official Charts Company will weight streaming to that 100 plays amount to one physical sale. So far this year the average weekly figures volume of streaming is 70 times greater than the combined sales of downloads and physical singles. Included: From July 6, songs that are played through on-demand services such as Spotify (pictured), Deezer and Napster, will feature in the charts, which are announced on Radio 1 each week . Online listening: Chart-topping hit Get Lucky by Daft Punk (pictured) was the first song to generate a million streams in a week . With some of the services offering free ad-funded accounts, it marks the first time that chart positions could be affected without music fans actually making a purchase. The move - which has been backed by the music industry - reflects the explosion in streaming which has occurred in recent months with audio streams rising from around 100million a week in January of last year to 200million at the start of this year. It has continued to rocket and peaked at 268million during one week. On average the number of weekly streams for 2014 is currently at 228million, while the level of single sales trails significantly at 3.2million. Chart-topping hit Get Lucky by Daft Punk was the first to generate a million plays in a week but with the ongoing rise, there have already been nine songs this year which have run into seven figures in a week. To qualify, songs must be streamed for a minimum of 30 seconds and there will be controls in place to stop users playing songs too many times in order to manipulate the chart. Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot said: ‘Audio streaming has grown at an extraordinary rate over the past year - and the time is now right to take this important step. ‘The Official Singles Chart is, and always has been, the most trusted and definitive measure of Britain’s music tastes. Just as it has evolved through the years to reflect the most popular music in the UK, from 10-inch to 7-inch, vinyl to cassettes, CD singles to downloads, this is the latest stage of that progression.’ George Ergatoudis, head of music at BBC Radio 1 which broadcasts the top 40 each Sunday, said: ‘We are moving from an era of music purchasing to one dominated by music streaming and it is vital that the Official Singles Chart evolves to reflect this.’ The official chart has been run since 1969.","Move by the Official Charts Company reflects explosion in streaming .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Jemima Khan yesterday revealed one of her teenage sons prevented a late-night break-in at her home. The 40-year-old socialite said the burglars were ‘thwarted’ by his actions in the early hours. Writing on Twitter, she told her 536,000 followers: ‘2am break-in, thwarted by son. Told not to put spikes on gate to prevent repeat as I’ll be liable if intruders get injured.’ She did not say which of her sons stopped the break-in or which of her homes was targeted. Scare: Jemima Khan and her sons Sulaiman and Kasim . Last night a Met Police spokesman said no report of an attempted break-in had been received. It is not clear if the crime took place in London as Mrs Khan is known to have access to several properties. She is understood to have one apartment in Fulham, south-west London, in a gated community where homes sell for around £3million. Mrs Khan, who is now dating comedian Russell Brand, 39, has two boys - Sulaiman Isa, 17, and Kasim, 15 - from her marriage to former Pakistani cricketer turned politician Imran Khan. The couple divorced in 2004 but she raised the teenagers, whom she has described as ‘painfully shy’, in the UK. She subsequently dated actor Hugh Grant for several years before they split amicably. Mr Khan, 61, claimed he ‘lost the will to live’ after the break-up of their marriage. He said not seeing his sons, then aged eight and five, caused him deep anguish, adding: ‘I loved fatherhood more than anything I had ever experienced in life ... now not having them around was the hardest thing to come to terms with. ‘For the first time I began to understand how people could lose the will to live. The children’s obvious distress exacerbated the misery.’ Writing in his book, Pakistan: A Personal History about his rise to political power, Mr Khan said: ‘My greatest sacrifice for being in politics was not always being able to spend as much time as I wanted to with my family.’ Mrs Khan, the eldest child of the late financier Sir James Goldsmith and his wife Lady Annabel, has kept her ex-husband’s surname and converted to Islam when they married. She started dating Brand last autumn, and for the comedian’s 39th birthday on Wednesday she reportedly gave him a 24-carat diamond necklace spelling out the word ‘revolution’.","Mrs Khan, 40, tweeted about the attempt on her home last night .

"By . James Chapman . An emergency fund to pay for new cancer drugs is to be extended after the NHS’s rationing body failed to clear any medicines sent for approval in the past year. David Cameron will announce the extension of a £200million annual budget that is used to pay for treatments denied to NHS patients by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There are growing calls for fundamental reform of NICE, which is blamed for unfairly blocking drugs it deems poor value for money and taking too long to reach its decisions. David Cameron will announce the extension of a £200million annual budget used to pay for treatments denied to NHS patients by NICE . The Cancer Drugs Fund, which began in April 2011, has led to 34,000 patients in England getting drugs they were refused on the NHS. It was due to expire in March but the Prime Minister will announce a two-year extension during the Conservative Party conference in Manchester next week. A research project to help understand which treatments and drugs will be effective will sequence the DNA code of 3,000 cancer patients. ‘When I became Prime Minister three years ago many patients with rare cancers were being denied lifesaving treatments,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘That is why we created the Cancer Drugs Fund, it is why we are extending it, and it is why we are partnering with Cancer Research UK to conduct new research into the effectiveness of cancer drugs.’ Mother-of-two Nikki Phelps fought an NHS decision to deny her the life-prolonging drug sunitinib . Almost two-thirds of cancer treatments considered by NICE are rejected. This year, of the 11 new cancer medicines put to it, not one has been approved for NHS use. Since 2007 NICE has recommended only 31 per cent of new medicines it reviewed. Medics and drugs firms say the Cancer Drugs Fund was meant as a temporary stop gap, and without a more fundamental shake-up of Nice there will be a return to the days when patients had to ‘beg’ for life-prolonging drugs on the NHS. NICE says it is not worthwhile to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient, and the money would be better spent on other treatments. Critics say UK patients are being denied the most effective drugs even though many are invented in Britain, while NHS doctors miss out on the experience of working with breakthrough treatments. Others say NICE might reject a treatment on the grounds that it extends patients’ lives by an average of only a few weeks even though it helps some live for several years. Those who suffered as a result include mother-of-two Nikki Phelps – who fought an NHS decision to deny her the life-prolonging drug sunitinib. After a campaign backed by the Daily Mail, NHS chiefs finally agreed to supply the £100-a-day drug. But Mrs Phelps, 37, from Gravesend, Kent, who had glandular cancer, died two weeks later. Jonathan Emms, UK managing director of Pfizer, said: ‘NICE is blocking medicines when it should be a beacon for innovation. The Cancer Drugs Fund is a short-term fix which needs to exist because NICE doesn’t work.’ Dr Andrew Protheroe, a cancer consultant at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, welcomed the extension of the Cancer Drugs Fund. ‘There is nothing more frustrating than knowing there is an effective, licensed, evidence-based treatment available which I am not allowed to use,’ he said. Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE’s chief executive, said: ‘NICE guidance on new cancer drugs provides the basis for informed decisions to be taken by clinicians and patients, and by making clear when drugs work well in routine practice, it helps the NHS allocate the money it has available fairly and efficiently. ‘NHS organisations have always been able to consider exceptions to our guidance. The Cancer Drugs Fund provides a national resource to meet the cost of those exceptions. 'NICE cancer drugs guidance helps to make sure that the Fund is used only where exceptions to our recommendations on routine practice really will work in the interests of patients.’ One of the drugs rejected by NICE was the breast cancer treatment Afinitor, also known as everolimus, which costs about £36,000 a time. The watchdog said the drug was not ‘cost effective’ and there was no evidence it was better than treatments already available. But trials have shown it can stop tumours spreading for nearly eight months – twice as long as alternative drugs. Manufacturer Novartis believes up to 14,000 women a year with advanced breast cancer could benefit. In May, NICE rejected Avastin (bevacizumab) for ovarian cancer claiming it was ‘not the best use of taxpayers’ money’. This was despite trials showing that patients given this drug – which costs £25,000 a time – alongside chemotherapy lived 50 per cent longer, surviving just over a year on average. The treatment is now one of the most commonly-applied for from the Cancer Drugs Fund. In March, NICE turned down Inlyta (axitinib) for kidney cancer, even though it helped some patients live an extra three years. The drug – which costs £3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year.","Prime Minister will announce budget for Cancer Drugs Fund will be extended after NHS body failed to clear any new cancer medicines in the past year .

Novice surfers flocking to beauty spot Polzeath in Cornwall are being blasted for being ‘ignorant’ and not following ‘basic surf etiquette’. It comes after father-of-two Steve Pratt suffered a nasty head injury after being hit by a surfboard when a holidaymaker apparently lost control of it while learning the sport. Novice surfers flocking to beauty spot Polzeath in Cornwall are being blasted for being ‘ignorant’ and not following ‘basic surf etiquette’. Residents want first-time surfers to learn the sport before getting in the water . Steve Pratt, 48, was left with a six-inch head wound after being struck by a runaway surfboard at the beach . Mr Pratt, 48, who owns a café at the popular tourist beach, was left with a six-inch wound from the incident and had to have his head glued back together at hospital. He has now hit out at first-time surfers who flock to the region every summer to lap up the Cornish waves. He said: ‘There’s a saying that if you don’t surf in January, don’t try to surf in July. ‘This guy just bailed before getting his wave. I don’t know why - he might have thought the wave was too big. ‘But by just jumping off his board the way he did, he sent it flying straight at me. ‘I had no chance to get out of the way - he was only feet away - and it cracked me right on the top of my head. ‘It was unbelievably painful and when I put my hand up to feel the damage, I could see straight away that I was covered in blood. Mr Pratt, who owns a cafe at Polzeath, believes the board that hit him belonged to an inexperienced surfer . Thousands of tourists flock to Polzeath every year to make the most of the sandy beach and surfing conditions . ‘There’s a basic rule, or code, that every surfer learns - you must try to keep control of your board. If he’d just held on to his board he’d have been OK and so would I. ‘Instead I ended up in A&E having to have my head glued back together. ‘Actually it could have been worse - it might have caught me in the eye, or I could have lost some teeth. ‘Fast-moving surfboards can pack quite a wallop. It’s almost scalped me.’ The beach is popular with the likes of Prime Minister David Cameron, who holidays regularly there with his family, and Prince Harry and William who were both spotted surfing at the seaside resort in 2012. Residents now want visitors to undergo safety training before hitting the waves - to learn the equivalent of surfing’s Highway Code. Mr Pratt said: ‘I’m 99 per cent sure that the guy was a holidaymaker who didn’t know what he was doing. ‘I know all of the locals. This guy didn’t even check to see if I was OK. Polzeath beach is popular with the likes of Prime Minister David Cameron who holidays there regularly . Mr Cameron has previously spoken of his love for the beach and local beer, and often visits with his family . ‘I shouted at him and said “you’ve just whacked me” and put my hand up to show him the blood. I caught the next wave in and was expecting him to follow to at least see how I was but he didn’t. ‘It’s a bit like hitting someone with a car - you have a responsibility to stop and see if the other person is OK. ‘There are lots of ways to injure yourself while surfing but it’s particularly galling when you injure somebody else. ‘It’s more likely to happen when the sea is crowded and, at this time of year, the beach at Polzeath is pretty busy. ‘It’s really important that people get themselves some basic training instead of just picking up the first board they see and rushing into the sea.’ His opinion was echoed by Andy Cameron, who runs a surf school at the sandy beach. He said: ‘It’s very important to learn the correct surfing etiquette. It’s like a Highway Code. ‘Surfing is fantastic fun and nobody wants to take away the fun element, but getting a serious injury is no fun at all. The beach is also popular with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry who were spotted surfing there in 2012 . Prince Harry appeared to be enjoying the waves when he and friends took to their surfboards during a getaway . The beach is a popular tourist spot and many people, including the royals, travel far and wide to visit the resort . ‘This accident wasn’t the first and it won’t be the last. It’s important that people have equipment which is appropriate to their level of skill and experience. ‘There are lots of ways to learn - it can be just with a friend who has got experience, it doesn’t have to be with a surf school like ours. ‘But it’s really not clever to grab hold of a board, rush straight into the ocean and treat it like a playground. That’s just asking for trouble.’ The RNLI, which has lifeguards patrolling the majority of Cornwall’s beaches, said visitors are encouraged to undertake proper training before attempting surfing for the first time. Its website says: ‘To maximise your enjoyment and keep yourself and others safe when riding waves it’s important to understand surf etiquette. ‘If you are unsure, ask a lifeguard to explain.’","First-time surfers being urged to take lessons before going into the water .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Comic Relief, which is hosted by Lenny Henry, pictured, has pledged to avoid investing in the so-called 'booze, bombs and fags' sector . Comic Relief has promised to stop putting money into controversial ‘booze, bombs and fags’ funds after it was shamed over its investment policies. The charity published the results of an internal review by its trustees yesterday – six months after it was accused of making ‘unethical’ investments in alcohol, arms and tobacco companies. It pledged to be ‘more transparent’ with its cash in future and blacklist all funds in those three areas. But it stopped short of a wider ban on  other controversial investments deemed ‘unethical’ to ‘avoid an excessive reduction’ in the choice available. Last year, Comic Relief faced a public  backlash after it was revealed it pumped  millions of pounds of donations from its  Red Nose Day campaign into alcohol, arms  and tobacco giants even as it backed projects to help victims of alcohol abuse, war and smoking-related illnesses. The charity, chaired by BBC Worldwide boss Tim Davie, initially defended the policy on the grounds that ethical-only investments would generate a smaller return but it  eventually agreed to the review. Comic Relief also said it would start selling its shares in tobacco, arms and alcohol companies while the review was carried out. Yesterday, Mr Davie announced that its review panel had carried out ‘an excellent piece of work’ and all its recommendations had been accepted. He added: ‘Public trust is the cornerstone of Comic Relief and we would be nothing without our many supporters to whom we have listened and will keep listening. We now have an investment policy that is firmly in line with the ethos of the charity, at the same time as making sure that the money we raise can go further to change lives both here in the UK and abroad.’ The Daily Mail exposed the scandal of Comic Relief's controversial investments in December 2013 . The review panel headed by John Kingston, chairman of the Association of Charitable Foundations, said the charity should aim  for only a ‘small number of absolute prohibitions’ on its investment blacklist, which will be reviewed every six months. Comic Relief said it would build stronger links between the investment committee and charity trustees to ensure they are ‘aligned’. In 2013, Red Nose Day, which is held every two years, raised more than £100million after an eight-hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, hosted by presenters including Lenny Henry, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. According to Comic Relief’s accounts from 2007 to 2009, it placed millions in ‘blue-chip’ City funds that invested in the controversial companies, including £2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009. It is sitting on a £100million fund donated by the public despite promising in its  broadcasts to hand ‘every pound’ straight to good causes.

Soap star David Easter has spoken of his relief at being cleared of rape allegations as his lawyer accuses the alleged victim of trying to ‘cash in’ after the Jimmy Savile scandal. The 54-year-old actor, who is the former husband of Loose Woman presenter Denise Welch, was accused of carrying out the assault 17 years ago by a woman now in her 40s. He said today: 'I am relieved that this ordeal is now over and that I have been formally cleared. 'These allegations were always unfounded and I am focused now on my career, which has been understandably very difficult to manage over the last few months.' Mr Easter was questioned by police in May as part of Operation Sapphire after the alleged victim spotted him playing Gil Keane in Emmerdale last December. But officers have now said there is not enough evidence to prosecute. Mr Easter’s lawyers now claim that the woman tried to use Operation Yewtree, which was launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, as a way of ‘cashing in’. Lawyer Julian Lee told The Sun: ‘It was a 17-year-old allegation and the woman in question must have seen him on TV thousands of times during those years but she only waited until the Jimmy Savile bandwagon started and tried to cash in on it. ‘Thankfully it didn’t get anywhere – I hope David can get on with his life now.’ His agent, . Mark Deitch, told MailOnline: ‘It is great news. We are, as is David, . enormously relieved that this has been dropped and that no charges were . brought against him. ‘He can now get on with his career.’ Mr . Deitch was unable to confirm whether the actor would be making a return . to Emmerdale after his last contract with the show ended in December. He added: ‘He left before the allegations came to light when his contract was up at the end of last year.’ The actor, who has also appeared in The Bill, Holby City, Doctors and Family Affairs, has always denied the allegations. The actor is pictured above playing Gil Keane in Emmerdale alongside Gaynor Faye as Megan Macey . Mr Easter (left) married actress Denise Welch (right) in 1985, but the pair  divorced three years later . He made his acting debut in the 1979 disco film The Music Machine, before playing Pat Hancock in the soap opera Brookside from 1984 to 1987.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jobless people are being offered a course on how to 'design your own tattoo' - paid for by taxpayers. The free sessions on tattoo art paid for by the Labour-run Welsh Government's anti-poverty programme was yesterday blasted as a 'waste of public money'. The skin ink sessions for the unemployed are described a 'free fun interactive course that will develop your artistic skills to be able to design tattoos for yourself and others'. Scroll down for video . A free course for the unemployed on tattoo design has been attacked as a waste of public money (pictured a tattoo artist at work at the London Tattoo Convention on model Lexy Hell) The six-hour course is being run at a series of venues around Bridgend, South Wales, as part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help people get back to work. But leading Lib-Dem Welsh Assembly member Peter Black hit out at the tattoo courses - and said it shows the job-creation scheme is a flop. He said: 'It is difficult to see how this venture can be justified. 'This important regeneration programme is not delivering what is expected of it and now we see it being reduced to fun tattoo design classes.' The Labour Welsh Government has spent around more than £200million on the Communities First scheme over the last ten years - but did not disclose how much is spent on the tattoo course. Mr Black said: 'Tens of millions of pounds have been spent on Communities First over the last decade or so but what indicators that are available show that in employment, health and education terms this money has had little impact. 'The Government needs to revisit how they are spending this money so as to deliver the results we need in helping deprived communities back to work.' The tattoo sessions are being held for free at community centres in Caerau, Cornelly and Sarn areas of Bridgend later this month. The six-hour course is part of a publicly-funded Communities First scheme to help get people back to work . It is aimed to 'support people to acquire the appropriate skills to become job-ready and gain sustainable employment.' A spokesman for Communities and Tackling Poverty Minister Jeff Cuthbert hit back by dubbing the attack as 'snobbish and grossly misleading'. He said: 'The Work Programme publicises the fact that it has found work for young people in this growing industry - is Mr Black complaining about these jobs?' 'The truth is he has seen one advert about one small project in one Communities First area and run to the press without first making proper enquiries about the facts of the matter.' A spokesman for Bridgend council said: 'The ""Design your own tattoo"" session should not be taken at face value. 'It is carefully structured to help people develop confidence and important skills in areas such as communication, creative thinking and working with others.'","Free course is being offered in Bridgend, South Wales for unemployed .

"By . Sara Malm . A lorry driver has admitted killing two colleagues who were taking part in a charity ride from Land’s End to John O’Groats last summer. Andrew McMenigall, 47, and Toby Wallace, 36, died in the crash on the A30 in Newquay, Cornwall in July last year, only a few dozen miles into their ride to raise money for a colleague who had died of cancer. Robert Palmer, 32, pleaded guilty to causing the deaths of  Mr McMenigall, a father-of-two, and Cambridge graduate Mr Wallace, by dangerous driving. Tragedy: Toby Wallace 36, left, and Andrew McMenigall, 47,  died in a crash on the A30 near Newquay, Cornwall, just 40 miles into their 960-mile long charity bike ride, in July last year . Following Palmer’s plea, the widows of Mr McMenigall and Mr Wallace, released a joint statement speaking of their loss. Claire . Wallace and Anne McMenigall also hit out at UK transport laws, saying . they are too lenient and that it is too difficult to bring the . responsible of road incidents to justice. ‘There . are no words to describe the devastation and loss that we, and both . families, feel following the deaths of our husbands, they were . exceptional and giant men in every sense of the word,’ Mrs Wallace and Mrs McMenigall said. ‘It . is a tragedy that so many other families are also mourning loved ones . who have been killed on Britain’s roads, particularly when many of these . deaths were completely avoidable. ‘So . many of these families do not ever see this charge brought against the . person who has killed their husband, their child, their brother, their . father.' Heartbreaking: Lorry driver Robert Palmer, 32, has admitted causing the deaths of Mr McMenigall, a father-of-two, and Cambridge graduate Mr Wallace . ‘UK transport laws . are lenient, charges are difficult and onerous to attain and less and . less resource is being dedicated to road traffic collisions. ‘We would like to thank everyone who has supported us and been involved in getting us this far. ‘Toby . and Andrew loved cycling, we believe that the rise in the popularity of . the sport must be met by those with the responsibility to improve our . transport infrastructure and improve education for drivers. ‘ . Mr . McMenigall lived in Edinburgh with Anne and their two children, . Jennifer, aged 15, and 12-year-old Lucy. He was a keen triathlete and . had previously served as an officer in the Army before joining Aberdeen Asset Management (AAM). Mr . Wallace lived in Philadelphia with his wife, where he worked for AAM. He was born in the UK, went to school in Southampton and studied at . Cambridge University before working in London, Sydney and the US. Mr Wallace was part of an eight-man team who rowed across the Atlantic last year to raise money for charity. Their . bike ride was to raise money for the Kirsten Scott Memorial Trust, . named after a 25-year-old colleague who died from cancer in 2011. Mr . McMenigall was also raising money for It’s Good 2 Give, an . Edinburgh-based charity that offers support to people with cancer and . their families. One of his daughters had been diagnosed with and . recovered from a brain tumour. Heartbreaking: On Tuesday, the widows of the two cyclists released a statement saying there are 'no words to describe the devastation and loss that we, and both families, feel following the deaths of our husbands' The pair were 40 miles into the 960-mile bike ride to raise money for two charities when they were struck by Palmer’s lorry. Palmer, . of Bude, Cornwall also pleaded guilty during a hearing at Truro Crown . Court to a further count of dangerous driving in relation to another . crash in September on the A30 near Okehampton. Palmer was released on conditional bail for the preparation of reports. He will be sentenced on September 1. In . a statement released at the time of their deaths, the families of Mr . McMenigall and Mr Wallace thanked members of the public who donated to . the charities following the deaths. ‘Members of the public were there when the accident happened and did everything they could to help,’ they said. ‘The . emergency services were on the scene within minutes and did a valiant . job. It must have been tremendously upsetting for the witnesses and the . emergency services, and we want to thank them for everything they did. ‘We . have been touched by the generosity of people from around the world; . people who had never met Andrew or Toby but have been making donations . in their memory. Their kindness has been truly overwhelming. ‘We’d . also like to thank the Pro-Am players from the Aberdeen Asset . Management Scottish Open who donated their prize money, and the European . Tour who matched the funds.’ The pair were hoping to raise £10,000 for the two charities. Donations have now exceeded that more than five-fold.","Andrew McMenigall, 47, and Toby Wallace, 36, died in Newquay last year .

"By . Mark Prigg . They are already a common sight in San Francisco, but cars adorned with pink moustaches are set to be seen across Brooklyn and Queens, it has been revealed. Car sharing service Lyft, Uber's arch rival, revealed today it will launch in New York on Friday for the first time. The firm is known for its more relaxed attitude - drivers fist bump passengers when they get in the car, and there are even 'special' Lyft driver who have mirror balls and other customised themes for their cars. Scroll down for video . Car sharing service Lyft, with cars adorned with pink moustaches are set to be seen across Brooklyn and Queens from Friday. Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations. The app matches them with the nearest driver. Drivers attach fluffy pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers. Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers. Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student & MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer . Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. 'This week, we take a historic step forward in bringing community-powered transportation to all corners of the country, the firm said on its blog. 'After months of receiving unprecedented support from tens of thousands of residents, Lyft will launch in New York City on Friday at 7pm local time, with the outer boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens as our first communities.' The firm said it chose the areas because of their lack of public transport. 'Brooklyn and Queens are vastly underserved by public transit options compared to the rest of New York City. 'In fact, just one of New York’s 23 subway lines passes solely between boroughs, and 95% of taxi pickups happen in Manhattan or a local airport. 'The people of New York deserve more transportation options. Lyft provides greater access to a safe, affordable personal transit alternative that is built for New Yorkers, by New Yorkers.' Fans of the firm even began an online petition to persude it to open in New York. The company, which is in more than 60 American cities, plans to have more than 500 Lyft drivers available when the service starts in New York, the firm said. The Lyft allows allows people to hail their nearest car, and see information about the driver. Once the ride is complete, the passenger pays automatically uses a credit card held on file. A Change.org petition launched by several outer borough residents has already garnered thousands of signatures, and more than 75,000 people have already opened the app to get a ride in New York City, the firm said. 'Now, residents and visitors looking to travel in between boroughs, get a ride to the closest subway station, or head out for a night on the town can easily request a safe and friendly ride. 'Not only does Lyft cost less than a cab, it also allows passengers to meaningfully connect with someone in their community as they share the ride.' Lyft cars are already a common sight in San Francisco . The firm said it has already signed up New York drivers and hoped to have 500 in place for Friday.

It also stressed it has a strict screening process for drivers. 'As always, safety is our top priority and every driver has undergone a screening process that is more stringent than what’s required for NYC taxis, including a strict background check, vehicle inspection and $1,000,000 insurance that provides more than three times the $300,000 minimum for taxis.'","Firm allows anyone to sign up to become a driver .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Reuters Reporter . A white suburban Detroit homeowner who shot dead a black 19-year-old girl on his front porch admitted to purposefully opening fire on her out of fear, but insisted that he was not aiming at her. Theodore Wafer, 55, is accused of shooting Renisha McBride in the face through a screen door in Dearborn Heights when she came looking for help after an early morning accident last November. Taking the stand in his racially charged second-degree murder trial, Wafer said he ‘shot in fear’ when he saw a figure coming to his door. When asked by a prosecutor if he had shot 'on purpose,' he said, ‘Yes,’ but added he did not take aim. Courtroom confession: Theodor Wafer, pictured on the stand Monday, testified Tuesday that he fired his gun at Renisha McBride, 19, on purpose because he was afraid . Shooter's claim: Wafer told the court he was not aiming at the drunken teenager, pictured on a program printed November 2013 for her funeral . He also testified under cross-examination that he regretted not finding his phone and calling police before using his firearm – shotgun he purchased in 2008 to protect his property amid rising crime rates. Wafer wept during his testimony Monday, saying he regretted killing the unarmed McBride but that the violent knocking on his front and side doors made him think someone was trying to break into his house. The airport maintenance worker faces up to life in prison, if convicted. Mr Wafer has testified that he couldn't find his cell phone to call 911, and went to the door with his shotgun. He had told police the shooting was an accident, and testified that he pulled the trigger as a ‘reflex reaction.’ Prosecutors have called Wafer's actions unjustified and unreasonable. ‘Shoot first and ask questions later, right?’ Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Athina Siringas asked Wafer. Wafer responded, ‘It was a threat that was coming into my house.’ Grim image: Retired state Trooper David Balash holds a photo of Renisha McBride's leg on Wafer's porch during the seventh day of testimony Monday . During aggressive cross examination, Siringas questioned Wafer’s assertion that he was scared for his life – something he had failed to mention to police until they asked him about it. ‘I had a lot of emotions, fear, panicking,’ Wafer said. ‘I guess in front of a cop I didn't want to come across as less of a man.’ Siringas later asked Wafer if his first reaction to seeing a young African-American female was to shoot but his defense attorney objected before he could respond. The killing of McBride has sparked protests in Dearborn Heights and comparisons to the 2012 Florida shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was also unarmed. Gerald Thurswell, the McBride family lawyer, said before court Tuesday he believed Wafer was trying to sway opinion on the mostly white jury by talking about how ‘renters’ had been replacing owners in his historically white neighborhood. Private property: Wafer tearfully told the jury Monday that the violent knocking on his front and side doors made him think someone was trying to break into his Dearborn Heights home . Thurswell told reporters that he believed ‘renters’ was a code word for racial minorities. McBride had been in a car accident after drinking and smoking pot when she came to Wafer's door, according to previous testimony. Wafer was the last trial witness, and closing arguments are scheduled for Wednesday.","Theodore Wafer told the court Tuesday he intended to shoot Renisha McBride, 19, on his porch last November .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are helping reduce drunk driving arrests in some American cities, according to new data. Analysis reveals an average 10 percent decrease in DUI arrests in Philadelphia, Seattle and San Francisco after the car sharing apps were introduced. Observers say other factors may also be contributing to the decline, but add that people are less likely to drive home drunk if they have more transport options. Data: Chief technology officer Nate Good analyzed Philadelphia crime data and found DUI arrests declined about 11 percent after various car services were launched . Blogger Nate Good, a chief technology officer of a Pittsburgh event ticketing company, analyzed data from Philadelphia's Uniform Crime . Reporting system. He found the average number of DUIs per month . in Philadelphia decreased by 11 percent between April and December, . 2013. The number of DUIs among drivers under the age of 30 saw an even . higher decrease of 18.5 percent, according to his blog post. Good, a self-described 'proponent of ride sharing services', noted that the decrease in DUIs coincided with the launch of Uber Black, Side Car and Uber X. However he added as a disclaimer: 'As the famous adage goes, correlation does not equate to causation. There can always be other things in play here that are affecting these DUI trends.' Analysis: In May, Uber said it estimated the entrance of the car service in Seattle caused the number of DUI arrests to decrease by more than 10% . Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett backed the findings, saying a reduction in drunk driving in American cities is an unintended but welcome benefit of the company's services. 'Uber started really just to connect riders and drivers. A byproduct of that, as we've seen, are these incredible social and economic impacts that we're seeing in different cities,' he told NBC Philadelphia. 'It's a very seamless and convenient way to get transportation on demand. You don't have to go stand on a corner at two in the morning waiting for a taxi and fumbling around for cash.' Uber released its own analysis of local crime data in May showing a 10 percent reduction in DUI rates since Uber entered the Seattle market. 'While there is plenty of room to explore this topic in future studies,' Uber wrote online, 'the data confirms the intuitive claim, backed up by countless anecdotes, that potential drunk drivers will choose other options, like rides with Uber, when they are convenient, affordable, and readily available.' Correlation: Analysts say the introduction of ride-share services such as Uber and Side Car in some American cities has helped reduce DUI arrests . Earlier this month, Washington Post journalists reported a similar decline in DUI arrests in San Francisco in 2013, using figures from the San Francisco Police Department . They noted Uber Black launched in June 2010, before various other ride-share services started up in 2012. In September 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission introduced regulations which legally recognized these services. 'As a company - this might sound pollyanish -  we talk about our service not being aimed at providing transportation, but at lowering crime rates in a city like Chicago,' Lyft spokesman David Estrada told Washington Post. Meanwhile, momentum is growing around the country for the legalization of ride-car sharing services, including in Texas. A group in Austin has started a petition calling for the introduction of Uber to provide more transportation options. The group also has a Facebook page called 'Stop Drunk Driving in Austin; Bring Uber/Lyft to the City'.","Data shows declines in DUI arrests in some American cities where Uber, Side Car and Lyft operate .

"By . Reuters Reporter . The Mormon church has sued a Canadian polygamist for using its trademarked name, saying its reputation was damaged and that donations intended for the denomination were misdirected, a lawsuit filed in a Canadian court said. Attorneys for the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints argued in the suit that Winston Blackmore copied its name by registering his religious polygamist community under the moniker Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Inc. The church uncovered the similarities in January, when it tried to register with the Canadian government and was blocked. Court papers filed on Wednesday in the British Columbia Supreme Court said Blackmore had refused to voluntarily make a change, in an attempt to trade on the church's reputation. Copy cat: Winston Blackmore, ousted leader of the Canadian arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is being sued for allegedly registering his own polygamist community in Creston, British Columbia (pictured) under the same name as the church . No hearings are set in the case and an effort to reach Blackmore on Saturday was unsuccessful. '(Adopting the name) is yet another attempt of the Blackmore Sect to convey a false impression of affiliation with the Church,' court documents said. Blackmore is head of a religious community in Bountiful, British Columbia, which has traditionally practiced polygamy. Once known as the 'Bishop of Bountiful', Blackmore was formerly the head of the Canadian arm of the Warren Jeffs-led Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He was ousted a decade ago, and hundreds of Jeffs’ Canadian followers left with him. With some 15 million members worldwide, the mainstream Mormon church rejects any association with fundamentalists and polygamy, a practice it abandoned in the 1890s. In court papers, church attorneys said Blackmore’s use of a similar name caused public confusion and damaged its reputation of supporting religious worship, assisting families and providing humanitarian aid. Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The church is now suing a former affiliate for allegedly taking their name for his own polygamist community . Winston Blackmore was formerly the head of the Canadian arm of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, lead by Warren Jeffs (pictured in  2011 Texas Department of Criminal Justice photo). Jeffs was sentenced to life in prison for child sexual assault for intercourse with a 15-year-old as well as aggravated sexual assault for intercourse with a 12-year-old . Blackmore’s registration also resulted in the diversion of charitable donations meant for the Mormon church, court papers said. Church attorneys said Blackmore’s group was formed to further polygamy and had arranged for the underage marriages of young girls - acts renounced by the Mormon church. Documents obtained by Reuters from the Canadian Registry of Services showed Blackmore twice registered corporation names in 2010 that included the word 'fundamentalist'. The current name, which was registered in late 2013, dropped the word. Meanwhile, last week a Utah judge said that hundreds of people living in Warren Jeffs' sect on the Utah-Arizona border who have collectively failed to pay millions in occupancy fees for their houses should be evicted. State Judge Denise Lindberg said far too many have been ignoring the $100-a-month, per-house fee for too long and that 'enough is enough'. She suggested starting with a few homes, giving families notice that they must pay up or pack up. 'We have had a free rider problem here for a long time,' Lindberg said. 'There needs to be action, or otherwise the law means nothing.'","Winston Blackmore is the head of a religious polygamist community in British Columbia, Canada .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Measles cases have hit a 20-year high in the United States, a troubling increase fueled by international travel by people who have not been vaccinated against the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have revealed. Between January 1 and May 23 of this year, 288 measles cases were reported to the federal health agency, the highest year-to-date total since 1994, officials said. 'This is not the kind of record we want to break, but should be a wake-up call to travelers and parents to make sure vaccinations are up to date,' said Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases. Scroll down for video . Record: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have revealed that measles cases have reached a 20-year high in the US, even though the virus was eliminated in 2000 . Call for vaccinations: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that cases of measles in the first four months of this year are the most any year since 1996, as they warned clinicians, parents and others to watch for the potentially deadly virus . Home-grown measles in the United States was declared eliminated in 2000, but cases imported from patients traveling abroad continue to infect unvaccinated U.S. residents with the highly contagious respiratory disease, according to the CDC. A large outbreak in the Philippines was connected to 138 cases this year involving Amish communities in Ohio, health officials said. In all, 18 states have reported measles cases this year. Measles has caused 43 patients to be hospitalized in 2014 but no deaths, Schuchat said. Unvaccinated residents in the United States provide a 'welcome wagon' for measles imported from abroad, Schuchat said, noting the virus is still common in many parts of the world including Europe, Asia and Africa. The Philippines has reported more than 32,000 measles cases and 41 deaths from January to April 20, she said. Eighty-five percent of the unvaccinated U.S. residents (195 residents) who contracted measles cited religious, philosophical or personal reasons for not getting immunized, the CDC said (see the chart below). This chart shows the reasons why the 195 unvaccinated US residents who contracted measles this year didn't get immunized . Reasons for no vaccination: The CDC says 195 US residents infected with measles this year were unvaccinated, with 85 percent of them choosing not to get vaccinated because of their religious and philosophical beliefs . Source: Most of the US measles cases this year originated in the Western Pacific and the Philippines, according to official data . 'It was not because they were too young or had medical reasons like leukemia,' Schuchat said. 'These outbreaks illustrate that clusters of people with like-minded beliefs who forgo vaccines can be susceptible to outbreaks when the virus in imported.' The CDC recommends that, starting at age 12 months, infants receive two doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Infants aged 6 through 11 months old should receive one dose of MMR vaccine before international travel. The health agency also recommends vaccination for adults who were not immunized as children or are unsure of their immunization history. Protection: Medical experts recommend that, starting at age 12 months, infants receive two doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine .","The disease was eliminated in the US in 2000, but travelers are spreading it .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Federal securities regulators are probing whether New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's administration improperly diverted funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for use on transport projects in New Jersey. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into New Jersey's use of up to $1.8 billion in tax-exempt bond financing from the Port Authority to fix a bridge and roadways feeding into the New Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel, Main Justice reports. The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election. Scroll down for video . Federal securities regulators are probing whether New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's administration improperly diverted funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for use on transport projects in New Jersey. Christie is pictured on Monday announcing the development of a megamall in East Rutherford . The controversy has prompted scrutiny of nearly every aspect of the Christie administration and his Port Authority appointees. The Manhattan District Attorney's office is looking into the use of Port Authority funds by New Jersey. Federal investigators and a New Jersey special legislative committee are also probing the bridge incident. About $3 billion of Port Authority funds were originally earmarked for an $8.7 billion project that would have built a new commuter train under the Hudson River. Though construction had already begun, Christie killed the project in 2010 after taking office.But New Jersey is using some of those funds to rebuild the Pulaski Skyway and roadways leading to the Holland Tunnel. The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election . Under its 1921 charter, however, the bi-state Port Authority's purview includes access roads to the Lincoln Tunnel, but not to the Holland Tunnel. So the Christie administration allegedly pressured the Port Authority in 2011 to re-brand the Pulaski Skyway as feeding the Lincoln Tunnel. A Port Authority spokesman declined to comment to Reuters.

Oh, and they've helped whip the likes of Elle Macpherson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Hugh Grant and Lara Stone into shape too. But what do James and Christiane, who have been dubbed the 'world's most annoyingly healthy couple', eat themselves on a day-to-day basis? What does it take to look this good? James Duigan and his model wife Christiane have established the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire, but what do they eat themselves? The power couple have revealed all . The power couple, whose diet plan recommends fresh food as close to . its natural state as possible, no refined sugar - described by James as a 'toxic fat . bomb' for your waistline - and no alcohol, have shared their weekly food diary with online beauty and health magazine Get The Gloss... and it's just as infuriatingly healthy as you'd imagine. Speaking about how he starts the day, committed James said: 'My breakfast is the same every morning - a Body Brilliance and Ultimate Clean shake with rice milk or a green juice with a shot of ginger. 'When I’m in London I'll have eggs, tomato and avocado and an americano from Granger & Co in Notting Hill.' Proving that even Mr Clean & Lean has a treat every so often, he adds: 'I’ll add a chipolata in there if I’m feeling hungry.'

For lunch on the move, James has grilled salmon with fresh asparagus or lamb chops and spring vegetables. If he's at home with Chrissy, they whip up a Clean and Lean lettuce wrap with chicken tomato and hummus or go to Osteria Basilica in Notting Hill for seabass and vegetables - see, even eating out can be virtuous. Model food: Dinner for the duo is one of Rosie Huntington Whiteley's dishes - a roast chicken with brown rice and avocado, left, and the pair love creating healthy salads packed with avocado and kale . James describes dinners as 'a nice mix of dining out and staying in'. He said: 'Chrissy's magical lamb pot roast on Sunday night was amazing - lamb and vegetables slow roasted with veg for six hours. 'On Monday, we'll have Rosie Huntington Whitley’s recipe - roast chicken with brown rice and avocado and on Tuesday we'll go for sushi and treat ourselves to Chilean seabass and Japanese herb and avocado salad.' James describes Wednesday night as 'party night' saying he and Chrissy 'cuddle up on the couch to watch a cheesy movie and for a treat we’ll have the amazing fish curry from Granger & Co as a takeaway'.

For sale: Gold Coast's only five star beachfront resort developed by the late Australian businessman Christopher Skase for $170 million dollars, located just five minutes from Surfers Paradise and Sea World. The Australian owners have listed the iconic Sheraton Mirage Resort & Spa Gold Coast on the market globally after receiving several unsolicited off-market approaches. Pearl Australasia's executive director David Higgins told Daily Mail Australia that the company had significant international and local buyer interests in the property. For sale: Gold Coast's only five star beachfront resort for $170 million dollars, located just five minutes from Surfers Paradise and Sea World . 'We've had a lot of interests recently and the hotel market has been internationally strong in the last 20 years so we thought it would be a good time to put the unique property on the market,' Mr Higgins said. 'The board took the strategic decision to publicly offer the property for sale in order to focus resources on the group’s Australian market-leading major diversified property business and the innovative MiiHome business that manufactures and delivers advanced permanent and re-locatable buildings globally. 'We have over 850 apartments at the moment and once the resort is sold, we're looking at using the money to develop more apartments in Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sydney.' The five-star property have positioned as the leading resort hotel in Queensland and number one resort on the Gold Coast . The late Christopher Skase-developed resort was built on Four Mile Beach in 1987 . The landmark property is situated far north Queensland tourist town, on five hectares of absolute beach frontage . The late Christopher Skase-developed resort was built on Four Mile Beach in 1987 for $100 million dollars but was brought from receivers to Raptis Group companies by Pearl Australasia for $62.5 million in 2009. Director Higgins said the resort was only rated four-star when the company took over after Skase went bust in 1989. 'After the poor reputation, we have done everything we can to tick all the boxes, including great customer service, best location as well as a great tourism attraction,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Since the $26 million dollars refurbishment of all 296 rooms and public places, including the Sheraton's singature lagoons and tropical gardens, bars, restaurants and pool, the five-star property have positioned as the leading resort hotel in Queensland and number one resort on the Gold Coast.

The company have appointed McVay Real Estate Australia and Knight Frank Gold Coast in a joint agency agreement.

'The Australian hotel investment market has experienced unprecedented levels of activity over recent years and this is set to continue with a record $2.5b in transactions expected this year,' Mr McVay said. 'We continue to experience very strong levels of interest from not only Asian investors, but an increase in appetite from Middle East and American groups looking to enter the market at a time when fundamentals are very positive.'

"By . Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia . A Chinese company intends to build a new 'Chinese Disneyland' theme park in Australia, which they claim will draw tourists from around the world when it opens in 2016. New plans have been unveiled for the development of a $500 million Chinese-inspired theme park called Chappypie China Time in Warnervale, just over an hour's drive north of Sydney. Despite it's strange name, locals are tipping it will be a tourist attraction to rival Opera House and Harbour Bridge once it's finished. Scroll down for video . The Chinese theme park at Central Coast NSW is expected to be a major national tourist attraction . The sprawling, 15-hectare theme park will feature everything from giant rollercoasters and other Chinese themed rides, to Chinese calligraphy classes, traditional theatre and music performances. The entire site will be landscaped with Chinese gardens and statues and feature Australia's links with China, as well as a flying golden dragon winding its way through the park. The proposed theme park will feature 12 main sections - which includes the Meridian Gate, thanksgiving Temple, Zheng He’s Treasure Ship, arts and crafts workshop, Spring Festival Square and Panda Paradise. The sprawling, 15-hectare theme park will feature everything from giant rollercoasters and other Chinese themed rides to Chinese history . The owners of the proposed Chinese Cultural Theme Park have developed extensive plans for the theme park, which will be located next to Warnervale Airport, the Central Coast Express Advocate reports. Wyong Shire mayor Doug Eaton told ABC the park will cater for the growing Chinese tourism market and provide a massive boost to the coast's economy. 'It'll be the major tourism drawcard, I'd suggest, not just for the Central Coast, but everywhere outside of Sydney. 'It'll rank in the top five at least, if not in the top three destinations in New South Wales.' What the theme park at night is expected to look like . Wyong Mayor Doug Eaton said the park would be a major boost for the local economy . Mayor Eaton said he was incredibly excited about the prospect of half a billion dollars of investment heading his way, according to the Central Coast Express Advocate. The development application for stage one of the park could be open as soon as 2016 if the proposal gets approved. 'I’ve truly never seen anything like this before — it’s going to blow people away when they watch the video and get a sense of how big and imaginative this concept really is and what it can do in terms of tourism for our shire,' Mr Eaton said. 'The developers have long been telling us that this theme park will be up there with the Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge in terms of tourist attractions and I’ve got to hand it to them — it’s absolutely in that category.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two rogue Afghan policemen brazenly posed for pictures with British soldiers minutes before shooting them dead, an inquest heard today. Corporal Brent McCarthy, 25, and Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 27, were killed at an Afghan police base in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province, on May 12 last year. The soldiers killed in the attack had been part of an eight-man British Army patrol, with an interpreter, advising and training local forces. Turncoats: The two rogue Afghan policemen . suspected of shooting dead British soldiers Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 1st . Battalion Welsh Guards, and Corporal Brent McCarthy, an RAF policeman, in . Afghanistan last year . The patrol had gone to the base so British officers could meet local police officials, with Cpl McCarthy - an RAF policeman - acting as a specialist adviser. However, a short while after the patrol arrived, there was a burst of gunfire which left both servicemen, including L/Cpl Davies, of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, fatally injured. The two suspected killers, dressed in police uniforms, were seen dashing out the base’s main gate and across fields by another British soldier who managed to get a shot off at one of them. The inquest at Oxfordshire Coroners Court was shown several photographs including one of Cpl McCarthy, of the Royal Air Force, with one of the policemen - each holding the other's weapon. Another showed both Afghans posing for the camera with their own AK47 rifles. Betrayed: Cpl McCarthy, left, 25, and L/Cpl Davies, 27, were left fatally injured after a burst of gunfire . Guardsman Joshua Foley, of the Welsh Guards, told the inquest that the training group had 'a good relationship' with the Afghans. But a some point a new local police unit had moved into the base and when the British patrol had arrived that afternoon there were several unfamiliar faces among the Afghan units, he said. He said he and his comrades had been trained to pick up on warning signs - 'atmospherics' - that might suggest a possible betrayal by Afghan security forces. Such attacks are known in the Army as a green on blue incident. However, asked by the coroner for Oxfordshire, Darren Salter, if he was aware of any heightened risk before the patrol set out that day he said he was not, adding 'the atmospherics were fine'. As he was stood with L/Cpl Davies and Cpl McCarthy, two Afghan policemen passed them near the main entrance to the base and there was an attempt by the British soldiers to strike up some 'banter'. 'We tried to have a laugh with them but they didn’t seem to get it,' Guardsman Foley told the coroner. However, Cpl McCarthy then produced a camera and the Afghans agreed to have some photos taken, including with Cpl McCarthy and Guardsman Foley. Cpl McCarthy, who was just 25 years old, was injured in the attack and pronounced dead after evacuation . Guardsman Foley then described how L/Cpl Davies said to his fellow soldiers that one of the Afghans appeared to have a wet patch between his legs. 'He said ""look, he’s pissed himself, he’s scared of you"",' said Guardsman Foley. Asked by the coroner if he thought either of the Afghans heard the comment, Guardsman Foley said he did not believe they had and pointed out they seemed to understand very little, if any, English. He then left L/Cpl Davies and Cpl McCarthy with the policemen to take up duty in one of the base’s two guard towers. 'I heard a rapid burst of shots, and as I looked I saw the two Afghan police holding their weapons and L/Cpl Davies was lying back,' said Guardsman Foley. 'I did not see the Afghan police fire any shots but they both ran out of the main entrance.' Mr Salter asked: 'You saw the two before and then immediately after the shots, were you able to see if it was the same two?' Guardsman Foley replied: 'Yes, it was them.' The two soldiers, who were injured, were quickly evacuated. Both men were pronounced dead later.",Soldiers killed were part of British patrol advising and training local forces .

The country music legend known as as the rhinestone cowboy Glen Campbell was honored recently as his children performed following a screening of an upcoming documentary about his farewell tour. The 78-year-old star bravely performed his final 100-plus shows after receiving a devastating Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2011. The documentary, called Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me, reveals the performer--who is now in full-time care--was miraculously able to play guitar and sing perfectly despite his illness, though he at times appeared confused on-stage. Campbell's Alzheimer's disease has . progressed to the point where he needs full-time professional care, his . wife said in June, explaining her decision to place the singer in a . long-term care facility and responding publicly for the first time to . criticism from Campbell's eldest daughter. The news madeCampbell's final tour and the brave face he keeps in the James Keach-directed documentary all the more remarkable. In . an email to The Associated Press, Kim Campbell wrote that doctors . persuaded her earlier this spring to discontinue care at the family's . home, drawing criticism from Campbell's daughter Debby. Scroll down for video . Glen Campbell is shown here in 2012 with wife Kim and daughter Ashley. Ashley and her brother Shannon performed at a recent Boston screening of her father's documentary Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me . Family man: Glen Campbell has eight children, including three with Kim Campbell, his wife of 32 years (pictured in 1975) 'It is crushingly sad to see him afflicted with Alzheimer's but indulging those feelings does not help him,' Campbell wrote, adding, 'I am his wife and no one wants him home more than me but I must do what is in his best interest.' Meanwhile, at the recent screening, the Campbell family including daughter Ashley and son Shannon--who performed for the likes of Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey--put on their own brave faces during the screening and after party, according to the Boston Globe. Debby Campbell told Country Weekly magazine last week that she objected to the move and that she and Campbell's eldest children heard about it through news media reports. She also said she did not believe family members in Nashville, where the Country Music Hall of Fame member now lives, were spending enough time with him. Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2011. He issued two albums and went on a world tour following the diagnosis. At the time, Kim Campbell said the tour was a way to help her husband combat the brain-ravaging disease and spend time with his family members, including Debby, who made up his band and traveled with him. Glen Campbell has eight children, including three with Kim Campbell, his wife of 32 years. She says she spends time with her husband every day and that two of his children who live in Nashville visit weekly. Beyond that, she says she organizes activities for the Grammy Award-winning singer of such hits as 'Rhinestone Cowboy' and 'Wichita Lineman.' 'He has longtime friends here in Nashville who come to play music for him and give him hugs,' Kim Campbell said. 'He has activities and therapies to stimulate him and help him experience daily moments of success. His life is filled with love and laughter and he is being cared for round the clock by people who specialize in Alzheimer's care and happen to adore him.'

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . A restaurant owner has caused outrage by telling customers they can no longer share meals when in large groups and demanded they order individual dishes and drinks. Martin Duncan, owner of Freestyle Tout, which boasts the 'best desserts in Brisbane, took to Facebook on Monday to inform patrons of the rules during peak business times - but his post sparked anger among some regulars. 'We would really really appreciate each individual guest purchasing a meal or dessert and a beverage,' he wrote. Freestyle Tout owner Martin Duncan has caused controversy by demanding all customers order something when they visit his cafe . 'We would like to reserve table space for paying customers. 'Sorry to put it plainly but large groups not eating or drinking does not pay our rent or the wages of our fabulous staff. If you must share please purchase a drink.' But some diners were not happy with being told what to do and said the business would lose customers if they weren't more welcoming. One diner responded: 'Don't tell me what to do Freestyle? I will purchase what I want! What an absolute joke! This guy is going to lose all his business'. 'I always share a dessert when I go places simply because I can't eat that much food. I don't think it's healthy or fair to force people to eat when they are not hungry. It's such a waste of money for me to eat a meal and send half of it back when I go out, so my partner and I usually share,' another patron wrote. Others were more supportive of the new move. 'It is a reasonable request, I am with the owners,' one person said. The Brisbane restaurant is urging diners to order their own food and beverages instead of sharing meals . Following the reaction, Mr Duncan said his message may have been a 'little misconstrued'. 'To help set the record straight there are no ""rules"" regarding dining at Freestyle Tout,' he wrote in a latter post. 'There is no issue with people sharing meals, after all, the sharing of food is one of life's great joys.' But Mr Duncan continued to explain the reasoning behind his original plea. 'The issue I am speaking out about is when large groups of say, 10 or 20 people share for instance, 2 meals/desserts, or share 4 coffees or even worse, try bringing in their own food from home, especially when there are customers waiting for a seat,' he wrote. 'This is an issue not just limited to our business, many of my fellow restaurateurs have shared similar stories with me. 'Many people are watching their pennies in this economy and this is understandable. Our meals start at $8.90 and that's why we try and make dining out an affordable experience for all.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . There is a glimmer of hope for casino workers in Atlantic City, New Jersey, who risk losing their jobs when two - maybe three - of the city's most well-known casinos close their doors later this year - according to the city's mayor, at least one of those casinos has several potential buyers. However, workers at one of those casinos took to the streets Thursday to protest the planned August closing of the Showboat Casino. Chanting 'Keep Showboat open,' hundreds of casino workers and supporters staged a noisy, enthusiastic protest Thursday night on the Atlantic City Boardwalk aimed at getting the owners of the Showboat Casino Hotel to reverse their decision to close it next month. Showboat: Protesters gathered on the Atlantic City boardwalk to protest the planned closing of the Showboat Casino . Trend: Showboat is just one of three casinos that could close in the coming months . Economy: The Atlantic City economy relies almost exclusively on the casino industry, which has taken a serious hit in recent years . More than 400 protesters marched from a small park near the Boardwalk to Caesars Atlantic City, where a small group met with a labor attorney for the parent company that owns both casinos. The attorney promised to meet with union officials Aug. 7, but could not answer their immediate questions, said Donna DeCaprio, secretary-treasurer of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE casino union, which organized the protest. 'We’re going to keep fighting this,' she said. The still-profitable Showboat is one of three Atlantic City casinos that could shut down by September. Trump Plaza plans a Sept. 16 closure, and Revel could also close if a buyer is not found in a bankruptcy auction next month. That could put 8,000 workers on the streets within a few weeks. Atlantic City started the year with 12 casinos, but could end the summer with eight. The Atlantic Club shut down in January. Trump: Dawn French, a cocktail server at Trump Plaza, speaks to protesters during Thursday's protest . 'It’s a tragedy, what’s happening here,' said Curtis Wade, a cook at the Showboat for 27 years. 'We’re a profitable casino; there’s no reason to shut us down.' Speaking to Caesars Entertainment, the casino’s parent company that announced the Showboat closure to reduce competition in the saturated Atlantic City market, Wade said he felt betrayed. 'You said we were like a family, and if we worked hard, we would all prosper,' he said. 'Now you’re turning your back on us. After 27 years, now you say you don’t need me.' Wade and others said they believe other companies are interested in buying the Showboat; Caesars said recently it would consider selling it instead of closing it if a good offer materialized. 'Showboat is a good, viable property,' said Eve Davis, a cocktail server there. 'If Caesars doesn’t want it, fine. Sell it. We just need someone to come in here and love it.' Caesars Entertainment issued a statement saying it has no new information on the status of the Showboat, adding it plans to meet with workers next month to share any updates by then. Iconic: Showboat is one of the most well-known casinos in Atlantic City since it opened in 1987 . Trumped: Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino is scheduled to close later this year as Atlantic City's economy continues to crumble . Buyers: Atlantic City's mayor says there currently are six potential buyers for the troubled Revel hotel and casino . The protesters chanted loudly, blew whistles and beat drums at the entrance of Caesars, where a half-dozen security guards milled about at the front entrance. Many protesters carried hand-made signs excoriating Caesars Entertainment; several included unflattering photos of company CEO Gary Loveman. One read: 'Mr. Loveman: Please let Me Keep My Job.' Others said: 'Atlantic City: Broken Promises.' Bob McDevitt, the union president, said he was pleased at the political and public support for keeping the Showboat open so far. 'I have no doubt that if they continue the pressure and community support that Caesars will have no choice but to do the right thing,' he said.","Three casinos in Atlantic City could close in the coming months .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A large New Jersey shore family that suffered losses during Superstorm Sandy will share a $20 million lottery jackpot that one of the 17 siblings said would be 'a great pick-me-up.' Members of the Endreson family packed the Beachwood Community Center Thursday afternoon for a news conference. A lottery spokeswoman said the siblings range in age from 53 to 76. The New Jersey Pick-6 prize will also be shared with three children of a brother who died a few years ago. Scroll down for video . Family: There are 18 siblings in the Enderson family, and they will all share their sister's $20 million lottery winnings . Tradition: The Endersons' mother started playing the lottery years ago, and the family has kept the tradition alive . Sixty-nine-year-old John Endreson became emotional when he described rebuilding his home after Sandy ripped through the shore area in late October 2012. 'The hardest part was seeing other people that were devastated,' he said. 'I was able to redo my house and help my family and my brothers. I was quite fortunate. I just feel so lucky. And this is just the icing on the cake.' Another sibling described how their late mother started playing the lottery regularly years ago and would always say that all her children would get a piece of the winnings. Faith Schiabor told how she got the news from one of her sisters who had bought the winning ticket. Taxes: After taxes, the family will share about $10 million between the 18 of them and the children of a brother who died several years ago . Sister of the year: Sigrid Endreson is the family member who picked the winning ticket and then decided to share it with her family . 'I got this frantic phone call,' she said. 'She said, 'Are you sitting down?' I thought someone was hurt.' Her sister Sigrid told reporters Thursday that she bought the tickets and then forgot about them for about two weeks before going down to a supermarket to check them. When one came back with the message, 'see cashier,' she ran it through again before taking it up to the window and getting the good news. 'I started to cry,' she said. 'I called my sister to come get me. I didn't think I was going to make it. I said, ''I think I won the lottery.'"" Milk run: Enderson bought the winning ticket at this 7-Eleven when she stopped in to buy milk . The family has decided to take a lump sum payment of $14 million, which is worth about $10 million after taxes. 'It's going to help the family, it's going to help Ocean County,' Schiabor said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A new report claims that Democratic U.S. Senator John Walsh plagiarized a good portion of his masters thesis at the U.S. Army War College. Walsh, who was appointed to the seat in February after former Senator Max Baucus resigned the position after he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, reportedly took about two-thirds of his 2007 thesis from other works, without giving an attribution. In some instances, he took entire paragraphs verbatim from other works, the report claims. Plagiarism: Senator John Walsh lifted direct quotes from other published works for his masters thesis, according to a published report . 'Most strikingly, each of the six recommendations Mr. Walsh laid out . at the conclusion of his 14-page paper, titled ""The Case for Democracy . as a Long Term National Strategy,"" is taken nearly word-for-word without . attribution from a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace document . on the same topic,' the New York Times report states . The paper carefully provides multiple examples of portions of Walsh's thesis that are taken directly from other published material that is easily obtainable on the Internet. The senator responded to the report by claiming is was an unintentional mistake caused in part by post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq. The Times report was the second potentially damaging issue raised this year involving the Democrat's 33-year military career, which has been a cornerstone of his campaign to keep the seat. National Democrats said Wednesday they remained '100 percent behind Sen. Walsh' in his campaign against Republican Rep. Steve Daines. Walsh told The Associated Press when he wrote the thesis, he had PTSD from his service in Iraq, was on medication and was dealing with the stress of a fellow veteran's recent suicide. Appointment: Walsh was appointed to the seat in February by Montana Governor Steve Bullock . 'I don't want to blame my mistake on PTSD, but I do want to say it may have been a factor,' the senator said. 'My head was not in a place very conducive to a classroom and an academic environment.' Walsh submitted his thesis to earn his Master of Strategic Studies degree nearly two years after he returned from Iraq and about a year before he became Montana's adjutant general overseeing the state's National Guard and Department of Military Affairs. The paper includes a series of unattributed passages taken from the writings of other scholars. The first page borrows heavily from a 2003 Foreign Affairs piece written by Thomas Carothers, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a 2009 book by Natan Sharansky with Ron Dermer called 'The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror.' Sharansky is a former Soviet dissident and chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel. Dermer is the Israeli ambassador to the United States. Iraq: Walsh served in the Montana National Guard for 30 years and was Montana's adjutant general from 2008 to 2012 . All six of the recommendations that Walsh listed at the end of his paper are taken nearly word-for-word without attribution from a Carnegie paper written by Carothers and three other scholars at the institute. One section is nearly identical to about 600 words from a 1998 paper by Sean Lynn-Jones, a scholar at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a research institute at Harvard. Carothers and a Dermer spokesman declined to comment. Lynn-Jones said Walsh appears to have received a degree on the basis of work that was not entirely his own, and that anyone seeking credit for an academic degree 'needs to acknowledge where the material is coming from.' 'Maybe he unintentionally didn't cite my work, but it's up to the Army War College to determine whether this is acceptable by their standards or not,' Lynn-Jones said. An after-hours call to the Carlisle, Pennsylvania, school rang unanswered Wednesday. Walsh declined to answer repeated questions about whether he believed he earned the degree if the thesis' conclusions were not his own. Investigation: The US Army College says it plans to launch an investigation into the plagiarism allegations . 'I know about war strategy and defense because of firsthand experience leading a battalion and the Montana National Guard,' he said. The senator said when he wrote the paper, he was seeing two doctors and taking medication to deal with nightmares, anxiety and sleeplessness. He said he has since worked through those issues with his doctors and family, though he still takes antidepressant medication. Justin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the committee stands behind Walsh. 'John Walsh is a decorated war hero, and it's disgusting that Steve Daines and Washington Republicans are going to try denigrate John's distinguished service after multiple polls show him gaining,' Barasky said. Daines spokeswoman Alee Lockman said she had just seen the Times' report and had no immediate comment. Even before the plagiarism revelations, top Democratic strategists saw Walsh's campaign as an uphill pull, never counting on it as key to holding their Senate majority. PTSD: Walsh says his PTSD after a tour in Iraq might have played a role in his allegedly plagiarized thesis . Republicans need to gain six net seats this fall to control the Senate. South Dakota, West Virginia and Montana are seen as likely GOP pickups, and Republicans have several opportunities to grab the other three contests they need. Top on their lists are incumbent Democrats running in states President Barack Obama lost in 2012: Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina and Alaska. Walsh is the only senator who served in the Iraq war. He capped his long career in the Montana National Guard as the state's adjutant general before becoming lieutenant governor to Gov. Steve Bullock, who appointed him to the Senate seat. Walsh's military record was first questioned in January when records revealed the Army reprimanded him in 2010 for pressuring guardsmen to join a private association for which he was seeking a leadership role. Walsh was adjutant general at the time and wanted to become vice chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States. In the reprimand, Army Vice Chief of Staff Peter Chiarelli said he questioned Walsh's ability to lead. Political scientist David Parker of Montana State University said Walsh's thesis combined with the reprimand raise questions about the senator's integrity. 'If this were it, in isolation, I don't think it would be a big deal,' Parker said. 'But now we've got two issues of honor and competency.'","A New York Times shows examples where Walsh's thesis includes unattributed direct quotes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . On July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin was 'out of town' when the world united and rejoiced in a way never seen before or since. He and Neil Armstrong were on the moon. They missed the whole celebration 45 years ago this Sunday. So did Michael Collins, orbiting solo around the moon in the mother ship. Iconic: Aldrin says people ask him why this photo of him has become iconic. His answer: 'location, location, location' 'Out of town': Aldrin joked that he and the other astronauts missed the original moon landing because they were 'out of town' Now, on this Apollo 11 milestone - just five years shy of the golden anniversary - Aldrin is asking everyone to remember where they were when he and Armstrong became the first humans to step onto another heavenly body, and to share their memories online. Too young? You can also share how the moonwalkers inspired you. Celebrities, public figures, and other astronauts and scientists are happily obliging with videos. 'What a day that was,' said actor Tom Hanks, sipping from an Apollo 11 commemorative cup. He starred in the 1995 film Apollo 13, another gripping moon story. 'Going to space is a big deal. Walking on the moon is, literally, walking on the moon,' said singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams, born four years afterward. And from London Mayor Boris Johnson, who watched the event unfold on an a little black-and-white TV at an English farmhouse: 'I knew immediately it was the most exciting thing that I'd ever seen. I was only 5 at the time. And it still is just about the most exciting thing I've ever seen.' Earth-rise: Aldrin is asking people to tell the story of where they were when he and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon . Where were you? Celebs like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have offered their story of where they were when Aldrin (pictured in 2010) landed on the moon . In all, 12 men explored the moon in six landings through 1972. But that first moonwalk, by Armstrong and Aldrin, is what clinched America's place as space leader supreme following a string of crushing losses to the Soviet Union, which claimed title to first satellite, first spaceman, first spacewoman and first spacewalker. 'U.S. 1, Sputnik nothing,' actor Louis Gossett Jr. said with a laugh in his video. It's the first big anniversary of man's first moon landing without Armstrong, whose 'one small step ... one giant leap' immortalized the moment. Armstrong, long known for his reticence, died in 2012 at age 82. As Apollo 11's commander, Armstrong was first out the lunar module, Eagle, onto the dusty surface of Tranquility Base. Aldrin followed. Collins, now 83, the command module pilot who stayed behind in lunar orbit as the gatekeeper, also spent decades sidestepping the spotlight. He's making an exception for the 45th anniversary - he plans to take part in a NASA ceremony at Kennedy Space Center on Monday to add Armstrong's name to the historic Operations and Checkout Building. Anniversary: Aldrin and Armstrong pictured here on the 30th anniversary of the moon landing in 1999 . That leaves Aldrin, 84, as the perennial spokesman for Apollo 11. He will also be at Monday's ceremony. 'I consider myself a global statesman for space,' Aldrin says in a YouTube video. 'So I spend most of my time traveling the country and the world to remind people what NASA and our space program have accomplished, and what is still in our future at Mars. I feel we need to remind the world about the Apollo missions and that we can still do impossible things. 'The whole world celebrated our moon landing. But we missed the whole thing because we were out of town. So now I invite you to share with me - and the world - your story or your family's story of where you were on July 20th, 1969. Or feel free to tell me how the Apollo missions inspired you.' Aldrin used to keep a little black book to list people's whereabouts on July 20, 1969. Everyone wanted to share that with him. Now he's using social media and asking people to post a video to YouTube using the hashtag (hash)Apollo45. And the stories are pouring in. Peter Alyward, a self-professed space geek from Melbourne, Australia, recalls his parents waking him to see the Saturn V launch from what then was called Cape Kennedy, Florida, on July 16, 1969 - 45 years ago Wednesday - around the middle of the night Down Under. Nixon: The Apollo 11 astronauts meet Richard Nixon while in the quarantine van prior to their moon mission . It's the first major Apollo 11 anniversary- one divisible by five - that actually falls on the days of the week that the events occurred. Liftoff was, indeed, on a Wednesday, Eastern time; the moon landing was on a Sunday, Eastern time. 'More than any other time in history, with the technology that became available then, all the people of the world truly did experience it and were able to share it. Not just as an American feat, but as a really global event,' said Aylward, 56, a business developer for a software company. Actor Tim Allen watched the moon landing from his boyhood Michigan home. 'To this day, it's the most exciting thing in my life, just to think what you saw and what you experienced ... ' Allen said. Some of videos urge a return to the moon. President Barack Obama scrapped that idea in 2010 in favor of sending astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars. 'From one frontier to another, let's go back,' Alaska's lieutenant governor, Mead Treadwell, said in his video. 'Well done, Buzz Aldrin,' added Johnson, London's mayor. 'And about time we got back up there, huh?'","Aldrin took to Facebook to ask for stories about where people were on July 20, 1969, the date of the first moon landing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A few weeks before their prom king's death, students at an Ohio high school had attended an assembly on narcotics that warned about the dangers of heroin and prescription painkillers. But it was one of the world's most widely accepted drugs that killed Logan Stiner - a powdered form of caffeine so potent that as little as a single teaspoon can be fatal. The teen's sudden death in May has focused attention on the unregulated powder and drawn a warning from federal health authorities urging consumers to avoid it. Tragic: Popular Keystone High School student Logan Stiner died in May from a caffeine overdose . Popular: Logan Stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine . 'I don't think any of us really knew that this stuff was out there,' said Jay Arbaugh, superintendent of the Keystone Local Schools. The federal Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it's investigating caffeine powder and will consider taking regulatory action. The agency cautioned parents that young people could be drawn to it. An autopsy found that Stiner had a lethal amount of caffeine in his system when he died May 27 at his home in LaGrange, Ohio, southwest of Cleveland. Stiner, a wrestler, had more than 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood in his system, as much as 23 times the amount found in a typical coffee or soda drinker, according to the county coroner. His mother has said she was unaware her son took caffeine powder. He was just days away from graduation and had planned to study at the University of Toledo. Caffeine powder is sold as a dietary supplement, so it's not subject to the same federal regulations as certain caffeinated foods. Users add it to drinks for a pick-me-up before workouts or to control weight gain. A minuscule amount packs a punch. A mere 1/16th of a teaspoon can contain about 200 milligrams of caffeine, roughly the equivalent of two large cups of coffee. That means a heaping teaspoon could kill, said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Lethal: A mere 1/16th of a teaspoon of powdered caffeine can be deadly, according to health officials . The powder is almost impossible to measure with common kitchen tools, the FDA said. 'The difference between a safe amount and a lethal dose of caffeine in these powdered products is very small,' FDA spokeswoman Jennifer Dooren said. Glatter said he's seen several younger patients experience complications from caffeine in the last few months. Some arrive with rapid heart rates. 'They're starting to latch onto the powders more because they see it as a more potent way to lose weight,' Glatter said. Health officials worry about caffeine powder's potential popularity among exercise enthusiasts and young people seeking an energy boost. Dr. Henry Spiller directs a poison control center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Over a week or so this month, the center took reports of three people hospitalized for misusing caffeine powder. I can't believe you can buy this,' Spiller said. 'Honestly, I mean, it's frightening. It makes no sense to me.' Federal investigations have recently prompted some companies to pull products with added caffeine. Last year, Wrigley halted sales and marketing of Alert caffeinated gum after discussions with the FDA. In 2010, the agency forced manufacturers of alcoholic caffeinated beverages to cease production of those drinks. Authorities have also pledged to take action if they are able to link deaths to consumption of energy drinks. Hospitalizations from those drinks have been on the rise. Drugs: A week before his death, Stiner attended an assembly at his school on narcotics that warned about the dangers of heroin and prescription painkillers. Caffeine wasn't discussed . The number of emergency department visits involving energy drinks doubled — from 10,068 visits in 2007 to 20,783 visits in 2011, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Most of the cases involved teens or young adults. A full teaspoon of caffeine powder could contain 3,200 milligrams of caffeine. In that concentrated amount, a person can experience adverse effects in a matter of minutes, said Dr. Bob Hoffman, a New York University medical toxicologist. The brain becomes alert, then agitated and confused. The heartbeat picks up and can become dangerously irregular. A person can suffer nausea, vomiting and potentially a seizure. 'The thing about caffeine is just because you see it every day, just because it's naturally occurring — it comes from a plant — doesn't mean that it's safe,' Hoffman said. Back in Ohio, the superintendent of the district where Stiner attended school plans to take steps of his own. He wants to add the dangers of caffeine powder to drug and alcohol awareness programs.","Logan Stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on a powder form of caffeine .

"By . Ap . A hiker who was stranded for six days in California's Sierra Nevada with a badly broken leg says survival mode kicked in when he treated his own injury and sought sustenance by eating crickets and moths, and drinking melting ice. Recovering at a Fresno hospital, Gregg Hein, 33, said Wednesday that he was a couple days into a solo hike high in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks northeast of Fresno when a large rock crushed his right leg above the ankle. After letting out a yelp, the Clovis man said his first thought was treating his dangling leg and protruding bone to boost his chances of making it out alive. Gregg Hein, who broke his leg on a solo hike in the Sierra Nevada mountains, recovers at the Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno, Calif. on Wednesday, July 16, 2014. The 33-year-old hiker from Clovis, Calif., who was stranded for six days said that survival mode kicked in when he treated his own injury and he sought sustenance by eating crickets and moths, and drinking melting ice. (AP Photo/Scott Smith) 'I have to get these next moments right,' said Hein, an avid outdoorsman. 'What do I do to make sure I have the best chance for a positive outcome?' He briefly considered applying a tourniquet to stop the bleeding, a move that he knew would end with an amputation. Rather, Hein said he used hiking gear to wrap and secure his leg, and then he scooted to a flat clearing with a good vantage point to wait for rescuers. He had left his heavy pack behind, and the few insects he could scour at arm's reach hardly filled him up. He blew a whistle, hoping its echoes would catch somebody's attention. Who's hungry: Gregg Hein dined on moths and crickets for nourishment while stuck in the mountains with a broken leg . Back home, Doug Hein reported his son missing two days after he didn't return home as planned. Rescuers searched on foot and from the air. A helicopter crew eventually spotted the hiker July 10 and lifted him to safety. Hein underwent two surgeries and expects two more in a healing process likely to take months. Five pins hold his bones in place, and his legs are covered with scrapes from the 150-foot fall he took in the accident. Hein's father said he has warned his son against hiking alone, but that didn't keep him from two major expeditions, one covering 165 miles of wilderness. He's waiting for his son to recover to have another heart-to-heart conversation. Rugged: Hein was stranded for six days in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains . 'I've got a long time to get him back home and get him cornered and say, ""Hopefully you've learned from this,'"" Doug Hein said. Gregg Hein said his risky days of hiking alone are behind him, but not his love of the outdoors. 'As soon as I can get back to trail running and hiking, I'll be out there,' he said. 'It's my community.'","Gregg Hein was hiking alone when his leg was crushed by a large rock .

Stays in place: Chelsea Manning, who originally became known to the world as the Army private who leaked 700,000 state documents to Wikileaks, has been denied a transfer to a civilian prison and will stay in military custody, it was announced this week . Manning has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the sense of being a woman in a man's body. Civilian prisons can provide treatment, but the Defense Department doesn't have the medical expertise needed. Civilian federal prisons are required to provide such treatment, if deemed medically necessary, for inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Unlike in military prisons, the policy also allows inmates who believe they are the wrong gender to dress and live accordingly as part of their individual treatment plans. No go: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has approved the Army's recommendation to keep Manning in military custody in Kansas. The Army tried to get Manning transferred to the federal prison system, but officials said those discussions have ended . Previously, the military has said it does not provide treatment for gender dysphoria because Pentagon policy dictates that transgender soldiers are not allowed to serve.

"By . Ap . The first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal, Alice Coachman Davis, died early Monday in south Georgia. She was 90. Davis' death was confirmed by her daughter, Evelyn Jones. Davis won Olympic gold in the high jump at the 1948 games in London with an American and Olympic record of 1.68 meters (5.51 feet), according to USA Track and Field, the American governing body of the sport. Davis was inducted to the USA Track and Field Hall of fame in 1975, and was inducted to the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2004. Gold: Alice Coachman Davis clears the high-jump bar at five feet on her way winning an Olympic gold medal . 5.51: Davis' victory was the result of her gold medal jump of 5 feet six and 1/8 inches high . 'Going into the USOC Hall of Fame is as good as it gets,' she told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. 'It's like Cooperstown, Springfield and Canton,' she said, referring to the sites of other prominent Halls of Fame. Davis was the only American woman to win a gold medal at the 1948 games. According to Olympic historian David Wallechinsky, Coachman was honored with a 175-mile motorcade in Georgia when she returned from London. However, the black and white audiences were segregated at her official ceremony in Albany. Recollecting her career in the 2004 interview, Davis speculated that she could have won even more Olympic medals, but the Olympics weren't held in 1940 or 1944 because of World War II. She retired at age 25 after winning the gold medal in London. First: Davis became the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal for her high jump performance in the 1948 Olympics . Gold: To honor Davis, there was a 175-mile motorcade in her honor when she returned from London . 'I know I would have won in 1944, at least,' said Davis. 'I was starting to peak then. It really feels good when Old Glory is raised and the National Anthem is played.' Davis attended Tuskegee University and also played basketball on a team that won three straight conference basketball titles. She won 25 national track and field championships - including 10 consecutive high jump titles - between 1939 and 1948, according to USA Track and Field. Growing up in the deep South during the era of segregation, Davis had to overcome multiple challenges. The New Georgia Encyclopedia says she was prohibited from using public sports facilities because of her race, so she used whatever equipment she could cobble together to practice her jumping. 'My dad did not want me to travel to Tuskegee and then up north to the Nationals,' Davis told the AP. 'He felt it was too dangerous. Life was very different for African-Americans at that time. But I came back and showed him my medal and talked about all the things I saw. He and my mom were very proud of me.' Good as it gets: In 2004, Davis said that 'Going into the USOC Hall of Fame is as good as it gets' Davis won her first national high jump title at age 16 according to USA Track and Field, and worked as a school teacher and track coach after retiring. An elementary school in her home town is named in her honor and opened in August 1999 according to Dougherty County schools officials. Vera Williams, a secretary at Meadows Funeral Home in Albany, said Meadows will be handling Davis' memorial service, but plans haven't been finalized yet. Davis' cause of death was not immediately disclosed.","Davis won a gold medal in the high jump in the 1948 Olympic Games in London .

The blaze, which is burning in steep terrain, was just 10 percent contained Sunday morning. More than 1,000 firefighters, aided by aircraft, are battling the blaze in hot, dry conditions. The wildfire had prompted evacuations and road closures, but CalFire said all residents have been allowed to return home and all roads have been open to them. Massive: The fire already has burned 3,700 acres of forest and destroyed six structures . Still, the fire is threatening 15 homes and about 50 other structures. In Solano County, a grass fire prompted evacuations in Fairfield and temporarily shut down Highway 12 in both directions. By 4 p.m. residents were allowed back to their homes and most lanes had reopened, officials said. In Central California, a wildfire has burned nearly 2 square miles (1,200 acres) of a remote wilderness area of the Sequoia National Forest and was just 5 percent contained as of Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said more than 600 personnel are involved in fighting the Nicolls fire, which broke out Friday afternoon south of Sequoia National Park. Danger: The fire is threatening 15 homes and an additional 50 structures if fire crews can't get it under control soon . No homes were evacuated or in danger. The forest where the fire started is south of and separate from the Sequoia National Park east of Fresno, which is famous for its giant Sequoia trees.","Freddie Smoke III is accused of starting the blaze when the exhaust from a truck he was driving ignited some dry grass .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . and Ap . An Ohio woman who called 911 to report that her husband committed suicide by suffocating himself has been charged with his 2011 murder. A three-year investigation into the death of 55-year-old Michael Gabel concluded that he didn't commit suicide and that his wife, Jeane Harrington, had killed him, police said. She had reported Gabel's death to police, saying she found him dead with plastic wrap around his head. 'We know that suicide in this manner is very unusual,' Duane Streator, police chief of Avon Lake, told reporters Friday. 'Killer': Authorities say Jeane Harrington, who reported her husband's 'suicide' to police, actually murdered him . Streator said there was no immediate evidence of a struggle, but the Lorain County coroner ultimately determined Gabel died of asphyxiation, blows to his head and body, and electrical burns. Harrington, 56, was arrested Thursday, and her son - 11 when Gabel died - was turned over to a relative. In the 911 call, Harrington had reported that Gabel, a local car salesman, left a suicide note, and she described heavy debts coming due, suggesting he'd taken his own life. Harrington told police she owned a stun gun and had used it several times on Gabel in a fight earlier that evening that she described as 'mutual.' She said the disagreement centered on the couple's financial woes. 'He got a letter from the Internal Revenue Service the other day wanting $17,000,' Harrington said during the call. 'And then the following day he got a letter from some collection company wanting $16,000. And tomorrow they're supposed to sell our home at sheriff's auction.' 'Murdered': Police say Michael Gabel was murdered by his wife, Jeane Harrington, who they say shot him with a Taser and put plastic wrap over his face . Harrington said she last saw her husband alive at 2 a.m. on Aug. 16, 2011, when he walked from the den to the bathroom. She found his cold body on a sofa later that morning after she returned from errands, she said. Authorities now believe she stunned Gabel multiple times before suffocating him with industrial-strength, restaurant-grade plastic wrap. It wasn't immediately clear who is currently representing Harrington. A message was left for a lawyer who represented her in 2005 during divorce proceedings, which ended in reconciliation, and with another lawyer who represented her in a 2007 foreclosure case. Divorce filings indicated Harrington's pay at the Avon Public Library gift shop had been halved and that Gabel had used money from a 401(k) account and from mortgaging the couple's rental property to pay gambling debts. Streator said police had been called to the couple's address before on domestic issues.","Jeane Harrington told police that her husband, Michael Grabel, killed himself over financial troubles .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . and Ap . Unseasonably cool temperatures will arrive next week in the Midwest and as far south as Arkansas and Oklahoma. It . is not, however, the second coming of a polar vortex, a phrase the . National Weather Service's Chicago office tweeted earlier this week to . describe the upcoming sweater weather. They quickly learned that wasn't . such a good idea, said Amy Seeley, a weather service meteorologist who . spent a good chunk of Friday morning fielding a flood of telephone calls . from the media. 'I think people are pretty sensitive to those words,' she said. Polar vortex: A cold front set to hit the Midwest next week is NOT another polar vortex, just unseasonably chilly weather . Cooling off: Six-year-old Chance Seeds runs through the water at the splash pad at McEuen Park in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho on Thursday. But the weather is set to turn chillier soon . Though . Typhoon Neoguri has weakened since hitting Japan, it altered the path . of the North Pacific jet stream, allowing polar air behind a trough of . low pressure to spill out of Canada and into the Midwest, says Weather . Underground meteorology director Jeff Masters. It's similar to . the polar vortex pattern from the winter that turned much of the country . into a freezer for weeks at a time, breaking cold weather temperature . records in numerous states. But there are key differences, Masters says. This air mass is coming from western Canada and not directly from the . arctic, plus the polar vortex is not nearly as strong in the summer — . and sometimes breaks down completely. Between Monday and . Wednesday, temperatures in the Midwest will be as much as 15 degrees . cooler than normal, with the biggest drops seen close to the Great . Lakes, though people in Oklahoma and Arkansas will need to break out . pants, too. Meanwhile, the usually temperate Pacific Northwest . should get ready to sweat. Places like Seattle could reach 90 or higher . next week, Masters said. January chill: The winter Polar Vortex brought freezing temperatures and mountains of snow to much of the Midwest and Northeast . Chicago would normally see highs in the . 80s and lows in the mid-60s, but the weather service says highs early . next week will climb no higher than the mid-60s — maybe 70 degrees— and . lows could dip into the upper 40s. The cool spell is coming at . the wrong time for some athletes who are preparing for a triathlon in . Wisconsin next weekend. If Lake Michigan is too cold, the swimming . portion won't happen. 'It's disappointing because you've done all . the preparations for it,' said Elizabeth Waterstraat, who has been . coaching several people from suburban Chicago. That sound you . hear coming up from Oklahoma might be thousands or people turning off . their money-gobbling air conditioners. It could also be the cheers of . those who make their living working outside, like the employees at a . Tulsa nursery, whose job entails hauling trees and shrubs around town. Not quite: It's going to be cold in the midwest next week, but not 'polar vortex' cold . 'We . love it,' Paul James, marketing manager for Southwood Landscape & . Garden Center, said of the forecast for temperatures running about 15 . degrees lower than the typical 93- or 94-degree July days. 'Any day you . don't get above 100 degrees.' Further north, the forecast is more . bad news at the Maple Lane Resort in the western Michigan community of . Empire, along Glen Lake, near Lake Michigan. This summer's cooler . temperatures already have affected business. 'We are fully booked . for weekends here this summer but we are seeing less families spend a . week up here,' office manager Amanda Rennie said.

"By . Emily Crane . and Ap . The head stripper of Australia's Thunder from Down Under troupe has told a Las Vegas court how he and his friends dived on top of an intruder who allegedly stole G-strings from their dressing room. Mathew Fardell said he came off stage at their show at the Excalibur Casino on March 18 and was told an intruder was being held by other members of his troupe. He went out to a patio and saw his fellow strippers Aidan Te Puke and Ryan Paki struggling to control 24-year-old Joey Kadmir so he decided to subdue him by 'choking him out'. Scroll down for video . Australian Thunder from Down Under stripper, Mathew Fardell, told a Las Vegas court how he tried to pin down the hand of a man threatening to fire a handgun inside their dressing room at the Excalibur casino in Las Vegas . The struggle continued with more strippers coming to help, before Kadmiri fell back on to the floor with the strippers on top of him. Mr Fardell said he noticed Kadmiri was wearing  the blue Calvin Klein underpants Mr Te Puke wears in the show under his jeans. He also noticed under the underpants Kadmiri was wearing one of his tight, black G-strings. Las Vegas authorities allege Kadmiri was high on a drug, methamphetamine, when he snuck backstage of the Thunder Showroom in the Excalibur Casino on March 18, rifled through the troupe's belongings, and stole G-strings, underpants and other props from their show. 'He (Kadmiri) yelled, “I've got a gun. I'm going to shoot now”,' Mr Fardell told the court on Tuesday. Mr Fardell didn't believe him after seeing the underpants and G-string. 'I kind of relaxed because, given he was wearing my thong and he had on Aidan's underwear, I thought, ""I don't think he'd have a gun"",' he said. Joey Kadmiri, 24, faces nine felony burglary, robbery, battery and weapon charges after being accused of sneaking into the stripper's dressing room on March 18 . He initially thought Kadmiri was talking about one of the fake guns the troupe uses in SWAT and gangster acts in their show. 'I turned and in his hand was the biggest gun you have ever seen in your life,' he said. 'I don't know guns that well, but I knew it was .44 Magnum. It was massive.' The performer said he put all of his might on Kadmiri's wrist to make sure the gun was pointing away from them before Kadmiri pulled the trigger, lodging the bullet in the wall of an Italian restaurant at the casino. Mr Fardell was so close to the gun when it went off he suffered gunpowder burns on his face and in his left eye, and also suffered tinnitus in his left ear. The ear was bleeding, but after security and police took Kadmiri into custody, Mr Fardell and his troupe went back on stage to finish the show. 'I could feel blood dripping on my shirt,' Mr said. Kadmiri is alleged to have snuck into the Thunder Down Under dressing room on March 18 by claiming to be a new performer in the show . 'It's a miracle that no one was killed,' Prosecutor Kenneth Portz said in his opening address. 'These men don't miss the gym all that much, and it still took six men to hold him.' The .44 calibre Magnum revolver was a gun made famous by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies, Mr Portz told the court. Prosecutors on Monday dropped eight of 17 charges originally filed by a grand jury in the case, including attempted murder, armed robbery and several counts of robbery with a weapon. Kadmiri still faces nine felony burglary, robbery, battery and weapon charges, which could get him decades in prison if he's convicted. The accused suffered a black eye and other minor injuries during the scuffle that saw him allegedly fire a gun . He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers, Joshua Tomsheck and Roy Nelson, plan to make their opening arguments later this week. Mr Tomsheck has said Kadmiri had drug and mental health issues before the March 18 incident. Police later found that Kadmiri had with him a pair of surgical gloves, an open 2.1-gram plastic packet of methamphetamine and a box of bullets for the handgun. His lawyers haven't confirmed if Kadmiri will testify. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . They were dubbed the 'forgotten souls' - the cremated remains of thousands of people who came through the doors of Oregon's state mental hospital, died there and whose ashes were abandoned inside 3,500 copper urns. Discovered a decade ago at the decrepit Oregon State Hospital, where One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was filmed, the remains became a symbol of the state's - and the nation's - dark history of treating the mentally ill. A research effort to unearth the stories of those who moved through the hospital's halls, and to reunite the remains with surviving relatives, takes center stage Monday as officials dedicate a memorial to those once-forgotten patients. 'Unclaimed souls': Building 60 on the Oregon State Hospital grounds is where the cremated remains of thousands of mentally ill patients . Memorial: The building has been transformed into a memorial for the thousands of 'forgotten souls' who died at the hospital . Hollywood: The Oregon State Hospital was used in the filming of the Jack Nicholson classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . 'No one wants to be laid to rest without some kind of acknowledgement that they were here, that they contributed, that they lived,' said state Senate President Peter Courtney, who led a successful effort to replace the hospital and build the memorial. Between 1913 and 1971, more than 5,300 people were cremated at the hospital. Most were patients at the mental institution, but some died at local hospitals, the state tuberculosis hospital, a state penitentiary or the Fairview Training Center, where people with developmental disabilities were institutionalized. Hospital officials have been working for years to reunite the remains of their former patients with surviving relatives. Since the urns were found by lawmakers on a tour of the hospital in 2005, 183 have been claimed. The 3,409 that remain and have been identified are listed in a searchable online database. Thirty-eight urns will likely never be identified; they're unmarked, have duplicate numbers or aren't listed in ledgers of people cremated at the hospital. Patients: The remains of S. Erickson is one of more than 3,000 'forgotten souls' found at the hospital . Alone: Many of the remains that were discovered were unclaimed, like those of Nencel Devorak . History: The hospital tells the tale of the tragic history of how mental illness has often been treated in America . They came from different backgrounds, for different reasons. Some stayed just days before they died, others for nearly their entire lives. They came from every state except Alaska and Hawaii. Nearly 1,000 were born in 44 countries. Five were born at sea. Twenty-two were Native Americans. Their remains won't be part of the memorial; they'll be returned to their tribe for a proper ceremony. Members of the local Sikh community are working to claim the remains of two people. Many of the 110 veterans still there will eventually receive proper military burials, though some are ineligible due to dishonorable discharges or insufficient information available. Some patients spent a lifetime at the hospital for conditions like depression and bipolar disorder that, in modern times, are treated on an outpatient basis. 'At the time, they just put them in a safe place and treated them with what they knew to treat them,' said Sharon Tucker, who led the two-year research project. Canisters: The remains of thousands of patients sat in canisters on shelves at the hospital . Records are sparse, even for people who lived for decades inside the walls. Some suffered from severe delusions, others from physical deformities. Some seemed to be institutionalized because their families just didn't know what to do with them. But what does survive is a window not only into who they were, but the time in which they lived. - Mr. S. Erickson was committed on Feb. 2, 1929, at age 78. A doctor who examined him wrote that he 'wanders around naked at night' and suffers from senility. A laborer, 5-foot-5, 125 pounds with gray hair and blue eyes, he arrived in New York from Norway on the steamship Norstatter on Aug. 22, 1883, according to the doctor's report. - Wencel Devorak, a saddler born in Bohemia, was 33 when he was committed on Jan. 31, 1890 struggling with delusions that others on the road to Portland were following him and teasing him about his wife. The handful of notes in his file show his delusions continued throughout his 40-year stay at the hospital. - Susanna Weber arrived at Dammasch State Hospital, a now-closed mental institution, on July 26, 1962 at age 82. A widower, she was committed by her sister and a friend, who had cared for her for three years, but couldn't keep going. She'd been sent to a nursing home, but administrators kicked her out because she wouldn't stop wandering and rifling through other patients' possessions, according to a social worker's report written shortly after Weber arrived. Old: Some of the canisters have been there since around the time the hospital opened its doors in 1896 . The remains of Erickson, Devorak, Weber and thousands of others have been transferred from the copper canisters to ceramic urns that will better protect them. The old canisters will be preserved to give visitors to the memorial a sense for how they once were housed. 'I think it will be very difficult to forget them now,' said Jodie Jones, the state administrator leading the hospital replacement project.","The cremated remains of more than 3,500 people were found in the Oregon State Hospital about 10 years ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Workers are preparing to enter one of the most dangerous rooms on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation - the site of a 1976 blast that exposed a technician to a massive dose of radiation, which led to him being nicknamed the 'Atomic Man.' Harold McCluskey, then 64, was working in the room when a chemical reaction caused a glass glove box to explode. He was exposed to the highest dose of radiation from the chemical element americium ever recorded — 500 times the occupational standard. Hanford, located in central Washington state, made plutonium for nuclear weapons for decades. The room was used to recover radioactive americium, a byproduct of plutonium. Atomic Man: Harold McCluskey survived a nuclear explosion in 1976 at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, Washington . Nukes: The Hanford Nuclear Reservation made plutonium for nuclear weapons for decades. Covered with blood, McCluskey was dragged from the room and put into an ambulance headed for the decontamination center. Because he was too hot to handle, he was removed by remote control and transported to a steel-and-concrete isolation tank. During the next five months, doctors laboriously extracted tiny bits of glass and razor-sharp pieces of metal embedded in his skin. Nurses scrubbed him down three times a day and shaved every inch of his body every day. The radioactive bathwater and thousands of towels became nuclear waste. McCluskey also received some 600 shots of zinc DTPA, an experimental drug that helped him excrete the radioactive material. Outcast: McCluskey's friends were afraid to go near him until his minister assured them that it was safe to be around him . He was placed in isolation in a decontamination facility for five months. Within a year, his body's radiation count had fallen by about 80 percent and he was allowed to return home. But his radiation-related medical problems proliferated. He had a kidney infection, four heart attacks in as many months and cataract surgery on both eyes, followed by a cornea transplant and a precipitous drop in his blood platelet count, which required transfusions. Friends at first avoided him until his minister told people it was safe to be around him. The accident sapped his stamina, and he was unable to hunt, fish or do any of the things he had planned for his retirement. He was studied extensively by doctors for the rest of his life and died of coronary artery disease in 1987 at the age of 75. Restricted: The 'McCluskey Room' was used to recover radioactive americium, a byproduct of plutonium . Hanford contains the nation's greatest collection of nuclear waste, and for more than two decades has been engaged in the dangerous work of cleaning up that waste. The space now dubbed the McCluskey Room is located inside the closed Plutonium Finishing Plant and is scheduled for cleanup this summer. 'It's been largely closed up since the accident,' Geoff Tyree, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy in Richland, said Wednesday. 'It was restricted for the potential for airborne radiation contamination.' Since 2008, the Department of Energy and contractor CH2M HILL Plateau Remediation Company have been preparing the plant for demolition. 'About two-thirds of the Plutonium Finishing Plant is deactivated — cleaned out and ready for demolition,' said Jon Peschong, an assistant DOE manager in Richland. 'Cleaning out the McCluskey Room will be a major step forward.' Disassemble: The Department of Energy hopes to have the site ready for demolition by summer of 2016 . When specially trained and equipped workers enter the room this summer, they will encounter airborne radioactivity, surface contamination, confined spaces and poor ventilation, the DOE said. They will be wearing abrasion-resistant suits that protect them from surface contamination and chemicals. A dual-purpose air system will provide cool air for breathing and cool air throughout the suit for worker comfort, allowing them to work for longer periods of time. The suits are pressurized, to prevent workers from coming into contact with airborne contaminants. The McCluskey Room 'is going to be the toughest work ahead of us as we finish cleaning the plant and getting it ready for demolition by the end of September 2016,' Tyree said.","Harold McCluskey was working at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation when a chemical reaction caused a glass .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A suspended South Carolina state trooper threatened to use a Taser on Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Sam Montgomery during a traffic stop last week for speeding. South Carolina Highway Patrol Lance Cpl. R.S. Salter shouted directions at Montgomery during the stop early Wednesday. The 6-foot-3, 262-pound lineman attempts to comply when Salter tells him if he can't follow the commands 'the next thing you're going to get is the Taser.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unprofessional: Trooper Salter's instructions for Montgomery were confusing, to say the least . Taser: As Montgomery politely tries to comply with Salter's bizarre instructions, the trooper threatens to Taser him . Arrested: After barking orders at the startled Montgomery, the trooper takes him into custody for speeding . Jail: Montgomery was forced to spend the night in jail for driving 34 mph over the speed limit . 'Whoa,' Montgomery responds, 'I'm not trying to cause problems.' Montgomery was arrested for going 89 mph on a 55 mph road in Laurens County. He was booked and spent the night in jail until getting released on $355 bond. He has a court date of July 16, according to the ticket issued by Salter. Salter was suspended by the state Department of Public Safety on Thursday and his conduct during the stop is under investigation by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility. Salter has been with the South Carolina Highway Patrol since 2000. The agency said Salter was within the law to make an arrest for a speeding violation in excess of 25 mph. But a statement released Monday said 'Salter's behavior during the traffic stop of Mr. Montgomery was not representative of professionalism displayed by our troopers and officers every day around the state.' Attitude change: Once Salter got Montgomery into his patrol car, his cold demeanor changed . Montgomery said he was returning home to Greenwood when pulled over. He played football for Greenwood High, then spent three seasons at LSU where he had 19 career sacks and helped the Tigers to the 2011 national championship game won by Alabama. Montgomery was selected by Houston in the third round of the 2013 draft. However, he was inactive for the Texans' first seven games and waived by the club last October. Oakland signed him to the practice squad in December. Montgomery signed with Cincinnati as a free agent in April. Agency spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said in a statement the department expects troopers treat the public with courtesy and respect. When Montgomery's arrest was brought to the agency's attention, 'we began a review of the traffic stop and self-initiated an internal investigation,' Iacobelli says. Buddy-buddy: The officer then tried to act like the NFL player's buddy after taking him into custody . All-American: Montgomery was an All-American at LSU before he was drafted into the NFL . Salter's harsh tone changes after handcuffing Montgomery and moving him into the trooper car. Montgomery phones his mother with Salter's help and the two discuss what Montgomery might face because of his excessive speed. When Montgomery tells the officer that he accepts responsibility and will pay whatever fine is asked, Salters counsels says it might be in the driver's best interest to come to traffic court and see if he can get the penalties - and potential points against his license - lessened. 'And I will work with you on your ticket,' Salter tells Montgomery. 'I'm pretty fair, any man comes to court, asks for help on a ticket, I'll do what I can.' Montgomery says he was at fault for going too fast. 'Bad deal,' he said. 'Trying to get home. I'll take the lick. I was wrong.'","Bengals lineman Sam Montgomery did everything he could to politely comply as the trooper shouted at him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . President Barack Obama plans to nominate former Proctor & Gamble executive Robert McDonald as the next Veterans Affairs secretary, as the White House seeks to shore up an agency beset by treatment delays and struggling to deal with an influx of new veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. An administration official said Obama would announce McDonald’s appointment Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would succeed Eric Shinseki, the retired four-star general who resigned last month as the scope of the issues at veterans’ hospitals became apparent. In tapping McDonald for the post, Obama is signaling his desire to install a VA chief with broad management experience. High expectations: President Obama is hoping former P&G CEO Robert McDonald can reform the scandal-plagued VA . McDonald also had military experience, graduating near the top of his class from West Point and serving as a captain in the Army, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division. The administration official insisted on anonymity in order to confirm McDonald’s appointment before the president’s announcement. Jim McNerney, Chairman and CEO of The Boeing Company, welcomed the development. 'I believe Bob McDonald is an outstanding choice for this critically important position. Following his military service, Bob spent more than three decades in business, where he rose through the ranks leading increasingly large and complex organizations by demonstrating strong management skills and by understanding and attending to the needs of hundreds of thousands of individual consumers of Procter & Gamble,' McNerney said. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement that he looked forward to meeting with McDonald next week to get his views on issues he views as important. Scandal: 1,700 veterans seeking treatment at the Phoenix VA hospital were at risk of being 'lost or forgotten' after being kept off the official waiting list . Among them, . Sanders said in a statement, 'The VA needs significantly improved . transparency and accountability and it needs an increased number of . doctors, nurses and other medical staff so that all eligible veterans . get high-quality health care in a timely manner.' A biography of McDonald on Procter & Gamble’s website says he led the company from 2009 to 2013. During . that time, the company website states: 'P&G realized annual sales . of over $84 billion. The company had more than 120,000 employees, 120 . plants and 200 brands in 35 categories, of which 25 brands generate over . $1 billion in sales each year.' The company’s Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and other products can be found in 98 percent of American households. But . under McDonald’s leadership, it struggled to grow under increased . competition and global economic challenges. Critics suggested he was . having trouble getting the 150-year-old-plus company to fire on all . cylinders. Ousted: The scandal at the VA hospital led to the resignation of former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki . Investors, . including activist investor William Ackman, voiced frustration over the . company’s slow revenue growth and stagnant market share gains. Ackman, . who took a 1 percent stake in the company, pressed for the company to . streamline operations and improve results. In . a letter announcing his retirement from P&G, McDonald wrote, 'This . has been a very difficult decision for me, but I’m convinced it is what . is in the best interests of the company and you. 'During . the past year, much attention has been focused on me from several . angles, which has been a distraction that is not in our best interests,' he wrote. In a surprise move, McDonald was replaced by the man he had replaced, former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley. McDonald . has also served on the board of directors of the Xerox Corp., the .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a long-delayed inhalable diabetes medication to help patients control their blood sugar levels during meals. The FDA cleared MannKind Corp.'s Afrezza, a fast-acting form of insulin, for adults with the most common form of diabetes, which affects more than 25 million Americans. The approval decision comes more than three years after the agency first asked MannKind to run additional clinical studies on the drug. Inhaler: The device, which is about the size of a referee's whistle, could replace injectable insulin . Tiny: Other, similar devices have been much larger - some the size of a tennis ball - than the Afrezza device . Approval for the drug is a milestone for MannKind Corp., and its billionaire chief executive, 88-year-old Alfred E. Mann, who has devoted much of his fortune to developing the revolutionary delivery system for the in-demand drug. 'Today’s F.D.A. action validates the . years of clinical research and commitment that powered the development . of this unique therapy,' Mann said in a statement to the New York Times. Demand for diabetes treatments is surging globally as the prevalence of obesity explodes. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 347 million people worldwide have the disease, a chronic condition in which the body either does not make enough insulin to break down the sugar in foods or uses insulin inefficiently. It can lead to blindness, strokes, heart disease or death. In type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, the body does not use insulin properly. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. In those cases, the body does not produce insulin. Afrezza, an insulin powder, comes in a single-use cartridge and is designed to be inhaled at the start of a meal or within 20 minutes. MannKind has said that patients using the drug can achieve peak insulin levels within 12 to 15 minutes. That compares to a wait time of an hour and a half or more after patients inject insulin. Philanthropist: Billionaire Alfred E. Mann lost nearly $200 million developing Afrezza . The FDA said in its approval announcement that Afrezza is not a substitute for long-acting insulin and is a new option for controlling insulin levels during meals. The agency approved Afrezza with a boxed warning — the strongest type — indicating that the drug should not be used in patients with chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and smoker's cough, due to reports of breathing spasms. The agency is also requiring several follow-up studies looking at the drug's long-term safety, including its impact on the heart and lungs. Mannkind first submitted the drug to FDA in March 2009. The Valencia, California-based company has no other products on the market and lost more than $191 million last year. MnnKind Corp: MannKind Corp.'s lone product is Afrezza, which it has devoted hundreds of millions of dollars into developing . Several other companies have failed to make inhaled insulin work commercially. In 2007, Pfizer Inc. discontinued its inhaled insulin Exubera after it failed to gain ground on the market. In 2008, Eli Lilly & Co. ended its development program, citing regulatory uncertainty. MannKind shares fell 5.5 percent in regular trading after the FDA's approval announcement but rebounded 70 cents, or 7 percent, to $10.70 in after-hours trading Friday.","Afrezza is a fast-acting form of insulin that can be inhaled rather than injected - to control blood-sugar levels .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A California firefighter who disappeared two weeks ago after chasing after his dog during a backpacking trip was found dead Friday, authorities said, less than a week after his dog was found alive. The body of Mike Herdman, 36, was found in a rugged cliff area about three-quarters of a mile and 1,200 feet above the river bottom where he was last seen June 13, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. Authorities theorized that he may have fallen off of a cliff, but his remains could only be identified by his dental records after being exposed to the elements for such a long period of time.

Authorities will have to wait until an autopsy is performed to determine an official cause of death. Herdman and a friend were backpacking in the Los Padres National Forest river bottom when his dog, Duke, ran off. The firefighter chased after his pet barefoot and wearing only shorts and a T-shirt. Herdman's . friend made his way back to a trailhead June 15 to alert authorities, . setting off a large-scale search. Dean said search crews put in about . 5,000 hours and scoured 50 square miles on foot, on horseback and by air . — including the use of two drones.

'Nobody could imagine that he was able to travel that far,' the sheriff said. Tragic: Mike Herdman, pictured, was a paramedic with the Arcadia Fire Department whose body was found Friday .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Ap . A Detroit father whose son had been missing for 11 days learned on live television that the boy had been found alive in his basement. Charles Bothuell IV was on HLN to speak with Nancy Grace about the June 14 disappearance of his son Charlie, 12, when the host suddenly said she had new information. 'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said. Bothuell was stunned - becoming visibly upset and clutching his chest as he struggled to speak. It has since emerged that the father could face child abuse charges in the case. Police sources told WJBK that he allegedly beat his son with a PVC pipe and gave him a grueling exercise regime. Scroll down for video . Stunned: Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence on Wednesday when HLN's Nancy Grace told him his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished . Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days . On the show, Grace repeated what she had said - this time importantly adding that he had been found 'alive'. As the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news, Grace demanded to know whether or not he had checked his basement. 'I checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down there several times. We've all been checking.' He said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement of their Detroit townhouse but the boy had not been found. Charlie Bothuell was discovered on Wednesday . afternoon as authorities searched the home but it is not yet clear . whether he had been there the whole week. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said . when police found the boy, he appeared to be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did . not announce himself. Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found . Emotional: When Nancy Grace demanded to know if he'd checked the basement, he said repeatedly that he and his wife, as well as the FBI and the Detroit police had been down there . Craig said that he believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found . nearby. 'There's no way he could have erected this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' Craig told WJBK. 'He certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to actually talk and embrace Charlie. 'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.' In . the basement, a tunnel leads from apartment to apartment and to the . outside, meaning he could have come and gone when he needed to, WJBK . reported. Charles Bothuell IV . Sources told the news channel that the boy had claimed his stepmother, Monique, was helping him hide out and giving him food - but the family attorney has denied the claim. His stepmother reportedly told police the boy didn't complete his daily exercise routine and when she told his father, Charlie ran away. Sources also said that he often beat his son, who was homeschooled, with a PVC pipe and that blood was found in the boy's room - which is why police did not rule out homicide. Police are investigating a serious case of child abuse we're told the father considered discipline. WJBK reported that the father is expected to face child abuse charges in the next couple of days. The boy was taken to hospital, where he was met by his biological mother. The extent of his injuries, if any, are unknown. Relieved: The boy's father was so emotional when his son was discovered that he hugged a reporter . Charlie was last seen on June 14 when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom - but never came back. The boy lives in the home with his father and stepmother. Just . hours before he was found, Craig had told reporters that investigators . were 'not ruling out the possibility of homicide' in the case. After . he emerged from the HLN interview, his father, Charlie Bothuell IV, . said he was as surprised as anyone that his son was in the basement. 'I'm . shocked. I looked. The Detroit police looked. The FBI looked,' he said. 'To imply that I knew my son was in the basement is absurd.' The elder Bothuell was swarmed by reporters outside the house when he arrived home Wednesday evening. 'I thought my son was dead,' he said as he broke down in tears and hugged a reporter. Craig . told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a . polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother . declined to do so.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Buddy Cianci, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Cianci said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago — before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent 4 ½ years in prison. Cianci, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence can't afford to have a mayor who is getting 'on-the-job training.' Convict: Buddy Cianci was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions . Making an announcement on his radio show, Cianci said that many people would call this an eleventh-hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soul-searching and reflection. He said he wants to rekindle the city's 'renaissance.' 'If the people don't want me, they don't have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. 'They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I've accomplished.' Cianci's announcement came shortly before the 4 p.m. filing deadline; a surrogate filed his paperwork for him at City Hall. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Cianci previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Cianci has worked as a radio broadcaster since his release from federal prison in 2007 . Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Cianci has remained a popular politician in Providence . He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and won't keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a down-at-the-heels urban center with a dwindling downtown to an arts and culture hub. He often boasts that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City Hall, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrass the city. Cianci mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Buddy II, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City Hall, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Nice 'do: Cianci used to wear a tupee but recently ditched it and embraced his bald head . The city's demographics have changed since Cianci last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Brett Smiley and law professor and former judge Jorge Elorza. Republican Dan Harrop is also running. Lorne Adrain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Cianci's entry. 'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Buddy Cianci's candidacy represents,' Smiley said. Solomon said he — not Cianci — is the candidate of experience, having worked in recent years with Taveras to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to 'keep moving forward.' Adrain said Cianci's announcement won't affect his campaign. 'The people of Providence are well familiar with his history,' he said.","Cianci served six terms as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island .
He is often given credit for the city's rise as a cultural hub .
Cianci's first felony conviction was for assault after he beat a man with a log and a lit cigarette .

"By . Mark Prigg . and Ap . The Supreme Court has told wireless streaming firm Aereo it must pay broadcasters when it takes television programs from the airwaves and allows subscribers to watch them on phones and tablets. The justices said by a 6-3 vote that Aereo is violating the broadcasters' copyrights by taking the signals for free. The ruling is expected to kill the service, which is available in New York, Boston, Houston and Atlanta among 11 metropolitan areas and uses thousands of dime-size antennas to capture television signals and transmit them to subscribers who pay as little as $8 a month for the service. Scroll down for video . Aereo showing a streaming broadcast of Bob the Builder on the New York PBS station, WNET 13. The Supreme Court has  ruled that Aereo has to pay broadcasters when it takes television programs from the airwaves . Aereo is s available in New York, Boston, Houston and Atlanta among 11 metropolitan areas and uses thousands of dime-size antennas to capture television signals and transmit them to subscribers who pay as little as $8 a month for the service. The ruling preserves the ability of the television networks to collect huge fees from cable and satellite systems that transmit their programming. Aereo looks a lot like a cable system, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court in rejecting the company's attempts to distinguish itself from cable and satellite TV. 'Aereo's system is, for all practical purposes, identical to a cable system,' he said. Company executives have said their business model would not survive a loss at the Supreme Court. Following the ruling, billionaire Barry Diller, Aereo's most prominent investor, said, 'It's not a big (financial) loss for us, but I do believe blocking this technology is a big loss for consumers, and beyond that I only salute (Aereo CEO) Chet Kanojia and his band of Aereo'lers for fighting the good fight.' Some justices worried during arguments in April that a ruling for the broadcasters could also harm the burgeoning world of cloud computing, which gives users access to a vast online computer network that stores and processes information. But Breyer said the court did not intend to call cloud computing into question. Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. Scalia said he shares the majority's feeling that what Aereo is doing ""ought not to be allowed."" But he said the court has distorted federal copyright law to forbid it. Congress should decide whether the law ""needs an upgrade,"" Scalia said. Broadcasters including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS sued Aereo for copyright infringement, saying Aereo should pay for redistributing the programming in the same way cable and satellite systems must or risk high-profile blackouts of channels that anger their subscribers. The National Association of Broadcasters praised the court for rejecting Aereo's argument that the lawsuit was an attack on innovation. 'Broadcasters embrace innovation every day, as evidenced by our leadership in HDTV, social media, mobile apps, user-generated content, along with network TV backed ventures like Hulu,' NAB president Gordon Smith said. In each market, Aereo has a data center with thousands of dime-size antennas. When a subscriber wants to watch a show live or record it, the company temporarily assigns the customer an antenna and transmits the program over the Internet to the subscriber's laptop, tablet, smartphone or even a big-screen TV with a Roku or Apple TV streaming device. The antenna is only used by one subscriber at a time, and Aereo says that's much like the situation at home, where a viewer uses a personal antenna to watch over-the-air broadcasts for free. The broadcasters and professional sports leagues also feared that nothing in the case would limit Aereo to local service. Major League Baseball and the National Football League have lucrative contracts with the television networks and closely guard the airing of their games. Aereo's model would pose a threat if, say, a consumer in New York could watch NFL games from anywhere through his Aereo subscription. The federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo did not violate the copyrights of broadcasters with its service, but a similar service has been blocked by judges in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Chet Kanojia, founder and CEO of Aereo, Inc., holding a tablet displaying his company's technology, in New York. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said its ruling stemmed from a 2008 decision in which it held that Cablevision Systems Corp. could offer a remote digital video recording service without paying additional licensing fees to broadcasters because each playback transmission was made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber. The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal from movie studios, TV networks and cable TV channels. In the Aereo case, a dissenting judge said his court's decision would eviscerate copyright law. Judge Denny Chin called Aereo's setup a sham and said the individual antennas are a ""Rube Goldberg-like contrivance"" — an overly complicated device that accomplishes a simple task in a confusing way — that exists for the sole purpose of evading copyright law. Smaller cable companies, independent broadcasters and consumer groups backed Aereo, warning the court not to try to predict the future of television. Indeed, Scalia himself noted that the high court came within a vote of declaring videocassette recorders ""contraband"" when it ruled for Sony Corp. in a case over recordings of television programs 30 years ago.","Aereo told it must pay broadcasters when it takes television programs from the airwaves .

"By . Ap . To a raucous embrace, President Barack Obama told gay donors Tuesday that American society and its laws have advanced the cause of gay rights over the past 10 years but said the job was hardly over in the United States and especially abroad. He received a loud standing ovation when he declared that he had directed the White House to prepare an executive order barring discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The White House announced the initiative Monday, a long-sought measure in the gay community that Obama initially had resisted. 'It's not just laws that are changing, it's hearts and minds,' he said before 550 supporters at a Democratic National Committee fundraising dinner for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender donors. Standing ovation: President Obama speaks at the DNC annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender fundraiser gala in Gotham Hall, Tuesday in New York. The president won a standing ovation when he announced plans to sign an executive order that would prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . Obama was courting high-dollar Democratic contributors in New York, also headlining an event for a super PAC like the ones he once decried and appearing with about 30 donors who paid up to $32,400 to dine at the home of Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Obama's attendance at the three fundraisers underscores his popularity as a draw for big donors and his utility in an election year building up the treasuries of the Democratic Party. Earlier Tuesday, Obama was in Pittsburgh promoting his economic policies and drawing contrasts with congressional Republicans, another midterm presidential task aimed at helping Democrats. The dinner and the fundraiser for the Senate Majority PAC were closed to the media. The news media was permitted to cover Obama's remarks to the Democratic National Committee's gala for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender donors, the centerpiece event of the evening. The dinner at New York's Gotham Hall came on the same day that the Senate approved two openly gay Obama nominees for federal judgeships. The president got a rousing reception at the gala for gay donors in response to his directive for an anti-discrimination executive order, even if it only applies to federal contractors. Famous faces: Obama grasped hands with Edie Windsor after she introduced him. A lawsuit filed by Windsor and her late wife ultimately became what helped get the Defense of Marriage Act struck down . Entertainment: Singer Sia performed at the event, which was attended by about 550 supporters . Obama lacks authority to extend that protection to all Americans, but the order being drafted by the White House would affect about 14 million workers whose employers or states currently do not prohibit workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals. The scope of the measure was tabulated by the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, which studies sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. Obama had resisted signing the order in hopes Congress would pass a broader non-discrimination measure that would apply to nearly all employers. While the Democratic-controlled Senate passed the legislation last year, the measure has languished in the Republican-led House and there is little sign that lawmakers will take it up in an election year. He urged supporters to keep pressure on Congress, noting that there are more states that allow same-sex marriage than have laws specifically protecting gays against workplace discrimination. And he said Americans should not forget strong anti-gay sentiments in some countries abroad. 'We can't stop. We have to keep fighting, we have to keep fighting for the human rights of people around the world,' he said. Officials with the Senate Majority PAC declined to provide details about the number of donors or the amounts contributed. Obama had once vigorously objected to political groups like the Senate Majority PAC that can take unlimited donations. Once primarily conduits for Republican or conservative big money, such super PACs have now been embraced by liberals and Democrats. Obama's appearance caps what has been a gradual acceptance of such groups. In addition to the Senate Majority PAC, . Obama has committed to attend in events for the House Majority PAC, . which works to elect Democrats to the House. The super PAC announced . Tuesday that Obama will travel to New York to attend a fundraiser for . the group on July 17 and will also headline a San Francisco fundraiser . on July 23. Guests applaud as Obama as he spoke at New York's Gotham Hall about LGBT rights issues. The venue plays backdrop to the DNC's annual LGBT gala each year . White House spokesman Jay Carney said that while Obama participates in super PAC events, he does not actively solicit money for the groups. In Pittsburgh earlier Tuesday, Obama pledged to boost American manufacturing and to give entrepreneurs greater access to production tools that would help bring their ideas to fruition. Obama visited that venerable steel manufacturing city to showcase a workshop chain called TechShop, a variation on a tool lending library that provides high-end instruments to hobbyists, tinkerers and startup businesses to help them realize their innovations. The tour was designed to draw attention to Obama's own plan to make more government technology and assets available to the private sector. 'I can't rent the space shuttle out to you,' he joked. 'But there are areas where we can in fact enhance what is already being done by companies like TechShop.'","Addressed the state of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in New York on Tuesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . and Reuters . The military on Wednesday identified 17 of the 52 people onboard a C-124 Globemaster that crashed into a mountain outside Anchorage, Alaska, on Nov. 22, 1952. The crash site was rediscovered two years ago, and testing has confirmed the identities of about a third onboard. The military says the bodies of the other 35 crewmembers have not yet been recovered. Identified: Air Force Col. Eugene Smith is one of 17 bodies from the 1952 wreck that have been positively identified . Air Force Col. Noel Hoblit's remains also have been identified as one of the 52 people killed in the wreck . Lt. Col. Lawrence S. Singleton is one of three Army men who died in the crash to be identified .

Col. Lawrence S. Singleton, Pvt. James Green Jr., and Pvt. Leonard A. Kittle. Marine Corps Major Earl J. Stearns and Navy Commander Earl J. Stearns also have been identified. Wreckage: The wreckage was discovered Colony Glacier, about 50 miles east of Anchorage . Slow process: Recovery teams want the grinding glacier, as it moves over time, to reveal more relics over what is expected to be a years-long project . The 12 remaining servicemen were from the Air Force and have been identified as Col. Noel E. Hoblit, Col. Eugene Smith, Capt. Robert W. Turnbull, 1st Lt. Donald Sheda, 1st Lt. William L. Turner, Tech. Sgt. Engolf W. Hagen, Staff Sgt. James H. Ray, Airman 1st Class Marion E. Hooton, Airman 2nd Class Carroll R. Dyer, Airman 2nd Class Thomas S. Lyons, Airman 2nd Class Thomas C. Thigpen, and Airman 3rd Class Howard E. Martin. Relics from the plane first emerged last summer on Colony Glacier, about 50 miles east of Anchorage. That discovery, by Alaska National Guard crews flying training missions out of Anchorage, put into motion a sophisticated recovery program carried out by the Hawaii-based Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. SSG Alfonso Gacuson (left) and Dr. Greg Berg, members of a specialized recovery team with the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command assess evidence at a historic aircraft crash site at Colony Glacier, Alaska . After last year's initial work - when nearly everything that rose to the glacier's surface was picked up - the JPAC team came back this summer to collect additional relics pushed out of the ice since then. 'As the glacier melts and the glacier moves, more material comes up to the surface,' Dr. Gregory Berg, the forensic anthropologist who leads the team of specialists examining the crevasse-ridden ice field, told reporters at a news briefing at the time. Among the personal items collected from the crash site: A tiny fishing kit, a compass, a survival kit, a survival suit, a hockey puck, and a mini-box of Camel cigarettes. Those and other items are being saved for a future memorial, said Doug Beckstead, a historian at Anchorage's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Members of a specialized investigative team from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command wait as a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter comes in for a landing to transport them back to base . Berg and his team must tread carefully, skirting deadly crevasses and deep water-filled holes while trying to collect as many items and remains as possible. They want the grinding glacier, as it moves over time, to reveal more relics over what is expected to be a years-long project, but they do not want it to carry the items all the way into the terminus lake, where they would likely be lost forever. So far, only the lightest pieces have been pushed to the glacier's surface, and only a small portion of the 154-foot aircraft has emerged. 'We don't have all 52 guys lined up neatly, ready to be located,' Berg said. As the glacier melts and the glacier moves, more material comes up to the surface . The wrecked cargo plane, a C-124 Globemaster II, slammed into Mount Gannett in midwinter, an accident blamed on bad weather. Although officials knew the site of the crash, remoteness and winter weather made recovery impossible at the time. The wreckage was soon buried under snow and gone from sight. When finally spotted last year, the debris was 12 miles from the crash site, having been shifted by the glacier. The ice has flowed another 275 meters (902 feet) downslope since 2012, Berg said. For Alaska-based military members supporting the JPAC effort, there is another mission: removing the crash debris that is not useful to the investigation.","The C-124 Globemaster crashed into a mountain 50 miles from Anchorage in 1952 .

'Depraved': A depraved murder count often used in cases that suggest extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, however -- 25 years to life . Killer instincts? Lacey Spears, 26, is pictured with her 5-year-old son Garnett (right) who she's now accused of killing . Spears pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Tuesday and was being held without bail. A call to her lawyer, David Sachs, was not immediately returned. At Tuesday's hearing, Spears largely kept her head down as prosecutors laid out their case, reports lohud.com. And it all boiled down to one unthinkable accusation. 'This mother was intentionally feeding her son salt in toxic levels,' Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd said. The now childless woman spoke only the words 'Yes, sir' when asked if she was indeed Lacey Spears by New York state Supreme Court Justice Barry Warhit. After her . son's death, Spears has fled New York, where the Alabama native lived in . a 'fellowship community' of back-to-the-land types, for Kentucky. Her attorney David Sachs denied his client had anything to do with her son's death. 'Lacey is completely devastated by the loss of her son and absolutely denies harming her son in any way,' Sachs told FoxNews.com . Spears, . who at the time was living in Chestnut Ridge, brought her son to Nyack . Hospital in Rockland County on January 17, reporting he was having . seizures. On . January 19, with no medical explanation, Garnett-Paul's sodium levels . rose to an extremely dangerous level. Spears was sharing her son's . hospital room and prosecutors believe the mother administered sodium . through the boy's stomach tube. The . boy was transferred to the Westchester Medical Center. The Westchester . district attorney says doctors there suspected Spears was harming her . son and called New York state children's services, which launched an . investigation. Even . before he tragically passed, hospital officials told police that his . sodium levels were suspiciously high - which caused the investigation to . be opened into the Chestnut Ridge mother. Following this, police sought and obtained a search warrant for her home in mid-January. Too far: Spears allegedly sickened her son over and over in order to gain attention, but eventually went too far and lost her only child . They took food from her home, her cell phone and computer. They have also questioned Lacey Spears' friends and family and obtained Garnett's past medical records after discovering that he had been hospitalized 23-times during his short life. As the investigation continued, a neighbor who asked not to be named told USA Today that as Spears' son lay dying she asked her to go to her home and dispose of one of the boy's feeding bags - which allegedly contained a large amount of sodium. Police have not released why Garnet had a feeding tube - believed to be in his abdomen - but have pointed to his history of illness and repeated hospital visits. The neighbor who asked not to be named said that they did initially remove the bag - but then phoned the police and turned it over when they heard about the circumstances surrounding the boys death. Tragic: Garnett died of toxic levels of sodium. Doctors immediately became suspicious of his mother after discovering the extreme salt levels . Tragic: Lacey Spears is pictured with her son Garnett in hospital after he had been admitted with 'excessive' levels of sodium. He was dead four days after he was admitted . Those circumstances, it became clear all too late, were nothing new. The same questionable parenting and suggestions of the child-harming mental illness Munchhausen by proxy surrounded Garnett and his mom starting from just after the boy was born and across the states of Alabama, Florida and New York. The Florida Department of Children and Families revealed in April that they've had a file on Spears since 2011, when an anonymous call voicing concerns about her parenting was made to their abuse hotline. And prior to that, in 2009 while the family lived in Alabama, Garnett suffered severe seizures and had to be flown by helicopter to a Decatur hospital and resuscitated. The Journal News reported in April that the Florida agency is sharing all information they have on the mother with New York authorities. Munchausen by proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child — to get attention. 'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome. 'But medical child abuse can and does occur.' Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse. 1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally.'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said. 'A feeding tube is a real red flag.' 2) It is almost physically impossible to ingest or force feed a lethal does of salt. However, introducing it over time through a feeding tube is possible. 3) Feldman points out that those with Munchausen often exhibit pseudologia fantastica — compulsive lying - Spears told lies about her partner and about being a mother . 4) Exaggerated stories of their child being ill is another symptom - and in this case Spears obsessively detailed her child's illnesses online . People with the condition also have borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by problems with impulsive and reckless behavior, leading to unstable relationships. Signs of Munchausen by proxy can include: .","Prosecutors say Lacey Spears became so obsessed with attention she got from blogging about son Garnett's illnesses began to cause them herself .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Workers at the Phoenix VA Health Care System — where investigators say veterans' health was jeopardized when employees covered up long wait times for patients in order to receive bonuses for short wait times — received about $10 million in bonuses, newly released records show. Documents from the VA indicate than 2,100 employees got bonuses over the course of a three-year period. The records, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the bonuses kept increasing. Scandal: 1,700 veterans seeking treatment at the Phoenix VA hospital were at risk of being 'lost or forgotten' after being kept off the official waiting list . The records were first obtained by the Arizona Republic, which first requested them in March. The VA paid $2.5 million in 2011, $3.5 million in 2012 and $3.9 million last year. The merit-based bonuses were doled out to nearly 650 employees each of those years. The employees included doctors, nurses, administrators, secretaries and cleaning staff. 'The VA employee recognition and awards program provides an entire range of rewards to recognize employees who make contributions that support goals and objectives across the facility,' Phoenix VA spokeswoman Jean Schaefe said. A VA inspector general's report found that 1,700 veterans seeking treatment at the Phoenix VA hospital were at risk of being 'lost or forgotten' after being kept off the official waiting list. Leave: Director Sharon Helman and two others were placed on administrative leave last month following allegations that some veterans may have died waiting for appointments . Phoenix VA director Sharon Helman and two others were placed on administrative leave last month following allegations that some veterans may have died waiting for appointments and schedulers manipulated records. Helman, who earns $169,000 salary annually, had her $4,900 bonus from last year rescinded by federal VA officials. Helman was unable to be reached for comment on Tuesday. But she told The Associated Press the day she was put on leave that she was appalled by the idea she would manipulate wait times and put patient lives at risk to collect a bonus. Federal lawmakers are working on legislation that would ban bonuses at the VA. Ousted: The scandal at the VA hospital led to the resignation of former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki . 'It is highly disturbing that while patient care suffered, bonus pay skyrocketed. This must be the subject of a full investigation — in addition to the FBI investigation that is ongoing — and serves as another example of the systemic, cultural problem at the VA that must be addressed,' U.S. Sen. John McCain said. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee plans to conduct a hearing Friday on how bonuses are awarded to senior VA executives.","More than 2,100 employees were given bonuses over a three-year period .
The bonuses were merit-based .
It was revealed earlier this year that VA employees were keeping veterans off a waiting list to make it appear as though the wait time to see a doctor was shorter than it actually was .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A Pittsburgh police officer was put on desk duty after video surfaced showing him punching a woman at the city's gay pride parade and festival on Sunday. The officer, Souroth Chatterji, will remain on restricted duty for a month during an internal investigation, Mayor Bill Peduto said Monday. Chatterji said in a criminal complaint that he was trying to break up a fight when he grabbed the woman by the head and punched her in the side so he could handcuff her. Scroll down for video . Rough: Officer Souroth Chatterji is seen grabbing the woman by the head and punching her . Break it up: Chatterji says he was breaking up a fight between Lawther and a man protesting the LGBT parade . The officer said the woman, Ariel Lawther, 22, of Harmony, fought with him and kicked him in the groin, resulting in charges of aggravated assault and resisting arrest. She also was charged with simple assault for allegedly attacking a man the mayor said was with a group of people opposing the parade. Peduto said the episode began with 'comments from some of the folks who had gathered to oppose the parade.' Online court records don't list an attorney for Lawther. She doesn't have a listed telephone number and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her Facebook page, where a friend posted the brief video. Local media outlets like KDKA then showed the video on the air. The Delta Foundation, a local group that advocates for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals, asked police to investigate the officer's actions. Peduto said the city's Office of Municipal Investigations, which reviews cases in which citizens accuse police of misconduct, is probing the encounter. Attack: As Chatterji was breaking up the fight, he says Lawther attacked him and kicked him in the groin . Resisting: The officer claims Lawther was resisting arrest and he needed to get her out of the group so he could place her in handcuffs . Police also were trying to find additional video that might shed light on what preceded the arrest, Peduto said. The video, which depicts less than 10 seconds of the confrontation, appears to show the officer pulling Lawther by the hair and punching her in the side. In his complaint, Chatterji acknowledged he 'grabbed Lawther by the head and swung her out of the crowd' and that he later punched her 'in the left abdomen several times to distract her enough so I could handcuff her.' The mayor declined to say whether he believed the officer used excessive force, saying all he had seen was the brief video clip. 'I want to remain fair both to the officers and to the public. We will not delay this investigation, but I will not make any judgment until such time that OMI has had the opportunity to fully investigate,' Peduto said. Charged: Lawther has been charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest, simple assault and disorderly conduct . The Office of Municipal Investigations makes nonbinding recommendations for discipline, up to and including termination. The president of the police union did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the officer's behalf. The officer said in his criminal complaint that Lawther apologized to him afterward saying, 'I'm sorry I did not see you were a cop. I'm sorry I hit you.' The officer had warned Lawther 'not to be so physically offensive towards the demonstrators because she was clenching her fist and stating ""I'll (expletive) kill you'"" before she punched one of them, the complaint said. Lawther told police she didn't need medical help and the man she allegedly punched didn't wish to press charges, the complaint said.","Pittsburgh Police Officer Souroth Chatterji says he was trying to break up a fight between the woman and a man opposing the LGBT parade .

Iain Anderson, from Brisbane, Australia, filmed his daughter Hazel saying a line from the play in different locations over the course of 18 months. The two-and-a-half minute video opens with the famous line 'All the world's a stage' as Hazel plays on a roundabout. The camera then flicks to Hazel playing tabletop game Hungry Hungry Hippos as she declares: 'And all the men and women merely players.' Further scenes show Hazel in a location relevant to the line she is speaking. She holds open a door and says earnestly: 'They have their exits and their entrances.' Other shots feature Hazel in a variety of location from the middle of the sea to the school run. Hazel, who is a fan of literature, will have no trouble remembering the bard's lines as she will be able to link each place to a quote from the play.

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . Australia's Formula One rookie Daniel Ricciardo is earning almost 29 times less than his Red Bull teammate, Germany's Sebastian Vettel. Vettel came out number one on Business Book GP2014's list of highest paid Formula One drivers with an estimated salary of $31.7 million, belittling Ricciardo's pay check of $1.1 million - which put him 15th on the list. But the wages are not reflective of the current Formula One Standings where Ricciardo is in third place on 131 points, separating him from Vettel - in sixth place - by 43 points, according to News.com.au.

Per point Ricciardo is worth $8,369 compared to Vettel who costing Red Bull $360,227 every point he earns.In the earnings stakes, Spain's Fernando Alonso and Finland's Kimi Raikkonen shared the top spot with Vettel. This means Alonso is being paid out $275,652 per point by Ferrari while teammate Raikkonen is raking it in with each of his points worth $1.17 million. If this disparity in pay cheques causes any trouble between the teammates, it will not be the first time Vettel has caused a stir in the garage. Before Australian Mark Webber retired, Vettel usurped the veteran driver as number one driver for Red Bull. Ironically it now appears Daniel Ricciardo looks to do the same if his impressive performance on the Formula One Standings continue. The 25-year-old, from Perth, was promoted this season from Red Bull's secondary team, Scuderia Toro Rosso. His latest success was at the Hungarian leg of the Formula One Grand Prix where he took out first place.

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The Australian Government is looking at joining the U.S. in 'humanitarian airdrops' over northern Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says. It comes as the US airforce launched attacks on Saturday night on militants in the Middle East region where tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - were surrounded by Islamic State fighters who were threatening to kill them. 'We've been asked to consider participation in humanitarian airdrops,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Sydney. Tony Abbott says the Australian Government is considering humanitarian aid for people stranded in northern Iraq . 'This is a potential humanitarian disaster.' Islamic State is an extremist terror organisation, which is an off-shoot group of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda. Two of Australia's C-130 Hercules aircraft based in the United Arab Emirates could possibly be used to assist in drops of food, water and other humanitarian supplies on Mount Sinjar, where 40,000 Iraqis are trapped. Australia will be ready to assist within days should it be called to action. The US has already started making 'humanitarian airdrops' as northern Iraq continues to be overrun by Islamic State militants . 'We are looking to assist as quickly as we can,' Mr Abbott said. The prime minister said it was important Australia join international partners on helping stifle a potentially large-scale humanitarian disaster. He warned of the 'medieval barbarism' of the terrorist group Islamic State, formerly known as ISIL or ISIS in its efforts to set up a 'terrorist state'. 'This is designed to protect civilians from a murderous onslaught,' Mr Abbott said. It comes as the US started airstrikes targeting fighters of the Islamic extremist group on Saturday night . Tens of thousands of people are stranded in northern Iraq where Islamic State fighters are threatening to kill them . Mr Abbott also dismissed reports Australian warships could be used to allow American commanders to launch missile strikes. 'There's been no discussions along those lines whatsoever,' he said. It comes as the former Chief of the Australian Army, Peter Leahy, told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Abbott should feel compelled to act. 'As we look out from Australia, we can see chaos and unprecedented savagery in some of these lands, particularly in the ISIS groups in Iraq and Syria,' Mr Leahy said. 'How long can we sit back and watch this before we decide out of morality that we have to do something about this?'","Tony Abbott says the government is considering humanitarian airdrops .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The Newcastle Knights finally had something to smile about when a last-minute conversion saw them beat out the Melbourne Storm after a hellish season which has seen them lose 13 games, their 'super coach' and a team mate to a wheelchair. It was an emotional win for the Knights and it showed as they piled on top of each other in celebration on the field after Knights skipper Kurt Gidley slotted in a sideline conversion after the final siren at Newcastle's Hunter Stadium when team mate Akuila Uate dived over in the right-hand corner. It was a crushing blow for the Storm, who were leading 30-20 in the 77th minute when winger Sisa Waqa scored his fourth try. The Newcastle Knights had a triumphant win on Saturday night against the Melbourne Storm after a final conversion won them the game . Knights players could not hide their joy at the win after a tumultuous year for the club . With just under two minutes remaining, the Knights looked no hope of victory as Melbourne worked the ball off their own line. But the home side's Travis Waddell delivered a glimmer of hope when he stripped Billy Slater one-on-one in front of his posts and crossed under the posts. The horror year for the Knights started after rising star Alex McKinnon's career ended when he suffered a devastating spinal injury confining him to a wheelchair in March . It was from there the Knights were able to claw back the points, and deliver a 32-30 win. 2013 has been a tumultuous year for the embattled Newcastle Knights whose first blow of the season came in Round 3 of the NRL premiership series. In March, rising star Alex McKinnon's career ended when a horrific tackle during a clash against the Storm left him with a devastating spinal injury, which confined him to a wheelchair. More bad news followed when Nathan Tinkler relinquished ownership of the club in May after it emerged coach Wayne Bennett and players were not being paid on time, leaving the club in millions worth of debt - according to The Sydney Morning Herald. In a statement through Hunter Sports Group - owned by the mining magnate - Mr Tinkler rebuffed reports the club had liabilities amounting to $20 million and added it was 'substantially less' than the $10.5 million the group had in its coffers. But the final nail in the coffin came from 'super coach' Wayne Bennett who announced he would be leaving the Knights last month at the end of the season and return to the club where he won six premierships, the Brisbane Broncos. Of his decision to discontinue his post as coach after the change of ownership left him open to re-negotiate his contract, Bennett said the Knights were a long way from reaching a premiership and he was unable to commit to the number of years it would take to get them into that position. Akuila Uate's try at the final siren levelled the scores between the Knights and the Storm to 30 all . But it was Kurt Gidley's kick that won the conversion for the home side, bringing the final score to 32-30 . The bad year continued with mining magnate Nathan Tinkler ending his ownership of the Knights, sparking a re-negotiation of 'super coach' Wayne Bennett's contract - who decided to leave the club in July . 'I believe it will take a number of years to reach an acceptable position and that is what I am unable to commit to,' he said at the time of the announcement in a statement on the Newcastle Knights website. 'A longer term coach is crucial for future success.' His decision to end his tenure with the club came just days before Bennett revealed he had lost interest in football after Alex McKinnon's tragic accident. Fighting off tears during an interview with The Footy Show on July 17, the normally stoic coach said he cared about his players but 'didn't really care whether we won or lost' in the weeks after the 22-year-old was left unable to walk. 'Football was still important to me, but it wasn't that important,' he told the show's Erin Molan. Saturday night's game also saw Knights back-rower Chris Houston celebrate his 150th NRL game.","The Knights won 32-30 against Melbourne at Newcastle's Hunter Stadium .
