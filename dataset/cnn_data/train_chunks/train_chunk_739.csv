House prices have soared by record levels this month, adding to fears of a fresh property bubble. Booming demand, the Government’s Help to Buy scheme and a lack of available properties have helped push up the asking price of the average home by a record £2,406 in January – a month that usually sees prices fall. The average asking price in England and Wales is now £243,861, compared with £229,429 last January, according to leading property website Rightmove. Increase: The asking price of the average home has risen by a record £2,406 in January, it is claimed. The most expensive area is Knightsbridge and Belgravia in central London, with an average property price of £4.4million . And 43 areas of the country have seen average house prices break the £1million barrier, according to a second report. Some 34 of these elite areas can be found in London, with the remainder in commuter zones in Surrey, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The most expensive area is Knightsbridge and Belgravia in central London, which has an average property price of £4.4million. But the report from estate agents Savills and analysts Property Database also highlights hotspots in other parts of the country that are rapidly closing in on the £1million club. Rise: The average asking price in England and Wales is now £243,861, compared with £229,429 last January . These include rural parts of Oxfordshire, Hampshire and Winchester, as well as parts of Bath, Oxford and Cambridge. Prices in the Brendon Hills area of Somerset have tripled in ten years to more  than £800,000. According to the respected Rightmove House Price Index, asking prices on homes have risen by 6.3 per cent – or £14,432 – in the past year, marking the biggest annual increase since the start of the financial crisis in November 2007. Warning: Vince Cable has warned that the Government's Help to Buy scheme should be reassessed in light of London's 'housing boom' The 1 per cent rise this month will add to concerns that  the housing market is starting  to overheat. It comes as the boss of Legal & General, one of Britain’s biggest investment firms, became the latest senior business figure to call for the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to be scrapped in London, arguing that prices in the capital and the South-East have hit ‘absurd’ levels. Nigel Wilson said: ‘Help to Buy turbo-charges an already rising market inside London – stopping it would be economically sensible and help prevent the North-South divide getting even wider. ‘The Government should stop stoking up demand, there is already lots of demand and  this will create a bubble in  the future.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable has also warned that Help to Buy should be reassessed in light of a ‘raging housing boom’ in London. The launch of the scheme last year has boosted demand for homes by providing guarantees for those with smaller deposits and helping them get on the property ladder. This surge in demand helped drive the record 1 per cent increase in the asking prices between December 9 and  January 11. Usually prices fall in January  by an average of 0.2 per cent.","House prices have soared by record levels this month, it has been revealed .

Outspoken: Singer Morrissey, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating meat and paedophilia . Smiths singer Morrissey has said he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia. The incredible suggestion was shared in a Q&A session on his fan site - True To You. The site allows fans to submit questions to the singer and Morrissey is said to answer each one personally. On the site, Matthew from Preston asked, 'Knowing that you are a loyal and proud vegetarian, I would like to ask you what is it that motivated you to stop eating meat for good?' The answer read: 'If you have access to You Tube, you should click on to what is called The video the meat industry doesn't want you to see. 'If this doesn't affect you in a moral sense then you're probably granite. 'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia. 'They are both rape, violence, murder. If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away. 'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you ""Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life,"" well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.' Later, Paddy from Stockport asked: 'What achievement are you most proud of in your life?' He replied: 'Many people have told me that they stopped eating flesh because of something I said. I can't ask higher than that, and I wouldn't aim for higher than that. 'If you believe in the abattoir then you would support Auschwitz. There's no difference. 'People who would disagree with this statement have probably never been inside an abattoir.' Controversial: Morrissey added: 'If you believe in the abattoir then you would support Auschwitz' In another bizarre post, he wrote: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?' And then, on the topic of Cilla Black preparing a leg of lamb on television, he added: 'Since a lamb is a baby, I wondered what kind of mind Cilla Black could possibly have that would convince her that eating a baby is OK?' Morrissey also threatened to 'slip into permanent unconsciousness' if any journalist ever asked him again about the Smiths. The controversial singer has long been known as an animal rights activist. In November, he said he disapproved of the country's Thanksgiving holiday - renaming it Thankskilling. The outspoken star recently published his autobiography - which he insisted on being published in the Penguin Classics series.","Suggestions made in a Q&A session on Morrissey fan site True To You .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:01 EST, 17 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 18 January 2014 . Poisoned by carbon monoxide: Jeffrey Williams, 11, was found dead in room 225 of the Best Western Hotel because of a faulty pool water heater in June . The North Carolina mother who nearly died from a carbon monoxide leak in a hotel that claimed the life of her 11-year-old son spoke about the incident on ABC's 20/20 this week for the first time since the June 2013 tragedy. Jeffrey Lee Williams and his mother, 49-year-old Jeannie Williams were discovered unresponsive inside Room 225 of the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone at around 12.30pm on June 8. The woman pulled through and later woke up at Watauga Medical Center, only to learn that her young son has died from carbon monoxide poisoning. What the mother and son, in town to pick up Jeffrey's sister from a science camp, did not know when checking into the second-floor hotel room is that only two months earlier, an elderly couple had died there after being overcome by carbon monoxide gas seeping from a faulty pipe. Last week, Damon Mallatere, the president of the company that owns the Boone inn, was indicted by a grand jury on three counts of involuntary manslaughter and assault inflicting seriously bodily injury in connection to the deaths of Jeffrey Williams, Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72. In an exclusive interview with ABC's 20/20 airing tonight at 10pm, the boy's grieving mother said her last memory of her son is Jeffrey sitting on the edge of the bed and playing a game on his iPad. The following day, the family were supposed to pick up Mrs Williams' 17-year-old daughter from camp, but at night the woman felt nauseated and rushed to the bathroom. Scroll down to video . Final moments: Mrs Williams the said her last memory of her son is of Jeffrey sitting on the edge of the bed and playing a game on his iPad . Three people died last year from carbon monoxide poisoning after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina . ‘I knew where I was,’ Williams recalled. ‘I was on the floor, but my phone was plugged in by the bed. I knew I needed to get help... I remember [being] on the floor reaching and trying to get to the door to open the door, and I couldn't. I couldn't get it. And then that's the last thing I remember.’ The next morning, Williams' teenage daughter became concerned when her mother and brother had failed to turn up at the appointed time and called the hotel to inquire after them. A Best Western clerk went up to Room 225, where he discovered Jeffrey dead and his mother lying unconscious on the floor in the bathroom. ‘The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital room,’ Williams said. ‘I couldn't talk.’ Desperate to find out what happened to her son, Mrs Williams wrote a note to her husband, who then delivered the devastating news. 'That's when he told me that Jeffrey was with Jesus,' she said. Unbeknownst to Jeannie Williams and . her son, they were lodged in the same room where Washington couple Daryl and Shirley Mae . Jenkins were discovered dead from carbon monoxide poisoning on April 16. On a 911 tape, a concerned hotel clerk could be heard telling the dispatcher in June that the same thing happened just weeks earlier. Damon Mallatere's company owns the ill-fated Boone motel, which is part of an international franchise, where police say a faulty swimming pool heater allowed . carbon monoxide to seep into the motel room through a corroded pipe. Cursed room: Daryl and Shirley Mae Jenkins, and Jeanine and Jeffrey Williams were lodged in Room 225 (not pictured) of the Boone hotel about seven weeks apart . Equipment failure: Police said a faulty swimming pool heater allowed carbon monoxide to seep into the motel room through a corroded pipe propped up with a VHS tape . Mallatere’s attorney told the Charlotte Observer . last week that he was 'extremely disappointed' that charges have been . pressed against him instead of the gas company that converted the heater . from propane to natural gas. In . an interview with ABC, Mallatere said that he made the decision to . re-open Room 225 six weeks after the Jenkins couple's deaths because officials indicated to him that they had passed away from natural . causes. Dr. Brent Hall, Watauga County medical examiner, had a report on his desk . that explained the reasons for the Jenkins' deaths, however their . toxicology reports did not make it to Boone police until after Jeffrey . Williams died two months later. 'I don't know why they didn't expedite . them, but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide,' said Chief Police Officer Dana Crawford. When Jeffrey and his mother checked into the hotel, they did not know about the previous victims - nor did the police. Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning . Deja vu: On a 911 tape from June 8, a concerned hotel clerk could be heard telling the dispatcher that other guests had died in the room just weeks earlier . Dr Hall suddenly resigned in November but he has not answered questions about when he received the results. 'I can’t speculate as to why we . didn’t get them,' Police Chief Dana Crawford said, according to WSOC. Ms. Crawford said those documents could have saved the boy's life. 'I would like to think we would have . been able to conclude and find the source of that carbon monoxide, and . with that information, been able to rectify that whole situation before . this happened,' Ms Crawford said if her department knew . there was a carbon monoxide death in the room, they would have worked . with fire officials to find the leak. She said it took investigators just hours to trace it back to a pool water heater after Williams’ death. But just days after the elderly couple's death - and weeks before Jeanine and Jeffrey Williams checked into the hotel - there was another alarming incident suggesting that something was amiss. Serene Solinski hosted a birthday party at the hotel for her 13-year-old daughter and her friends. The guests were lodged in Room 325, located directly above the accommodations where Mr and Mrs Jenkins had died three days prior. In the course of the party, Solinksi recalled to ABC that most of the children became violently ill and were 'falling off like flies.' The troubled mother alerted the front desk and was assured that the general manager will be notified of the situation. Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter after three people died of carbon monoxide poisoning at a North Carolina hotel he owned . Mallatere has denied being told about Solinski's fraught stay by his staff. He also has told ABC that he did not know at the time that the hotel pool heater's exhaust pipe was severely damaged. ‘We never would've re-opened that room if we had any thoughts whatsoever that there was something wrong or that that would hurt somebody,’ Mallatare said. According to ABC, photos of the conduit show that it was riddled with holes and propped up with a VHS tape and an ice bucket. Mallatare pleaded not guilty and was released on $40,000 bond. He is expected to be arraigned February 17. Jeanine Williams believes that her son could have been saved had the hotel bothered to install carbon monoxide detectors. The family are planning to start a foundation encouraging hotels to install the life-saving devices and pushing for state laws that would make the detectors mandatory. Mrs Williams also hopes that in sharing her tragic story, she would raise awareness of the silent, odorless and colorless killer that has robbed her of her son. ‘One thing I'll never have… I won't have the mother and the groom dance,’ Williams said. ‘But I just take it one step at a time, and I just know I'll see him and I'll dance with him in heaven one day.’","Jeffrey Lee Williams, 11, died from carbon monoxide poisoning at the North Carolina motel last June .

ALSO: Arsene Wenger has given his clearest indication yet that he will sign a new deal at Arsenal. READ MORE HERE . Jose Mourinho says that he believes Manchester United, whom Chelsea face Sunday will sell Wayne Rooney this summer, but only to a club outside the Premier League. Also: The Association of Tennis Professionals, which runs the men's tour, is to discuss whether it needs to adopt a heat policy in the wake of the gruelling conditions that have dominated the first week of the Australian Open. Jose Mourinho expects Manchester United to sell Wayne Rooney to a leading foreign club if they cannot convince him to extend his stay at Old Trafford, with Chelsea resigned to missing out on the forward, given the champions' intransigence over conducting business with a direct Premier League rival. Also: Oh, England. So close. But still so very, very far away. There have been precious few moments of grace for England's cricketers over the past 11 weeks and they were denied one at the Gabba in the most agonising of circumstances as Alastair Cook and his team found a new and yet more painful way to lose a cricket match, snatching ignominious defeat from the jaws of what would have been a first international victory after 84 days of this traumatic tour. West Brom are in danger of losing a Â£3 million sponsorship deal if they do not sack Nicolas Anelka over his controversial 'quenelle' gesture. Also: Potential bidders looking to buy Southampton have already contacted the club at a time when the owner is adamant the players themselves are not for sale. Jose Mourinho has stoked tensions before Chelsea's encounter with Manchester United tomorrow by predicting that the Barclays Premier League champions will try to sell Wayne Rooney to an overseas club at the end of the season. Also: Like a car crash in the making, England are heading towards their worst run of results in international cricket. The opportunity squandered painfully at the Gabba yesterday represented an eighth successive defeat across formats. David Moyes has hit back at Jose Mourinho's jibes by insisting that Wayne Rooney will not be sold in the summer. Also: Alan Pardew has sentenced himself to community service - as penance for swearing at Manuel Pellegrini. West Bromwich Albion's sponsor, Zoopla, last night warned the club to axe Nicolas Anelka or risk their lucrative shirt deal being scrapped. Also: Sunderland have sacked their director of football, Roberto de Fanti, after a spell of less than seven months during which he oversaw a terrible summer recruitment drive that left the club with a weaker squad this season than the one that finished fourth from bottom last May. Wayne Rooney will be sold in the summer, according to Jose Mourinho. Also: Jose Mourinho has made a grovelling apology to David Moyes for sticking the boot into his rival. Jose Mourinho last night accepted Chelsea will never get Wayne Rooney - but believes he will be sold in the summer. Also: Andy Carroll last night revealed he would be heartbroken to miss this summer's World Cup finals.","Jose Mourinho claims Manchester United are ready to sell Wayne Rooney .

"By . Paul Bentley . and Laura Cox . PUBLISHED: . 18:38 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:49 EST, 14 January 2014 . Parents are losing control over what youngsters watch, experts have warned . Parents are losing control over what youngsters watch, experts warned yesterday. This is because tablets, phones and computers allow their children to see violence and pornography without their knowledge. Children as young as 12 are viewing vile and often illegal websites with their friends using the new technology which parents cannot track – although some would argue that parents should be stricter about leaving their children to view content unsupervised. This has left a generation . desensitised to the obscene language and sexual images which have become . the ‘wallpaper’ of children’s lives, said a report for the British . Board of Film Classification. Parents . said they worried about what children aged ten to 15 were now able to . view using phones, tablets such as iPads and computers -– even though in . many cases they bought the devices for them. They also expressed . concern about the surge in sleepovers, which often have little adult . supervision and allow children to watch films their parents would not . approve of. Children were also seen as desensitised to the sexualisation of young women. The . BBFC report said: ‘For many parents, technology is in the hands of the . young and the balance of power within the household has shifted.’ The Daily Mail has campaigned for an opt-in system of filters. The scheme, slowly being rolled out by the internet giants, would mean adults would actively have to ask for the household to have access to X-rated websites. Researchers for the BBFC questioned 10,000 people – including teenagers –  about the viewing habits of young people, for the report to accompany its new guidance on film classification. Children are viewing often illegal websites with friends using new technology like iPads . The British Board of Film Classification has also announced plans to clamp down on raunchy music videos in the UK. Videos made featuring artists such as Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Britney Spears could be targeted following the large-scale public consultation. The body said there are ‘special worries’ about sexual content in music videos. The vow to crack down on the videos came as the BBFC released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch. In its report it noted: ‘A specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content, where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls, and pornography. ‘The content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries.’ It also said the ‘sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern’. ‘Music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery, which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls’ emotional wellbeing and social development,’ the report said. ‘The overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity.’ ‘Parents are working hard to maintain . control, yet feel that the tide of information and challenging content . can sometimes be against them,’ the report said. ‘By . age 15, most parents argued that it was “game over” and they could no . longer control their child’s viewing. They were fairly pragmatic about . the way in which their children were viewing films – online, at friends, . illegally downloading.’ The fears raised in the report were echoed by Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. ‘Now so much viewing is done online. All it requires is for the viewer aged 15 to know what the parental lock password is and it’s very easy to get around,’ he said. ‘It is perfectly true that most children over 15 are very familiar and literate with digital distribution online and therefore for parents to control it is much harder.’ The BBFC report said that because children are now able to watch films using portable devices on their own in their rooms or with their friends, ‘childhood years and their innocence are felt to be under threat with children being exposed to age-inappropriate content... at an earlier age than ever before’. The results support the findings of the Bailey review in 2011, which said: ‘Children are under significant pressure to grow up at a faster pace than ever before. Mothers of girls were particularly sensitive to the increasingly sexual and sexualised culture that their daughters are growing up in and worry about the long-term impact on their development.’ Bad language was also a big concern with the shock value of four-letter words diminishing with each generation.","Tablets, phones and computers allow children to see violence and pornography without their knowledge .

The supermodel was spotted at the age of 14 by Storm Models founder Sarah Doukas at JFK airport, and the skinny south London schoolgirl has since become an international icon and household name.

A 66-year-old woman looking for love online ended up with a broken heart and bank account when she lost $500,000 to suitor on a Christian dating site. The San Jose divorcee met a Nigerian man on ChristianMingle.com falsely claiming to be Irish citizen 'David Holmes', according to the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office. Holmes said he worked on a Scottish oil rig, and his profile picture turned out to be a picture of a male model downloaded from the internet. The two never met in person, but talked over the phone and Holmes even sent the woman flowers. Scammed: A 66-year-old woman lost $500,000 to a man she met on ChristianMingle.com but was able to recover $200,000 . Eventually he convinced her to loan him $300,000 for his oil business - funds she supplied from her retirement account. After wiring him an additional $200,000 to a bank in Turkey, the woman got suspicious and informed the DA's office. Cherie Bourland of the elder fraud unit called the bank in Turkey and was successfully able to freeze the funds before Holmes' associate Wisdom Onokpite showed up to withdraw the money, according to CBS San Francisco. Onokpite was arrested by the Turkish National Police on suspicion of committing fraud. The DA's office traced Holmes to Nigeria - a 'hot bed of online scams' - and he remains free. While the woman was able to get her $200,000 back, Ms Bourland says there's just a '1 per cent' chance she'll recover the over $300,000 because 'it's just impossible to track down' and federal authorities won't investigate losses below $1million. Ms Bourland says reports of lost money on dating sites has been on the rise, especially among the elderly since 'studies show the ability to make financial decisions is the first to be affected by aging.' 'You get the love drug in you and you end up getting duped,' she told the San Jose Mercury News.","Con artist claimed to be 'David Holmes', an Irish citizen working on an Scottish oil rig .

A mother claims she has been forced to move into a tent because of a row over an unpaid council tax bill which has been going on for seven years. Marilyn Robinson-White, 64, thought she was exempt from paying because her husband was registered as disabled after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. She claims she has built up a £50,000 legal bill as she battles to avoid paying the £5,492 council tax. After a High Court hearing last week, she was evicted from her £200,000 home in Kempston, Bedfordshire, which will now be sold to cover the costs. Evicted: Marilyn Robinson-White and her daughter Sarah who are living in a tent on an allotment in Kempston, Bedfordshire, after losing a court battle over a £5,500 unpaid council tax bill . Evicted: Mrs Robinson-White, 64, claims that she has been left with a £50,000 legal bill following a seven-year legal battle . As a result, Mrs Robinson-White said she had no choice but to move into a tent on an allotment site close to her home with her daughter Sarah, who is aged in her 30s. She stopped paying her council tax in 2006 after her husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. She was acting as his full-time carer along with her daughter but he later died from his illness two years ago, she said. Mrs Robinson-White, who owned her property, still insists that she should never have had to pay the bill. 'It was an error by Bedford Borough Council, I was exempt from council tax as it was a disabled household,' said Mrs Robinson-White. 'But after many hearings it has come to this disastrous situation where I’ve had to leave my home. Homeless: Mrs Robinson-White and her daughter are living on an allotment site close to the end of the garden of their house which they have been evicted from . 'We know the neighbours are wondering what on earth is going on, but we don’t have time to be embarrassed. 'All I have ever wanted is an apology from Bedford Borough Council, not huge compensation or anything, just an apology. But I’ve lost my home and I’m going nowhere.' The council have offered to provide her support, but it is understood that she has rejected all offers of help. Neighbour Albert Freer said the local residents have been helping Mrs Robinson-White and her daughter by making them breakfast and providing them with hot water. He said: 'I went into the back garden and saw clothing hanging from the tree and umbrellas and when I asked them what they were doing they said they were camping as they had been evicted. Lost home: Mrs Robinson-White was evicted from this £200,000 home in Kempston, Bedfordshire, last week after losing her High Court battle . Campsite: This is the tent that Marilyn Robinson-White and her daughter Sarah have been sharing after being evicted from their home . 'It’s freezing outside and they are really vulnerable out there. A few of the neighbours have clubbed together and bought them a tent and a mattress and we provide them with hot water and toast in the mornings.' A spokesman for Bedford Borough Council said: 'There have been a number of court hearings in relation to this case and the court has overruled Mrs Robinson-White’s objections each time. 'The Magistrates’ Court has confirmed that Mrs Robinson-White was liable to pay £5,492 in Council Tax arrears which dates back to 2006, and is still outstanding. 'Mrs Robinson-White was declared bankrupt by the County Court on 14 October 2010. The costs of the bankruptcy have increased due to the cost of legal proceedings taken by Mrs Robinson-White, and are understood to be a significant amount. 'A Trustee in Bankruptcy has been appointed by the court to manage Mrs Robinson-White’s financial affairs and to raise funds to settle the outstanding debts, and it is the Trustee, not the Council, that has obtained a court order for possession of her property. 'On numerous occasions, the Council has offered advice to Mrs Robinson-White throughout this process, but she had chosen not to accept the advice provided and this has led to the current circumstances. Housing officers are still trying to offer help and provide advice.'

Addressing a Westminster correspondents' dinner in the House of Commons – held for the first time since 1974 – the Prime Minister gave a self-deprecating speech about his various encounters with journalists. But he finished on a serious note, recalling a trip he made to a Tamil newspaper in northern Sri Lanka at the end of last year while attending the Commonwealth summit. He said the stories of the reporters who had suffered violence and even the deaths of their colleagues had reminded him of the value of Press freedom. 'It was an incredibly powerful moment. It was a reminder of just how fortunate we are in this country to have a Press that is free, that is open, that is able to stand up to the powerful,' he added.

More than a dozen people were arrested Saturday protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating a homeless man to death. Hundreds of people took to the streets in Fullerton, California to protest the not guilty verdict but things took a turn for the worse after a local television crew was assaulted - that's when police busted up the demonstration by arresting 13 people. Fullerton Police, the target of the protests, moved in donning riot gear and ordered the crowd to disperse. Those who didn't were taken away by force. Angry: People protesting in Fullerton feel the police aren't innocent in the homeless man's death . Eventually dispersed: The protest was broken up after demonstrators turned violent - 13 people were taken away in hand cuffs . The 10 people who failed to comply were arrested, as well as the woman who assaulted the camera crew and two others for scrawling obscenities and anarchist graffiti on police property. The FBI is now investigating the evidence in the case to see if any federal laws were broken, according to KTLA. The demonstrators were incensed by the acquittals of Manuel Ramos and Jay Cicinelli, who were charged with the 2011 death of 37-year-old Kelly Thomas, a homeless man who died at a hospital five days after a violent struggle with police that was captured on videotape. The acquittals came despite what appeared to be damning footage of the officers continuing to beat Thomas as he screamed out for his father 30 times, begged for air and apologized.

Former Fullerton police officer Manuel Ramos was acquitted of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Former Cpl. Jay Cicinelli was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force. Thomas, 37, had a history of run-ins with police before the July 2011 confrontation. His father, Ron Thomas, said his son suffered from schizophrenia and didn't understand the orders from police. Prosecutors relied on grainy surveillance video at trial to show Thomas being struck, shocked by stun guns and restrained by officers. The 33-minute video showed six officers striking Thomas with their fists and knees, and shocking him with a Taser as he cried out for his father. A county pathologist concluded that Thomas died, in part, from a lack of oxygen to the brain caused by injuries received during the confrontation. Outside court, Thomas's parents condemned the verdict. 'Just horrified,' Cathy Thomas said. 'He got away with murdering my son. It's just not fair. So I guess it's legal to go out and kill now. He was so innocent. It just isn't fair at all.' Ron Thomas said the defense 'lied ... continuously' about his son's character, such as his drug use. 'It's carte blanche for police officers everywhere to beat us, kill us' because the verdict proves 'they'll get away with it.' Thomas was taken off life support five days after the July 5, 2011, scuffle with several officers. A third officer is awaiting trial. Three others were not charged. Four-term Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas tried the current case himself, a sign of its importance. Cause for doubt? Defense attorney Michael D.

Evidence: The surveillance video was key evidence at trial and was played repeatedly by attorneys for both sides.

They . told jurors that Thomas was not a helpless, homeless mentally ill man, . but a violent and dangerous person who had a history of drug use and was . homeless because he had attacked members of his own family. In one of . the most striking moments at trial, the defense put Thomas' mother and . maternal grandfather on the witness stand. A . tearful Cathy Thomas told the jury she had taken out a restraining . order against her son three years ago after he choked her for several . minutes during an argument. The grandfather testified that Thomas had . suddenly attacked him with a fireplace poker in 1995. Thomas pleaded . guilty to the attack and served nine months in jail. Only . a handful of police officers nationwide have been charged with murder . for actions taken while on duty and convictions in those cases are even . more rare, said Lawrence Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman . University School of Law and a former federal prosecutor. 'It's not unprecedented, but it's very rare,' he said. 'There's only a handful.' Eye for an eye? Defense attorney John D.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:01 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:57 EST, 30 October 2013 . The squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end, grim new figures revealed today. Disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession, with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people’s spending power. Instead bills for life’s essentials like housing, energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes, and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending. Squeeze: Household essentials like housing, and utility bills not account for 27% of incomes, up from less than 20% a decade ago . The Office for National Statistics warned the economic position of households ‘remains under pressure’. Disposable incomes grew even when Britain was plunged into recession in mid-2008, but have remained ‘broadly flat’ since the summer of 2009, despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then. The revelation will pile pressure on David Cameron and George Osborne, who have been attacked by Labour for overseeing a recovery not being enjoyed by everyone. In particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families. Unchanged: Since the end of the recession in 2009 disposable incomes have remained largely unchanged despite economy growth . Four of the Big Six firms have already . announced big price rises this winter. ScottishPower bills will go up . by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a . 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent . increase. Since 2003, the proportion of income used on ‘essential’ household goods has risen from 19.9 per cent to 27.3 per cent in 2013. Gas and electricity bills now account 3.1 per cent of household income, up from 1.8 per cent in 2003 ‘despite very little overall change in the volume of household energy consumption’, the ONS said. The squeeze on incomes has added to the slow recovery, because a lack of spending has failed to provide a boost to shops and businesses. Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . The ONS added: ‘While the majority of this increase has been in the cost of housing – which has increased from 14.7 per cent to 20.6 per cent between 2003 and 2013 – there have also been increases in the proportion accounted for by gas, electricity and water & sewerage. ‘The rise in these proportions has the effect of reducing household budgets for spending on other goods and products.’ TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Today’s figures confirm that households are not benefiting from the recovery. ‘Growth matters because it raises people’s living standards. But this basic rule has been broken under an austerity-obsessed government. ‘Most people will not feel as if we are in recovery if all the gains from growth are hogged by the same old elites, at the cost of ordinary families. ‘The government must wake up and start tackling our cost of living crisis. It can start by taking on the excessive profits of the big energy firms that have pushed energy bills up so much that households are now spending more on gas and electricity than they are on filling up the car.’","Housing, utility bills and petrol now account for 27% of household incomes .

An overweight man with a knack for keeping a football in the air has become the latest internet sensation after footage showing him playing keepy-uppy were posted online. The 46-second clip, apparently taken on a mobile phone, shows the man uses his head, knees and shoulders to keep the football up in the air as he practises on a rain-soaked patch of tarmac near the docks in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire. And today the man, who was identified as Andrew Cassidy, 50, said he had been invited to Dubai to take part in the World Freestyle Football Championships after the footage was spotted online. Scroll down for video . Andrew Cassidy, 50,  has been practising for years but has now caught the eye of football freestyle officials . Mr Cassidy has been a well-known figure in the Welsh town for more than a decade, but when new footage showing him keeping the ball up for nearly a minute was posted on the Spotted: Milford Haven Facebook page at the weekend, his reputation went global as football fans the world over marvelled at his skills. The clip shows him giving an impressive display likened by one website to that of footballing legend Diego Maradona, rolling the ball around his neck and shoulders without touching it. The footage, which is set to Rihanna singing We Found Love, was filmed near the docks in Milford Haven by some passers-by who spotted him from their car. Initially people assumed it was a hoax or a clever marketing stunt, but this afternoon Mr Cassidy spoke out about his hidden talent. He said: 'It's crazy to think that so many people have seen my skills - this is just what I do.  Sometimes kids will have a kick around with me but they always leave after I've shown them up.'

The divorced mother of two fell on a kerb while helping him look for burglars at the garage in August last year, hurting her left leg and right wrist. After her astonishing claim became public, her own Chief Constable, Phil Gormley, criticised it as ‘surprising and disappointing’. PC Jones is pursuing both claims.

Police have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are: . COMMENT by BRIAN PADDICK Former Deputy Met Assistant Commissioner . Analysis: Brian Paddick, Former Deputy Met Assistant Commissioner . The news that a police officer is suing someone who called for help will be met with astonishment among members of the public and incredulity among many of her fellow officers, particularly those of my vintage. An increasing number of people are reluctant to call for assistance because they do not believe the police will be able to do anything. Now they could also be concerned that the officers might end up suing them. How did we get to this desperate state of affairs? In the mid-Seventies when I started out on my police career, if you stumbled over a step or uneven paving slab, colleagues would say, ‘Enjoy your trip? Send us a postcard next time!’ There was no question of suing anyone, even if sometimes there may have been good reason. After the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival riot, we began public order training. Our riot helmets were reinforced cork and plastic and we used real bricks in training. Inevitably a colleague got a brick square on the badge on the front of his helmet and the pin holding it in place went straight into his forehead, blood streaming down his face. To complain would have been seen as being a sissy, to sue unthinkable. But the officer was allowed as much time to recuperate, on full pay, as he wanted. The helmets were soon replaced with proper Nato-style crash helmets and wooden blocks replaced the lumps of brick. A sign that things were changing came a decade later, when I responded to an ambulance crew’s call for assistance. I ended up rolling around on the pavement with the drunken man who had attacked them. When he had sobered up, he made a formal complaint and an investigation was launched. In interview, I was asked whether I had suffered any injury during the fight, to which I replied: ‘Not really, just a few scratches and grazes to my hands.’ The final report found I had not acted unreasonably, but I received a formal disciplinary finding against me for not recording the scrapes as an injury on duty. In those days, police officers who performed acts of bravery were praised by their bosses without hesitation. But in 2003 a serving and former Met Commissioner faced trial under the Health And Safety At Work Act after two officers in separate incidents fell through roofs while chasing suspects; one officer sadly died and the other was seriously injured. While the Commissioners were not convicted, the police attitude to acts of bravery changed. Among other things, officers were told that they must not climb over a certain height, even if chasing a criminal or trying to save a life. I remember in 2005 attending a Commissioner’s Commendation ceremony at New Scotland Yard. As a video shot from a police helicopter showed officers chasing suspects across steeply sloping rooftops, the senior officers in the audience sat ashen-faced, petrified that someone would report them to the Health and Safety Executive. Police officers have got to realise that policing is a potentially dangerous business. Part of the thrill of being an operational officer is never knowing what is around the next corner or what challenge is going to face you. Officers are protected by the courts, often being awarded damages against those who assault them as part of the criminal sanction passed by the judge. The bottom line is, police officers are protected financially from the kind of injury that the officer who tripped up the step at the filling station claims to be suffering from. Nothing should get in the way of victims calling the police. Pain and a damaged ego are part of the job and, as we used to say: ‘If you can’t take a joke, you shouldn’t have joined.’","WPC Kelly Jones's police car skidded off the road as it pursued another vehicle and she is now suing her police force .

"By . James Chapman . and James Salmon . and Hugo Duncan . PUBLISHED: . 18:51 EST, 15 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:25 EST, 15 January 2014 . Bank of England governor Mark Carney last night dismissed proposals to cap bankers’ bonuses as ‘crude’ measures that will fail. He said it would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay as they sought to keep hold of high-flying executives. His comments came amid speculation that the Royal Bank of Scotland wants to give senior staff bonuses worth twice their salaries. Mark Carney: The Bank of England chief says a bonus cap won't cut pay packages as it would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay as they sought to keep hold of high-flying executives . And it is an embarrassing blow to Ed Miliband after Labour yesterday called on the Government to reject any request to pay higher bonuses at RBS – which is still partly taxpayer-owned. A new bonus cap introduced this year by Brussels restricts banks in the EU from paying more than one year’s salary as a bonus, rising to two times salary if shareholders approve. Mr Carney, who did not mention RBS by name, told MPs yesterday that he ‘absolutely’ agreed that the ‘crude bonus cap’ proposal backed by Labour was not the best way to rein in excessive pay. He said that after making ‘many . mistakes’ over pay and bonuses in the years leading up to the financial . crisis the UK now has now developed a ‘hard touch’ approach. Giving . evidence to the Treasury select committee, he said capping bonuses . would push up basic pay as banks attempted to keep hold of its most . highly prized staff. The Governor said the move would undermine efforts to ensure that large amounts of pay in the form of bonuses were deferred for five years or longer, paid in shares rather than cash, and were able to be clawed back if things went wrong. ‘It takes back some of the advantages of the approach that we have had because it will incentivise more cash compensation today – exactly the type of problem we had before – that we can’t claw back,’ MPs were told. ‘We would rather see more deferral, more equity [share-based payout] and this ability to take it back when those risks come to light.’ Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘These European rules will not lead to bankers being paid less. ‘What they will lead to is a Fred Goodwin-style situation where you will not be able to get money back off bankers when things go wrong. This is precisely what we have been trying to get away from in Britain.’ Mr Carney’s comments come after David Cameron told the Commons that there will be a £2,000 cap on bonuses paid in cash at RBS this year, following its introduction in 2013. He also said the Government would use its position as the bank’s main shareholder to block any increase in the overall amount paid out in salaries and bonuses. But he refused to rule out bonuses worth up to double an executive’s pay, as long as they are paid in stock and shares designed to deter the short-term risk-taking. Taxpayers own 80 per cent of RBS, meaning the Chancellor can prevent this from happening. RBS has not yet lodged a request for the higher bonus cap. It is discussing the matter with investors including UKFI, the arms-length body set up by the Government to manage taxpayers’ stakes in bailed out banks. Any request will have to be put to the vote at RBS’s annual meeting with shareholders in Edinburgh  in May. Mr Cameron said: ‘I can confirm today that just as we have had limits on cash bonuses of £2,000 at RBS this year and last year, we will do the same next year as well. ‘If there are any proposals to increase the overall pay, that is pay and bonus bill at RBS, at the investment bank, any proposals for that, we will veto it.’ A Downing Street source said the . total package of pay and bonuses at RBS had halved under the coalition . Government, from £3billion in 2009 to £1.4billion in 2012 – although . this is partly because its investment banking division is far smaller. Quarrel: David Cameron refused Ed Miliband's call  to . cap individual bank bonuses, but said he would use the Government’s . powers to block any rise in the overall pay pot at RBS’s investment arm . The source added that given every household had been forced to contribute £5,000 to bail out the banking giant, the top priority had to be ensuring they got the money back by returning it to the private sector. But Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, criticised the announcements. He said: ‘David Cameron has refused to rule out approving bonuses of up to 200 per cent at RBS. It looks like he and George Osborne would approve such a request at a time when ordinary families face a cost-of-living crisis and bank lending to businesses  is falling.’ Rob MacGregor, of the trade union Unite, said: ‘The Chancellor must not rubber stamp the corporate greed at Royal Bank of Scotland. If he looks the other way as the top bankers pat each other on the back and fill their boots hard working people across the country will be appalled.’ Chairman of the Treasury committee, Andrew Tyrie MP, said there should be no political interference in RBS. ‘RBS should be run on commercial grounds. Were decision-making at RBS to be subordinated to political considerations, it would be bad for the bank, bad for the taxpayers’ stake in the bank and bad for the wider economy,’ he said. ‘The structure and scale of remuneration in banking have incentivised misconduct and excessive risk-taking. ‘Risk and reward must be much more closely aligned, as the Banking Commission recommended. ‘The Governor of the Bank of England today agreed with the Banking Commission’s conclusion that a crude bonus cap is not the answer... the structure of remuneration is more important than the absolute level and that more deferral in variable pay is required.’","Mr Carney said a cap would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay .

They accuse Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, of corruption and say they want her to step down to make way for an unelected 'people's council' to push through broad political reforms. She has called an election for Feb. 2 and now heads a caretaker administration, but the protesters and opposition parties are boycotting the vote and want her to go immediately. The protests have been relatively peaceful until now, but sporadic flare-ups between protesters, police and government supporters have left eight people dead and scores injured. The demonstrations are the biggest since pro-Thaksin protesters paralysed Bangkok in April-May 2010. That movement ended with a military crackdown and more than 90 people, mostly protesters, were killed during the events. The stock market fell on Friday as investors cut some risk exposure after the blast and was down 0.5 percent at the end of trading. The baht currency also fell but was a shade higher on the day. Foreign Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul earlier said it was 'about time' to take back control of Bangkok and that a delegation of officials, escorted by police and troops, would make a start by going to a government office that issues passports to try to persuade the protesters to let work resume.

The turmoil is the latest episode in an eight-year conflict pitting Bangkok's middle class and royalist establishment against poorer, mainly rural supporters of Yingluck and Thaksin. That support has enabled him or his allies to win all elections since 2001 and Yingluck's Puea Thai Party seems certain to win the upcoming vote. The government says it must be held on Feb. 2 as parliament has been dissolved and the date endorsed by the king. Reuters reporters said at least 2,000 protesters in pickup trucks and vans headed towards a printing works north of the central Bangkok, saying it was producing ballot papers and claiming it would be printing far more than were needed. Speakers at protest sites across central Bangkok have suggested that Yingluck is worn out and eager to quit, but at a news conference on Friday, the prime minister maintained she still enjoyed overwhelming popular support. As the deadlock between the government and protesters drags on, many Thais believe the military could step in to break the impasse, especially if the protests turn more violent. The army has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy but has tried to remain neutral this time. The security forces have largely kept out of sight since the blockades began this week, with the government reiterating on Friday it was keen to avoid any confrontation.","Violence rippled through the Thai capital after several days of relative calm .

Police are investigating a fatal shooting just outside the Occupy Oakland encampment in Northern California and the apparent suicide of a military veteran at an Occupy encampment in Vermont's largest city. The Oakland killing is further straining relations between local officials and anti-Wall Street protesters. A preliminary investigation into the gunfire Thursday that left a man dead suggests it resulted from a fight between two groups of men at or near the camp on a plaza in front of Oakland's City Hall. The Oakland death is the latest in a string of violent outbursts and disease outbreaks in Occupy protests throughout the country, coming the day after a 35-year-old veteran shot himself at the protest in Burlington, Vermont. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fatal: Medics try to revive a man shot at the Occupy Oakland protest Thursday, before he was transported to hospital and pronounced dead . Mystery: The Oakland shooting is still under investigation and police are looking for suspects but have not announced any clues to the public . As the varying protests continue throughout the country, the potential for violence in the camps and the spread of disease among groups of people living in unsanitary conditions spreads. Tuberculosis has been traced to the base of the Occupy protests in Atlanta, Georgia. The deaths in Oakland and Burlington are causing alarm among organizers and attendees. Investigators do not yet know if the men in the Oakland fight on Friday were associated with Occupy Oakland, but they are looking into reports that some protest participants tried to break up the altercation, police Chief Howard Jordan said. Mourning: Little is known about the Oakland shooting but onlookers said that they saw the two men involved in a verbal fight before one shot the other . Occupy grief: Police have yet to identify the victim officially . With opinions about the ongoing demonstration and its effect on the city becoming more divided in recent days, supporters and opponents immediately reacted to the homicide — the city's 101st this year. Camp organizers said the attack was unrelated to their activities, while city and business leaders cited the death as proof that the camp itself either bred crime or drained law enforcement resources. Mayor Jean Quan, who has been criticized by residents on both sides for issuing mixed signals about the local government's willingness to tolerate the camp, issued a statement Thursday calling for the camp to shut down. 'Tonight's incident underscores the reason why the encampment must end. The risks are too great,' Quan said. 'We need to return (police) resources to addressing violence throughout the city. It's time for the encampment to end. Camping is a tactic, not a solution.' Tragic: Paramedics rush an ex-soldier to hospital yesterday after he apparently shot himself at the Occupy Vermont encampment in Burlington . Shock: A police officer questions a distraught witness at the Occupy Vermont camp . Investigation: Police look inside the tent where the military veteran was found with a gun shot wound . 'This one heinous immoral crime should not overshadow all of the good deeds, positive energy and the overall goals that the movement is attempting to establish,' Khalid Shakur, 43, who has a tent in the encampment, said. Before the shooting, protesters were planning to have a party to commemorate the encampment's one-month anniversary with music, dancing, a slide show and donated cakes. Instead, they opened a microphone for participants to talk about where the movement is headed. 'It's not a celebration anymore, but a period of reflection,' said Leo Ritz-Barr, a member of Occupy Oakland's events committee. Consolation: Amanda Thayer, 29, is comforted by a friend in the aftermath of the shooting . John Lucas, 52, part of an Occupy Oakland medic team, said a fistfight involving several men preceded the gunfire. 'Several people went after one guy, and the group got larger, and they beat him and he ran,' Lucas said. 'There were six or seven shots. Everyone starts running ... and there was another shot.' Lucas said he and other medics rushed to the wounded man and tried to tend to him until paramedics arrived. 'He was not breathing and there was no heartbeat,' he said. 'We started CPR.' A health scare hit Occupy Atlanta protesters this week after their home base tested positive for tuberculosis. Residents at the homeless shelter, where protesters are gathered after being moved from the nearby Woodruff Park, have contracted the drug-resistant disease. But tests for tuberculosis carried out on activists yesterday came back negative. Occupy Atlanta leader Tim Franzen said: 'We have gone as far as having our folks get tested today for TB... No trace of any TB at all.' Mr Jordan said the victim was hit by one bullet and he was pronounced dead at a hospital. No suspects have been identified, said Jordan, who asked people participating in the protest who may have taken photographs or video that captured the shooting to contact authorities. Though investigators in Burlington, Vermont have concluded preliminary investiations into the apparent suicide there. saying that the  35-year-old military veteran fatally shot himself in the head Thursday at an Occupy Wall Street encampment. The name of the Chittenden County man is being withheld because not all of his family has been notified. He shot himself inside a tent in City Hall Park. Mike Noble, a spokesman for the Fletcher Allen Health Care hospital in Burlington, confirmed that the man had died. Noble said he could provide no other details. Infested: Unsanitary conditions have caused the spread of disease, and while some camps offer flu shots, many protesters are not participating because they fear it is a government ploy . Emily Reynolds, a University of Vermont student and a leader in the local Occupy movement, said: 'This person has clearly needed more help than we were capable of giving him here at this park.'

In addition to the tuberculosis outbreak in Atlanta, protesters in the original outpost near Wall Street are catching what they have called 'Zuccotti Lung,' named after the park that serves as the base. Respiratory illnesses like norovirus and the flu are easily spread among the protesters as they share drinks and cigarettes, and have little opportunity to wash their hands.

With huge annual tuitions, multibillion-dollar endowments and long lists of powerful graduates working on Wall Street and in Washington, schools like Harvard and Yale embody the kind of institutions the Occupy movement – with its opposition to undue influence by those in the top tiers of society – was born to protest, but that has not stopped the students from joining in. At Duke University in Durham, N.C., for instance, a small group of students has camped out for three weeks. On Wednesday night at the University of California at Berkeley, dozens were arrested during demonstrations against financial policies they blamed for causing deep cuts in higher education spending. And in Harvard Yard on Wednesday, protesters gathered in front of the statue of school namesake John Harvard, calling for 'a university for the 99 percent'. A few dozen students then set up tents and stayed overnight, though police stopped any non-students from joining them. Students urged a fair contract for custodial workers at Harvard, argued that it played a role in the financial crisis because of its influence, and should be socially responsible in its endowment investments. 'Harvard should reconsider its status as the training ground for the people who make our political and economic systems less democratic,' said Joe Hodgkin, a senior who has led meditation sessions at Occupy Boston. Last week, students walked out of a popular introductory economics class, complaining of bias. The actions have drawn plenty of skeptics, even at the schools themselves. On Wednesday, Harvard students in nearby dorms yelled derisively at the protesters, while another said the yard into which police had locked students was 'the richest prison in America'.

Political heavyweights are to be ordered to measure their waistline in an attempt to get Parliament to set an example to the nation. A letter backed by ministers is to be sent to every MP and peer urging them to check that their waist is less than half their height - a key indicator of having a healthy weight. Former surgeon Lord McColl of Dulwich is now stalking the corridors of power to put pressure on Labour, Tory and Lib Dem members who accuses of ‘eating too much of the gross national product’. Strain: It is claimed the green benches of the Commons and the red benches of the Lords are straining under the weight of gluttonous politicians . The government has warned that Britain has even fallen behind the US in failing to deal with the  obesity crisis. Scientists say that by 2050, half of women, almost two-thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese. But earlier this week the National Obesity Forum said these predictions were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’. Lord McColl, a former professor and director of surgery at Guy's Hospital, London, said that the rise in obesity is ‘the worst epidemic for 90 years and the cure is free’. Lord McColl insists he ‘easily’ meets the target, and credits it to a former patient. As . a surgeon in his forties he was on his way to a black tie event, . wearing a second-hand - and rather tired - dinner suit when he was called . to hospital. He was asked . to see a patient with an inoperable tumour, who urged him to operate and . promised to make him a new suit if it worked. ‘She . survived another seven years and during that time she made me a black . tie outfit so I have to stay in the same shape in tribute to her,' he revealed. He now plans to write to all 650 MPs and 830 peers telling them to get a grip on their expanding waistline. Lord McColl told MailOnline: ‘I will be sending the letter and asking them to measure their waist and height and if their waist is more than half  their height they have a problem. ‘I have been talking about this now for years, trying to get them interested. ‘Hopefully one day it will click. As I walk down the corridors of Parliament now they see me coming and tighten their jackets and say “I am trying”. ‘They are eating too much of the gross national product.’ Lord McColl said overweight politicians could not be seen lecturing the public on their eating habits. ‘I think the whole nation is at fault. We have got to get the whole nation moving on this. ‘It looks bad if politicians are telling the people what to do and they are not doing it themselves.’ The letter has been backed by health minister Earl Howe, who said he supported ‘any measure that encourages us all to improve our diet, to reduce physical inactivity and to be aware of what we need to do to keep our weight under control’. MPs complain that they have piled on the pounds after being elected to the Commons. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has been the butt of many jokes about his size, once boasted that his secret to trying to lose weight was  ‘no cheese, no chips, no seconds’. It came after Nick Clegg said Mr Pickles was the ‘only Cabinet ¬minister who you can spot on Google Earth’. Most senior politicians face pressure to keep their weight under control. Mr . Clegg claims to have lost a stone after taking up kick-boxing, after . pictures of his paunch on holiday in Spain triggered headlines asking . 'who ate all the paella?' David . Cameron is often seen jogging in Westminster and at Prime Minister's .

Andrew Lansley, when Health Secretary, admitted that he was overweight and borderline obese. Speaking . in May 2012 he said that at 6ft 1in and just over 15st, he had a Body . Mass Index of 28. A ‘healthy’ BMI score – used by doctors as a . height/weight ratio – falls between 18.5 and 25. But Lord McColl argues that the waist-height ratio is a better gauge of unhealthy fat around the stomach. Some find the struggle to shed the pounds so great they have signed up to Parliament’s very own slimming club. Members . the Weight Watchers group include former Culture Secretary Dame Tessa . Jowell, former Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart, Tory MPs Ian . Liddell-Grainger, Caroline Nokes and Lorraine Fullbrook and several . peers. The fifteen women and five men get free membership, saving them £235-a-year each. Former Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell is a member of parliament's WeightWatchers group and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott has spoken of his battle with bulimia . Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson, father of TV chef Nigella, wrote his own weight loss guide  - The Nigel Lawson Diet Book - which helped him to shed five stone in a year. Tory MP Nadine Dorries said one of the reasons she took part in ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here was to lose weight. Former Tory minister Anne Widdecombe went one better, losing 18 pounds over six months as a contestant on Celebrity Fit Club. In 2008 former Labour Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott confessed to suffering from an eating disorder. Explaining . his battle with bulimia, he revealed he would 'sup a whole tin of . condensed milk', eat trifles 'forever' and gorge at his local Chinese . restaurant before vomiting. Experts claim the waist-to-height ratio is a better measurement of health . Health experts now believe that central obesity (fat round the mid-section) is increasing at a faster rate than general weight. So relying solely only on Body Mass Index . (BMI) may provide inaccurate estimates of the childhood obesity epidemic, according to new research by Leeds . Metropolitan University, published in Public Health journal. Fat around the stomach is thought to be . riskier than elsewhere on the body because it has a more direct effect . on vital organs. Yet BMI, which compares weight with height, does not . take into account where on the body fat is found. Tummy fat produces more . dangerous chemicals, and it is also closer to the body’s vital organs . than flab on the bottom, hips and thighs. A staggering 60 per cent of teenage girls are obese by the time they reach 16, according to research that measures waistlines rather than BMI. The . waist of the average 15-year-old girl has expanded nearly 13cm (5in) in . the past two decades, according to a study which finds that many . children are even fatter than previously thought.","Former top surgeon Lord McColl to issue blunt warning to colleagues .

Friends of John Bercow last night said they feared renewed strains in his marriage to wife Sally may have led to a series of volcanic outbursts at MPs from the Speaker’s Chair. Mr Bercow’s fragile relations with Conservative MPs have been stretched to breaking point after the series of spectacular clashes in recent weeks. It has led to rumours at Westminster that frustration over his marriage has spilled over into his job of chairing Commons debates. An official close to the Speaker last night insisted there was ‘no truth’ in the reports and said the couple were still together at their grace-and-favour residence overlooking the Thames. However, it is not the first time the Bercows’ marriage has been thought to be under strain, with reports of the couple being overheard shouting and arguing with each other. Until a few weeks ago, the tall figure of Mrs Bercow was a familiar sight in the Palace of Westminster – either walking with her husband or driving to and from their apartment. But MPs say they have not seen the mother of three around the Commons for weeks and claim her apparent absence has coincided with increasingly ‘eccentric’ behaviour from her husband in the Speaker’s Chair – with Tory MPs bearing the brunt. A series of explosions last week began when he bawled out mild-mannered Bridgwater and West Somerset Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger for apparently heckling a Labour MP. Aggressive: Speaker John Bercow has been erupting with anger more regularly in the Commons recently . Mr Bercow yelled: ‘Be quiet, and if you cannot  be quiet, get out. You are adding nothing, and you are subtracting a lot. It is rude, it is stupid, it is pompous and it needs to stop.’ But to the Speaker’s embarrassment, Tory Minister Alan Duncan owned up that he was the heckler, with Mr Liddell-Grainger the innocent party. The eruption was followed up two days later with a withering rebuke of Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over his handling of a Commons statement on Territorial Army reforms. To the fury of Mr Hammond’s  colleagues, Mr Bercow accused the Minister of ‘utter incompetent’ and ‘woefully inadequate’ behaviour. One senior Tory MP said: ‘I wouldn’t talk to my dog the way Bercow spoke to Hammond.’ But unabashed, the Speaker later that day reignited his long-running feud with Tory Transport Minister Simon Burns after Mr Burns clashed with Labour MPs who were heckling him. Happier times: John and Sally at his victorious election count when he was re-elected as MP for Buckingham in 2010 . A furious Mr Bercow accused Mr Burns of hypocrisy and said he was a ‘slow learner’ who had to ‘raise his game’. The previous week, Tory MPs claim the Speaker failed to discipline a Labour MP who allegedly made an offensive gesture to Chancellor George Osborne during his statement on the spending review. Witnesses say Tory backbencher Jason McCartney wrote the name of the offending Labour MP on a note and handed it to the Speaker only to see Mr Bercow rip it up in front of him. The Speaker’s office said they had found ‘no evidence’ of a Labour MP behaving in this manner.","The Bercows’ marriage is thought to be under strain .

A Cleveland cheerleader has made a swift recovery from spinal surgery after an inspirational fight to get back to practice. High school senior Courteney Belmonte, from Westlake, Ohio was diagnosed with scoliosis in sixth grade and was told her best option was surgery. She was given a year to make a full recovery, but Miss Belmonte managed to get an all-clear after just six months of rehabilitation. Three cheers: High school cheerleader Courteney Belmonte was so determined to return to her squad that she made a full recovery from spinal surgery in just six months . Miss Belmonte was devastated when she found out her spine problem required surgery, fearing that she would never be able to cheerlead again. After undergoing orthopaedic surgery which saw her curved spine fused together using bone grafts and metallic implants, she was told it would take about a year until she could make her comeback on the field. However, Miss Belmonte, a varsity cheerleader at Westlake High School, resolved to do it quicker, and six months after the surgery she was back in the gym. 'I just think never give up on something . you really want,’ Miss Belmonte told Cleveland.com. ‘[Getting the all . clear] was probably one of the greatest feelings in the world.’ Spinal issue: Scoliosis (this is not an image of Courteney's condition) means that the spine is curved instead of straight . ‘Courteney is an exceptional young lady,’ paediatric orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Ryan Goodwin at the Cleveland Clinic told Cleveland.com . ‘Rather than give up and accept that she may never tumble again, she worked exceptionally hard during her recovery and returned to her activity at an even higher level.

A collective sigh of relief was heard throughout the world last night as Rosetta woke from its two-and-half-year slumber. The probe creaked into action 500 million miles from Earth at 10am yesterday, taking an agonising eight hours to let Earth know that it was ok. ‘That last quarter of an hour was one of the toughest of my life,’ mission director, Paolo Ferri told MailOnline. ‘I never want to do it again.’ Scroll down for videos... Rosetta was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov/Gerasimenko. it is due to arrive at the comet in August this year . Rosetta, . named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient . Egyptian hieroglyphs, will seek to help scientists unlock the . composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system. The . probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five . times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its . final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For . the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out . towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space . hibernation. Later . this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting . with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s . surface in November. ESA received the all-clear signal at 6.18pm, some 48 minutes behind schedule. A few seconds later, Rosetta sent the message ‘Hello World!’ out on Facebook and Twitter. ‘Having Rosetta go into hibernation was a nightmare for me,’ Dr Ferri said. ‘It’s the worst thing you can tell a mission controller that you’re not going to be in touch with your spacecraft for a while,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘But I tell you, my life has changed so much since yesterday…and I’m so happy.’ While the celebratory ribbons are being . cleared away, mission control is hard at work to uncover any problems . Rosetta may now be facing. The spacecraft, which was launched in . 2004, is due to rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and land . a probe on it this year in an unprecedented manoeuvre. ‘What we got yesterday was simple a radio frequency carrier from Rosetta saying “I’m alive!”’, said Dr Ferri . ‘We still need to get all the telemetry, which it’s sending down now, and we’ll be analysing that overnight.’ The European Space Agency (ESA) received the all-clear message 'Hello World!' from its Rosetta spacecraft, 500 million miles away, shortly after 6pm . The signal was received by Nasa's Goldstone ground station in California at 18:18 GMT, during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with Earth. It was immediately confirmed in ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt (pictured) The . Rosetta mission will perform several historical firsts, including the . first time a spacecraft orbits a comet rather than just whizzing by it . to snap some fly-by pictures, and the first time a probe has landed on a . comet's nucleus. Rosetta . is also the first mission to venture beyond the main asteroid belt . relying solely on solar cells for power generation, which is also why it . had to be put into a deep sleep for 957 days. 'It . has been so far away from the sun that the solar rays were not able to . generate enough energy to safely operate the spacecraft, said Rosetta . spacecraft operations manager Andrea, who has been working on the . Rosetta mission since 1997. The data so far suggests that all the systems are healthy and working perfectly. 'In the worst case scenario, the instruments are exactly as they were when we entered hibernation 2.5 years ago,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘In the best cast, they are better as they’ve managed to get some rest.’ Mission control have now switched on the space probe’s mass memory, and in the coming days will reactivate the crafts four momentum wheels. These wheels are essentially fast rotating discs that spin at a few thousand revolutions per minute - similar to a gyroscope. They are used to keep the 3-dimensional attitude of the satellite fixed direction. By Monday, Rosetta is expected to be fully functional and will remain stable as it falls closer to the sun and its target comet. The craft is currently around 5.6 million miles from its destination and closing on the object at more than half a mile a second. A screenshot of the moment the signal was received from Rosetta. The spacecraft's orbit has brought it back to within 673 million km from the sun . For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation . Rosetta . is now around 5.6 million miles from its destination, the comet . Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and closing on the object at half a mile a . second. The spacecraft, . which was launched by in French Guiana in 2004, will now spend several . months approaching and orbiting the comet. Once it has found for a suitable  site, it will attempt a landing in November. Scientists are particularly keen to conduct organic chemistry experiments on samples from the comet's body. It now has 644W of power from the sun, but scientists want it to gain several hundred watts more before they can switch on its scientific instruments. They believe this will happen in early March as Rosetta heads towards closer the sun. ‘What counts for us now is the relative speed between the spacecraft and the comet,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘It’s now travelling around 1km per second faster than the comet. In May, we will need to correct that and slow it down to 0.5m per second – less than walking speed.’ By the time Rosetta reaches the comet in August, it will be travelling at only a few tens of centimetres per second. ‘What comes after that will be completely new,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘I wouldn’t describe it as a fear. But it’s a big challenge and hugely exciting to learn how to fly around a comet and then try and land a probe on its surface’. The manoeuvre is described by Dr Ferri as a ‘gentle push’ with Rosetta releasing the probe between 5-10 km away from the comet. A private image of the mission control team following contact with Rosetta. Dr Paul Ferri describes the moments leading up to the signal as the 'toughest of my life' Later this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet's surface in November . Scientists have no idea whether the comet’s surface will be as soft as snow or hard as ice. And unlike the Moon or a planet, the comet is too small, at 2.5 miles across, to have a significant gravity. So the lander will fire a harpoon into the surface to keep it anchored. Lead scientist Jean Pierre Bibring said: ‘The risks are huge. We had to develop something to land on something that was unpredictable and unknown.’ Both Rosetta and the lander will be able to take images of the comet, as well as use their many onboard instruments to analyse samples. Scientists hope the probe’s findings will help them understand the composition of comets and thereby discover more about the origins and evolution of our solar system. They have speculated that comets - which are essentially giant, dirty snowballs - may be responsible for the water found on some planets. And like asteroids, comets also pose a theoretical threat to life on Earth. ‘I’m just extremely happy, and relieved, that Rosetta has woken up,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘What comes next will be incredibly exciting.’ The spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

Space fans have stitched together the images from the spacecraft to create a stunning 360 degree panorama you can scroll around. The images show the Moon's bleak, gray, rocky landscape, and are similar to the images captured by NASA's Apollo lunar landing missions from 1969-1972. Scroll down to see the interactive panorama . China's space agency has released the first color images from its first spacecraft to soft land on the Moon. The Chang'e 3 spacecraft captured several panoramic photographs of the surrounding moonscape. The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme, with the moon believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation. 'China wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. 'With the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still has more, and more advanced, assets in space.' China is the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and the then-Soviet Union - a decade after it first sent an astronaut into space. The lunar rover Yutu has a designed life span of three months, and the lander is expected to work for one year. After waking up following nearly two weeks of dormancy, Yutu has now completed its first sampling of lunar soil using its mechanical arm on Tuesday, the Beijing command centre said. 'Accuracy control of the mechanical arm at a distance of 380,000 kilometers has been realized in the probe, marking China's breakthrough in controlling a mechanical arm with high precision on the lunar surface,' said Wu Fenglei from the centre. The Chang'e 3 spacecraft has now captured several panoramic photographs of the surrounding moonscape. The images were captured between between December 15 and 18 of last year. The panoramic camera and infrared spectrograph have sent back clear images of the moon's surface and data collected by a particle X-ray device has helped scientists identify 11 types of chemical elements such as magnesium, aluminum, calcium and yttrium on the moon, officials added. Click on the image below to see the panorama . Lunar panorama: Chang’e 3 lander in The World . Ma Xingrui, chief commander of China's lunar programme, declared the mission a 'complete success' after the rover and lander took photos of each other on the moon's surface late last year. The mission is seen as a symbol of China's rising global stature and technological advancement, as well as the Communist Party's success in reversing the fortunes of the once-impoverished nation. Beijing plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020. Colour images showing the Chinese national flag on the rover were transmitted live to the Beijing Aerospace Control Center where Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated the mission, the agency said.

A message from the party's Central Committee, the State Council - China's cabinet -, and the Central Military Commission branded the touchdown a 'milestone' in China's space programme, as cited by Xinhua late Sunday. The lunar probe began to carry out soft-landing on the moon at 9 pm China time on Saturday and touched down in Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, 11 minutes later, according to the Beijing Aerospace Control Center. During the process, the probe decelerated from 15km (nine miles) above the moon, stayed hovering at 100 yards from the lunar surface in order to use sensors to assess the landing area and avoid obstacles, and descended slowly onto the surface. Launch: The December 2 launch of the carrier rocket, the vehicle for China's first moon rover mission, blasting off after midnight in Xichang in southwest China's Sichuan province . The success makes China the third country, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to soft-land (a powered, controlled descent) on the moon. The last soft-landing was carried out by the Soviet Union in 1976. The probe's landing is the most difficult task during the mission, said Wu Weiren, the lunar program's chief designer, according to  the Xinhua news agency. 'It's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world,' said Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry. 'Especially somewhere like the moon, which doesn't have an atmosphere so you can't use parachutes or anything like that. 'You have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you don't end up in a crater on top of a large rock.' State-run China Central Television showed a computer-generated image of the Chang'e 3 lander's path as it approached the surface of the moon, explaining that for about a 12-minute landing period it would have no contact with Earth. As it was just hundreds of metres away, the lander's camera broadcast images of the moon's surface. The Chang'e 3's solar panels, which are used to absorb sunlight to generate power, opened soon after the landing. The Chang'e 3 will set up antennae to transmit pictures back to Earth. Chang'e-3 relied on automated systems for descent, range and velocity measurements, finding the proper landing point, and free-falling.

Chang'e-3 adopted a variable thrust engine designed and made by Chinese scientists. Its thrust power ranges from 1,500 to 7,500 newtons, according to Wu Weiren. The soft-landing was carried out 12 days after the probe blasted off on an enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket. China's military-backed space programme has made methodical progress in a relatively short time, although it lags far behind the United States and Russia in technology and experience. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel independently. In 2006, it sent its first probe to the moon. China plans to open a space station around 2020 and send an astronaut to the moon after that. 'They are taking their time with getting to know about how to fly humans into space, how to build space stations ... how to explore the solar system, especially the moon and Mars,' said Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry. 'They are making good strides, and I think over the next 10, 20 years they'll certainly be rivalling Russia and America in this area and maybe overtaking them in some areas.' Chang'e-3 includes a lander and a moon rover called 'Yutu' or Jade Rabbit. Yutu's tasks include surveying the moon's geological structure and surface substances and searching for natural resources. The lander will operate there for one year while the rover will be active for three months. Chang'e-3 is part of the second phase of China's lunar programme, which includes orbiting, landing and returning to the Earth. It follows the success of the Chang'e-1 and Chang'e-2 missions in 2007 and 2010. Sun Huixian, deputy engineer-in-chief in charge of the project, said: 'Compared to the last century's space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, mankind's current return to the moon is more based on curiosity and exploration of the unknown universe.' 'China's lunar program is an important component of mankind's activities to explore peaceful use of space.' The moon is one of the most important themes in Chinese literature and ancient myths, including one about Chang'e, a lady who took her pet 'Yutu' to fly to the moon, where she became a goddess. 'Though people have discovered that the moon is bleached and desolate, it doesn't change its splendid role in Chinese traditional culture,' said Zhang Yiwu, a professor with Peking University. 'Apart from scientific exploration, the lunar probe is a response to China's traditional culture and imagination. China's lunar programme will proceed with the beautiful legends,' Zhang said.

On Monday Iran announced that successfully sent a monkey into space for a second time, part of an ambitious programme aimed at manned space flight. Iran's state TV said that the launch of the rocket dubbed Pajohesh, or Research in Farsi, was Iran's first use of liquid fuel and reached a height of 120 kilometres (72 miles). It said the monkey, named Fargam or Auspicious, was returned to earth safely. The TV showed the rocket blasting off and then showed the monkey, strapped snugly into a seat, staring at people clapping to celebrate its safe return. The report said Fargam's capsule parachuted safely to earth after detaching from the rocket in a mission that lasted 15 minutes. Iran frequently claims technological breakthroughs that are impossible to independently verify. The Islamic Republic has said it seeks to send an astronaut into space as part of an ambitious aerospace programme.

Smog blowing across the Pacific towards the United States from China is often caused by the manufacture of goods for export to America, a new study has claimed. Researchers found pollution choking the American West Coast comes from China's production of mobile phones, televisions and other consumer goods for export. Dr Steve Davis, from the University of . California, Irvine said: ‘We've outsourced our manufacturing and much of . our pollution, but some of it is blowing back across the Pacific to . haunt us. Cities like Los Angeles (pictured) received at least an extra day of smog a year from nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide from China's export-dependent factories, a report said . ‘Given the complaints about how Chinese pollution is corrupting other countries' air, this paper shows that there may be plenty of blame to go around.’ The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to work out how much pollution reaching the West Coast originates from China. Los Angeles, for example, experiences at least one extra day of smog that exceeds legal limits because of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emitted by Chinese factories producing goods for export. Black carbon has been linked to numerous health problems including athsma, emphysema, heart and lung disease and even cancer. It can be problematic because rain doesn't easily wash it out of the atmosphere. The study also revealed that as much as a quarter of the sulphate pollution on the US West Coast is tied to Chinese exports. Chinese citizens wear masks on their faces on a hazy day while walking to their respective destinations in Beijing . However, China is not responsible for the lion's share of pollution in the U.S. - cars, trucks and refineries pump out far more. Japan and South Korea have regularly suffered noxious clouds from their neighbour in the last couple of decades as environmental regulations have been sacrificed for economic and industrial growth. But powerful global winds known as ‘westerlies’ can carry chemicals over the ocean to the U.S in days, particularly during spring, causing dangerous spikes in contaminants. And dust, ozone and carbon can accumulate in valleys and basins in California and other Western states. The authors believe the findings could play an important role in the future negotiation of clean air treaties. China's huge surge in industrial activity in recent years, as well as poor pollution controls, has led to often fierce international debates. The researchers wrote: ‘International cooperation to reduce transboundary transport of air pollution must confront the question of who is responsible for emissions in one country during production of goods to support consumption in another.’ Dr Davis said: ‘When you buy a product at Wal-Mart, it has to be manufactured somewhere. ‘The product doesn't contain the pollution, but creating it caused the pollution.’ Pollution has been so bad in China recently that flights have been diverted. This picture shows cars in a haze in Beijing . Air quality is of increasing concern to China's stability-obsessed leaders, anxious to douse potential unrest as a more affluent urban population turns against a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has poisoned much of the country's air, water and soil. Authorities have invested in various projects to fight pollution, but none has worked so far. In Shanghai the smog has been so severe recently that flights have been diverted, schools closed and authorities left mulling whether to distribute gas masks to the mega-city’s residents. The population stands at 23million and it’s not been made clear whether every person would receive a mask, but officials are becoming increasingly concerned at pollution levels and may at least give one to people who work outside. Last year authorities claimed that illegal barbecues were contributing to the air pollution in Beijing and seized and subsequently destroyed 500 of them, according to Shanghai Daily.","LA experiences an extra day of smog due to pollution from China, says study .

A car-hire company, Drive, ran a newspaper ad with a map tracing the route from the Elysee presidential palace to the apartment where Hollande's tryst ocurred - and pricing the trip at five euros. 'Unseen. Unknown. Private cars, tinted windows. At prices this low, you should choose discretion,' it said. Another rental car company, Sixt, made a similar crack in a newspaper insert telling Hollande: 'Mr President, next time avoid the scooter. Sixt rents cars with tinted windows.'

New mother Roxana Rodriguez will have to leave the order she is part of, known as the Little Disciples of Jesus, and the Italian convent she has lived in since she took her vow of chastity. The 33-year-old remains in hospital near Rome under a security lockdown, amid reports that the nun, from El Salvador, has been overwhelmed by the level of media attention in her case.

Sister Roxana initially claimed to have . no idea that she was pregnant and thought her labour pains were 'stomach . cramps' when an ambulance rushed her to hospital in severe pain after . being called by fellow nuns when she collapsed at her nunnery. Her picture was published in the Italian daily newspaper Corriere Della Sera, who have carried out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the birth of 9lb Francis and have spoken to the the social worker in the case. It shows Sister Roxana, who is currently in the first floor maternity unit at the San Camillo de Lellis hospital in Rieti, 50 miles north of Rome, as she took her vows and became a nun in the order last September. She told her social worker Anna Fontanella: 'I am so happy. I feel more of a mother than a nun, I think that's obvious. I decided to call him Francis in honour of our wonderful south American Pope. I do not feel of guilt. I will be keeping him and bringing him up. 'He is a gift from God. I am little worried about all the publicity, not only in Italy but in El Salvador and all over the world. Everyone is talking about this and I don't think I will be able to return to my home country, let alone Rieti.' Sister Roxana has written a letter of apology to the order's mother superior general Elvira Petaraca - the woman who in September she solemnly promised to follow her vows of 'chastity, poverty and obedience', the three main pillars of the Little Disciples of Jesus Order. The nun stunned her mother superior and local church chiefs after giving birth last week to a baby boy which she has called Francis, in honour of the current Pope . The nun had only arrived in Italy last . summer at the nunnery in Rieti and has told officials that the father is . a man from her native El Salvador but she has so far not named him. Father Benedetto Falcetti, priest at . the nearby St Michael's church in Rieti, said: 'It all happened last . spring, around March or April time when she was back in El Salvador to . get her passport renewed. 'She . has not said who the father is but I understand he is an, shall we say, . old flame of hers from when she was younger. At some stage I expect she . will tell the father that he has a son and they will be reunited but I . don't know when that will be.' However, not all sure Father Falcetti's delight at the birth, apart from the anger of her superiors, sister Roxana has also upset her fellow nuns at the convent in Campomoro. One nun who answered the telephone at the convent and who asked not to be named said:'No we must certainly not be going to visit her. What she has done is not right at all. She has betrayed her vows. She will not be coming back here.' Since news of the birth was announced the hospital has been flooded with gifts for the nun and her new baby including nappies, clothes and money. Hospital director Pasquale Carducci said:'We have had to put extra security on the maternity wing because of all the interest. Like any new mum she is delighted but obviously this has created a great deal of clamour because she is a nun. 'There have been calls and gifts from dozens of well wishers and she has passed on her thanks to all these people. Medically she and the baby are doing well and I expect them to be discharged by Tuesday at the latest.' Massimo Casciani, spokesman for the local bishop of Rieti, monsignor Delio Lucarelli, said: 'At some point the bishop will visit the nun but at the moment he has not yet seen here. 'We shall be investigating the circumstances behind - the child could be the fruit of a consensual rapport but it could also have been as a result of violence. That's why we need to investigate properly.'","Sister Roxana initially claimed to have no idea that she was pregnant .

Five children and two men have been rescued after being stranded in the Australian outback for four days - but not before courageous efforts by the two adults. When their vehicle broke down in the harsh Kimberley region of north-west Western Australia, they survived on what food and water they had, while two of the children used up their asthma inhalers.But it was not the typically baking heat of the desert that had caused their plight. What caused them trouble was lashing rain that had flooded the rough outback. It put such a strain on their old vehicle that it broke down. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The children were rescued by helicopter after spending four days in a harsh region of Australia . The children were close to running out of food when they were rescued . After surviving on what little supplies they had for four days one of the men decided to set off to seek help - and walked 30 miles across the soggy sand before he was found in a weakened state by a youth worker travelling on another road to an Aboriginal settlement. In the meantime the father of the five children - the youngsters were aged between three and 11 - decided to set off for help, too, and risked his life by swimming across a river while carrying a full petrol can and then walking to a cattle station. He told workers there that his children had hardly any food left and they were boiling water they had scooped up to drink. The group was seen by a spotter plane, then picked up by police helicopter . The family ran into trouble after their vehicle broke down navigating flooded roads . He was able to send a message to the emergency services from there, before swimming back across the river and returning to the broken-down vehicle to comfort his children. With the alarm raised now from two places, a spotter aircraft set off across the desert to look for the stranded vehicle. To the relief of the pilot, he saw the children waving up at the aircraft. Later a police helicopter made two trips to the vehicle to pick up the children and their father. The family have yet to be named. The group was stranded in an extremely harsh environment . 'They had limited food and water supplies when found,' said police spokesman Sam Dinnison. 'Two of the children had also run out of their asthma medication.' The group, who had set off from Darwin to Halls Creek on the unsealed Duncan Highway in a four-wheel-drive vehicle last Friday, ran into trouble when they tried to cross a flooded creek. 'They were driving in an area that's had a lot of torrential rain recently and we believe they've entered floodwaters with the vehicle, which has caused it to break down.' With the family being flown to safety at Halls Creek - and the man who had first set out being due to arrive later - police turned their attention to other motorists stranded by the flood waters. Helicopters were being used to deliver food and water to them in the Kimberley region after the Great Northern Highway was cut off by rising waters east of Fitzroy Crossing. Mr Richard Omen, who works at a roadside filling station and cafe, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that traffic was banked up, including up to 25 large trucks. 'There's quite a few of them stuck and they've ended up having to find accommodation here,' he said. Police said they have been keeping in touch with two women and two truck drivers who spent two nights stuck on a small section of highway isolated by floodwaters.","The group got into trouble after their vehicle broke down in the Kimberley region of Western Australia .

Despite this a senior police officer said handing 32 drivers a chance to go on the course would be ‘far more beneficial’ for the drivers involved than putting them before the courts. Motorists who decline to take up attending the course will automatically be summonsed to court, said the police. The controversial decision to spare drivers prosecution follows a four-month investigation by specialist collision investigators and case review staff from Kent Police. Eight people suffered serious injuries and 200 others were treated at the scene following the crash, which started at around 7.15am. It then continued for 10 minutes as cars and lorries crashed into each other on the bridge’s Sittingbourne-bound section in visibility that was down to 25 yards. Massive: Some 150 cars were involved in a  huge crash on the Sheppey Crossing in Kent in September last year in conditions of thick fog - but they will be given a driving course, not prosecuted, it was announced . Inspector Martin Stevens, head of the serious collision investigation unit at Kent Police, said it was ‘quite simply a miracle’ that no-one was killed. Fog was a major factor, but evidence from investigators suggested some motorists failed to drive appropriately for the conditions. Letters have now been sent to 32 drivers, offering them the chance to enrol on an awareness course rather than go to court, said Kent Police. As part of the one-day, self-funding course, drivers will sit through an interactive classroom session followed by a supervised drive in front of an instructor. 'Miracle': Despite the dangerous driving seen on the day, nobody was killed in the crash . Damage: Despite claims of driving 'like idiots', nobody will be prosecuted in the wake of the accident . Inspector Stevens said: ‘Clearly the thick fog that descended on the bridge that day made driving conditions incredibly challenging and was a contributory factor in the resulting collision which stretched from the approach right across the bridge. ‘While a significant number of drivers did precisely the right thing by driving to the conditions, our investigation has provided overwhelming evidence that in some cases motorists were not driving with due care and attention and were travelling at speeds which prevented them being able to stop in the distances that they could see ahead.’ But he said: ‘Rather than go through the process of taking these people to court, it was felt that offering an educational outcome would prove far more beneficial for the drivers involved. 'Driving at speed without clear visibility is without doubt extremely dangerous and the fact there was not a single fatality on the day is quite simply a miracle.’ The police inspector added: ‘This has been a thorough investigation of what was the biggest collision in the county and certainly the largest our team has had to deal with. ‘The emergency services and partner agencies worked together to support those involved in the collision. 'Attention then quickly turned to the recovery process and getting the crossing back up and running by the early evening, which was no mean feat.’","Horrific crash took place in heavy fog on the Sheppey Crossing in Kent .

A 500-year-old Tudor mansion boasting a 100ft great hall, three priest holes and its own ghost is for sale for £4.75million. Sawston Hall, described as the finest private house in Cambridgeshire, has five ensuite bedrooms, a moat, and an arboretum with rare trees, but its real draw is its history. Owned by a grand Roman Catholic family for centuries, the Hall has secret places where outlawed Catholic priests could hide when the terrifying priest-hunters came to call during the Reformation. Sawston Hall, which dates back to the Tudor period, was a Catholic stronghold and boasts three priest's holes in which outlawed Catholic priests could hide when the feared priest-hunters came to call . Life-saving hiding place: This priest hole, hidden beneath in a spiral stone staircase in Sawston Hall, was designed by carpenter Saint Nicholas Owen . Guardians of history: Stephen and Claire Coates, left, who live at Sawston Hall with their three children, have spent 'millions' renovating the rare Tudor mansion . Feared by Catholics who continued to practise their religion even after it was made illegal, priest-hunters would arrive with skilled carpenters who would spend up to a week ripping out panelling and pulling up floorboards looking for priests. Sawston Hall, which was one of the famous Catholic safehouses in the reign of Elizabeth 1, has three such holes hidden in the fabric of the stone, Grade I-listed mansion.  One of them, hidden within a stone turret housing a spiral staircase, was created by master carpenter Nicholas Owen, and is said by experts to be the finest example of a priest's hole in the country. Owen, who died under torture in the Tower of London in 1606, was later canonised for his role in ensuring the future of British Catholicism, and his work in creating spaces where priests could escape capture played a key role in English Catholic history. Sawston, which lies seven miles outside Cambridge, was owned by the Huddleston family from 1517 until they sold up in 1982, but much of its original furnishings and artefacts are still there, including paintings, tapestries and furniture. Hailed as a rare perfect - not added to or rebuilt - example of mid-Tudor building on a grand scale, it was built using stones from Cambridge Castle between 1557 and 1584, replacing a late medieval manor house on the same spot that burnt down. Mary Tudor, the future Mary I, hid in the original house as a guest of the Huddlestons in 1553 on her way to claim the throne, and it is said the Duke of Northumberland, hot on her heels, burnt it down when he found she had escaped dressed as a dairy maid. Beautifully restored: Sawston Hall has fine wooden panelling and plenty of original features dating back to the Tudor period . Place of worship: The house, one of the most famous Catholic strongholds in the Reformation, comes with its own chapel . Sawston Hall boasts Grade I-listed gardens with formal gardens, a wildflower meadow, a moat, pinetum, and arboretum with rare trees . Mary is said to have told her hosts not to worry, and promised to build them a better house, and the current Sawston Hall, which was occupied by the US Air Force during the Second World War, is the result. After the Huddlestons sold it, Sawston Hall became a language school and was then bought by an internet tycoon who hoped to turn it into a five-star hotel.  But when he lost interest and emigrated to Australia, it was bought by former hedge fund manager Stephen Coates in 2010. Since then, he and his wife Claire have spent millions of pounds restoring the building, adding a bespoke kitchen by kitchen designer Mark Wilkinson, five bedroom suites, and a sophisticated zoned heating system. The house is said to be haunted by Queen Mary, but the Coates, who have three young children, say it has never bothered them. A . campaign to raise the money to buy the house and open it for future . generations has been launched by historians and is backed by leading . Catholics including Ann Widdecombe and Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, . the former Archbishop of Westminster. Modern touches: The Coates family, who have owned Sawston since 2010, have added an expensive, bespoke Mark Wilkinson kitchen to the Tudor mansion . Rear view: Sawston Hall lies just seven miles outside the city of Cambridge and has grounds of nearly 60 acres, with water gardens, a moat, and specimen plants . Brian Plunkett, of the Sawston Hall Heritage Trust, said the house's rich history made it of interest to everybody, regardless of religion. He said: 'We want to buy it and open it as a heritage site for everyone to share.  It's just the most beautiful place, and has the most astonishing history.' He added: 'One of the priest holes at Sawston, said to be the best in the country, is ingeniously hidden within the actual thick stone wall of the medieval spiral staircase and can be accessed by lifting the boards of the landing at the top of the stairs. 'It is a couple of metres long once you get inside it and is a genuine hidden chamber built of stone. As you walk up the spiral staircase you could never spot it without knowing it is there. 'The opening is quite small so the priest would have needed to be quite small to get in through the access. My understanding is that it worked in that nobody was ever caught in it during the bad times.' He also said Sawston was designed to allow someone to circulate in such a way that would confuse an intruder. Sawston Hall is for sale through Savills estate agents, who say it may be of interest to the new breed of tech millionaires working in Cambridge. When Catholics were persecuted by law in England, beginning in 1558 in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, it became an offence to celebrate Mass. Those found breaking the law were fined in the first instance, imprisoned if caught a second time, and imprisoned for life for a third offence.  Imprisonment for a priest often meant torture and execution. And those who refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, declaring that the Queen was the head of the Church, would be found guilty of high treason and could be put to death. Prince Charles examining a priest hole at Boscobel House in Shropshire - Charles II hid in a priest hole in the house after evading Cromwell after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 . After the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, anti-Catholic sentiment became even more rabid. Grand Catholic families who were determined to continue in their faith built secret priest holes into their large houses, where priests could hide from the dreaded priest-hunters. They would be carved into thick stone walls, dug deep under wooden floorboards, or hidden in thick chimney breasts, and priests would often have to hide in them for days at a time while the priest-hunters laid waste to a house in their bid to uncover evidence of practising Catholics. Many grand houses had priest holes, including Boscobel House in Shropshire, where Charles II hid in a priest hole after hiding in a tree known as the Royal Oak, to avoid capture by Cromwell after the Battle of Worcester in 1651.","Sawston Hall in Cambridgeshire, which is for sale for £4.75million, was a Catholic stronghold in the Reformation .

Two amateur photographers have made more than 100 miniature scenes in their living rooms - with food from their kitchen cupboards. The 'food art' includes a moon landing in parmesan cheese, a ski slope on an iced cake, an office built from wafer biscuits and a crib containing the baby Jesus inside a muffin. One small step for parmesan: Italian 'food artists' Antonio Magliocchetti and Stefano Adorinni have created more than 130 photos of a miniature world using everyday objects - often from their kitchens . Off-piste: In one creation these cross-country skiers appear to have got lost on the icing on a cake . Dancing on iced martini: Figure skaters take to the surface of a frozen cocktail in another shot by the artists . Earning a crust: Office workers are hemmed in by wafer biscuits, but at least they can eat their way out . On their coffee break: Construction workers hauling buckets of beans - including with a miniature JCB . The artists from Udine, Italy, used tiny model people which they bought from hobby shops and from eBay for as little as £1. Antonio . Magliocchetti and Stefano Adorinni began their Mini World Project in 2012 and have since amassed more than 130 images, expanding their repertoire to household objects like vinyl records, glass bottles and a fish tank. Each shot takes up to two hours to piece together using ordinary household objects, coloured paper and a tripod-mounted camera with a macro lens. The pair have sold their creations to cafes, restaurants and offices, where they are now on display across Italy. Mr Magliocchetti, 54, said: 'The construction is very fun, finding the items and building the sets. Big appetite? This baker carries a croissant bigger than him. The artist pair use 1/67 scale models . No crib for his bread: The baby Jesus finds an unusual scene for a manger inside a hollowed-out panettone . Rising to the challenge: Builders create a bread house out of dough (bottom left) in a tiny cement mixer .

Watermelon men: There was no seed of doubt for the swimmers in this miniature beach scene . Golden sun: The artists created a perfect sunbathing spot for their figurines with half a pineapple . Spill something? A man drinks wine next to a full-size bottle in this photo by the two Italian artists . Dried fruit: Brightly-coloured clothes on a miniature washing line are outshone by slices of pear and lime . 'We get inspiration from everywhere: the kitchen, food. It can strike at any time.' Despite the intricate nature of their shots, the pair use some surprisingly low-key methods to create them. They tend to set up their 'studio' on the carpets of their living rooms during their free time. For the people in their scenes they favour 1/87 scale figurines, which they buy from hobby shops or on eBay for as little as £1 each. Mr Magliocchetti said: 'The reaction is highly variable. It is often the surprise and amazement of seeing certain combinations that get people going. It's an attempt to revive what is not alive.' Our song: Some of the photos do not include food, such as this one of a couple dancing on a vinyl record . Tuning up: The musical theme continues as tweaking these guitar strings becomes an industrial task . You're going to need a bigger boat: This fisherman comes face-to-face with his gigantic catch . Castaway: A rowboat delivers a message in a bottle in this photo, taken at an unusual angle .

Wall of death: An empty tin can becomes a funfair stunt in this photo, created in the artists' living rooms . In this photo, women and children are dwarfed by their own clothes pegs as they try to reach for the washing . The pair are continuing with their project, even releasing 'how-to' images giving a glimpse of how their pieced their shots together. The fantastical scenes include workers sawing apart 'logs' made of wafer biscuits and a woodland scene with closed cup mushrooms transforming into trees. Some are a little more bizarre, with a tiny clothes line next to a line of dripping fruit slices. And many of the pair's characters are stranded on top of fruit slices, frozen drinks or biscuit mountains with no sight of terra firma. But at least if they get stuck there's a solution: they can always eat their way out. So it WAS a hoax! 'Making-of' photos released by the pair show how they created the moon landing made of parmesan cheese, left, and the logging depot constructed from wafer biscuits, right - in their living rooms . Some of the scenes took hours to set up on the artists' floors... as well as needing some very steady hands .

A stand-in male stripper lost his temper when he was heckled by his female audience, lashing out and pulling one woman's hair out in clumps - while his trousers were around his ankles. First-timer Leon Zbudowskyj, 30, was a last minute replacement for a regular stripper called Fabio at the £10-a-head, ladies-only night at the Baltic Inn, near Llanelli. But he failed to excite the crowd, and when more than 200 disappointed women started booing the 'scrawny' striptease artist, pelting him with paper napkins, he flew into a rage. Leon Zbudowskyj, 30, lashed out when he was heckled by the female audience at the Baltic Inn, near Newport . Venue: Five police cars arrived to break up the scuffle at the nightspot in the village of Pontyates, pictured . Swansea Crown Court heard how Zbudowskyj, of Caerleon, Newport, had a few drinks to calm his nerves before changing into his fireman’s outfit in the men's lavatory at the pub. Prosecutor Brian Simpson said: . 'Zbudowskyj was booked to work as a stripper for a ladies night but he . turned up after he’d been drinking. 'He used the gents toilet as a changing room and the compere, Deborah Jones, saw him pull his trousers down. 'On stage he started spitting cream at the members of the audience - the audience began to boo and throw serviettes at him.' The court heard Mrs Jones described the novice stripper, who was taken offstage by manager David Morgan and told he was no longer welcome, as like 'a rabbit caught in a car's headlights'. The prosecutor said: 'He appeared agitated and aggressive - he still had his trousers down when he lunged at Mr Morgan, punching him to the side of the head. Zbudowskyj, left, was standing in at the last minute for regular Baltic Inn stripper, Fabio, pictured right . Popular: The Baltic Inn hosts a regular ladies' night featuring stripper Fabio, with tickets costing £10 a head . 'There was a struggle, and Zbudowskyj threw a beer glass at him, grabbed him by the face, and tried to gouge his eyes. 'He bit Mr Morgan on the chest, and he was only released when he managed to twist his body away.' The court heard he then went on to attack the compere and a member of the audience. Five police cars were sent to break up the scuffle, and Zbudowskyj was arrested and driven away still wearing his fireman’s outfit. Zbudowskyj denied assault and claimed he himself had been attacked at the bar in Pontyates near Llanelli, West Wales. Zbudowskyj smiled in court today as the events of the night in January last year were related. Erotic act: Zbudowskyj was performing in a fireman's uniform but it failed to excite his female audience . Mr Simpson said: 'Mrs Jones described Zbudowskyj as being liked a caged animal, and he lunged at her, causing her £154 glasses to break. 'A woman in the audience, Bethan Lewis, went to the gents toilet after seeing the fuss but Zbudowskyj grabbed her by the hair, pulling clumps of it out.' Zbudowskyj had admitted three charges of common assault and one of damaging the glasses at an earlier hearing. Today the court heard he had 11 previous offences of violence and had once smashed up a flat before running naked through a town centre. Psychiatrist Dr Stephen Attwood told the court that Zbudowskyj was suffering from a mental disorder which 'can be treated'. Judge Keith Thomas, who made Zbudowskyj the subject of a mental health order committing him to a hospital without time limit, said: 'When he loses control of himself he behaves in an uncontrollable fashion. 'It’s only a matter of luck he has not caused serious injury to members of the public through his uncontrollable outbursts.'

'Fraud': Keith Webber, pictured today outside Bristol Crown Court, stands accused of fraud, forgery and theft . A crooked probate lawyer stole £210,000 by writing himself into his clients' wills, charging inflating fees and convincing them to give him large cash 'gifts', a court heard. Keith Webber, 67, gained the trust of four 'elderly and vulnerable people' - including his own sister-in-law - who made him sole executor of their wills and trusted him implicitly. But he then used a variety of methods to steal their money, including exaggerating his fees and persuading them to sign over assets into his name, Bristol Crown Court heard. Prosecutors claim that in one case he made himself the main beneficiary of a will, and in another continued taking his client's money even after she had died. For one ploy he turned against his own family to empty his sister-in-law’s account, while on another he claimed to be in a relationship with his victim to avert suspicion, a jury was told. Webber denies four counts of fraud by abuse of position, one of forgery and another of theft at Bristol Crown Court. Rupert Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'These elderly and vulnerable people trusted him because he was a very professional and proper person and they believed he was honest. 'But instead of looking after their affairs he actually found ways to help himself to their money. He would persuade, or deceive, them into making him large gifts, tens of thousands of pounds. 'Sometimes it would be in the form of exaggerated fees from his work, sometimes it the form of generous gifts which they suddenly wanted to make. 'He would also have them sign assets over to him, he would hang on to money from accounts he would receive and pocket money due to them. 'After their deaths he would continue to charge, grossly inflated fees from so-called work. In one case he altered the main beneficiary of a will so he would inherit all her money. 'He engaged in acts of dishonesty and deceiving exploitation on elderly and vulnerable people to enrich himself.' The court heard how Webber ran a business known as Will Power, later changed to KEW Wills, where he managed wills and powers of attorney. But it was claimed that he abused his powers with a number of clients, including his sister-in-law, Esther Larn, her husband David, and two women, Audrey Jarvis and Vera Costan. Webber’s alleged deception began in September 2009 when Mr and Mrs Larn moved to his home town of Chard, Somerset, to live in sheltered accommodation. The court was told that within six months Webber had convinced his sister-in-law to revoke any powers another sister, Margaret, had over the couple, and give them to him. As a result Webber gained complete control over their estate and all monetary matters. It was claimed he would use the couple’s bank account to write large cheques payable to his wife Joan - Esther’s sister - in order to make them look like gifts. At one point the couple were allegedly tricked into handing over £36,000, before another £25,404 was taken to cover Webber's 'fees'. Trial: Webber denies all charges at Bristol Crown Court, pictured . Mr Lowe told the court that a will written in 2009 only listed 'clothes' being due to Mr Webber, with his wife in line to inherit a quarter of their estate. But by the end of 2010, when both had died, Webber had stolen more than £77,000 from them and inflated his wife’s claim to half of the estate, the jury was told. 'It is not often you get given gifts of over £36,000 when they had only wanted to leave him clothes just a year before,' Mr Lowe told the jury. He added: 'The fees represented a continuation of his abuse of his position. 'Once you add that to the petrol he was claiming, and the £36,000 of ‘gifts’, that is already over £68,000 in a 13 month period. 'It works out at £4,700 a month, it is a cash cow for Mr Webber.' Webber even continued to steal after the couple’s deaths, withdrawing money from their accounts with their debit cards just hours after widower Mr Larn passed away. The court also heard that Webber abused another client, Audrey Jarvis, and made regular trips to see her in Surbiton, Surrey. Prosecuters said he encouraged her to sign over a power of attorney, then wrote 'quite substantial cheques' to himself totalling £11,500, it is claimed. When questioned about the motive for this money he claimed the pair were 'spiritually close' and, despite his embarrassment, she had insisted he took them as gifts. Webber began to empty Mrs Jarvis’s bank accounts, cashed in her £35,000 Prudential policy, her £32,000 Friend’s Life policy and £25,000 of Premium Bonds, prosecutors claim. The court heard that when Webber realised Mrs Jarvis was dying he rang up her bank and asked for £1,000 to be transferred to him, in a 'last throw of the dice'. Mr Lowe said: 'Audrey is about to die so this is the last throw of the dice for Mr Webber as far as his power of attorney is concerned. He helps himself to as much as he possibly can.' Webber denies Fraud by abuse of position in relation to power of attorney between September 20 2009 and October 2010 and fraud by abuse of position as sole executor of a will between October 9 2010 and March 2011 in relation to David and Esther Larn. He also denies fraud by abuse of position in relation to power of attorney between July 13 2011 and October 20 2011, and fraud by abuse of position as sole executor of a will between October 2010 March 2011 in relation to Audrey Jarvis. He pleaded not guilty to forgery of a will between December 3 2012 and March 6 2012, and theft on February 14 2012, of Vera Costan.

Looking like typical grumpy teenagers, the runaways who fled their £30,000-a-year private school for the Caribbean could not hide their dejection today after being caught following a week on the run. Glum Edward Bunyan, 16, and . Indira Gainiyeva, may be back in their five-star beach resort, but they are being chaperoned by his mother Suzannah, who . flew into the Dominican Republic to collar them. The pair, who have been dating for months, were seen in beachwear strolling along the ocean in Punta Cana and eating outside the hotel - but always being watched. Eight days ago they fled Lancashire on a dream holiday and began running up thousands of pounds on credit cards ‘living like there was no tomorrow’. But very soon they will be flown home for a roasting from their school, the authorities and their parents. Romantic stroll: Runaways Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva walk along the beach in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, a day after they were found by police . Out for a meal: Eddy and Indira Gainiyeva with his mother Suzannah Bunyan, who is said to furious about their week-long sojourn in the Dominican Republic . Yesterday the two boarding school sixth-formers were finally tracked down – and had to face his furious mother. They had sparked an international manhunt after sneaking out of their £30,000-a-year boarding school last Monday and boarding a flight to the Dominican Republic. They originally checked into a . five-star hotel on the island where they are believed to have spent . several days enjoying lavish meals and cocktails. But, . fearing the authorities were closing in, they moved to a rundown . £75-a-week apartment block where they hoped to remain under the radar. They were finally caught late on Sunday when plain clothes police found . them sitting at a beachside restaurant in the resort of Punta Cana. They told police: ‘We’re having a great time and want to stay.’ Escapade: The couple were finally found on Sunday night after running away together from their boarding school for a holiday because of Britain's dank weather . Punishment: The pair's school has not confirmed if they will be expelled or suspended, while Lancashire Police will also speak to them They are now in a five-star resort after briefly running off to some apartments . Serious: When police caught up with them they said they were 'having a great time and want to stay', but they will soon be back in the UK . In trouble: A man, who may possibly be from local police, leads them into a five-star resort as Eddy drags a small suitcase . The pair were later reunited with Edward’s mother, Susannah Bunyan, who had flown out to help the search. Yesterday . morning she frogmarched the sheepish couple from their bolthole to a . taxi and reluctantly returned them to the luxury hotel where she had . checked in. She later accompanied them for a meeting at the police . station flanked by motorcycle outriders. Ramon . Brito, spokesman for the local tourist police, said: ‘We located them . by tracing their credit cards. They spent Sunday night at the Sol Caribe . apartments, in the Los Corales resort in Bavaro. We confirmed that they . were there, contacted their parents, and the police went in to take . them to be reunited with their families. ‘The . hotel owners won’t face any procedures – the youngsters came for a good . time and behaved well, so there was never any danger to them or . others.’ Light relief: Eddy and his mother smile at the man accompanying them to the hotel as they enjoy a drink and some food outside . Walk: The sixth-formers, who both wore beachwear, then left the table after a chat with Eddy's mother Suzannah . A source said: ‘Edward’s mother is very, very angry but also hugely relieved and wants to know what got into the pair. ‘She . desperately wants to know whether her son has been unhappy at boarding . school and whether he really wants to go back there. But she is also . very angry at what they did. We understand this stunt cost thousands of . pounds which he racked up on his credit card. It was like he was living . like there was no tomorrow.’ Their . adventure began last Monday when they left Stonyhurst College in . Clitheroe, Lancashire, at 3am and took a taxi to Manchester airport for a . flight to the Caribbean. End of the party: Suzannah Bunyan looked stern as she ushered son Eddy Bunyan, 16, into a car to go home . The pair have been on a week-long escapade, fleeing officials as they hop from one five-star resort to the next. Ms Bunyan carried the luggage as a sullen-looking Indira Gainiyeva, 17, stood behind waiting to get into the car . Action: The couple, who have been dating for seven months, face police questioning back in the UK . After . British police alerted Interpol, local officers spent days scouring 250 . miles of coastline packed with resorts. They finally traced them via . their credit cards at the luxury Occidental Grand Hotel in Punta Cana, . which boasts three swimming pools, a spa, tennis courts, nine . restaurants, seven bars and live nightly shows. But . by the time officers arrived on Sunday they had moved half a mile away . to a one-bedroomed apartment in a shabby block a ten-minute walk from . the beach. They were also more frugal, stocking up on bread and water and dining at cheap beachside restaurants. On the run: The couple were believed to be staying in a room similar to this one when they were found . They spent the week jumping from one five-star hotel to another until police traced their credit card payments . The pair were traced to the Sol Carib apartment complex in Punta Cana on the island . Indira's oil-rich family refused to fly out to the resort as they had no way of tracing the so-called 'Bonnie and Clyde' Fellow pupils took to Twitter to try to trace their whereabouts as the couple turned off their mobile phones . This is the beach front bar area where the couple were found on Sunday night before Eddy's mother arrived . The Roman Catholic school has refused to reveal what action will be taken over their escapade . At . around 11pm on Sunday police moved in and picked them up. It is . understood that they are now in separate rooms at the Occidental and . that Mrs Bunyan will act as guardian to Indira for the journey back to . Britain later this week. Indira’s . father, Ravil Gainiyev, a businessman in Kazakhstan, said: ‘Everything . is under control. We now want to take Indira home, back to Kazakhstan.’ It is understood that he and Indira’s mother Firuza spoke to their . daughter by phone after she was found, but they declined to talk about . the call. Eddy Bunyan was described by friends as 'a bit of a rebel'. Indira's parents believe she fell in love with him . Stonyhurst College in Lancashire prides itself on its high-end security measures . Stonyhurst headmaster Andrew Johnson said staff were delighted . the pair had been found safe and well but would not be drawn on whether . they would be expelled. The . college had earlier defended its security measures, saying they were . intended to keep out intruders, not to ‘imprison’ pupils.

Their hands lacerated by blisters and their bodies brutalised, a team of four British polo players have completed the world's toughest rowing race after 48 gruelling days at sea. In a tiny boat just seven yards long, the Atlantic Polo Team - comprised of 29-year-old Bobby Dundas (10th Viscount Melville), Henry Brett, 38, James Glasson, 39, and amateur polo player Fergus Scholes, 31 - has crossed the Atlantic in 48 days and seven minutes. The rowers, who had little nautical experience, tackled the staggering 3,000 miles, from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Antigua in the Caribbean, in shifts of two hours at the oar, followed by just two hours of sleep. Champions: (Left to right) Henry Brett, 38, Bobby Dundas, 29, Fergus Scholes, 32, and James Glasson, 39, of The Atlantic Polo Team, celebrate as they arrive in the harbour in Antigua . Viscount Melville, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, said: 'It was so out of our comfort zone as we had no seafaring ability. None of us are mariners but we craved that excitement, that sense of adventure. 'We had to everything from scratch, there was an enormity to it.' Just five days into the challenge, they hit a powerful storm in the Canaries, forcing the four men to seek solace in the tiny 8ft by 3ft cabin - designed to hold just two - for three days. They were washed back east by the storm and had to spend days making up the lost distance to win the four-person category and take second place overall in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. 'We couldn't leave the cabin, it was the most horrendous thing', said Viscount Melville. 'It was morale-breaking.' They . also had to endure being constantly wet from waves or sweat, which . combined with the hours spent at the oar caused horrendous blisters that . wouldn't close. Ferocious: Two men were thrown overboard during a ferocious storm just five days into the challenge but they recovered to complete the race in 48 days and seven minutes . But there were moments of incredible beauty too. Former city trader Mr Scholes, from Blandford in Dorset, said: 'We didn't see any wildlife - in fact we didn't even see another boat - but the stars were phenomenal. We were 1,000 miles from any land and the natural beauty was a knockout. 'We talked about food so much, like burgers, milkshakes, cold Coke with ice and lemon and the simple things like a bed and shower.' The team competed to raise money for The Brooke, Hilton in the Community Foundation and Right to Play causes. 'The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is something we feel extremely privileged to have experienced, yet would not have wished upon our worst enemies - we have been through hell and back again out there', added Mr Brett, from Witney in Oxfordshire. 'Most did not expect us to even get to the start line, we are delighted to have won the fours and be second out of the entire fleet.' We would not wish that challenge upon our worst enemies - we have been through hell and back out there . Two men were thrown overboard during the crossing whilst battling 40ft waves. Racing neck and neck against friends Row2Recovery, The Atlantic Polo Team nudged to the lead on New Yearâ€™s Day and stayed ahead for the duration of the nail-biting race. The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge saw 16 teams from around the world start the race on December 4. With two teams airlifted to safety following capsizes and one team rescued by a passing bulk-carrier ship, only 11 teams remain in the worldâ€™s toughest rowing race. Talisker Brand Manager Sophie Brookes said: 'The Atlantic Polo Team has done tremendously well to win the fours class of the 2013 Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, during which the team faced extremely unforgiving conditions. 'Bobby and Fergus visited Talisker distillery on the Isle of Skye in Scotland before they left, looking out at the rough Atlantic Ocean surrounding the island one last time before setting off they discussed the tough battle ahead of them. 'All of us at Talisker would like to applaud them for facing the conditions head on and coming out on top in their class.'","Four men crossed 3,000-mile Atlantic in 48 days and 7 minutes .

Satisfaction among Britain’s train passengers has plummeted as fares soar, more trains run late and thousands face standing room only on overcrowded trains, damning new figures reveal today. The official national rail passenger satisfaction survey for Autumn says satisfaction levels are ‘significantly down’ on the same period last year. Among individual train companies over the last 12 months it concluded: ‘None significantly improved and seven declined.’ On the worst commuter routes only just over a quarter (28 per cent) think they get value for money from their price of their ticket – with the rest feeling ripped off. Packed: Satisfaction among Britain¿s train passengers has plummeted as fares soar, trains run late and carriages are overcrowded, according to a new study . Around one in five passengers are dissatisfied with the quality of service they get from train companies with overall  satisfaction levels dropping to 83 per cent – down  2 percentage points compared to Autumn 2012. Nationally, after years of fare price hikes fewer than half (45 per cent) of passengers  are satisfied with the ‘value for money’ of their train ticket. This is two percentage points lower than in Autumn 2012 (47 per cent). But fewer than a third (32 per cent) of passengers on commuter routes feel they get value for money. Offering worst value for money by train operator is Southeastern with only a third (34 per cent) satisfied with their deal. It is followed by Greater Anglia (36 per cent), and South West Trains  First Capital Connect (both 37 per cent). But it is passengers on the Greater . Anglia Stansted Express route who feel most ripped off – with  just 28 . per cent saying they get value for money from their ticket, just ahead . of those on the Greater Anglia mainline route (29 per cent). On . overcrowding only two thirds (66 per cent) are satisfied with the . amount of sitting or standing space on their train, down by three . percentage points on the same period last year. Nor . are passengers impressed with declining punctuality and reliability . with satisfaction levels again ‘significantly down’ with more than one . in five dissatisfied. The proportion who are satisfied has fallen by . four percentage points to just 79 per cent. Poor: Train operator Southern received the lowest rating for overall satisfaction with 76 per cent of passengers saying they were satisfied with the service . The worst performer was Southern which ties with London Midland and First Hull trains with just 73 per cent of passengers satisfied, followed by First Capital Connect and First Great Western. A Passenger Focus spokesman said: ‘Satisfaction levels on punctuality reflect the reality. As punctuality has got worse satisfaction levels have also dropped.’ But the figures from independent consumer watchdog Passenger Focus also show big variations between different rail operators. Lowest rating for overall satisfaction were given to Southern (76 per cent), Northern Rail (78 per cent), First capital Connect (79 per cent), First Great Western (80 per cent) and Greater Anglia (80 per cent). Highest ratings were  achieved by Heathrow Express (96 per cent), Grand Central (95 per cent) and  Merseyrail (93 per cent). Frustration: Around one in five passengers are dissatisfied with the quality of service they get from train companies with overall satisfaction levels dropping to 83 per cent . Overcrowded: Only two thirds are satisfied with the amount of sitting or standing space on their train, down by three percentage points on the same period last year . Dissatisfaction was among its highest on commuter routes in London and the South East. Here the report notes: ‘The two biggest declines in satisfaction were  with punctuality/reliability (down 5 per cent) and how well train companies dealt with delays (down 5 per cent). Among long-distance operators satisfaction at dealing  with delays was down by 7 percentage points. Passenger Focus acting chief executive David Sidebottom said: ‘There are gaps of around 20 per cent between the best and worst-performing services, and satisfaction with value for money varied from 28 to 82 per cent.’ He noted:’Although generally satisfaction has remained fairly high over the last five years, we want to see a more consistently high level of service for passengers, wherever they may be travelling to and from.’ Delayed: The Passenger Focus report said punctuality was a key factor in rail passenger satisfaction . Out of pocket: Fewer than a third of passengers on commuter routes feel they get value for money . The Passenger Focus report says: ‘The key factor in rail passenger satisfaction remains punctuality. The satisfaction rating has dropped since the last Autumn survey – from 83 to 79 per cent – reflecting a drop in actual punctuality over this period. However, passenger punctuality ratings have barely changed in the last five years. In 2008 it was 81 per cent.’ The report adds: ‘How train operators handled delays dropped from last year’s 44 to 40 per cent satisfaction – and varied between 23 and 69 per cent across the country. Although this is a slight improvement on the situation in 2008 (when this factor scored 37 per cent), it is disappointing considering the amount of work that has gone into helping operators better manage and communicate during delays.' The survey was carried out between September and November 2013, before announcements on rail fare increases which Passenger Focus predicts will have some impact on the next survey results. Under the new and capped price-rise formula average regulated fares may increase by up to 3.1 per cent. But train companies can also use a 2.0 per   flexibility or ‘flex’ regulation which lets them put some regulated fares up by 5.1per cent provided their  overall average does not exceed the 3.1 per cent cap. Each January increase is calculated from the RPI rate of inflation figure for the previous July, which in 2013 was 3.1 per cent. The increase could have been even greater, but Chancellor George Osborne announced in his Autumn Statement in early December that, to ease some of the pain,  planned price cap price cap of RPI inflation plus 1per cent was being changed to RPI plus 0per cent - or in line with inflation only. Rises on unregulated fares, typically off-peak leisure tickets, are not capped. But some of these fares, including on the East Coast route, are going up by much less than 3.1 per cent. The overall rise in tickets - regulated and unregulated – is  2.8 per cent. But campaign groups complain that fares are still rising three times faster than wages and want a change to a ‘fairer’ model.","Rail passenger survey shows satisfaction levels 'significantly down'

Caught out: John Lindsey Hollingworth, 60, pocketed £26,000 pounds in disability hand outs after claiming he struggled to walk, only to be filmed playing golf . A benefits cheat who pocketed £26,000 pounds in disability hand outs after claiming he struggled to walk was caught out after being filmed playing golf. John Lindsey Hollingworth, 60, received Disability Living Allowance, claiming he suffered from arthritis, back pain and gout, which he said caused difficulties when walking short distances or driving. However, the only handicap he could honestly lay claim to having, was the one he played off each week at his local 18 hole golf club. Investigators put Hollingworth under surveillance and were stunned to discover the fraudster had an impressive handicap of six after playing regularly in competitions at Chorley Golf Club in Lancashire. Today Preston Magistrates Court heard that Hollingworth had started to receive disability benefits legitimatley in August 1997, but failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in 2001, when he was fit enough to join his local golf club. Andrea Fawcett, prosecuting, told the . court that Hollingworth had regularly played the 'strenuous sport' at . the 127 acre course for more than a decade before being put under . surveillance in October 2012. She said: 'The surveillance showed Mr Hollingworth playing golf frequently and driving to and from the course. 'He played competitively and had a golf handicap in the single figures. 'Towards . the end of 2012, information was received by the department which . suggested Mr Hollingworth might not be as disabled as he was claiming.' On . December 20, 2012, Hollingworth was arrested and interviewed by police . but maintained he was unable to walk significant distances and said he . had difficulty sitting and standing. Then . in January last year he admitted to playing competitive golf on a . regular basis but told police it was because he required exercise to . help with the pain caused by his health issues. On the day his trial was due to start, . Hollingworth, from Chorley, was informed he had been filmed playing . golf and those recordings were ready to be played to the court - and changed his plea to guilty. Nigel Beeson, defending, said the footage showed a man clearly 'in a position to swing a golf club.' Sentencing him, bench chairman John Connor said: 'You committed fraud for over ten years.

'You dishonestly failed to notify changes in your circumstances. You were given ample opportunity to come clean but you failed to do that. 'You knew exactly what you were doing.' Hollingworth, who struggled to stand up in court and had to use the wall for support, made no reaction as he was given a 16 week sentence, suspended for two years. He was also fitted with an electronic tag and given a six month curfew from the hours of 7pm to 7am. Covert: Hollingworth was filmed playing golf by investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions . Picking up the pieces: Hollingworth was given a 16 week sentence, suspended for two years and ordered to wear an electronic tag . Hollingworth was ordered to pay £200 pounds in court costs and an £80 victim surcharge, before limping out of court. Vernon Sanderson, DWP fraud manager in the North West, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. Busted: The surveillance showed Mr Hollingworth playing golf frequently and driving to and from the course . 'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 10:41 EST, 21 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:28 EST, 21 January 2014 . The commissioner also said that Christmas could be linked to the increase . There was a sharp leap in domestic violence in the last quarter of 2013 - with a rise of 15.5 per cent of victims suffering abuse at home, police have revealed. Speaking to a panel including mayor Boris Johnson at City Hall in London today, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that there had been a 5.1 per cent rise in the final quarter of last year of attacks with injuries, compared with the previous three months. He said he believes this was mainly driven by a 15.5 per cent increase in domestic violence. Sir Bernard said: 'It may be down to increased reporting rather than down to more domestic violence. 'Some of these increases have been in boroughs which have made the most increases to third-party reporting (where someone other than the victim reports the crime). 'We are not going to say it's something we are not concerned about, but it's too early to say it's a trend.' The number of repeat domestic violence victims fell by 10.2 per cent in the three months, suggesting that more new victims came forward in that time. The commissioner also said that Christmas could be linked to the increase, saying: 'You can imagine that when people are at home more there is more opportunity for domestic situations.' Violence with injury as a whole had risen by 5.4 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2012. Sandra . Horley, chief executive of domestic violence charity Refuge, said: . 'Domestic violence thrives on secrecy, so no one knows its true extent. Refuge works with women and children in a number of London boroughs and . we know that many of them live in fear before finding the courage to ask . for help. A huge leap in domestic violence has pushed violent injuries up by five per cent, police have suggested . 'But these figures show that more women in London are coming forward and reporting domestic violence to the police. This is a good thing. 'Domestic violence is a serious crime that kills two women a week in England and Wales. Through rigorous arresting and charging we can protect women and children by holding violent men accountable for these atrocious crimes.' But she said the charity receives fewer visits to its website and that there are fewer calls to the National Domestic Violence Helpline at Christmas than at other times of year. 'It can be very difficult for a woman experiencing domestic violence to access support during the festive period - a period when her abusive partner may be spending more time at home and monitoring her behaviour more closely than ever,' Ms Horley said. Separately, questions were also raised over why crime in London is not falling as quickly as in the rest of the country. In the decade to 2013 crime in the capital dropped 27 per cent, compared to 38 per cent across England and Wales and 50 per cent in urban areas classed as being similar to London. Chair of the London Assembly Budget and Performance Committee, John Biggs said: 'We are all pleased that crime has fallen by more than a quarter in London over the last 10 years.

This amounts to 5 million women and 2.9 million men. • Domestic violence has repeatedly been identified as a major factor leading to death in or related to pregnancy and childbirth. • In 2011/12, the police reported nearly 800,000 incidents of domestic violence. • Domestic violence accounts for 10 per cent of emergency calls. • Domestic violence has consistently accounted for between 16% and one quarter of all recorded violent crime. • There has been a 65 per cent increase in number of domestic violence prosecutions between 2005/6 and 2010/11 and a corresponding 99 per cent increase in number of defendents convicted. • Despite this, domestic violence conviction rates in the five years to 2011 stood at just 6.5 per cent of incidents reported to police – though a much higher proportion of around 70 per cent of those charged. • Women are much more likely than men to be the victim of multiple incidents of abuse, of different types of domestic abuse (partner abuse, family abuse, sexual assault and stalking) and in particular of sexual violence.","Metropolitan Police reveal 15.5 per cent increase in domestic violence .

A grandfather was battered to death when he went to help a landlord who was tackling a gang 'spoiling for a fight' outside his pub. Ray Cannon, 52, was set upon as he backed up his friend Bernard Roberts when a group of customers refused to take bottles and glasses back inside the bar. During the unprovoked attack, the victim, a self employed plasterer, was punched by two men and hit his head on the ground when he fell. He died at the scene shortly afterwards. Tragedy: Ray Cannon, pictured with his wife Jayne, was battered to death when he went to the aid of his landlord friend who was tackling vicious louts . His killing happened 11 weeks before Mr Cannon, who was married with three children and two grandchildren, was due to walk his daughter down the aisle. Today Matthew Hancock and Callum Belfield, both 22, were branded 'scumbags' by friends and family of the dead man as they were jailed for four years after they admitted manslaughter. A third man, Shane Davies, 21, was jailed for 12 months for affray after he admitted throwing a bottle at Mr Roberts. The tragedy occurred on May 10 last year after 'much-loved family man' Mr Cannon of Biddulph, Staffordshire, had been out with his friend. Sentencing: Matthew Hancock, left, and friend Callum Bellfield, right, admitted the manslaughter of hero grandfather Ray Cannon and were both jailed for more than four years . At 11.40pm they returned to the Jester pub, which Mr Roberts owned, to find Hancock and Belfield and their friends drinking in the car park. Victim: Ray Cannon had been out with friends when he was punched and could not be revived . Mr Roberts asked them to take their glasses and bottles inside but the mob became aggressive. Hancock punched Mr Cannon in the head, knocking him off backwards. As he fell Belfield threw a second punch, knocking him to the ground and causing him to fall unconscious. He died despite attempts to revive him. A post mortem was unable to establish whether Mr Cannon was killed by a punch to the face or by banging his head on the floor following the impact. In a statement read to the court, his widow Jayne Cannon who had been his childhood sweetheart said: 'I am alone. I have to face the rest of my life without the man who had been in my life since I was 14.' Stafford Crown Court was told Belfield, who was jailed for four years and three months, had written a letter to the court which referred to Ray's death as an 'accident'. He claimed he was 'bitterly and deeply sorry'. Father-of-two Hancock, who was jailed for four and a half years, claimed he expressed 'real regret and apology for the devastation he has caused.' But Judge Simon Tonking told them: 'There can be no doubt that Mr Cannon did nothing to provoke the attack which led to his death. It is plain from the CCTV footage that you were aggressive and spoiling for a fight. 'It is true that the consequences of what you did were not what you intended. But that does not alter the fact that what happened and its consequences were not an accident but a deliberate act of violence which caused a man to lose his life.' Addressing Ray's family, Judge Tonking added: 'You have suffered a loss which cannot be recompensed or compensated for by any sentence passed by any court.' Gang: Matthew Hancock and Callum Belfield set upon Mr Cannon because they were 'spoiling for a fight', and their victim's family said they were 'disgusted' by their sentences . But after the case Mr Cannon's father Ray snr, 74, said: 'We are absolutely disgusted with the sentence. Just over a four years for my son's life is nothing. Ray was a top man, a great family man and one of the best.' Family friend Steve Turner, 50 said: 'Ray was a perfect gentleman and a real character. 'There are some real scumbags on this earth and Ray was the last person who deserved any of this. There was no harm in him at all.' Pub landlord Gary Pearson said: 'We all lost a friend that night. Ray was very well liked. He was very quiet and always very polite - a real gentleman.' Det Chief Inspector Darren Harding, of Staffordshire Police said: 'What turned out to be a typical Friday night out with friends sadly ended in tragedy. 'Mr Cannon got caught up in a spur of the moment incident which escalated out of control. Our thoughts remain with Mr Cannon's family at this very difficult time.'","Ray Cannon, 52, was set upon as he helped his friend Bernard Roberts .

Sentenced: Police constable Sarah Greaves has been spared an immediate prison sentence for offering to supply cocaine . A policewoman who cheated on her husband with a drug dealer has been spared an immediate prison sentence for offering to supply cocaine. Police constable Sarah Greaves began an affair with mephedrone supplier Adam Dickinson who was involved in a multi-million pound drug-trafficking ring, a court heard. When he was arrested, police examined Dickinson’s mobile phone records and found hundreds of texts between himself and the female officer. Greaves, 29, who had worked as an officer in South Yorkshire since 2003, was still living with her husband at the time she began seeing Dickinson. Anthony Dunne, prosecuting, said hundreds of intimate texts found on Dickinson’s phone showed a 'familiarity with the use of cocaine' and efforts by the police officer to obtain cocaine from her boyfriend. She even boasted how she had cheated on drug tests at work when Dickinson, 31, had to take a test for a new job, the court was told. Mr Dunne said: 'It seems both defendants have experience of being able to cheat such drug tests.' Greaves sent a text saying: 'I passed one just two days after I had some before' and later asked Dickinson if he had used another person's urine to pass the test, Mr Dunne added. Another text showed how Dickinson could obtain cocaine at a reduce priced and Greaves replied: 'I appreciate the discount.' She said in another message: 'Just tell me where to meet so I can jack up.' When a deal was arranged she replied: 'Thank you, next time it won’t be a business transaction.' Greaves later asked Dickinson to pick up 'two bags' for her and a friend, named only as Vix, telling him to get the friend '£100 of decent stuff'. When Dickinson revealed he had got her some 'mint' stuff she replied: 'Wish I had ordered some for me now.' Greaves later said she was feeling upset and sent Dickinson a message which read: 'I’m tempted to stick both those Gs (grammes) up my nose but I won’t.' Both defendants were arrested in February, 2013 and Greaves told police she not believe Dickinson was dealing in drugs and her texts were an attempt to 'test' whether he could supply drugs. She claimed she had never arranged to sell drugs to anyone. Sheffield Crown Court heard that Dickinson played a minor role supplying and receiving mephedrone, also known as Mcat or Meow Meow, in a major South Yorkshire-based drug gang whose members were jailed for a total of 121 years last year over a cocaine conspiracy. Dickinson contacted members of the gang in September, 2011 and featured in their 'sophisticated' accounts as DJ - he was a disc jockey at the time - and was named as the source of some Mcat. 'He was a minor figure in the large group but we are still talking of kilos of Class B drugs and thousands of pounds,' said Mr Dunne. Greaves admitted offering to supply cocaine between August 15, 2012 and February 6, 2013. Dickinson, of Worksop, Nottinghamshire admitted the same charge and conspiracy to supply mephedrone. He has previous convictions for possessing small amounts of cocaine and amphetamines. Hearing: Sheffield Crown Court was told hundreds of intimate texts found on Dickinson's phone showed a 'familiarity with the use of cocaine' and efforts by the police officer to obtain cocaine from her boyfriend . Greaves, from Doncaster, quit South Yorkshire Police on November 13 last year. Kath Goddard, for Greaves, said: 'She finds her humiliation utterly complete.' She had only discussed the supply of cocaine on three or four occasions with Dickinson out of 'four months worth of intimate texts.' Tests after her arrest showed she was not a regular drug user 'however there was occasional exposure to cocaine.' She had continued her work as a police officer until her suspension in June, 2013 and she appeared to have 'lost her sense of direction and sense of identity' during 'sensitive' work undertaken for South Yorkshire Police. 'Her actions are totally at odds with the values of South Yorkshire Police. She is now a criminal.' South Yorkshire Police Detective Chief Constable Andy Holt . 'She never used or abused her position as a police officer to commit these offences,' said Miss Goddard. The court heard her marriage had broken down and she was suffering from issues dating back to her childhood. She had received counselling at work as her physical and mental health deteriorated. 'But she does not blame Dickinson in any way, shape or form for her offending,' said Miss Goddard. 'It may well be her relationship was symptomatic of the problems she faced and she was keeping repressed so she could continue with her job.' Miss Goddard continued: 'The only thing that she wanted to do with her life was to become a police officer. It is her abiding shame she has now brought discredit to the organisation she was proud to represent.' Nawaz Hussain, for Dickinson, said he was not a street dealer and it reflected 'social activity'. He said: 'He got into a relationship and he was eager to impress her.' Judge Paul Watson said Greaves was involved in trying to pass cocaine onto a third party but it was a 'lesser role' and she had not compromised her job as a police officer. He said: 'I have read a number of testaments which say that you were an exemplary officer. One describes you as outstanding and a police inspector says you were one of the best officers he had.' He gave her a 12-month jail term suspended for two years and ordered her to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. The judge said he was not imposing an immediate jail term and said: 'I may be criticised by some but I take the view that it is the right decision'. Dickinson was jailed for a total of 18 months. After the hearing, Detective Chief Constable Andy Holt said: 'Greaves was a former officer who betrayed the trust of the public and her hardworking colleagues. 'Her actions are totally at odds with the values of South Yorkshire Police. She is now a criminal.'","Sarah Greaves began an affair with mephedrone supplier Adam Dickinson .

Considering they included mustard gas and trench foot, the dangers to soldiers in the First World War were all too obvious. But their wives and daughters hardly lived comfortably either - toiling on dangerous machines and making deadly materials such as asbestos to keep the nation from grinding to a halt. A new exhibition reveals a very human side to the war effort - showing women smiling as they drink tea and carry tyres and rolled glass. Life during wartime: Striking new images of women working during the First World War have gone on display at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester. Left, workers stack thousands of oil cakes in a Lancashire factory in 1918, while women use a grain elevator at the mills of Messrs Rank and Sons in Birkenhead, right . Heavy load: Left, a woman working in the Charles MacIntosh and Sons rubber factory in Manchester, and another, right, carrying a piece of rolled glass at Pilkington Glass in St Helens, Merseyside. The huge prints are made from images taken by GP Lewis, an official photographer of the Home Front who specialised in heavy industry . Fancy a cuppa? Images like this one of women having a break in an Lancashire oil factory are on giant outdoor prints, pictured right with museum employee Alex Knight . The striking images were taken by GP Lewis, an official photographer of the Home Front who specialised in photographing women workers in the glass, vehicle and food factories which spread across Britain. They were taken in the industrial heartlands of the north of England, from Lancashire to Merseyside, showing women manufacturing everything from grain to oil cakes probably used in animal feed. The exhibition at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester is designed to show how life during wartime shaped the society in which we live today. Part of the centenary of the First World War this year, the outdoor exhibition features vast 16ft high black and white prints outside the museum's main entrance. Visitors can explore a recreated trench to the sounds of war along with soldiers whispering, singing and even frying bacon. They can also sit at an interactive table which shows how food reached soldiers fighting in Europe. Towering: The 16ft high black and white prints have gone on display at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester in tribute to women who worked on the Home Front . Food for thought: A man looks at one of the images, which shed light on an often unreported side of the First World War while soldiers were serving in the trenches . Danger: Although the peril to soldiers abroad was more obvious, those back home faced hazards too. Pictured left, women worked in a factory in Lancashire making asbestos, a cheap and versatile fireproofing material which it would later be proved caused a devastating form of aggressive cancer. The exhibition runs until September . GP Lewis, the photographer, was known for his spontaneous and human style which contrasted with the staged, formal photos by Horace Nicholls. Although conditions were terrible, the poverty of early 20th Century Britain meant it was better for many soldiers in the Army than it was back home. For one thing, they would be guaranteed a daily meal with meat, a rarity if they were with their families. Meanwhile for those left back home, the reverberations of the war would be felt in ways which few would have predicted - it arguably hastened the cause of women's rights. Wives who had spent their whole lives at home were suddenly empowered and doing the jobs only their husbands would have done before. If they could work like men, some thought, why not be treated on the same level? Most women were granted the vote in 1918, the year the war ended - although it took another 10 years before the right would be extended to those under 30. The exhibition at Imperial War Museum North, Manchester, runs until September 28.","Rare images show women manufacturing oil cakes, grain for food and deadly asbestos for fireproofing .

A man is battling to overcome his bizarre fear of ketchup which has stopped him enjoying normal meals for his whole life. Lee Sentino, 24, has a physical reaction to all types of sauce or condiment, and refuses to eat any 'wet foods'. The barman from Manchester says he starts gagging, feels sick and breaks out in a cold sweat when he is confronted with ketchup, gravy, custard or HP Sauce. Fear: Lee Sentino pictured eating dry pasta because he is terrified of all sauces and condiments . He does not remember when the crippling phobia started, but whenever he was growing up he had to be given special dry meals by his family. 'I don't really know why I had this phobia but I used to joke that my mum chased me around the house with a bottle of Heinz ketchup,' Mr Sentino said. 'I would eat like everyone else however my food has to be dry. If my family were having lasagne, I would have a separate meal. 'I could eat a good old-fashioned roast dinner, but I had to eat it without gravy. Bland: But Mr Sentino always eats his toast dry, and has to order special food in restaurants . Brave: The 24-year-old trying out a pudding as he attempts to conquer his lifelong phobia . 'When presented with something I didn't want to eat it I would gag and feel as if my body would reject it if I were to consume whatever it was.' Mr Sentino has lived with the fear for more than decades, but has become increasingly embarrassed by having to make a fuss whenever he ate in public. 'I never seen any counsellors about the issue because I presumed it would be fine to live like this forever,' he said. 'I've had a fair number of comments about it from people over the years and this only served to heighten my anxiety about it. Terrifying? Surprisingly many people claim to be scared of ketchup, such as spin doctor Alastair Campbell . 'It has been difficult to go to restaurants as most, if not all, of the menus wouldn't be suited to my needs. 'I remember the time I went to an Italian restaurant and just asked for a bowl of pasta. When I close my eyes, I still see the woman's look of confusion and disgust.' In the past year, Mr Sentino has become to fight back against his phobia, and has begun to eat food such as pies and some puddings. 'The thought of gloopy bottled sauces like ketchup and brown sauce still make me feel queasy, similarly custard is too much for me - I would rather just steer clear,' he said. While the fear of ketchup will strike many people as inexplicable, there are in fact many people who claim to have an uncontrollable revulsion to the sauce. One of the celebrity sufferers is former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who recently revealed that a mild fear of ketchup is called 'saltomaphobia' while an extreme reaction is 'equusmortusphobia'.","Lee Sentino, 24, has a lifelong phobia of all sauces and condiments .

People who are drunk and anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook, according to new research. A doctoral student has also discovered that people who use marijuana are less likely to be emotionally connected to the social networking site. Russell Clayton, from the University of Missouri School of Journalism, wanted to discover how involved Facebook’s one billion users become in the site. People who are drunk and anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook, according to new research . Heavy drinkers and people who are very anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook. People who use marijuana are less likely to be hooked. People who are lonely or anxious are more likely to use Facebook to connect with others. He surveyed more than 225 students about their perceived levels of loneliness, anxiousness, alcohol use and marijuana use. He found that students who reported higher levels of anxiousness and alcohol use were more emotionally connected to Facebook and to the social connections it facilitates. Mr Clayton also discovered that students who had higher levels of anxiety and loneliness were more likely to use Facebook as a platform to connect with others. ‘People who perceive themselves to be anxious are more likely to want to meet and connect with people online, as opposed to a more social, public setting,’ Mr Clayton said. ‘Also, when people who are emotionally connected to Facebook view pictures and statuses of their Facebook friends using alcohol, they are more motivated to engage in similar online behaviours in order to fit in socially.’ He added that because alcohol use is generally viewed as normative, or socially acceptable, among college students, increased alcohol use may cause an increase in emotional connectedness to Facebook. Students who drink heavily are more likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook than people who smoke cannabis are . By contrast, he also found that students who used marijuana were less emotionally connected with Facebook. ‘Marijuana use is less normative, meaning fewer people post on Facebook about using it,’ Mr Clayton said. ‘In turn, people who engage in marijuana use are less likely to be emotionally attached to Facebook.’ Clayton and his fellow researchers also found that students who reported high levels of perceived loneliness were not emotionally connected to Facebook, but use Facebook as a tool to connect with others. This study was published in the Journal of Computers in Human Behaviour.","Heavy drinkers are more connected to Facebook than cannabis smokers .

Tragedy: Lydia Bishop died in September 2012 on her first day at nursery, after telling her bereft mother she loved her . The mother of a three-year-old who died after becoming entangled in a rope on her first full day of nursery said today her daughter's last words to her were: 'I love you Mummy, see you later.' Lydia Bishop died on September 17, 2012, after she was found on the slide at York College nursery, which had 'fundamental flaws' in its health and safety procedures, Leeds Crown Court has been told. Nursery worker Sophee Redhead, 25, is standing trial for Lydia's manslaughter by gross negligence. Prosecutor Robert Smith QC has claimed Redhead saw the child walk towards the slide - but left Lydia 'to her own devices' for up to 20 minutes. The jury has been read a statement from Lydia's mother, Rebecca Dick, who was rushed in a police car to York Hospital's A&E, where medical staff were trying to revive her daughter. The jury has also heard that a visitor to the college, Saffron Stockwell, later told police she had seen a child lying motionless on the slide - but did not see any staff member in the outside play area. Rebecca Dick's statement, read to the jury, said: '[Lydia] asked me to bring her sweets for being good and said: ""I love you Mummy, see you later"".' But six hours later, Miss Dick recalled, she was called out of her course and rushed in a police car to hospital. 'It quickly became apparent that Lydia wasn't responding to any medical treatment. The doctor decided that she had died,' the statement said. She had difficulty realising that Lydia was dead, she said. 'Eventually I was allowed to take Lydia into a private room where we could be together.' Incident: Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard . The jury have heard that staff member Redhead had found Lydia shortly before 2:30pm lying unconscious and not breathing on a play slide. On trial: Sophee Redhead arriving at Leeds Crown Court last week, has denied a charge of manslaughter over the death of the three-year-old girl . She went on a half-day trial run there on September 10, 2012, a week before her death. When she went to collect her at the end of the afternoon, Lydia was sitting listening to a story. 'It was quite obvious that Lydia was enjoying herself and was in no rush to leave,' her mother said. On September 17, Lydia's parents took her to the nursery, where she arrived at 9am. Shortly after 3pm, a woman entered her classroom and took her hurriedly to the nursery. 'There were no children around. It seemed a little strange,' Mrs Dick's statement said. She was told Lydia had been involved in an accident and was taken to the hospital. A visitor to the college, Saffron Stockwell, later told police she had seen a child lying motionless with her hands by her side and her eyes closed halfway down the slide in the nursery's outside play area as she approached the college car park at 2:30pm. The jury heard she had not seen any staff member anywhere in the outside play area. She didn't tell anyone at the time because her own daughter sometimes played a game in which she lay in a similar way on a slide. Bosses: York College - which operated the nursery for children of staff, students and members of the public - denies failing to ensure people not in their employment are not exposed to a risk to their health and safety . Dr Anthony Powell, whose two children went to the nursery, told the jury its care was 'first class' and he had been 'astounded' to hear of the accident. Redhead, of York, denies manslaughter by gross negligence. She also denies an alternative charge of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of persons at work. York College denies a charge of failing to conduct an undertaking in such a way as to ensure persons not in their employment were not exposed to risks to health and safety. The trial continues.","Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing at York Collegeâ€™s nursery .

Germany's AA: ADAC says it is Europe's biggest auto club with more than 18 million members, offering breakdown help, safety tests and many other services to a nation of car enthusiasts . Fraud? The 2014 Car of the Year is the VW Golf which ADAC said received 34,299 votes before it was crowned last Thursday. But the ADAC's head of communications admitted that he inflated the figures by ten times the real amount because only 3,409 people had bothered to vote .

Michael Ramstetter, head of communications at ADAC until Friday morning, admitted that he was the one who fiddled the figures by ten times the real amount because only 3,409 people had voted. 'We're very sorry': ADAC's chief Karl Obermair, personally humiliated himself after he initially scolded media for reporting doubts about ADAC's vote-counting, apologised today . His confession came after prolonged rumours of vote fixing that were hitherto vigorously denied by the club. Shortly after being made to walk the plank on Friday Ramstetter said candidly: 'I’ve messed up and cooked the numbers.' His boss, head of ADAC Karl Obermair who fired him, has ordered a full investigation. It lays ADAC wide open to claims of kickbacks from car firms to promote their vehicles and a nasty suspicion that the whole competition has been a total fix for the decade it has been running. 'We've got our work cut out for us to repair the tarnished reputation,' said ADAC managing director Karl Obermair, who called Ramstetter's actions 'an inexcusable mistake'. 'We're very sorry,' added Obermair, personally humiliated himself after he initially scolded media for reporting doubts about ADAC's vote-counting. 'This strikes at the very core of our existence.

Ramstetter was also editor-in-chief of car industry magazine Motorworld and he has lost that post too. In the land where car is king and top marques like VW, BMW and Mercedes fill the nation’s driveways and autobahns, the fixing of the competition is front page news. VW, eager to distance itself from any part in the manipulation, has demanded ‘clarification’ about what went on.

A spaceship backed by Sir Richard Branson has made its first powered flight in a test that moves Virgin Galactic toward its goal of flying into space later this year. While SpaceShipTwo did not break out of the atmosphere during the test flight, it marked a significant milestone for Virgin Galactic, which intends to take passengers on suborbital joyrides. During the early morning flight, SpaceShipTwo, strapped beneath a twin-fuselage jet, took off from an airport runway in the Mojave Desert north of Los Angeles. Scroll down for video .

The craft did not break the atmosphere but the test moves Virgin Galactic toward its goal of flying into space later this year . The test began at 7:02 a.m. local . time when SS2 took off from Mojave Air and Space Port mated to . WhiteKnightTwo (WK2), Virgin Galactic’s carrier aircraft. Piloting SS2 were Mark Stucky, pilot, . and Mike Alsbury, co-pilot, who are test pilots for Scaled, which built . SS2 for Virgin Galactic. At the WK2 controls were Virgin . Galactic’s Chief Pilot Dave Mackay, assisted by Clint Nichols and Brian . Maisler, co-pilot and flight test engineer, respectively, for Scaled. Upon reaching 47,000 feet altitude and approximately 45 minutes into the flight, SS2 was released from WK2. After cross-checking data and . verifying stable control, the pilots triggered ignition of the rocket . motor, causing the main oxidizer valve to open and igniters to fire . within the fuel case. At this point, SS2 was propelled . forward and upward to a maximum altitude of 55,000 feet. The entire . engine burn lasted 16 seconds, as planned. During this time, SS2 went supersonic, achieving Mach 1.2. The entire rocket-powered flight test lasted just over 10 minutes, . culminating in a smooth landing for SS2 in Mojave at approximately 8 . a.m. local time. The jet released SpaceShipTwo, which ignited its engine for 16 seconds, then glided to a safe landing. Until now, SpaceShipTwo has only performed unpowered glide flights. Several powered flights are planned this summer, culminating with a dash into space targeted toward the end of the year. 'The first powered flight of Virgin . Spaceship Enterprise was without any doubt, our single most important . flight test to date,' said Virgin Galactic Founder Sir Richard Branson, . who was on the ground in Mojave to witness the occasion. 'For the first time, we were able to prove the key components of the system, fully integrated and in flight. 'Today’s supersonic success opens the . way for a rapid expansion of the spaceship’s powered flight envelope, . with a very realistic goal of full space flight by the year’s end. 'We saw history in the making today and I couldn’t be more proud of everyone involved.' SpaceShipTwo is the commercial version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 became the first private manned rocket to reach space. Since the historic flight, more than 500 aspiring space tourists have paid 200,000 dollars (£130,000) or placed deposits, waiting for a chance to float in weightlessness and view the Earth's curvature from 62 miles up.

No date has been set for the first commercial flight from a custom-designed spaceport in New Mexico, but Virgin Galactic executives have said it will come after testing is complete and it secures approval from the government. 'The rocket motor ignition went as planned, with the expected burn duration, good engine performance and solid vehicle handling qualities throughout,' said Virgin Galactic President & CEO George Whitesides. 'The successful outcome of this test marks a pivotal point for our program. 'We will now embark on a handful of similar powered flight tests, and then make our first test flight to space.'

Facebook has unveiled a major redesign of its Newsfeed - and says it wants it to look more like a personalised magazine or newspaper. Mark Zuckerberg said the radical overhaul reflects the huge amount of pictures being shared on the social networking site - which he revealed is now over 50% of the items shared. However, it was also revealed that along with bigger pictures, the advertisments Facebook's billion users will see will get bigger. Scroll down for video of the new design . Facebook's new design makes pictures more prominent, with videos and photo albums easier to see . All Friends - a feed that shows you everything your friends are sharing . Photos - a feed with nothing but photos from your friends and the Pages you like . Music - a feed with posts about the music you listen to . Following - a feed with the latest news from the Pages you like and the people you follow . 'Our mission is to make the world more open and connected,' said Zuckerberg at the launch. 'Newsfeed is one of the most important services we build, and we want to to give people around the world the best personalised news.' Zuckerberg had singled out the feature as in need of a makeover as recently as January, when the company introduced 'graph search' to address inadequacies in allowing users to trawl for information across the world's largest social network. Robyn Morris, the designer of the new Newsfeed, admitted that as pictures got bigger for users, so would ads. 'Integrating ads isn't something we really thought about,' he claimed. 'This redesign is about letting the content shine - whether that's from a musician, sponsored or from friends. 'The adverts will be bigger and richer, along with everything else.' Julie Zhuo, Facebook's director of design, said the firm was 'putting these pictures front and centre - they are more immersive.' She said the new designed was similar to a magazine table of contents. 'The new newsfeed is richer, simpler more beautiful newsfeed or desktop and mobile,' she said. The firm also revealed the new look will make the mobile phone and tablet apps look more like the desktop site. The changes are Facebook's also attempt to . learn more about its users and keep people coming back so the company . can sell more advertising. Robyn Morris, the designer of the new Newsfeed, told MailOnline he has been working on the project for a year. 'When we began we weren't sure what we would be doing,' he admitted. 'One early study used cut up paper to get people to rearrange their newsfeed. 'We found people really want to be able to see just posts from friends, and see photos . 'We decided if we're going to be showing photos, we need to have a design that gave them centre stage.' The new look was inspired by the firm's mobile apps. 'It starts to feel like mobile and desktop are made of the same material, we don't want people to have to learn things twice.' Morris also said the firm still treated Facebook as a third party app -even thought the firm owns the retro picture service. 'Instagram remain an independent app - even thought they are in house . It's been really interesting to have them here, to make sure third party apps look good - they are guinea pigs in many ways. The team behind the redesign was tiny - with Morris and one other designer working with engineers. 'The design team was small - me and one other designer, in fact. 'It's been a big undertaking, it's a high profile page - and we've had a lot of help. 'We've been bunkered down in a room working closely with engineers - 15 of us in a conference room turned war room.' 'Panda was the mascot - black and white like a newspaper, so somewhere along the way we adopted it - we all call each other pandas.' New music pages for bands were also revealed, with this one showing the new design for Justin Timberlake . Facebook's new album page shows more photos than the current version . Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the new look at the firm's Menlo Park HQ . The event comes a month after a Pew study reported that many Facebook users take a break from the site for weeks at a time. The report, from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project, found that some 61 percent of Facebook users had taken a hiatus for reasons that range from boredom to too much irrelevant information to Lent. Overall, though, Facebook's user base is growing, especially on mobile devices. At last count it had 1.06 billion active monthly accounts. Mark Zuckerberg said the redesign was triggered by a huge increase in pictures being shared on the service, with 50% of items now being shared photos . Facebook's new design will also make the site look the same on both desktop and mobile computers . The number of people who access Facebook daily is also on the rise. That said, even the company has acknowledged that some of its users, especially the younger ones, are migrating to substitutes, but so far this has not meant an overall decline in user numbers. The world's largest social network is moving to regain Wall Street's confidence after a botched IPO last year, addressing concerns about its long-term prospects - many of which center on an industry-wide shift toward the use of mobile devices. Facebook shares, which are still more than a quarter off their IPO price of $38, were up 2 percent at $27.99 on Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq. Facebook and Google, which both got their start on desktop computers, are now managing a transition of their products onto smartphones and tablets, which typically yield less revenue than on PCs. The two Internet mainstays are also waging a war for revenue in mobile advertising - a market that is still small compared with the traditional desktop but that is growing exponentially. In terms of overall mobile advertising, Google commanded a 53.5 percent share in 2012, aided by its dominance in search-based ads. Facebook had just 8.4 percent, a distant runner-up, according to estimates from research house eMarketer. 'For example, we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with Facebook in favor of increased engagement with other products and services such as Instagram,' the company said last month in the ""risk factors"" of its annual report. 'In the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in user engagement and our business could be harmed.'

"By . Cherry Maslen . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 21 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 21 December 2013 . Could this be the cutest cottage in Britain? This hexagonal-shaped stone thatch looks as if it could be lived in by a Hobbit – but, in fact, the impeccably restored two-bedroom Gingerbread Cottage is a former gatehouse to the Trelowarren estate near Helston, Cornwall. Visitors are certainly charmed by it – it’s one of the most photographed buildings in Gweek, the pretty village at the head of the Helford River in beautiful south-west Cornwall. And such is its allure that it has been let out successfully, all year round,  as a holiday cottage. Guests have included a honeymoon couple from Austria. Living in a fantasy world: Owner Lizzie Flint, 60, and her late husband John, completely redecorated Gingerbread Cottage in Gweek village, near Helston, Cornwall . Gingerbread Cottage’s front door leads  into a lobby and on to a cosy kitchen with slate floor, handcrafted kitchen units, table and chairs and inglenook fireplace. The deep window recesses in the cottage reveal the thickness of the 18th Century stone walls, with some of the stonework exposed and the rest plastered and painted. The sitting room has comfy armchairs and the new ground-floor bathroom is immaculate, with white and turquoise tiling and exposed beams in the ceiling. Up the winding staircase from the sitting room are two pretty bedrooms under the thatch, divided by an exposed stone wall and with dramatically sloping ceilings. Idyllic: One of the two bedrooms in the £295,000 cottage now for sale . A window seat with plush pink cushions makes an irresistible spot from which to  gaze through the Hobbit window above the arched front door. Outside, the gardens are surrounded by a neatly painted picket fence. Every detail in this little Grade II listed house, from the hand-placed pieces of slate in the kitchen floor to the carefully chosen bathroom accessories,  fits so perfectly that it’s hard  to imagine it as the run-down wreck it was when owner Lizzie Flint first fell in love  with it. She and her husband John, who lived in  the Midlands, had loved coming to Cornwall on holiday since the 1970s, and vowed they would one day move there. They spotted that the cottage was  for sale in 2004. ‘It had been on the market for 12 months apparently, but it was such a mess that nobody wanted it,’ says Lizzie. ‘But even though it needed work, I thought it was the most perfect cottage I’d ever seen. I remember standing in the garden with a gin and tonic  once it was ours, thrilled to bits.’ Signed, sealed, delivered: The £295,000 cottage is a former gatehouse to the Trelowarren estate in Cornwall . They bought it for £32,000, and for . the next few years travelled from the Midlands at weekends whenever they . could, doing it up themselves a bit at  a time. ‘We . slept on a mattress  in sleeping bags, and stuffed carrier bags in the . cracks in the walls to keep out the wind, but we were incredibly happy,’ says Lizzie. John was a carpenter by trade, so was  able to do all the joinery, as well as most of the other work, calling in craftsmen only when needed. And there was a lot to be done, including rewiring, replastering, rethatching, flooring, fitting a new kitchen and bathroom and landscaping. John spent a whole two-week holiday painstakingly repairing the beautiful arched windows. When they finally moved to Cornwall in 2008, they had both retired, Lizzie from  her job in the police force and John from  his carpentry business. He has just heard about the cottage: Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins in the latest Hobbit film . They lived in a four-bedroom house they  had also bought in a nearby village and  John spent the next ten months working his way through the cottage, getting everything finished to his and Lizzie’s high standards. By 2009, Gingerbread Cottage was ready  to rent out – and then, tragically, John was killed in a road accident in 2010. Now 60-year-old Lizzie has decided that it’s time for her  to move on, and is selling the cottage  for £295,000. ‘It will be a great pity to lose the cottage because it has so many special memories,’ she says. ‘John and I wanted to rescue it  and we did. I’ll always be really proud of  what we achieved.’ Claire Ray, marketing manager at Unique Home Stays, which specialises in luxury holiday properties, understands the appeal of one-off homes like this. ‘We have properties of all sizes which do very well, but the ones that do the best are the sleeps-two boltholes,’ she says. ‘People are tripping over themselves to book them and love the chance to stay somewhere unusual and romantic, immersed in luxury and seclusion.’ She knows of one ‘sleeps-two’ bolthole in Cornwall which achieved 98 per cent occupancy in a year, with a gross annual revenue in excess of £31,000. Lizzie has certainly done everything possible to make stays at Gingerbread Cottage special. She always leaves flowers and cream teas with strawberries for guests, and for Christmas visitors she even leaves wrapped presents. ‘It’s gorgeous here at Christmas,’ she says. ‘The Gweek Silver Band marches through the village on Christmas morning and stops right outside the cottage. ‘Everyone has mulled  wine and there’s a magical  atmosphere. ‘It’s just like a scene from  a Christmas card.’ Miller Countrywide, 01326 389366, millercountrywide.co.uk .","Gingerbread Cottage near Helston, Cornwall is on the market for £295,000 .

The average price of a home will be up to £14,000 more expensive in 12 months’ time with prices rising across Britain, the Halifax said yesterday. Amid fears the housing market is over-heating, the bank insisted there is ‘little sign of the excessive behaviour associated with a house price bubble at present.’ At present, the average price of a home is £175,000, but this is set to rise more than three times faster than typical pay rises next year. Average house prices will be up to £14,000 more expensive in a year's time, according to the Halifax . House prices will rise ‘between four and eight per cent next year.’ By comparison, a typical private sector worker will get a 2.5 per cent pay rise. If prices rise by eight per cent at the top end of the forecast, this would add £13,992 to the price of the average home, or just under £7,000 if they rise by only four per cent. The Halifax said house prices will rise in all regions, rather than only taking place in London and the South East but leaving the rest of the UK in the cold. For example, the price of a home in London’s exclusive borough of Kensington and Chelsea has rocketed to an all-time record of £1.1million, according to the Land Registry. In the North East, prices have fallen sharply to £96,200, far below a peak of £130,000 six years ago. Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax, said: ‘There are signs that the improvement is becoming more broadly-based with much of the country now recording price rises. ‘We expect the regional pattern to be more even in 2014 with all regions experiencing price gains.’ The price of a home in London's borough of Kensington and Chelsea has rocketed to an all-time record of £1.1million, according to the Land Registry . He dismissed fears of a housing bubble, which have been fuelled by Government-backed schemes helping people to buy homes for up to £600,000 with a deposit of just five per cent. The lack of housebuilding is also a concern. Just 106,500 new homes were built in England last year, but the ‘required’ number is 240,000, according to the National Housing Federation. This year, house prices have risen by nearly eight per cent. Mr Ellis said: ‘Another year of similar price rises to those in 2013 next year would not be sufficient to create a bubble.’ Before the credit crunch struck, house prices were rising considerably faster than they are today, he said. In August 1999, the average home cost £78,959. Eight years later in August 2007 - the month that the credit crunch began - prices were 150 per cent higher, reaching their peak of £199,612. The Halifax’s forecast follows a series of house price forecasts in recent weeks which have predicted that house prices will rise sharply over the next few years. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors predicts house price will rise by eight per cent in 2014, although it expects there will be significant regional variations. In London, prices will rise by 11 per cent, the fastest of the UK regions, compared to only four per cent in Northern Ireland, the smallest rise. Peter Bolton King, global residential director of RICS, said: ‘While the number of new homes being built is now on the rise, it still won’t be anywhere near enough to meet demand. ‘We expect the problem of insufficient housing stock to be the main driver behind price increases over the next twelve months.’ Around 400,000 people in Britain are ‘property millionaires’, a record number, according to a recent report by the property website Zoopla.co.uk. The National Housing Federation recently warned the situation is ‘dysfunctional’, adding: ‘England’s housing market is broken.’","Amid fears market is over-heating, Halifax has said there is 'little sign of the excessive behaviour associated with a house price bubble at present'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are a step closer to moving in to their new country home after builders finished re-roofing the house. Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, has had its roof covered in traditional clay pantiles which have rendered it a bright shade of orange. Roofers apparently worked flat-out to get the tiles in place and make the building watertight in time for the Christmas break. Finished: The new bright orange roof has been installed on Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk . New country house: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to move in to the home . Controversial: Some locals have compared the new colour of the roof to 'a vulgar Barratt home' Some locals have previously criticised the renovation, saying it makes the house look like 'a vulgar Barratt home', although the tiles are expected to lose their bright hue as they weather over the next year. Despite the completion of the new roof, the 200-year-old hall will not be ready for its new inhabitants for some time yet. Much of the building, which was previously leased from the Queen as a private home, is still covered in scaffolding, while a skip has been left in the driveway. It is believed that work on the house has been hampered by poor weather conditions in recent weeks as well as the short days. Building works: Roofers work on the house replacing the tiles; they have finished in time for Christmas . Work in progress: The house will not be ready for the Cambridges to move in until the New Year . Upgrade: The house has undergone numerous renovations, including security measures . Dormer windows set into the roof have been boarded up as they await new frames to replace ones which have rotted away. Many members of the Royal Family will be spending Christmas at Sandringham - the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived last Friday, while others are expected tonight or tomorrow. Villagers believe that William and Kate will pay a visit to Anmer during their stay on the estate in order to check up on the progress of the building work. Last year, the couple broke with tradition by spending Christmas together at the Middleton family home. As it was: Anmer Hall pictured before the start of this year's renovation works . Stately home: The house will be a country retreat for the couple, who live in Kensington Palace . Much of the work at Anmer Hall has involved installing security equipment to protect the couple, while contractors connected a new underground electricity cable to the hall last week. King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council approved a range of improvements at the hall including a new driveway sweeping across a field. But workers have still not finished the driveway and a new gate which is being installed further down a lane to give the couple more privacy. A garden room measuring 16ft by 16ft is also being added on the kitchen, overlooking a patio with a pergola constructed of stone columns with oak beams. Family: William and Kate will be spending this Christmas at Sandringham with the Queen . Security has been stepped up with new signs erected warning that the area is 'strictly private' and that trespassing is a criminal offence. Two marked police cars have been guarding the entrances to the hall every day. The Duke and Duchess recently moved into their new London home - the 21-room Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, which has been renovated at a cost to taxpayers of £1.1million. But all the work to Anmer Hall will be paid for by the Royal Family as it is privately owned by the Queen. A villager said: 'It appears that no expense is being spared for William and Kate. Everything at the hall is being done to a very high standard.'","Anmer Hall on Sandringham estate is being renovated for William and Kate .

At the top is a perfectly standard busy shopping street. But a few minutes down the hill, and past  a park, there is a large and very pretty cemetery, dotted with yew trees, with lush grass growing among the headstones. At the very bottom, before a thick wood of oak trees and behind the iron gate, appears a Victorian house. With Gothic arches, stained-glass windows and a sturdy wooden front door, it brings to mind the Gingerbread House in Hansel And Gretel. Authentic: Old Oaks Lodge, set in the Ford Park Cemetery in Plymouth, was built in the 1840s for the cemetery groundskeeper . A cemetery may seem a strange place to live. But if you want a quiet setting, easy access to a busy city centre and an old house with a history, then five-bedroom Old Oaks Lodge, set in the Ford Park Cemetery and on the market for £390,000, might be ideal. ‘As soon as we saw the lodge, we knew we had to have it,’ says Philip Johnson, 70, who used to run a water taxi business on Plymouth quayside. Now retired, he and wife Janice, 67, want to move somewhere with more outdoor space for their collection of vintage cars. ‘The house was built in the 1840s – about  the same time as the cemetery and chapel – for the groundsmen who maintained the graveyard,’ Philip explains. Indeed, when they moved in, the house was very basic, with just a couple of large rooms and not even a proper staircase. The Johnsons have maintained the original church-like feel while also making a cosy living area. Gothic romance: One of the five-bedroom Old Oaks Lodge's sitting rooms has stained glass windows . ‘We wanted to create an open-plan space downstairs which wasn’t chilly,’ says Philip. This is successfully achieved by having three rooms – the sitting room, kitchen and dining room – all flowing into each other, with no doors. The 15ft-high ceiling of the sitting room has gold mouldings. A wood burner ensures that the room is pleasantly warm. ‘There is underfloor heating as well,’ Philip points out. This comes up through a church-style green painted iron grate. All the windows in the house have stained glass. In this room, the sun shines through yellow and green glass. The kitchen has an Aga as well as a double oven – Janice finds it easy to cook for 20 when they have the whole family over for Christmas, including their two children and four grandchildren. The dining room leads through to another sitting room – with high ceilings and a massive original fireplace. These windows are stained red and blue. Upstairs are two bedrooms and a bathroom, which the couple use as a master suite, with the smaller bedroom acting as a dressing room. It is downstairs – down a winding ornate red iron staircase – that the house takes on a Tardis-like quality. Hero: George Hinckley was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing wounded comrades during the Taiping Rebellion in 1862 . Here, below the house and where women used to make the funeral wreaths, there are three further bedrooms and two more bathrooms. ‘When we have family to stay, we all feel as though we have our own space,’ says Philip. In the main bedroom, a French window leads out into the garden, and an en suite bathroom has a Jackson Pollock-style painted red glass door. ‘I did that myself,’ Philip says proudly. A huge green-tiled bathroom has mirrors around all the walls and a working fireplace next to the porcelain bath. ‘Light the fire, light a few candles, and it’s bliss,’ says Janice. The garden is walled, with a Victorian-style summer house and a three-car garage which has a utility room, including a washing machine, sink and toilet. ‘This could be used as separate accommodation,’ muses Philip. He uses it for his vintage car collection, which includes a 1935 Daimler, one of the procession cars from the funeral of George VI. For some, the thought of being surrounded by gravestones may be disturbing, but in  fact there is an air of quiet peace . . Walking up the hill to the chapel, where there is a separate visitors’ centre and cafe, friendly dog-walkers nod and smile, and the gravestones make fascinating reading. On one lies a poppy wreath, left over from Remembrance Sunday. Although the engraving on the headstone is now faded with time, Captain Andrew Henry, VC, is still remembered by Plymouth residents. The cemetery also contains the final resting place of another VC hero, naval rating George Hinckley, who was awarded the honour for rescuing wounded comrades during the Taiping Rebellion in 1862. When the cemetery’s gates close every afternoon, the Johnsons’ grandchildren can play in the 34 acres of grassy cemetery. ‘It’s beautiful and safe for them,’ says Janice. ‘This stunning Grade II listed property is one that’s brimming with character and history,’ says Gareth Cooper at estate agent Fulfords. ‘This is one of those unique homes that are rarely available.’ fulfords.co.uk, 01752 223 355 .","Old Oaks Lodge is set in the Ford Park Cemetery in central Plymouth .

One in four university students now lives at home with their parents, heralding the end of an era for a generation of school leavers who once dreamed of independence. In the last decade the number of undergraduates choosing to stay with mum and dad has risen by 50 per cent. Soaring living costs and a trebling of tuition fees are forcing growing numbers of students to abandon hopes of moving out. Sign of the times: The proportion of students living with their parents has gone from 20 per cent to 25 per cent in a decade . The cost of being a student has soared in recent years, and can easily top £22,000 including course charges, living costs, rent, food and travel. The National Union of Students (NUS) says accommodation costs have doubled in the last 10 years, while the coalition has increased tuition fees from £3,000 to up to £9,000-a-year. The rush in recent years for half of all young people to go to university has increased the pressure, but many find they cannot afford to live away from home. It suggests some students are being forced to choose to study at universities closer to where they grew up, even if they do not offer their preferred courses. The increase in tuition fees to up to £9,000-a-year has added to the cost of being a student . Latest figures show that 237,000 undergraduates were living with their parents in 2011-12, compared to 672,000 living away from home. A similar ratio applies to older students and post-graduates, according to figures published by universities minister David Willetts. In 2002-03, fewer than 20 per cent of students lived at home. Colum McGuire, NUS Vice President (Welfare), said: ‘More research needs to be done to understand this increase. Some students are choosing different routes into higher education, such as further education colleges, but a rise would not be surprising considering that accommodation costs have doubled in the last decade, and, aside from tuition fees, which have now tripled at many universities, students are also expected to pay out for extra academic expenses. Former Universities Secretary John Denham said more students should live at home, to save them and the taxpayer money . ‘Many students at university are facing a cost of living crisis, with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials. ‘Students shouldn’t be put in a position where they feel they need to sacrifice going to their ideal university by choosing an institution that is close to home so they can save on their living costs.’ However, it has been claimed that if the expansion of degrees is to continue more students will have to choose to study close to their parents’ home. John Denham, who was Universities Secretary in Gordon Brown’s Cabinet, said more should be spent on higher education but studying close to home was not necessarily a bad thing. Mr Denham, who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions, said: ‘The overwhelming expansion in student numbers has been in students living away from home, which is much more expensive for the taxpayer and more expensive for the student. I think the interesting question this raises is whether we shouldn’t be trying to look at enabling more students to get a high quality education closer to home. ‘Many students feel they have to make themselves financially worse off in order to do the course that they want to do. ‘I think as a country we actually need to spend more of our national wealth and private wealth on higher education than we do at the moment.’","237,000 university students living at home with parents, up 50% in 10 years .

Popular: Grüner Veltliner is the most popular Austrian wine, accounting for 36 per cent of the nation's vineyards . It is almost three decades since millions of bottles were tainted with engine coolant. Now, finally, the Austrian wine industry appears to be off the rack - with a huge boost in popularity at Waitrose. The upmarket supermarket chain recorded a 53 per cent rise in sales last year compared to the year before, after a steep rise in the number of vineyards. The Times reported the number of large-scale vineyards in Austria has increased from 1,000 five years ago to 1,600 in 2012, with wine now worth more than £115 million to the national economy. The news comes 29 years after millions of bottles of Austrian wine were tainted with diethylene glycol in one of the biggest food and drink scandals of the last century. Growers had added the sweet-tasting chemical, used to make antifreeze, in a desperate bid to make batches of cheap, unappealing wine more appetising. West Germany banned all Austrian wine completely and several people were arrested and fined over the scandal. In all, 36 million bottles were destroyed and had to be poured into the ovens of a cement plant as a cooling agent because they could not be emptied into the sewers. The scandal almost destroyed the Austrian wine market completely, with legitimate merchants unable to convince foreign buyers that their bottles would not be suspect. A year later, the amount of Austrian wine being exported had dropped by 90 per cent. However, the strict laws brought in after the scandal gave growers the chance to abandon the 'pile high, sell cheap' culture favoured before by many in Austria. Boost: Austrian wines have seen a leap in sales of 53 per cent year-on-year at Waitrose . Waitrose wine buyer Cat Lomax told the Times the quality of wine emerging from the country has transformed. Willi Klinger, general manager of the Austrian Wine Marketing Board, told the newspaper demand from the UK was outstripping that of almost every other country. 'The increase did not come from the traditionally strong markets of Germany, Switzerland and the U.S., but from the former ""problem children"" like Scandinavia, the Beneleux countries, United Kingdom and Japan,' he said. Austrian white wines, grown from grapes along the banks of the River Danube, are said to go especially well with Thai and Japanese food.","Austria's market almost collapsed completely after the 1985 scandal .

A donations page set up by the family of a seasoned sky diver who was seriously injured when he lost control of his parachute has paid for his medical bills and then some. Ben Cornick, 31, fell 12,000 feet Tuesday without anything to slow his fall but the parked van he landed on at an estimated 40mph. A lack of health insurance led to him paying around $33,000 in medical bills until internet samaritans donated more than enough to help defray the cost. The donations were made through a Facebook page that has garnered more than 6,800 members and over $80,000 in donations in less than a week. Skydiver Ben Cornick who needs emergency on his leg following a horrific skydiving accident in Fiji . Mr Cornick, a father-of-one, was attempting a 12,000ft jump when he lost control of his parachute . Mr Cornick's troubles began shortly after jumping out of the plane while 12,000 feet above Fiji. He lost control of his parachute due to a faulty steering toggle, and crash landed at roughly 40mph into a parked van. Mr Cornick broke both his leg in three places and snapped his arm in half - doctors initially feared he may lose the leg if it wasn't operated on immediately. The Swansea native is a sky diving instructor in Fiji and Australia with more than 1,000 jumps under his belt, it was the first time he had an accident of this magnitude. His health insurance did not cover the jump due to a quirk in regulations regarding the tour group he was with, according to a relative who posted on the Facebook page. Slowly recovering: Mr Cornick shown in an Auckland hospital after his surgeries . Ready to go: Mr Cornick being loaded into the plane to Auckland . In agony: The pain momentarily gets the best of the injured skydiver . Fijian doctors . said they were unable to pin his limbs together . and said he would need to be flown to New Zealand, on an . emergency flight. This forced him to have to pay about . $33,000 in medical bills upfront before being airlifted to Auckland . for surgeries to save his leg and repair other damage to his body. The Welsh skydiver's cousin Ricky Davies created a Facebook donations page and reached the fundraising goal within hours. What happened next was completely unexpected, the page more than doubled its initial target and raised more than enough to pay for the surgery and follow up care. Even more astonishing, a British physical therapist offered free rehabilitation services for the duration of Mr Cornick's recovery, accroding to a post on the Facebook page. Mr Cornick crash-landed into a van at 40mph - breaking both his arm and his leg in tree places . An Xray showing the skydiver's femur broken in 3 places (left) and the break in his arm (right) The skydiver was told by hospital staff in Fiji he would need £20,000 for a transfer to Auckland to have surgery . The skydiver pictured falling out of a plane. He had recently become a father to a son called Alfie . Mr Davies, a skydiver himself, said: 'While he was doing the swoop the toggle came out of his hand and he hadn't completed the turn.' This caused Mr Cornick to spiral out of control and make the crash landing, he is lucky to be alive. 'I spoke to Ben and he was a bit groggy from the drugs he is on but that's what I could make out,' Mr Davies added. 'His right femur snapped in three places. 'His left arm between his shoulder and elbow is in half and he has got cuts and bruises and damaged his knee- cap. 'In Fiji, they have only got small hospitals. They had a look at him but couldn't pin and screw that together.' In the ambulance: Mr Cornick as he's taken from the accident to a hospital in Fiji . With his son: Mr Cornick is shown here with his 11-month-old son . Friends of the experienced skydiver raised the money in a matter of hours, and he was moved to New Zealand . Mr Davie added: 'His parents haven't got that sort of money, I haven't got that sort of money. 'I . got on Facebook and spoke to a few skydivers to see if they had any . contacts. I put up the page where we can all go. 'Now, we have saved his . leg and possibly his life.' Mr Cornick's ordeal has received widespread media attention around the world, likely leading to the high number of donations. Being stuck with the full bill would have put a serious crimp in his ability to care for his 11-month-old son. Mr Cornick was due to have surgery last night. His family said before the procedure he was doing well . Mr Cornick's family are continuing to appeal for money as they are unsure whether he will need further medical care . Mr Davies told the Western Mail: 'The . page was set up at about 9pm or 10pm on Wednesday. I think it was about . 16 hours from starting the Facebook page that we accomplished the ($33,000). 'The guys in . Auckland wouldn't transport Ben until they had the money up front. It is . actually another, fellow skydiver who paid the (fees) up front on my . word that I would give him the money back.' Mr Davies said they did not know what the cost of the operation or Ben's continued medical care would be, so the fundraising will carry on.","Ben Cornick, 31, attempted a 12,000ft jump over the South Pacific island .

He's spent most of the last seven years in prison, has been arrested more than 20 times and missed seeing his children grow up.Why? Because 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough simply won't keep his clothes on in public. Now Mr Gough, 55, from Hampshire, is to appear in a new documentary in which he attempts to explain the reasoning behind the nudity that has left him a stranger to his teenage son and daughter. Although imprisoned earlier this month, this time for close to two years, the former marine claims that his love of baring all is  - despite the repeated spells in jail - all about freedom. Defiant: Stephen Gough, aka the Naked Rambler, says he has no plans to stop walking while in the buff . Long suffering: Alison Ward, Mr Gough's former wife, finds his behaviour hard to understand . 'I like wearing clothes but the thing . about clothes is that I want to be able to wear what I want to wear,' he explains in a scene from the BBC One film. 'I . get up in the morning and I want to put on what I want... Some people, . like naturists and that, nudists, they heat up their house especially so . they can go naked and I think that's nuts. I stand for freedom.' One person who's far from convinced by his claims is his former wife Alison Ward, who says she's baffled by his insistence on going naked. 'It is extraordinary, really,' she says. 'I don't . think the legal system can believe that someone, given the choice of ""put . your clothes on and you're a free man"" or ""you don't and we'll lock you . up in solitary confinement"", would choose ""oh, solitary confinement for . me please"". 'I don't think anyone saw that coming.' Since his nude rambling career began with a walk from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2004, Mr Gough has been arrested countless times and has spent years in prison. Although appearing nude in public isn't technically a crime, if someone complains, it can be considered a breach of the peace or more seriously, an outrage to public decency. Mr Gough's most recent conviction, for breaching an ASBO that banned him from being naked in public places, resulted in a 16-month sentence. Recorder John Williams, who presided over the court, told him: 'I’m afraid there is going to be a revolving door in and out of prison, . because you are intent on flouting these orders and there is absolutely . no way you are going to comply with them.’ Chilly: During the new film, Mr Gough is seen walking in the rain, the snow and in temperatures of -1 while nude . Under arrest: Mr Gough photographed during one of his many arrests. There have now been more than 20 . Home: After walking back from Scotland last year, Mr Gough was in trouble within days of arriving . It's an attitude that has left his 86-year-old mother Nora baffled. 'I don't understand why he's doing it,' she sighs. 'I . never have understood it. I know it's something to . do with freedom but he's not free, is he? Stuck in jail for six . years... That's not free! 'It seems that's a useless way of living your . life to me.' Gough, however, believes that his mission to share his insight about the freedom nudity brings is important and claims that his naked rambling is of genuine help to people. 'I help them to confront their . false beliefs about who they are,' he explains. They need someone like me to come along and . challenge them. 'We consider ourselves a democratic and free society but how far does that go? There's a bigger thing at stake.' He pauses and adds: 'I'm not sure what it . is but... ' before trailing off. Once again, it seems that not every member of the public is happy to embrace his views. During one scene in the new film, he's seen blithely wandering past a school as the children leave - much to the outrage of the parents. In another, he's heckled by an irate passer-by in Scotland, who tells him: 'You're a disgrace! A real disgrace! He adds: 'That . does not do any good in this day and age for this country. What point . is he trying to prove? He's not proving anything to anyone apart from . that he's an idiot.' Despite the brickbats and the ever-growing amount of time spent at Her Majesty's pleasure, Gough remains committed to his unusual mission, despite the impact it has had on his family. 'That's just how life's turned out,' he muses. 'I don't . regret it, even though it means I've been separated from my children. 'Sometimes, you've got to follow your passions in life even when that . means you can't be with your children or people you love.' You can only hope that his children agree.

Britain has been named as the gout capital of Europe with one in 40 people suffering the condition which commonly causes swelling and pain to the big toe . Our love of alcohol and reliance on junk food has made Britain into the country worst affected by gout in Europe, researchers claim. A record one in 40 people in the UK have been diagnosed with the painful arthritic disorder that famously afflicted Henry VIII – bringing the total number of patients with the condition to around 1.5million. Historically known as ‘the disease of kings’, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle. A new study, published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, suggests 21st century diets are fuelling a surge in cases, with the UK ahead of Germany and Italy. However two-thirds of sufferers are still not being prescribed drugs for the condition – a statistic that has remained unchanged since the late 1990s, according to scientists. Lead researcher Dr Weiya Zhang, from Nottingham City Hospital, said ‘We are eating too much junk food. 'We are also drinking a lot of alcohol. All these things cause gout. ‘The prevalence of gout has risen in the past 16 years and is now the highest reported within Europe.’ ‘But it is curable, with the right drugs, and that is also something we are not doing very well at because gout is extremely painful if left untreated. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis, with sudden onset of acute pain, redness and swelling in peripheral joints, most commonly the joint in the big toe. It is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which is related to high uric acid in the blood, and can be alleviated with urate-lowering treatment (ULT). The condition used to be rare among young people, but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people. 'Despite being the commonest inflammatory arthritis the management of gout continues unchanged with just a minority of patients receiving ULT and new patients not being treated in a timely fashion,' Dr Zhang added. The study found wide variation in both the number of existing and new cases with the most occurring in Wales and the North East of England. Analysis of primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 1997 and 2012 found among more than 4.5 million eligible people almost 116,000 already had gout. Eating junk food and drinking too much alcohol are known to encourage the condition commonly known as 'the disease of kings' This is a prevalence of 2.5 per cent, . almost twice as high as previous estimates and topping Germany (1.4 per . cent) and Italy (around one per cent). Men . were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed than women, . mostly between the ages of 35 and 39 at a ratio of 11 to two. More than 7,000 new cases were identified giving an overall incidence of 2.26 per 1,000 person years, rising to 3.5 among men. They were highest for both sexes among those aged 80 to 84. During the study period the prevalence of gout rose by 64 per cent, increasing by around 4 per cent every year. Rates were around four times higher in men. The number of new cases rose by 30 per cent during this time, increasing by around 1.5 per cent each year. New cases were highest in Wales and the North East of England, and lowest in the East of England and Northern Ireland. Only a third of people with gout were getting urate-lowering drugs, a proportion that remained constant over 15 years, says a report online in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (must credit). In 2012, fewer than one in five patients was prescribed drugs within six months of their diagnosis, and only around one in four was still on treatment a year later. This rate was virtually unchanged since 1997, despite the publication of guidelines on optimal management of the condition. Patients got better at taking their drugs, with around four out of 10 doing so in 2012, compared with 28 per cent in 1997, but these figures suggests more needs to be done, said Dr Zhang. ‘It is apparent educational initiatives to improve practitioner knowledge, interest and standard of care of the only ‘curable’ form of inflammatory arthritis are urgently required’ he added. Rheumatologist Dr Tim Tait, medical trustee of the UK Gout Society said ‘We welcome this new data which reaffirms gout as a significant health problem. ‘The increase in gout is a result of a combination of factors - primarily an ageing population and a growing obesity problem in the UK.’ Researchers last month found gout may run in the family, partly because of genetics and also through sharing similar diets.","Around 1.5million people in the UK are affected by the condition .

Ray Edwards MBE, 59, is turning thousands of fake body parts into cash to help pay for new equipment for amputees. The new recycling centre is set to make about £20 for each limb - by stripping away the plastic and selling the metal inside. A quadruple amputee has set up a recycling centre for old and unwanted false limbs - and has been given more than 1,000 so far . Ray Edwards MBE, 59, had to have all of his limbs amputated when he developed septicaemia in 1987. He is pictured with his wife, Fiona, and daughters Taya (back) and Nicola (left) It has been opened by charity Limbcare, headed by quadruple amputee Mr Edwards, who lost his arms and legs in 1987 after developing septicaemia. The team has set up its recycling station in a warehouse in Camberley, Surrey - and has already been given over 1,000 false limbs from around the country. They have received their limbs from amputees who needed new ones, or from relatives of users who have passed away. Because false limbs are classed as medical waste, by law they cannot be re-used, so Mr Edwards' team are stripping away the plastic and resin outer coating, to get to the metal inside. Mr Edwards says some of the limbs come from people who have outgrown them while others are donated by the relatives of people who have died . His recycling centre strips away the plastic on the limbs and then sells the metal on the inside - each limb can raise about £20 for Mr Edwards' charity, Limbcare . The charity will use all of the money raised by the recycling centre to help other amputees pay for new limbs, wheelchairs and rehabilitation . Mr Edwards, of Sandhurst, Berkshire, . said: ‘The metal inside false limbs is very expensive - it’s all . titanium, aluminium or medical-grade stainless steel. ‘In . the past, when an amputee dies or out-grows their current false limb, . they were just thrown away. But we can get about £20 for the metalwork . inside, so that’s a great start. ‘There are upwards of 100,000 amputees in Britain, and each one will go through several different limbs in their lifetime. ‘I think it’s a brilliant way for us to raise money, because all the proceeds will go back to help others. Mr Edwards said: 'We're the first people in Britain to realise the very real cost of waste artificial limbs' Mr Edwards (centre) and his team have already been given more than 1,000 unwanted false limbs to recycle . ‘We hope to raise as much money as . possible to buy new limbs, wheelchairs and pay for rehabilitation, and . we think we’ve come up with a fantastic way to do that.’ Below the knee prosthetics cost about £4,000, and above the knee limbs cost up to £9,000. Mr Edwards said: ‘In the past, family members either threw away the false limbs or buried them with their loved ones. ‘Now they have an option to help others after their own loved ones have passed away.’ Limbcare is run by Mr Edwards, and double amputees Barry Perrin and Roy Wright, who both lost their legs. As unwanted false limbs are classed as medical waste they cannot be reused . Mr Edwards said: 'The metal inside false limbs is very expensive - it's all titanium, aluminium or medical-grade stainless steel. In the past, when an amputee dies or out-grows their current false limb, they were just thrown away.

The group's car veered into oncoming traffic and collided with an 18-wheeler semi truck at 8.30am on Friday as they drove from Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago to Tucson, Arizona for a fraternity leadership conference. The 1,700-mile trip would have taken more than 25 hours. Victor Maldonado, 18, who was driving the 2006 Chevrolet Impala, and 23-year-old David Roman both died in the wreck, which occurred on U.S. 54 about six miles from Dalhart, Texas. Maldonado may have fallen asleep while driving, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Olivia Gonzalez told the Chicago Tribune. Roman was a back-seat passenger behind Moldonado.

A mother-of-three has set up an hotel for rabbits after claiming her now ex-husband gave her an ultimatum - to choose between him or her pet rabbits. Sarah MacRonald, 35, opened a successful 'bunny bed-and-breakfast' in her family home after splitting from her former husband. She says he walked out after telling her ""see how far you and your rabbits get without me."" Sarah now has 11 furry critters of her . own, and commands up to Â£20-a-night to look after other people's pets . while they go on holiday. Her . business, Celebunnies, claims to offer 'celebrity-style boarding for . bunnies' and her cuddly charges have the run of her extensive garden in . Coulsdon, Croydon. Sarah MacRonald set up a 'bunny hotel' after her husband made her chose between him or her pet rabbits . Former banker Sarah said: 'My husband was annoyed that I spent so much time with the rabbits and, to be fair, they did take over my life. 'But, if anyone ever says 'It's me or the rabbits,' then sorry, it's the rabbits every time.' Her love of rabbits began when she bought her first bunny, Rupert, five years ago. 'Why did I suddenly start? I was 30 and I could,' she told her local newspaper, the Croydon Advertiser. 'I . had my third child, my two girls were at school during the day and we . had a big garden. So I thought: 'Right, now I can get that bunny.' Sarah started off with just one rabbit, Rupert. She now has 11 and her own 'bunny hotel' The former bank worker bought Rupert and the largest hutch in the pet store. Ms MacRonald, who even has a rabbit tattoo, admits now she did not know what she was letting herself in for. 'I was in for a shock,"" she said. ""I didn't realise how much care rabbits need, how much they cost, and how much I would end up loving them. 'They are the hardest animal on the planet to keep alive. They suffer from dental problems which can develop into abscesses. 'You also have to be really careful with what they eat because they have very sensitive digestive systems. 'It's also really important that rabbits have a friend and aren't left to live on their own.' Sarah is now studying for an online diploma in rabbit behaviour, physiology and welfare . After Rupert, Sarah bought three Netherland Dwarf females and then three males and then, after a suggestion from a friend, decided to turn her hobby into a business, looking after rabbits while their owners are away. She is now studying for an online diploma in rabbit behaviour, physiology and welfare and hopes one day to run a rabbit rescue centre. However her children, Megan, 13, Molly, 11, and Connor, 6, might not be as keen. 'Connor likes them, but the girls are bored of it,' she said. 'They get excited by other people's rabbits but aren't interested in ours. They keep telling me to stop getting them. 'I can't imagine not having them. It's just a shame I haven't got a passion for something that's going to make me rich.' She is not the only one with a passion for rabbits. Last year, the Daily Mail revealed a growing trend in Japan - rabbit cafes, where stressed out workers can relax with a drink and a rabbit to play with.","Former banker Sarah MacRonald bought one rabbit, Rupert, five years ago .

Accenture has been chosen to replace CGI Federal as the lead contractor for the Obamacare enrollment website, which failed to work when it launched in October for millions of Americans shopping for health insurance, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said on Saturday. CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, built the website, HealthCare.gov, which was plagued by error messages and slow speeds for weeks after the launch. The glitches created a political crisis for President Barack Obama, threatening the roll-out of his signature healthcare law and emboldening Republican foes to call for its repeal. Glitches: The HealthCare.gov website has been plagued with problems since its launch . 'As CMS moves forward in our efforts to help consumers access quality, affordable health coverage, we have selected Accenture to become the lead contractor for the HealthCare.gov portal and to prepare for next year's open enrollment period,' the agency said in a statement. CGI Federal said on Friday that its contract, which was originally awarded in 2011 and is scheduled to end February 28, would not be renewed . The Montreal-based company was selected in 2011 for the $93.7-million two-year contract and could have extended the contract had the problem-plagued website been more successful.[related . CGI spokeswoman Linda Odorisio said in a statement that the company played a large part in fixing the troubled website and that it remains a federal contractor on other healthcare projects. 'We are proud that more than 400 CGI employees worked around the clock from October through December to deliver a consumer experience that works for a vast majority of Americans,' she said. Parting way: Montreal-based CGI Group will not have its contract renewed when it ends in February . Accenture said the contract was worth $45 million for the initial phase of the project, and the Washington Post reported that the final value of the one-year contract would be about $90 million.'Accenture will bring deep healthcare industry insight as well as proven experience building large-scale, public-facing websites to continue improving HealthCare.gov,' David Moskovitz, chief executive of Accenture Federal Services, said in a statement. New partnership: Accenture will take over from CGI Group in March 2014 . Obama has said the fiasco with the website has made him want to overhaul the way the federal government buys technology services. Critics say the system favors large, established contractors such as CGI.Although the site is vastly improved, technical glitches continue to bedevil enrollment. The improvements allowed more than 1.1 million people to shop for and enroll in insurance on HealthCare.gov by the end of 2013, far short of original hopes.The deadline for signing up for 2014 health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is March 31, meaning Accenture will take over at a time when the government needs the site to handle what it hopes will be a surge of last-minute sign-ups.","Accenture will take over the contract for the Obamacare website .

A British woman says she has endured six years of paralysis and memory loss after swallowing poisonous algae while swimming in Florida . Nicoletta Stephanz was taking a dip in the sea when she unwittingly swallowed microscopic ‘neurotoxic’ algae. Soon afterwards she experienced stomach cramps, which led to fever.Five weeks later she developed excruciating pains and paralysis throughout her body which baffled doctors. Unwell: Nicoletta Stephanz (with partner Mark Wilson) was taking a dip in the sea when she swallowed microscopic 'neurotoxic' algae. She says she endured six years of paralysis and memory loss as a result . Ms Stephanz, who is in her 30s, was eventually diagnosed with ciguatera, a rare condition which affects the central nervous system. She now suffers from a list of allergies and needs to be helped to bathe and get dressed. She said: 'My partner Mark and I were on a hiking holiday in Florida in 2008. We went to this quiet isolated beach and noticed that the water had a red tinge to it but I never really thought anything of it. 'Later I found it was a ""red tide"" caused by algae in the water, but I thought it was normal for the area.' Red tide is the common name for an algal bloom, a marine phenomenon in which large concentrations of microscopic organisms turn the water red or brown. Ciguatera poisoning is a form of food poisoning. It affects about 50,000 people in . the world every year but is often misdiagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis . due to its similar symptoms, and like MS, there is still no guaranteed . cure. It is caused by eating warm water ocean fish that carry ciguatera poison (a toxin). This poison is produced by a very tiny organism called a dinofl agellate, which attaches itself to algae growing in warm ocean water reef areas. Small plant-eating fish eat this toxic algae and in turn are eaten by larger predatory fish which are eaten by humans. While not always harmful, some red tides are linked to the production of toxins leading to the mass death of sea life and can have dangerous effects on humans. Ms Stephanz said: 'Usually there are only a few kinds of algae in the water and they aren’t harmful, but when I was there the water had a kind called Pfiesteria that can turn from a plant into an animal, and then back into a plant. 'I noticed a lot of weird things in the area. There were dead fish everywhere on the beach, just thousands, and the birds were behaving really unusually. 'They were killing themselves by flying head first onto the beach because the algae had released neurotoxins into their brains, but by that time I had already been into the water.' Within hours of her swim, Ms Stephanz started experiencing symptoms similar to food poisoning and knew something was seriously wrong. For two weeks she endured crippling joint and muscle pain, along with fever and memory loss and eventually became so weak she could barely talk. She said: 'Soon after I started feeling unwell, as though I had food poisoning. My muscles and joints hurt all over and I developed a heavy fever. 'I got home about two weeks later but none of the doctors there could help me because it was a tropical condition and no one knew anything about it. 'I was told that even if I hadn’t . gone into the water, the algae still gets blown into the air and into . the nearby towns, so I would have gotten it anyway just from breathing.' Ms Stephanz, who is in her 30s, was eventually diagnosed with ciguatera, a rare condition which affects the central nervous system. She now suffers from a list of allergies and needs to be helped to bathe and get dressed . Ciguatera . affects about 50,000 people in the world every year but is often . misdiagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis due to its similar symptoms, and like . MS, there is still no guaranteed cure. But Ms Stephanz, who is cared for by her partner Mark Wilson, 34, at their home in Galashields, Scotland, found hope in some treatments which relieved the worst of her illness, and for a brief period was able to live a relatively normal life. She said: 'When I was given antibiotics, I got a lot better. But they only helped me so much. 'I still need help getting dressed and bathing, as I can’t do that by myself any more. Mark has to help me do normal things. 'There’s a whole list of things that I . can’t eat or be near because they aggravate the condition - eggs, . caffeine, alcohol, nuts and seeds, chicken, and anything from the sea. 'I also can’t be near cleaning products which contain ethanol.' Gambierdiscus toxicus, which produces ciguatera toxin. Ciguatoxin accumulates in the flesh of fish and, when eaten by humans, causes severe illness . Now Ms Stephanz hopes to travel to London with Mr Wilson to see a specialist who may able to help her condition at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, but is struggling to raise the money. Mr Wilson, a technology journalist, said: 'A trip to London is simply beyond our means. I feel terrible not being able to help Nic out, but she is unable to work, and the fact that I provide 24-hour care means that I am not able to work to the extent needed to bring in the money. 'While the local health authority has agreed to fund the referral, there is no funding available for travel and/or accommodation.'

But one couple appear to have found a solution - and all they needed was a 3-D printer. Instead of splashing out on bride and groom cake toppers that looked nothing like them, Emily and Carl Osgathorp, from Oxfordshire, used the technology to create lifelike mini statues of themselves or 'threlfies' [3D selfies] to adorn their cake.

To create the perfect likeness, the pair stood on a rotating turntable in order to scan their images into a computer, using the same technology as the Xbox Kinect. The image was then sent to a 3D printer, which printed them out, layering up 0.1mm thick plastic threads to create the mini statues. Once complete, the mini-statues were placed on top of their wedding cake - and proved the talk of their wedding which took place at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Mrs Osgathorp, a marketing manager, said: 'It was great. When it was on the cake everybody was like: ""Oh, my God that is you?"" It was so instantly recognisable that it was us.'

King himself, while appreciative, wasn't . as quick to credit the Kennedys alone with getting him out of jail, . according to a previously unreleased portion of the interview with the . civil rights leader days after Kennedy's election. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Historians generally agree that Kennedy's phone call to Coretta Scott King expressing concern over her husband's arrest in October 1960 helped him get elected, but rediscovered audio of MLK credits 'many others' as well . 'The . Kennedy family did have some part ... in the release,' King says in the . recording, which was discovered in 2012. 'But I must make it clear . that many other forces worked to bring it about also.' A . copy of the original recording will be played for visitors at the . National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis for a 'King Day' event on Jan. 20. King was arrested a few weeks before the . presidential election at an Atlanta sit-in. Charges were dropped, but . King was held for allegedly violating probation for an earlier traffic . offense and transferred to the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Ga. The . Kennedys intervened, and King was released. Their intervention won the . support of black voters who helped give Kennedy the winning edge in . several key states. Despite their help, however, King was careful not to give them too much credit. 'I . think Dr. King was aware in the tape that he probably did more for John . F. Kennedy than perhaps John F. Kennedy did for him,' said Keya Morgan, . a New York-based collector and expert on historical artifacts. Morgan . acquired the reel-to-reel audiotape from Chattanooga, Tenn., resident . Stephon Tull, who discovered it while cleaning out his father's attic. John F. Kennedy did some behind the scenes work to help release Martin Luther King Jr. from prison . Raymond . Winbush, director of the Institute for Urban Research at Maryland's . Morgan State University, said Kennedy's call to King's wife was . political in nature because the Kennedys had been slow to get involved . in the civil rights movement. He said John . Kennedy didn't actually commit to the movement until a few months before . his assassination when civil rights leader Medgar Evers was gunned down . by a Klansman outside his Jackson, Miss., home just after midnight on . June 12, 1963. The slaying came hours after . JFK's television speech in support of civil rights and helped propel the . struggle for equality to national attention. 'There . were a lot of black folks who ... weren't fully committed to his . campaign,' said Winbush, who is also a historian and psychologist. 'That . call he made to Coretta moved black folks.' He . said King's comments on the tape were measured because he probably . didn't want to offend black supporters, like the NAACP, that had also . aided him. 'He kind of went in the middle,' Winbush said. Some believe that Kennedy's call to Corretta King was only  a ploy to get black voters because the Kennedy;s were slow to join in on the civil rights movement . Tull, . the Chattanooga man who discovered the tape, said his father had . planned to write a book about the racism he encountered growing up in . Chattanooga and later as an adult. Tull said his dad, an insurance . salesman, interviewed King when he visited the city, but never completed . the book and just stored the recording with some other interviews he . had done. Tull's father is now in his late 80s and under hospice care. Tull has asked that his father not be identified. In . the recording, King also discusses his definition of nonviolence, his . visit to Africa and the impact of the civil rights movement. 'I . am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, . historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest . epochs of our heritage,' he said. 'I am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epochs of our heritage,' said King in the rediscovered recording . After Morgan . acquired the tape, he sold it to magician David Copperfield, who then . donated it to the National Civil Rights Museum to promote King's message . of nonviolence. Copperfield said King inspired people to dream. 'That's . too important for one person to possess,' Copperfield said of the . recording.

Nearly two thirds of patients seeking treatment for depression are women, NHS figures show. Almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or behavioural therapy last year, compared to only 274,000 men. The figures, which for the first time reveal the numbers of patients receiving the so-called ‘talking treatments’, also showed women under 50, and especially those in their 20s, are most likely to seek help. Revelation: Nearly two thirds of patients seeking treatment for depression are women, NHS figures show . Some experts say women are more prone to mental illness because they tend to bottle up their emotions, whereas men lash out if angry. But female patients are also far more likely to admit they have a problem. Only last month, the NHS’s annual health survey revealed that almost a quarter of women were depressed or very anxious. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre’s  figures, 761,848 patients were referred last year for counselling, psychological treatment or behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety. Difference: Almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or behavioural therapy last year, compared to only 274,000 men. Women under 50, and especially those in their 20s, are most likely to seek help (file picture) Some 62 per cent were women, though in some cases the gender was not recorded. Three quarters were aged 20 to 49, with the majority of those cases – 185,700 – in their 20s. Because this is the first time the data has been published, it is impossible to know whether the numbers needing treatment for depression is on the rise. However, separate NHS figures show there has been a surge in prescriptions for antidepressants with 50million handed out a year, a rise of 7.5 per cent compared to the year before. The increase has partly been blamed on financial woes although there is also concern that patients are becoming addicted to the drugs, with GPs writing out repeat prescriptions too easily. Expert: Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity SANE, said: women 'feel more able to express their feelings and look for support' Experts are divided over whether women are more susceptible to depression and anxiety or whether they are better at seeking professional help. Beth Murphy, of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘While there is no gender difference in the prevalence of mental health problems, women are much more likely to seek help than men, and are more willing to talk about their own mental wellbeing. All the signs suggest that more and more people are seeking help for mental health problems. ‘Prescriptions for antidepressants have been rising steadily and recently topped 50million for the first time, while the numbers of people contacting organisations like Mind for help are also increasing. ‘We also know that people are really struggling at the moment, as unemployment, cuts to welfare and other pressures take their toll on the mental health of the nation. ‘It’s important that anyone struggling with their mental health speaks to their GP as soon as possible.’ Last month the NHS’s annual health survey involving 8,000 adults showed 23 per cent of women reported feeling anxious or had been diagnosed with depression. Some experts argue that this is because women tend to want to share their feelings when they are at their lowest ebb, while men are more likely to turn to alcohol or physical violence. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity SANE, said: ‘Previous research indicates that depression is around twice as common among women as men, as is self-harm and suicide attempts. But it is young and middle-aged men who are most at risk of actually taking their own lives. ‘The reasons may be in part because women feel more able to express their feelings and look for support.’","Almost 475,000 women were referred for counselling or therapy last year .

But her future is already looking bright and the way ahead paved with gold. For this foal’s famous father means she could be worth a cool £3million. She is the first daughter of sporting legend Frankel, the world’s top-rated racehorse who won all 14 of his races before retiring in 2012. Like her famous father, who is valued at £100million, the filly – who has yet to be named – is bay in colour and has a similar white blaze on her face. Expectation: The three-day-old filly is the first daughter born to legendary racehorse Frankel. Huge pressure has been placed on the adorable foal to live up to her famous father and become a champion herself . Bright future: The as-yet-unnamed filly is described as 'a very nice quality, athletic individual' by Frankel's managing director, although he added there was no way to predict her success on the racecourse . But it will be some time yet before she gets a chance to show if she can follow in his record-breaking hoof prints. She . will not set foot on a racecourse for two years. Yesterday, however, . her owners released images of her having a trot round a paddock at her . birthplace, The National Stud in Newmarket, Suffolk. She is the first of . Frankel’s offspring to be presented to the public in this way, giving . punters a glimpse of a potential wonderhorse. Last . night Brian O’Rourke, the stud’s managing director, described the filly . as ‘very nice quality’ but  added: ‘When they’re this young there’s no . way of knowing if they’re going to be champions.’ The . filly was born at around 5.30am on Sunday. Her mother, Song, comes from . good racing stock and is owned by Khalid Abdul Rahim, a construction . magnate from Bahrain. Legendary: Frankel, who is valued at £100 million, won all 14 of his races before retiring. He mated with 133 mares last year at his home at Banstead Manor Farm, near Newmarket, during his first season at stud . Good breeding: Frankel (left) mated with 133 mares between February and June last year, including Song, the mother of the three-day-old foal who stands at her feet (right) Playful: The filly was born at the stud around 5.30am on Sunday. Her mother is a mare called Song, who comes from good racing stock and is owned by Khalid Abdul Rahim, a construction magnate from Bahrain . ‘The . pedigree of this filly is impeccable, with Frankel as the father and . Song, who is unraced but from a family of horses that have won some of . the best races in Europe, as mother,’ said one source. Experts . say it is too soon to know how much she is worth but she could fetch . £3million in a year’s time. Song was sold for £824,000 in November while . carrying her. Frankel’s . first foal – a colt born at Coolmore Stud in Co Tipperary on January 11 . to a mare called Chrysanthemum – is reported to have a potential value . of £6million. Within days, bookmakers Coral were quoting 100-1 on him . winning the Epsom Derby in 2017. Horses which race on the flat, like Frankel, usually begin their racing careers aged two. So the foal is likely to be seen on the track for the first time in the summer of 2016 . Big family: The filly already has one brother, with dozens more siblings expected later in the year . Colts . are more valuable than fillies because, aside from their racing career, . they can make vast sums at stud in comparison to mares who can breed . only once a year. Frankel, . owned by Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah, mated with 133 mares between . February and June last year, his first season at stud. He commands a fee . of £125,000 a time and 126 of the mares are expecting foals or have . given birth. It means .

A devoted father has donated 20 per cent of his own liver to his critically ill son to provide him with a replacement, which will grow as he does and eventually become a replica of the original organ. Muhammed Ali Tariq was poorly from birth, but was diagnosed with liver disease at just nine weeks old, and his only hope was an urgent transplant. But in what is the greatest gift of life, his father Tariq Mushtaq has given his son a portion of his liver, which means he now has a healthy organ that will get bigger as he gets older to match his father's. Tariq Mushtaq has donated 20 per cent of his own liver to his critically ill son Muhammed Ali Tariq to provide him with a replacement, which will grow as he does and eventually become a replica of the original organ . On December 6, last year, the transplant went ahead, and 20 per cent of Tariq's liver was removed at St John's Hospital in Leeds before being transported by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary to be introduced to Muhammed Ali's body . Mr Mushtaq, 37, said: 'Muhammed Ali's liver was taken away completely and replaced with 20 per cent of mine. 'The idea is that my 20 per cent is the equivalent to his 100 per cent now. As he grows, the liver will regenerate with him and always be sufficient to do what he needs it to do. 'It's nothing short of an absolute miracle, and I struggle to comprehend how amazing it is. 'We have got the same scars running down our chests and I will always remember being able to do this for him.' Father and son at Leeds General Hospital after the operation. in September last year, Muhammed Ali was placed on the waiting list for a new liver . Before Mr Mushtaq could be accepted as a donor for his son, he had to go through a rigorous two-month process of speaking to doctors, social workers and psychologists to make sure he was prepared . Muhammed Ali, from Nelson, . Lancashire, was born on 13 July 2012, but at just seven weeks old, he . was diagnosed with liver disease. 'It was a normal birth, but we noticed that Muhammed Ali was jaundiced,' said Mr Mushtaq. 'We . brought it to the doctors' attention but we weren't too concerned . because we have three older children, who were also jaundiced after they . were born. 'However after a few weeks, it didn't pass so we started to get a bit more worried so we went to the local hospital, who ran some tests. 'We realised something serious was going on when we were transferred over to the Leeds General Infirmary for specialist care.' Muhammed Ali Tariq was poorly from birth, but was diagnosed with liver disease at just nine weeks old . Tariq, and his wife Asia, 31, were told of his condition, something they had only ever associated with alcoholism and other complications. Doctors told the family that Muhammed Ali's liver was very badly damaged and beyond repair, but it is still unknown what caused it. After months of tests and scans, the couple, who also have three daughters - Alisha, 12, Aliya, nine and Haleema, three - was told their only option was a transplant, and in September last year, Muhammed Ali was placed on the waiting list for a new liver. Mr Mushtaq, who works in sales, said: 'There are two words in our family that we never want to hear. One is cancer and the other is transplant. When we heard transplant, it completely took us aback and we were all over the place. 'They said that without it he would . get progressively worse rapidly, and we were already in hospital with . him almost weekly with various complications. 'We . could have waited for someone to pass away and an organ to become . available but we could see him getting worse so I enquired and learned . about live donor transplants. 'I . just felt that this was the option for us, and my wife and I made a . joint decision that this was the best thing for Muhammed Ali.' Before . Mr Mushtaq could be accepted as a donor for his son, he had to go . through a rigorous two-month process of speaking to doctors, social . workers and psychologists to make sure he was prepared for the . procedure. 'They were very satisfied with me . mentally and physically, and I had to undergo a whole series of tests . which said my liver was in an extremely good condition,' he said. 'It was a very scary time but I knew it was the right thing for my son.' On . December 6, last year, the transplant went ahead, and 20 per cent of . Tariq's liver was removed at St John's Hospital in Leeds before being . transported by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary to be introduced to . Muhammed Ali's body. Tariq, and his wife Asia, 31, were told of their son's condition, something they had only ever associated with alcoholism and other complications . Mr Mushtaq said: 'It was a very worrying time for my wife. She has her husband on one side and her son on the other' The risks included blood clotting, internal bleeding, various infections and a 1 in 200 chance of death. Mr Mushtaq said: 'It was a very worrying time for my wife. She has her husband on one side and her son on the other. 'I told her just to worry about him, and she did a fantastic job. People have called me brave, but she was the brave one. 'She's been through so much having to watch two members of her family undergo major surgery at once and she's been so strong.' Since the operations, which were both a complete success, Muhammed Ali has seen enormous health benefits, and despite having to take anti-rejection medication for the rest of his life, both father and son are well on the road to recovery. Mr Mushtaq added: 'He was in intensive care for two days while he recovered, but when they took him on to the ward they said the change was dramatic. 'We saw immediate change in him and he has become a different child. He's smiling, and he's happy, and they expect him to make a complete recovery.' The pair have formed an incredibly special bond, are now looking forward to the fun of being father and son, and activities they couldn't do before due to Muhammed Ali's condition. 'I look forward to going swimming with him, walking in the park and kicking a little ball about with him,' said Tariq. 'I would recommend this to anyone to give the gift of life. It's brought us closer and it can bring me to the point of tears. 'I look at him and there's something between us, we have a very unique bond. 'Every day we have a fresh zest for life, and for that I really want to thank the NHS.

Sue Rumsey, 45, leapt in her car and chased two men after she saw them burgling her neighbour's house in Laindon, Essex . A woman who chased a burglar in her car, mounting the pavement to prevent him escaping, has been praised for her 'determination' by a judge. Sue Rumsey, 45, spotted two suspicious-looking men hanging around near her home in Laindon, Essex, and realised they were burgling a neighbour's house. She called the police but when the men fled from the house, Mrs Rumsey leapt into her car and chased them, before helping officers to arrest one of them while his colleague arrested the other. After Stephen Sayer, 32, and Michael Perry, 33, appeared in court charged with burglary, judge David Owen-Jones told them: 'If it were not for the determined actions and observations of Sue Rumsey, you would have got away with it.' Mrs Rumsey flew into action on November 27 last year when she saw the two men in the street near her home. She said: 'I saw the two lads hanging about and thought ""You’re not right for around here"". 'It was just instinct so I just kept watching, and then when I saw one of them go around the back, I rang the police. 'They said there was an officer on the way but at that point I saw them making off and I didn’t want them getting away. 'I . stayed in the car and followed them - I know the area well so I was . speaking to the police to help them work out where they would try to go. 'I thought I’d lost them, but then I looked up and saw they had had the audacity to go back to the house.' She added: 'A . PCSO [special constable] came jogging along but the lookout, who was on a bike, saw him and . yelled to his friend so I thought ""He’s never going to catch him"". 'The burglar came over the back fence and I thought ""I’m not giving up on this now I’ve come this far"". 'I put my foot down and caught up with him before mounting the kerb to cut off his exit. 'I think he thought I was police as he put his hand on the roof as if to give himself up. 'Then the PCSO stepped in and arrested him, and a police unit caught the other boy on a bike.' Sayer, from Basildon, Essex, was given a . three-and-a-half year jail sentence for burglary, criminal damage and . breach of a suspended sentence when he appeared in the dock at Basildon .

Scene of the crime: Mrs Rumsey chased the burglars in her car after spotting them in this street in Laindon . Perry, from Laindon, who acted as his accomplice and lookout, admitted burglary and received a 15-month . prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. The court heard that jewellery stolen was later recovered by officers. Mrs Rumsey said: 'I’m not a hero - I was just at the right place at the right time. 'We’ve all lived round here for a number of years so we all look out for each other.  Burglary can really ruin people’s lives and I wasn’t going to let it happen.' Her elderly neighbour, whose house was broken into, praised Mrs Rumsey and said he was lucky to live in a street where everybody knew each other. He said: 'Sue was absolutely amazing.  She could have got herself hurt and was really brave to chase them.

In late November, Marcy Glanz was hit with some awful news: after battling with ovarian cancer for nearly three years, her doctors told her she had but a few weeks to live. With just a few, short weeks left on earth, Ms. Glanz didn't succumb to self-pity or fear - rather, she used her remaining days to essentially have a month-long farewell party, during which she could say her goodbyes to the scores of friends she made in her 62 years on earth. 'Many of us die too soon and have no chance to say goodbye, or we have a . long, ugly painful demise,' her husband, Marion Stewart, said. 'Hers was . neither of those.' The end: Glanz died on January 5 in her 90th Street apartment surrounded by her family . Glanz's final days are recounted in a lengthy piece in the New York Times, which describes her desires for her final weeks as wanting 'a monthlong farewell party that mixed frivolity and friendship, laughter and tears.' Ms. Glanz got her wish. 'She very quickly made peace with the fact that she was going to die in a . few weeks and that she would use that time to say goodbye,' her husband told the paper, . adding that this was not an easy task for a woman who'd amassed as many friends as his wife. Rather than spend her final weeks in a hospital or hospice, Ms. Glanz was able to remain in her home on West 90th Street in Manhattan, where a medical staff was brought in to give her the care she needed as she prepared to lay down her arms in her long battle against cancer. Ms. Glanz - who had a master's degree in educational psychology from Harvard - spent much of December sharing memories with her family in the forms of old pictures and home movies. Mr. Stewart notes that while there was some crying as he, his wife and their two sons remembered happier times, 'but there was a lot more laughing than crying.' 'We did many of the things that people do after death, but we . did it before she died,' he says. Ms. Glanz even helped plan her own memorial service, giving her husband specific instructions on everything down to the music and speakers. 'There was no ""Woe is me"" or ""I can’t stand this,’” he said. 'There was just a peacefulness and wanting to wrap everything up.' One of Ms. Glanz's biggest regrets was that her unfortunate death would mean she would never meet her grandchildren. So, in preparation, her sons brought her a copy of Goodnight Moon - the same book she used to read to them before they went to sleep - and she recorded herself reading it so her future grandchildren could hear her voice and be 'tucked in by the grandmother they never met.' Another of Ms. Glanz's concerns was who would take care of her husband, as many of her longtime friends confided to Mr. Stewart after her passing. In many cases, all she asked of her friends was that they promised to look after the man she'd spent her life with. She couldn’t even eat, yet she told me she was really, really happy to . be able to help her family deal with the loss before she was gone. 'She couldn’t even eat, yet she told me she was really, really happy to . be able to help her family deal with the loss before she was gone,' friend Catherine Paura told the paper. As her health continued to deteriorate, Ms. Glanz was bound to a wheelchair by the time her 62nd birthday rolled around on December 24. But that didn't stop her from having not one but three parties to celebrate her abbreviated life. On New Year's Eve, Ms. Glanz decided that she wanted to have 'one last blowout party' at the apartment she shared with her husband. She invited 20 people and made toasts with ginger ale as she worked the room wearing a pink, fuzzy boa. The next day - New Year's Day - was the last day Ms. Glanz could speak. She died on January 5 - in her bed and surrounded by her family. 'She had the ability and wherewithal to say everything she wanted to say,' Ms. Paura said. 'It was as if, by facing her death through the prism of love she transcended it.'","Marcy Glanz battled ovarian cancer for nearly three years until her death earlier this month .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:06 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:18 EST, 21 January 2014 . Tragic: Polly Kitzinger was left severely brain damaged after she was injured in a car crash in March 2009 . The sisters of a woman left severely brain damaged after she was injured in a car crash have published a study calling for patients in a vegetative state to be allowed to die. Celia and Jenny Kitzinger were devastated when their sister Polly was involved in the crash in March 2009. Five years on Polly, now 52, has emerged from a coma but remains with permanent and profound mental and physical disabilities. Although the sisters handed doctors a 100-page dossier outlining fiercly independent mental health advocate Polly's wishes not to be kept alive, including her own notes and testimonies from family and friends, they were legally unable to have her treatment stopped. Now Celia and Jenny, who are both . university professors, have published research declaring that other . families of severely brain damaged patients believe that when all other . avenues have been exhausted, terminal sedation is a humane option. Jenny, a professor in the School of Journalism, Media and Cultural . Studies at Cardiff University and Celia, sociology professor at the . University of York, hope their research, published in the respected . Journal of Medical Ethics, will help inform debate about ways . of dying when people become catastrophically disabled through illness or . injury. 'Often family members want to speak publicly about this but . it’s taboo for them to say they wished their loved one was dead or would . want to be dead,' Jenny said. 'Polly, who very much believed in . people being able to make their own health choices, had a car crash and . now lives life in a coma. 'It is a very, very cruel irony. 'She’s trapped and could live like this for another 25 years. I know it’s not what she would want.' Trapped: Polly's sisters have said she is 'trapped' due to her severe mental and physical disabilities, and believe she should be allowed to die . Prior to the accident, Polly, now 52, was a mental health user involvement . officer at Interlink Rhondda Cynon Taf and was returning from a work . conference when she was involved in the car crash near Brecon, Wales. Having suffered multiple fractures and profound brain . injury, she was kept breathing on a ventilator as she was rushed to the . University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Soon afterwards, the family was told . the prognosis was grim and although Polly now has some minimal . consciousness having emerged from her coma, she has permanent mental and physical disabilities and will always need . round-the-clock care. Her . sisters, daughters of acclaimed birth rights writer and campaigner Dr . Sheila Kitzinger, talked about dying before the accident and say they . have no doubt their younger sister, who lived in Brecon, would not want . to be kept alive. Research: Jenny Kitzinger, pictured, and her sister have completed research showing some families would consider terminal sedation for brain injured relatives in a permanent vegetative state . 'We’d . discussed as a family what we’d each want if we lost capacity to make . decisions and mother and I had written living wills,' said Jenny, who is . in her . 'You can download . forms on informed consent and living wills. When I cleared Polly’s house . in Brecon I found an empty form from Compassion in Dying, she’d never . filled it in. I wept. How many of us find time to do it?' 'It feels very cruel for Polly that she is kept alive against her wishes. 'After her accident we discovered next of kin have no legal right to take decisions.” Jenny, who lives in Penarth, said Polly was a lively, fearless woman who enjoyed sailing and gardening and had strong views on patient rights and disability rights. She hopes the study, Withdrawing Artificial Nutrition and Hydration from Minimally Conscious and Vegetative Patients: Family Perspectives research, will help raise awareness of the issue. Speaking to 51 relatives of patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state, the sisters found two thirds believed their relative would rather be dead than stay alive in that condition, but less would consider applying to halt artificial feeding and hydration to allow death. Some told them euthanasia by sedation was preferable to withholding or withdrawing treatment. Currently, halting treatment is the only legal method guaranteed to allow death in patients in a vegetative state. 'At the moment it is legal to allow people to die by withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration, but that can mean watching a long, slow death which many relatives just cannot bear the thought of,' explained Celia. 'There must be a more merciful way of allowing people to die.' Celia Kitzinger . 'If a court is going to take a decision to allow someone to die, why not do it in a way that’s less prolonged for the patient? 'There must be a more merciful way of allowing people to die.

A public protest about paying employees penalty rates on public holiday by an Adelaide pub restaurant has attracted a torrent of negative feedback with punters taking to Facebook to vent their fury. The Bombay Bicycle Club in Ovingham put up a sign outside its doors complaining they have to pay 2.75 per cent above the ordinary hourly rate of pay on public holidays, reported News.com.au. They multiplied everything on the menu 2.75 times in an attempt to highlight the 'stupidity of the new rate. Fed up: Adelaide's Bombay Bicycle Club put up a sign complaining about paying penalty rates . 'The bread would be $19.25 under the cafe's calculations, while lamb korma was $65, salt and pepper squid $55, chicken schnitzel $48.50 and it would be more than $60 for a seafood pizza,' the sign read. After getting negative feedback in person, the restaurant turned to Facebook to further explain its stance on penalty rates. Its post claimed the increased penalty rates left employees worse off in some cases and would force venues to stay closed on public holidays, as was the case in Melbourne. Backlash: Many people said that the pub was being unreasonable and should be willing to pay their workers the required rate . 'So, by all means don't come back, and by all means complain about us pointing out the stupidity of a rate 2.75 times the norm but please don't insinuate disrespect by us to our employees,' it explained on Facebook.The message prompted a further backlash, attracting more than 300 comments, many of them critical. 'Bombay reminds us what we loved about slavery,' wrote one person. 'Here's a quick maths formula. Multiply zero (which equals the amount I will now spend at your establishment) by 2.75 and see what it equals,' wrote another.'Interesting to see that wages make up 100 per cent of your costs. While it must suck to have to compensate people for working when everyone else gets a holiday, it must be nice not to have to pay for rent, insurance, or food,' wrote another.An angry post declared, 'Pay penalty rates you bourgeois swine!' 'I will never be returning. How dare you treat your staff like they don't deserve decent wages and conditions,' David Pink wrote. A handful of comments defended the business' right to highlight an issue . Later the Bombay returned to its Facebook page to apologise and later took down its sign from the front of the restaurant. It claimed to regret the wording it used and that it didn't mean to cause offence. 'Too late. Your ""opinion"" has already spread across Facebook and beyond. Not going to be good for business,' one Facebook user wrote while another concluded, 'Damage has been done.'

The Jamaican bobsled team are now headed to another Olympics after the Sochi Organizing Committee offered to cover the travel costs for the team. Olympic organizers said Saturday that Jamaica has qualified for the two-man competition at next month's Games, and later announced that they will help meet some but not all of the team’s financial needs. The team- which shot to popularity following the release of Cool Runnings, the 1993 film based on their story to make it from their tropical island nation to the slopes of the 1988 winter Olympics- is still trying to raise money to pay for the equipment they will need to compete. Represent: The team was larger in 2012 but are going to be there next month to wave their flag after this weekend's ruling that they qualified for the Games . Cool car: The bobsled used by the team in the 2002 Olympics (pictured) used the colors of the Jamaican flag . Winston Watts, the sled driver, confirmed today that they are still raising money but has not said how much they need. On Saturday, he estimated they needed $80,000 but that included the cost of travel. He said he has received calls from countless people around the world offering financial support. For a nation lacking bobsled tradition, or snowy winters, Jamaica has often fared quite well on the international circuits. Watts finishing 28th at the Salt Lake City Games 12 years ago, with Lascelles Brown — now a key part of Canada's national team. Brown won a medal at the 2010 Vancouver . Games, one where the Jamaicans were hoping to compete but were again . thwarted by funding issues. Jamaican Chef de Mission and four-time Olympic bobsleigh team member Nelson Stokes said: 'I can confirm that we have qualified a team for Sochi and it means a great deal that we are able to return to Olympic competition after a few years of missing out.' 'There is still great enthusiasm for bobsleigh in Jamaica and we are making great progress with our funding. We will definitely be in a position to take part in the Games.' Making an impact: The 1988 triumph was captured in a 1993 Disney movie called Cool Runnings . The Jamaican team performed poorly at their second Olympics in 1992, but returned in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Still, the 46-year-old Watts — who called himself 'retired' from sliding for nearly a decade — has held on to hope of sliding again on the sport's biggest stage. 'We're pretty good,' Watts said. 'We're not there with the rest of the world, of course. But we if had some more sources for funding, we'd have a better chance.' He started the season thinking he could get a four-man sled ready for Sochi, before quickly realizing that was too expensive. Changing it up: They only qualified for the 2-man race and not the 4-man sled as pictured here at a practice round in Calgary in November . Financial concerns: Winston Watt, the team captain, realized early on that he would not be able to get enough money together for a four man sled for the Sochi games . His focus then shifted to the two-man sled and by racing in a number of lower-tier events at tracks in Park City, Lake Placid and Calgary in recent months, Watts and brakeman Marvin Dixon piled up enough points to get into the Olympic mix. Sochi officials tweeted word Saturday that the Jamaicans were in, but the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation — the sport's governing body — is not expected to confirm before Sunday at the earliest how many nations qualified for the Olympic fields. Watts said he's confident that Jamaica is qualified. 'I'm not a person who likes to quit,' Watts said. 'I put my heart into it and I know for a fact that people are going to help this team.'","The Jamaican bobsled team will be competing in Sochi after a 12 year absence from the Games .

The seemingly placid appearance of the sun in our skies hides its true nature as a hot fireball of plasma in constant turmoil. In reality a complex network, invisible to the naked eye, surrounds the solar disc, with cells of hotter and colder plasma merging and disappearing within hours of each other. The boundaries between these constantly moving cells are hectic places. Powerful jets of plasma are often launched whenever the cell pattern changes. There was something about this bright coronal mass ejection (cropped but un-retouched) on 27 February 2002 that suggested the splash of colour found in a flower petal, especially when copied into a circular pattern. Add an extreme ultraviolet image of the sun, and the artists suggests a recreation of oneness in the universe . The extreme ultraviolet images come to Earth from the SOHO spacecraft in black and white. Then they are consistently colour coded for easy identification. For this May 1998 image, the nearly simultaneous images from three different ultraviolet imagers were each given a colour code (red, yellow and blue) and digitally merged into one . SOHO stands for Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and is a satellite that studies the sun 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without interruptions. It is currently in orbit between the Earth and the sun. It is about 150,703,456 km (92 million miles) from the sun. The spacecraft has 12 scientific instruments collecting information about the sun ranging from activity in the sun's corona to vibrations deep in the sun's interior. These changes may happen as a result of variations in the magnetic field – known as ‘magnetic reconnection’. To learn more about these reconnection jets and what causes them, scientists observe the sun at different wavelengths using a variety of techniques. These images, published under the title ‘The sun as Art’, reveal a series of scientific observations performed with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to understand our star. One image, which looks more like an . abstract painting that a scientific study, shows 60 frames taken with . the ultraviolet spectrometer SUMER on SOHO over 10 minutes. This image shows a coronal mass ejection (CME) headed right towards Earth. A CME is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space. An extreme ultraviolet image of the sun is shown here with an expanding cloud of particles heading out on all sides of the star. The cloud impacted Earth about two days later . This image, which could be mistaken for a piece of abstract art, shows a series of observations performed with the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to study the evolution of reconnection jets on a small patch of the sun's surface. The individual frames were taken every 10 seconds, so each row of snapshots corresponds to almost three and a half minutes of observations . This coronal mass ejection (CME) from 26 November 2000 is blasting billions of tonnes of matter at millions of kilometres per hour. An ultraviolet image of the sun has been superimposed onto the image. Colours have been altered, but nothing else has been added. The large white speckles and longer streaks are high-energy protons hitting the SOHO imager after being blasted at nearly the speed of light by the solar storm . The individual frames were taken every 10 seconds, so each row of snapshots corresponds to almost three and a half minutes of observations. Each frame shows a spectrum of the light coming from a small patch on the solar disc: the height of each frame measures 84 000 km, which is about a sixteenth of the sun’s diameter. In the first few frames of the series, the shape of the central bright region is roughly vertical, a sign that the underlying boundary was in a quiet state. After only a couple of minutes, however, the situation changed dramatically: towards the end of the first row and at the beginning of the second row, the shape of the bright region appears stretched towards the right. A pair of images taken the same day by different ultraviolet imagers are sandwiched together to make a kind of alien-shaped spacecraft. What appear to be shafts of light are in fact particles of the solar wind streaming out into space along open-ended magnetic field lines . A particularly complex and large coronal mass ejection on 4 January 2002 made even seasoned solar physicists gasp with awe. The LASCO C2 instrument observed the particles blasting out. Areas of white indicate the greatest intensity of matter; the reds somewhat less; blues, even less . Extreme ultraviolet images taken by the SOHO spacecraft come back to Earth in black and white.

This image of a rainbow was created by scientists attempting to measure the sun's interior. Tones of oscillating sound waves from the sun produce surface change on the star around every five minutes.  The nature and source of these oscillations was a mystery for many years after their discovery in 1962 . This is a wraparound 360 degree image of solar winds in the whole sky. Maps such as this can help scientists understand how solar winds behave at different altitudes . Another image shows a CME blasting billions of tonnes of matter at millions of kilometres per hour.

A coroner demanded action yesterday after a critically ill pensioner . died waiting for an ambulance while several crews in the area took . ‘undisturbable’ rest breaks. Fred Pring could have survived if  his wife’s first desperate 999 call had been responded to in time, an inquest heard. Joyce . Pring, 63, made four increasingly frantic calls over 50 minutes after . her  74-year-old husband was taken ill with chest pains. 'Unacceptable': Joyce Pring (left) frantically called 999 when her husband, Fred, 74, started suffering chest pains. Crews did not reach their home for 50 minutes . On her fourth and final attempt she was forced to accept: ‘It’s too late now, he’s gone.’ As . she made the calls, six of the region’s 16 ambulances were on mandatory . rest breaks, another eight were queuing outside two hospitals to hand . over patients, and the remaining two were dealing with other incidents. After . delivering a narrative verdict, coroner John Gittins announced he was . calling for urgent changes to reduce the risks posed by mandatory rest . breaks and delays in dropping off patients at A&E. The inquest . heard harrowing recordings of the 999 calls made by the retired . gardener’s wife at their home in Mynydd Isa, near Mold, North Wales. Mrs Pring initially phoned at 1.08am on March 21 last year and was reassured an ambulance was on the way. Tragedy: By the time Mrs Pring made her fourth emergency call, her husband (pictured) had died. She told the operator it was 'too late' Half . an hour later – and on her third call – her husband stopped breathing . and died. She dialled 999 for the last time at 1.51am, when she said: . ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, . he’s gone.’ Mr Pring was suffering from heart disease and a chronic lung condition and died from heart failure. The . coroner told the inquest at Ruthin that three ambulances eventually . reached the couple’s home, with the first ‘arriving 48 minutes after the . initial call’. Mr Gittins said: ‘Although it cannot be established . with  certainty that Mr Pring would have survived if help had reached . him sooner, it is probable that if an ambulance had arrived promptly . after the first call, that is to say within their target response time . of eight minutes, he would have lived long enough to be transported to . hospital where further medical treatment would have optimised the . prospect of his survival.’ The inquest had previously heard how one . of the first paramedics on the scene, Michael Bennett, received a ‘red . two’ call – the second most serious alert – at around at 1.32am. But . he ‘politely declined’ to help because he had been on shift for six . hours without a break. Prior to the call he had waited 99 minutes to . hand over a patient at Wrexham Maelor Hospital’s A&E department. A . short time later Mr Bennett and his colleague Vincent Clayton got . another call requesting their help on a top priority ‘red one’ call, and . they agreed to give up the break. The strict rest break policy . means paramedics must be stood down to take an ‘undisturbable’ 30-minute . meal break once they have been working for five hours. Delays: Paramedics had to wait 99 minutes to transfer patients from their ambulance to hospital staff, meaning a limited number of ambulances were available to attend the call . Ambulance . service officials told the inquest that the break must be taken where . hot food can be prepared and served, meaning paramedics cannot simply . park in a layby to eat sandwiches. Mr Gittins said the loss of any life to a ‘potentially avoidable delay’ was unacceptable. He . said he was writing to the local ambulance trust and health board to . express his concerns that unless action was taken the risk of other . deaths would continue. The coroner wants to know why the system for . prioritising 999 calls doesn’t take into account whether someone has . been waiting for an ambulance to arrive. Numbers: There were 15 ambulances on duty in the whole of North Wales on the night Mr Pring died . He also wants to encourage . greater sharing of NHS facilities. Canteens in hospitals appear not to . be available to paramedics, meaning crews could be wasting precious time . ‘returning to base’ for their mandatory breaks. Professor Matt . Makin, medical director of the Betsi Cadwaladr University health board, . and Elwyn Price-Morris, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, . issued a joint statement, saying: ‘We are taking a range of actions to . ensure that our busy ambulances and emergency departments are available . to those who need them most urgently.’ Joyce Pring (pictured) begged the emergency services for help for her husband, Fred . Mrs Pring:  ‘It’s my fourth call, I think my husband has just died.’ Operator asks for her full address . Mrs Pring: ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, he’s gone.’ Operator: ‘Are you with him now.’ Mrs Pring: ‘There’s not much point now, he’s dead.’ Operator: ‘How old is he?’ Mrs Pring:  ‘He was 74.’ Operator: ‘Is he awake?’ Mrs Pring: ‘No’ Operator: ‘Is he breathing?’ Mrs Pring: ‘No.’ Operator: ‘Alright, what happened?’ Mrs Pring; ‘He just couldn’t take the pain anymore and couldn’t breathe anymore.’ Operator: ‘Okay, I’m organising help for you now.’ Mrs Pring: ‘There’s nothing I can do now for him, he’s just lying on the bed.’ Operator urges Mrs Pring to help her husband by laying him flat on his back on the floor. Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t do that, there’s nobody here, he’s died.’ Operator:  ‘Are there any neighbours that can help you?’ Mrs Pring: ‘No, there’s nothing I can do, he’s dead.’ Operator: ‘I can tell you how to help him.’ Mrs Pring: ‘You’re too late, I’m sorry.’ Operator: ‘Are you wanting to help your husband? Mrs Pring: ‘Just let him go. He was in pain, I do not want him to suffer. It’s not that I do not want to help him, he’s gone.’ Operator: ‘Let’s help him together.’ Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t he’s gone. Don’t you understand? I don’t want to get him back to suffer more.’ Operator: ‘When did he stop breathing?' Mrs Pring: ‘Two minutes ago.’ Operator: ‘Just follow my instructions, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.’ Mrs Pring: ‘I just want someone to come and take him, it’s nearly an hour…What are your target times?’ Operator: ‘What do you mean…we try to get to patients as quickly as possible.’ Mrs Pring: ‘Well, you haven’t succeeded this time.’","Joyce Pring rang for ambulance when husband, Fred, 74, had chest pains .

The firm has also been told by the Federal Trade Commission to overhaul its charging system to make it more obvious when payments are being taken. The Commission received tens of thousands of consumer complaints, it said. Apple CEO Tim Cook: The firm will refund consumers at least $32.5 million to settle a longstanding complaints that the technology company billed U.S. consumers for charges incurred by children buying mobile apps without their parents' consent. A single purchase generally can range from 99 cents to $99, the commission said. One parent told the FTC that her daughter had spent $2,600 in 'Tap Pet Hotel,' in which children can build their own pet lodging. The game is free to download and play, but it takes in-app purchases for treats and coins for the pets. Others consumers reported unauthorized purchases by children totaling more than $500 in the apps 'Dragon Story' and 'Tiny Zoo Friends.' A single purchase generally can range from 99 cents to $99, the commission said. One parent told the FTC that her daughter had spent $2,600 in ""Tap Pet Hotel,"" in which children can build their own pet lodging. The game is free to download and play, but it takes in-app purchases for treats and coins for the pets. Others consumers reported unauthorized purchases by children totaling more than $500 in the apps ""Dragon Story"" and ""Tiny Zoo Friends."" Just how could a kid buy these things without mom or dad's knowledge and run up bills into the hundreds of dollars or more? A game-player wants to advance to a new level or buy coins, a chest of gems or treats for a virtual pet. It takes a click, and then the app asks for a password. The child turns to a parent, who punches it in. But, according to the FTC complaint, Apple did not always make it clear that they were buying something. Parents also were not told that entering the password started a 15-minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult, the agency said. 'You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize,' said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairman. Under the settlement, Apple will be required to provide full refunds, totaling a minimum of $32.5 million, to consumers who were billed for in-app charges that were incurred by children and were either accidental or not authorized by the consumer. Apple must make these refunds promptly, upon request from an account holder. Apple is required to give notice of the availability of refunds to all consumers charged for in-app charges with instructions on how to obtain a refund for unauthorized purchases by kids. Should Apple issue less than $32.5 million in refunds to consumers within the 12 months after the settlement becomes final, the company must remit the balance to the Commission. Apple will have until Mar. 31 to come up with a billing system that ensures the company obtains consumers' informed consent before billing them for in-app purchases. The settlement involves all apps in which minors made unauthorized purchases. It addresses the same issue raised in a class-action lawsuit that Apple resolved last year. In that case, Apple agreed to contact 28 million of its app customers to offer them a $5 store credit or a $30 cash refund if their children had spent at least that much money without parental consent. The deadline for filing a claim was Monday. That settlement resulted in about 37,000 claims, according to a memo that Apple CEO Tim Cook sent to company employees Wednesday to discuss the FTC's rebuke. 'It doesn't feel right for the FTC to sue over a case that had already been settled,' Cook wrote. 'To us, it smacked of double jeopardy.' Cook said the Cupertino, Calif., company relented to the FTC because the consent decree ""does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight."" Apple has taken a series of steps in the past few years to ensure its app store is a ""safe place for customers of all ages."" A selection of apps on Apple's latest iPad. Apps across all of Apple's range are affected by the new decision . Apple's app store is a gold mine for software developers and the company, which charges a 30 percent commission on the transactions. Apple says its customers spent more than $10 billion on app transactions last year. That figure includes the price charged by some apps for the software, as well as revenue from purchases while playing a game or for some other extra service. Children's applications sold in Apple's store generated about 44 percent of its revenue from purchases made while using the software during November, according to the latest data from the research firm App Annie. The remaining revenue came from upfront fees required to download some children's apps from Apple's store. In the FTC case, the $32.5 million payout is a minimum. As part of the settlement, Apple must pay full refunds to consumers for kids' unauthorized purchases, so that figure could climb. If it doesn't rise to $32.5 million, the difference would be paid to the FTC, Ramirez said.Apple is the world's most valued company as measured by market capitalization.","Apple boss emailed employees to say decision 'doesn't feel right'

William Dresser has been arrested for attempted murder after police say he shot his elderly wife in the chest while she lay in hospital . An 88-year-old man allegedly shot his elderly wife in the chest while she was lying in a hospital bed. According to police William Dresser, 88, walked into the rehab unit of Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center, Nevada, yesterday morning before shooting his wife once in the chest with a pistol. Dresser was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and has been placed on suicide watch by officers. His wife, who has not been identified, suffered life-threatening injuries and was transferred to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno. No details of why she was originally admitted to the hospital were released, but officials don't suspect foul play. Dresser's wife was alone in the rehab unit when allegedly he carried out the attack around 11.30am. The hospital was placed into a state of lockdown while hospital security personnel and state Department of Corrections officials detained the man until sheriff's deputies arrived. Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said that Dresser, who recently bought the gun, has no previous criminal record in the Carson City area. Dresser's bail has been set at $225,000. Police were called to Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center (pictured) after reports of the shooting. Dresser's wife, who has not been named, suffered life-threatening injuries .

Americans are reading more ebooks than ever before - but also more print books, it has been revealed. 28% of Americans read at least one e-book in 2013 up from 23% the year earlier, according to a new survey of more than 1,000 adults from the Pew Research Centre. However, it found the percentage of people who read print books increased as well with 69% telling the researchers they had read at least one print book, a rise of 4% from the previous year. The rise of the e-reader: The Pew study found ebook sales at record levels - but also that print books are continuing to sell well . 'Though e-books are rising in popularity, print remains the foundation of Americans’ reading habits. Most people who read e-books also read print books, and just 4% of readers are “e-book only,' the study's authors said. Audiobook listeners have the most diverse reading habits overall, while fewer print readers consume books in other formats. 'Overall, 50% of Americans now have a dedicated handheld device–either a tablet computer like an iPad, or an e-reader such as a Kindle or Nook–for reading e-content,' the center said. 'That figure has grown from 43% of adults who had either of those devices in September.' A new lease of life: Research found that print books were still selling well - and have risen . Based on interviews conducted earlier this month, the study shows 50 percent of respondents saying they have a tablet or stand-alone device such as Amazon.com's Kindle, up from 43 percent in September. However, only around 4 percent read e-books exclusively. Sales for e-books are growing, but have leveled off over the past couple of years. They're believed to comprise 25 to 30 percent of the general trade market, with commercial fiction especially popular for e-books. Ebook sales are at record levels, new research which found 50 per cent of respondents now own a tablet or ereader has found. 'The proportion of Americans who read e-books is growing, but few have completely replaced print books for electronic versions,' said Pew. The percentage of adults who read an e-book in the past year has risen to 28%, up from 23% at the end of 2012. At the same time, about seven in ten Americans reported reading a book in print, up four percentage points after a slight dip in 2012, and 14% of adults listened to an audiobook.

Sharing her view Sarah, another Twitter user, said: 'I don’t need my drama to be all hearts and flowers and happy endings but I struggle with unrelenting grimness in The Village.'

The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication study found the number has risen to 23 percent, up 7 percentage points since April 2013. The latest survey, taken in November 2013, finds that the majority of Americans — 63 percent — do believe in climate change, and 53 percent are 'somewhat' or 'very' worried about the consequences. Climate change protesters on Capitol Hill: Despite protests, more the number of Americans who do not believe in global warming is rising. 'The great majority of climate scientists have concluded that global warming is happening, mostly human caused and, if left unchecked, will have serious consequences for human societies and the natural world,' the report's authors said. 'Yet, over the years, there has been considerable confusion within the American public about the level of scientific agreement on the subject.' The study, conducted in November, found About two in three Americans (63%) believe global warming is happening. 'Relatively few – only 23 percent – believe it is not,' they said. 'The proportion who believe global warming is real has remained steady since Spring 2013. 'However, the proportion who do not believe global warming is happening has increased 7 percentage points since Spring 2013. 'The proportion of Americans who say they 'don’t know' whether or not global warming is happening has dropped 6 points – from 20 to 14 – since Spring of 2013. The researchers also say Americans believe that even if it exists, global warming is not their problem. 'Over years of research, we have consistently found that, on average, Americans view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect far away places, other species, or future generations more than people here and now,' the report says. 'We still find this same pattern, in which fewer than half of Americans (38%) believe they personally will be harmed a 'moderate amount' or a 'great deal' by global warming. Thick dark clouds hang over Jakarta: 23% of Americans do not believe global warming is happening, it has been revealed . 'People who prior said don’t know are increasingly saying they don't believe it,' said Anthony Leiserowitz, who led the study. He told Livescience media coverage surrounding the release of the IPCC report in September may be the explanation for the shift. While the report made a strong case for human-caused climate change, the majority of global media coverage focused on the question of whether there has been a ""pause"" in global warming. 'Media frames can be really important in shaping the way people interpret the news,' he said. The findings divide Americans into six distinct subsets. Sixteen percent are ""alarmed,"" sure global warming is happening and concerned about it. On the opposite end of the spectrum are the ""dismissive,"" who comprise about 15 percent of the public and who almost all see global warming as a conspiracy theory or hoax. Changing either of these two groups' opinions about climate change is nearly impossible, the report found.","Research found 63 percent do believe in climate change .

Chopped: Mary Berry's shark recipe will be removed from her new cook book . She is the queen of baking who can usually do no wrong in the eyes of her fans. But when Mary Berry published a controversial recipe using shark fillets, her loyal followers were horrified. Dozens took to the internet demanding to know why she was encouraging people to eat a species whose numbers are dwindling in the wild because they are being slaughtered illegally for their meat. Now, in the face of mounting pressure, the much-loved TV cook is to remove the offending recipe – Shark With Tropical Salsa – from her Complete Cookbook. Graham Buckingham, of shark and marine conservation charity Bite-Back, said: ‘No modern cookbook should include recipes for shark and other threatened species. ‘The last thing the marine environment needs is more people asking fishmongers for shark and swordfish because Mary Berry thinks it’s OK.’ Those who expressed their anger on the internet included ‘Scorch’, who wrote: ‘Please, please, please do not buy this book. Mary Berry apparently has no regard whatsoever for our oceans, and actually has included a recipe for Shark With Tropical Salsa. ‘Either the lovely Ms. Berry has been too busy to notice all the press surrounding the increasingly dwindling shark population, or she doesn’t care. Either way, please do not encourage this sort of awful consumerism by adding to her profit margin.’ NC wrote: ‘Unbelievably, this cookbook contains recipes that call for the use of shark and swordfish. It is quite frankly disgusting that in this day and age, when shark populations and the marine environment as a whole are subjected to increasing threats, a cookbook is promoting this. Despicable.’ The Complete Cookbook is published internationally by Dorling Kindersley. It was first published in 1995 and the most recent edition, published last year, includes the shark recipe. It will be removed from future editions. In a statement issued through her publishers Mary Berry, who does not specify what kind of shark to use in her recipe, said: ‘As this book is not just sold in the UK, my publishers at DK and I try to include the occasional recipe for fish that is more widely available abroad. Controversial: Mary Berry's shark recipe will be removed from her Complete Cookbook (pictured) ‘My intention for any of my recipes is always to use responsibly sourced ingredients, but in retrospect we realise this wasn’t clear in the recipe. We understand that some species of shark are endangered and we have taken on board concerns. 'I have therefore spoken with my publishers and we have both agreed that this recipe will be removed from future printings of the book.’ Of the more than 400 species of shark, at least 60 are classified as endangered and many have protected status. Bite-Back has led a campaign backed by Gordon Ramsay, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Bear Grylls to condemn chefs who cook with shark. It says a boom in demand for shark fin soup has increased the number of sharks being killed by sea fishermen. More than 90 per cent of the population has been lost in some species over the past 20 to 30 years, according to experts.","Offending recipe - Shark with Tropical Salsa, is to be removed from her Complete Cookbook .

Angry road safety and motoring groups have criticised England’s first controversial new £1million pub on the M40 motorway which opens today amid fears it could raise the risk of drink-driving . The RAC said it was a ‘risky and frankly unnecessary move’ that was ‘at odds with common sense’  while road safety charity Brake said it represented ‘a potentially deadly temptation to drivers.’ Pub chain JD Wetherspoon said its Hope And Champion bar and restaurant will be open from 4am to 1am, seven days a week, in the Extra Motorway Service Area at junction 2 of the M40 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire creating 120 jobs. Scroll down for video . Opening: The launch by JD Wetherspoon at Beaconsfield services on the M40 in Buckinghamshire has prompted safety campaigners to issue a warning to motorists over the temptation of drink-driving . The pub, which is split over two floors, is licensed to serve alcohol from 9am. It  will sell real ale from local and regional brewers as well as hot drinks. But the controversial plans have alarmed safety campaigners concerned about the  added risk of drink-driving  after the new establishment  had its 24-hours license approved in June 2013 by the South Bucks District Council. Ed Morrow, campaigns officer for national road safety charity Brake said: ‘The opening of a pub on a motorway is a serious concern, presenting a potentially deadly temptation to drivers. ‘Drink driving remains one of the biggest killers on our road, causing devastation to families and communities every day.’ Mr Morrow added: ‘It is vitally important that messages about the dangers of drink driving are as strong and obvious as possible, so drivers know it's not okay to stop off for a quick drink on their way home. Our advice is not to have a drop if you are driving.’ Pete Williams, head of external affairs at the RAC whose own poll of motorists showed widespread opposition to the idea of pubs on motorways , said: ’The public appear to be very much against the introduction of motorway pubs. 'We appreciate the vast majority of motorists drive responsibly and that alcohol is already available in shops at motorway services, but for many this decision seems to be at odds with common sense. Stop-off: The £1.2million Hope And Champion pub - which will create 120 jobs - will be open from 4am to 1am, seven days a week, in the Extra Motorway Service Area (pictured) at junction 2 of the motorway . 'In our view this is a risky and frankly unnecessary move. The question we are struggling to answer is: of all the places to open a pub, why choose a motorway service station?’ Mr Williams added: ’The temptation to drink and drive can only be increased by easier access to alcohol. We therefore urge JD Wetherspoon to do all they can to convey the anti-drink-driving message as strongly as possible at this particular pub.’ But JD Wetherspoon's said they are keen to prove they are doing all they can to prevent drink driving. 'The opening of a pub on a motorway is a serious concern' Ed Morrow, Brake . They will include the national Drink Drive Awareness logos on menus and remove all alcoholic promotional deals. Manager of the M40 branch, Steve Baldwin said: ‘Myself and my team are looking forward to welcoming customers into The Hope and Champion."" He said the pub ‘primarily serves the motorway users, but its facilities are also available to the surrounding community from the local road network.’ The RAC’s own research showed just one in eight (12 per cent) of people supported the decision to put pubs into motorway service stations. Of the 2,000 people surveyed, more than six out of ten (64 per cent) opposed such a move. Older drivers being less accepting to the sale of alcohol at a motorway pub than their younger counterparts. The research found that only one in 12 (8 per cent) of those aged over 55 were in favour of pubs being opened at motorway services while seven out of ten (71 per cent) were against. In the younger 18 to 34 age range as many as one  in sex (18 per cent) supported the move and only just over half (52 per cent) disagreed. Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of everyone questioned said they were undecided on the issue. Road: The pub is split over two floors and licensed to serve alcohol from 9am. The M40 motorway is pictured . Doctors and motoring groups said a motorway pub sent out  the ‘wrong message’. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Last year it was revealed that the number of drink-drive deaths had risen by a quarter to 290. 'Given this background does opening a pub at a motorway service station send the right message about road safety? 'People will probably be stopping off and using the loo and having a meal, but the temptation is there to have a drink. I’m very disappointed and I just cannot understand it' Carol Whittingham, Campaign Against Drink Driving . 'The majority of motorists are sensible but people would be forgiven for thinking the official line from ministers is now take a break and have a pint.’ Sir Ian Gilmore, Royal College of Physicians special adviser on alcohol and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said he was ‘disappointed’ by  the decision to open a JD Wetherspoon on the M40: ’We are trying to prevent harm from alcohol-related traffic accidents and this sends out completely the wrong message. ‘The appearance of bars on our motorway network adds greater urgency to the Alcohol Health Alliance’s call for a fundamental review of licensing laws, focusing on the availability of alcohol and reducing alcohol-related harm. 'Public health should be a core licensing objective, and the impact on the health of local people must be a key consideration.' An AA Populus survey found more than two thirds (68 per cent) of drivers were opposed to bars on motorway service areas serving alcohol. AA president Edmund King , AA said: ‘Two thirds of drivers are opposed to bars or shops serving alcohol on motorway service areas. 'Some fear that the fact that alcohol is served in areas mainly only accessible to drivers and their passengers may tempt some drivers to have ‘one for the road’. Our advice is always that if you are going to drive, don’t drink, and if you are going to drink, don’t drive. ‘Perhaps pubs setting up close to motorways should offer free non-alcoholic drinks to drivers to show that they have a genuine concern for road safety.’","Launch by JD Wetherspoon at Beaconsfield services on M40 in Bucks .

Warning: Chris Stevens told officials that militia groups providing security in Benghazi had turned against the U.S. The American ambassador to Libya sent a diplomatic cable spelling out his worries about the security situation in Benghazi on the day he was killed in a raid on the U.S. consulate, it has been revealed. Chris Stevens told State Department officials that two militias which had been providing security in the city were threatening to withdraw over a dispute about U.S. policy. The news comes at the same time as it has emerged that the head of a special-operations team helping the embassy in Libya with security asked for 'more, not less' reinforcements before the government pulled dozens of people out of the country earlier this year. The revelations could come as a further blow to Barack Obama, whose administration has been under fire for failing to prevent last month's terrorist attack. On September 11th, the day he died, Mr Stevens wrote to Washington officials detailing a dispute involving the leaders of two prominent Benghazi militias who were responsible for security in the city, according to the Daily Beast. The two men, Wissam bin Ahmed and Muhammad al-Gharabi, claimed that the U.S. was lobbying for centrist politician Mahmoud Jibril to become Libya's prime minister. They said that if he won the vote, they 'would not continue to guarantee security in Benghazi, a critical function they asserted they were currently providing,' according to Mr Stevens. Despite that warning, Mr Stevens did not ask for more U.S. troops, and commented that Benghazi officials believed the city was becoming safer. The cable made no mention of a U.S.-made YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad which was originally thought to have been the motivation for the deadly assault on the consulate later that night. Scroll down for video . Rage: A protester holding his rifle during the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th . Attack: Four U.S. citizens died in the raid on the consulate in Benghazi, including Mr Stevens . The American compound was being guarded . by members of the 'February 17 Martyrs Brigade', a militia which shared . members with the groups run by Mr bin Ahmed and Mr al-Gharabi. It was not only Mr Stevens who saw potential security issues cropping up in Libya before the September 11 raid. Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, who was head of a Special Forces 'Site Security Team' in the country, said officials felt 'like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers' after a number of troops were withdrawn from Libya in August. He told CBS This Morning that worried embassy staff had approached him to ask if they would still be safe when his team had left. 'I could only answer that what we were being told is that they're working on it,' he said. He added: 'Shooting instances occurred, many instances involved the local security guard force that we were training. 'Constantly, there were battles going on between militias, criminal activity and that became increasing danger as time went on as well.' Pleas: Lt. Col. Andrew Wood said he asked for reinforcements in Libya but faced troop withdrawals instead . Aftermath: The U.S. consulate in Benghazi the day after last month's deadly assault . Mr Wood claimed that other senior officials, including Mr Stevens, had requested a boost in the U.S. security presence, saying: 'We felt we needed more, not less.' Although his team was based in the city's capital Tripoli, Mr Wood said he would have accompanied the ambassador to Benghazi had he still been in the country. State Department officials said that as the Site Security Team was intended to help re-open the embassy in Tripoli, their departure from Libya was irrelevant to the subsequent security situation. They also claimed that Mr Wood did not know the details of the situation in Benghazi, which is 400 miles from the capital. Mr Wood is one of many witnesses who will this week appear at a hearing of the House Oversight Committee investigating the assault.","Chris Stevens wrote cable warning militias could turn against U.S.

One of Morrisons' senior executives has been arrested after allegedly buying shares in Ocado before a £216million deal for the online grocer to deliver its food was announced, it emerged today. Paul Coyle, the supermarket's group treasurer and head of tax, was held before Christmas after an insider trading probe by the Financial Conduct Authority. He is accused of buying an unknown amount of Ocado shares before the deal was announced, which sent the price rocketing last March. Arrest: Paul Coyle, Morrisons' group treasurer and head of tax, was held before Christmas after an insider trading probe by the Financial Conduct Authority linked to the supermarket's deal with Ocado . Ten months on Ocado shares are £2.81 higher and it was the best performing company on the stock market in Europe last year. Mr Coyle was arrested in Harrogate by Yorkshire Police, but despite not being charged he has not returned to work, according to the Daily Telegraph. The authorities would only say a 49-year-old Morrisons worker had been arrested as part of an insider trading investigation. Morrisons has refused to comment. If convicted, it can lead to a huge fine and up to seven years in prison. The deal between Ocado and Morrison's allowed the online retailer to turn a profit for the first time, and it will secure at least one new distribution centre from the cash. Ocado plans to build the centre with its new supermarket partner Morrisons, which began sending out deliveries for the first time this month. Morrisons has suffered for not having a delivery service and also had a disastrous Christmas in its stores. Festive sales were down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago and the company now says full-year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts, around £783million. Its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘quite awful’ by Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers. On the up: Ten months on from its deal with Morrisons, Ocado shares are £2.81 higher and it was the best performing company on the stock market in Europe last year . The company’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service. Chief executive Dalton Philips said it is working hard to catch up and its first deliveries of online orders went out this month, . By contrast, Aldi and Lidl’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success. The stores offered higher quality food and drink, from aged fillet steaks at £5 to award-winning mince pies and fresh turkeys.","Paul Coyle held after Financial Conduct Authority insider trading probe .

The European Space Agency (ESA) has revealed exactly how it hopes Rosetta probe will land on a comet later this year. The craft will perform a breathtaking complex series of moves described as 'a space dance' to enable it to fly close enough to the surface to identify a landing site. It will then release its lander - if it can complete the moves mission controller liken to 'parachuting onto the tip of a mountain.’ Watch the amazing path the probe will take . After a ten year journey through space, ESA’s Rosetta spacecraft will reach comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014. After catching up with the comet Rosetta will slightly overtake and enter orbit from the ‘front’ of the comet as both the spacecraft and 67P/CG move along their orbits around the Sun. Rosetta will carry out a complex series of manoeuvres to reduce the separation between the spacecraft and comet from around 100 km to 25-30 km. From this close orbit, detailed mapping will allow scientists to determine the landing site for the mission’s Philae lander. Immediately prior to the deployment of Philae in November, Rosetta will come to within just 2.5 km of the comet’s nucleus. The comet-chasing probe is set to be woken from its deep space slumber early next week, the European Space Agency (ESA) has said. At precisely 10 am GMT on 20 January, the Rosetta spacecraft be brought back to life as it moves closer towards Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenk. When Europe's Rosetta spacecraft wakes, scientists are hoping it will be ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land on the comet. The scientists are in for an nerve-wracking wait as there is little room for mistakes as the coming months. After it is woken from its slumber, the spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It will then attempt a historic landing in November 2014 the intercepting a 4km wide comet as it hurtles towards the sun. ‘Imagine trying to parachute onto the tip of a mountain,’ said Paolo Ferri, head of mission operations at the European Space Agency (ESA). The effort is different from Nasa’s Deep Impact probe that fired a projectile into comet Tempel in 2005, hurling a plume of matter into space for scientists to study. Rosetta's journey: The probe carried out a series of orbits to slingshot itself towards its target . Rosetta was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation. In 2014, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s surface in November. The time for Rosetta to wake up and prepare for this most exciting scientific adventure is now fast approaching. That mission was more of a sniper shot compared to the extended meeting ESA is planning for its spacecraft. Launched in 2004, Rosetta has already spent almost 10 years in space preparing for its big day. The probe had to conduct three fly-bys of Earth and one of Mars, taking advantage of the planets' gravity to accelerate sufficiently to intercept comet 67P as it orbits the sun at speeds of up to 100,000 kph (62,000 mph). The spacecraft has been in hibernation for more than two years now to conserve energy. ESA has been using the time to solve two glitches that could jeopardise the mission: a problem with two of the four `reaction wheels' used to turn the spacecraft, and a small leak of helium that could affect the thrusters which are vital for its final manoeuvres. ‘This is making our life more difficult,’ Dr Ferri acknowledges. But he added that engineers have found workarounds. If all goes according to plan, the probe's instruments will slowly switch themselves back on, though scientists will have a tense few hours of waiting before they can be sure the spacecraft is in full working order. The following months will involve a gradual approach of 67P, as Rosetta gently slows down and eventually draws up alongside the comet in what Dr Ferri likened to two planes flying in formation. The spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Pictured is an artist's impression of the comet . This will give the mission team time to take plenty of pictures of the comet, which is about 4km (2.5 miles) in diameter, and identify a good landing site. At the moment scientists are divided over whether to pick a site close to the comet's three active regions - where matter appears to be released into space - or to stay away from them to prevent dust from harming the lander's sensitive instruments. The lander - called Philae - will drop onto the surface of 67P and latch on using a harpoon, to prevent it from drifting off into space due to the comet's weak gravity. Using drills, it will dig up samples and analyse them using on-board instruments. Researchers hope to gain fascinating insights from the results, because comets have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the universe. ‘This time capsule's been locked away for 4.6 billion years,’ said ESA's director of science Mark McCaughrean. One key question scientists hope the mission can help answer is whether comets are responsible for the water on Earth, he said. Scientists believe the spacecraft's star trackers are now beginning to warm up, taking around six hours. Its thrusters will fire to stop the slow rotation. A slight adjustment will be made to Rosetta's orientation to ensure that the solar arrays are still facing directly towards the sun .

Happy father: The Duke of Cambridge during his first interview since the birth of Prince George, for a documentary to be screened next month . Prince William has revealed how the birth of his ‘little rascal’ son has changed his life. In a candid interview, his first since becoming a father, he admitted the days following George’s arrival had been ‘emotional’, and affected him more than he thought possible. But the prince could not resist joking about the sleepless nights and endless  dirty nappies of fatherhood – and how his newborn son reminded him of his younger brother, Prince Harry. Asked about what legacy he would like to leave George, he quipped: ‘At the moment, the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times.’ William gave the interview, his first since George’s birth on July 22, to CNN’s royal correspondent Max Foster as part of a  documentary about his determination to preserve wildlife in Africa. Prince William’s Passion: New Hope, New Father airs on the American channel on  September 15, but excerpts of the interview have been released today. He was interviewed in the gardens of  Kensington Palace on August 2, when his son was 11 days old. On being a new father, William said: ‘I think the last few weeks for me have been just a very different emotional experience. Something I never thought I would feel myself. 'And I find, again it’s only been a short period, but a lot of things affect me differently now. He recalled the ‘daunting’ moment he introduced George to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, and made clear his determination to give his son as normal a life as possible. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Exclusive: William sat down at Kensington palace with CNN's Max Foster for a one-hour special documentary - Prince William's Passion:  New Father, New Hope . Range of emotions: The Duke of Cambridge joked about the 'badge of honour' of changing his first nappy but also touched on more serious subjects like the preserving of endangered species in Africa . On leaving hospital, he said: ‘I think . more shock and dauntingness [sic] was the feeling I felt but … I think I . was on such a high anyway, and so was Catherine, about George that . really we were happy to show him off to whoever wanted to see him. ‘As . any new parent knows, you’re only too happy to show off your new child . and, you know, proclaim that he is the best looking or the best . everything.’ But asked . whether he was comfortable with the experience, William admitted: ‘Again . it’s not somewhere I enjoy being, [but] I know that the position I’m . in ... that’s what’s required of me to do. ‘It’s . nice that people want to see George, so, you know – I’m just glad he . wasn’t screaming his head off the whole way through.’ The . prince revealed that his decision to take the wheel as they drove away . from hospital was intended as a public demonstration of his . determination to do things his way. Magic moment: A month ago the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, and the world got to see their newborn son and future king . Off home: Prince George cried lustily, like his father when he was born, as he was taken back to Kensington Palace by his parents after being born on July 22 . As William hoisted George’s car seat into his Range Rover in front of the world’s media last month, every parent watching held their breath. And when he did it perfectly, they knew his secret: practice. William admitted: ‘I was terrified that … it was going to fall off or it wasn’t going to close properly. So, I had actually practised with that seat – but only once.’ He . said: ‘Where I can be I am as independent as I want to be, the same as . Catherine and Harry. We’ve all grown up differently to other . generations. And I very much feel if I can do it myself, I want to do it . myself. ‘And there are times where you can’t do it yourself and the system takes over or it’s appropriate to do things differently. ‘But, . I think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really . important to me. And I don’t like fuss, so it’s much easier to just do . it yourself.’ Asked by Mr . Foster if he was sending a message to the world, he replied: ‘I think . so. I’m just doing it the way I know … if it’s the right way then . brilliant, if it’s not – if it’s the wrong way – then I’ll try to do it . better. ‘But I’m reasonably . headstrong about what I believe in, and what I go for, and I’ve got . fantastic people around me who give me great support and advice.’ And he joked: ‘And I didn’t stall! It’s an automatic, so it’s alright.’ Asked about baby George’s character, William said affectionately: ‘Well, yeah – he’s a little bit of a rascal, put it that way. ‘So he either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger. I’m not sure. ‘But he’s doing very well at the moment. He does like to keep having his nappy changed.’ And . William confirmed that he changed his son’s first nappy while still at . hospital, describing it as a nerve-wracking experience.

William has said that he wants George to experience the same things and be inspired in the same way he was, starting with around his cot. 'I’ll have toy elephants and rhinos . around the room.  We’ll cover it in sort of, you know, lots of bushes . and things like that', he said. ‘I . did the first nappy, yeah,’ he said. ‘A badge of honour, exactly. I . wasn’t allowed to get away with that. I had every midwife staring at me, . “You do it. You do it”. ‘He’s growing quite quickly actually. But he’s a little fighter. He kind of, he wriggles around quite a lot. ‘And . he doesn’t want to go to sleep that much, which is a little bit of a . problem ...’ Mr Foster asked: ‘So you’re up a little bit at night?’ ‘A . little bit,’ William replied. ‘Not as much as Catherine. But, you know, she’s doing a fantastic job [she’s doing] very well.’ The . couple are clearly making sure their cocker spaniel, Lupo, doesn’t feel . neglected. He said: ‘For me, Catherine, and now little George are my . priorities. And Lupo. He’s coping all right, actually. As a lot of . people know who have got dogs and are bringing newborn back, they take a . little bit of time to adapt, but, no he’s been all right so far. ‘He’s been slobbering sort of around the house a bit, so he’s perfectly happy.’ And . although it was perhaps not terribly politically correct to admit it, . William also joked that it would be a relief to return to work as an RAF . Search and Rescue pilot based on Anglesey, North Wales. He . returned to work on August 7 after a fortnight’s statutory paternity . leave, and was finally joined by Kate and their son early last week. He . said: ‘Well, as a few fathers might know, I’m actually quite looking . forward to going back to work. Get some sleep.

Having fun: Prince William tickles a young child in Lesotho, southern Africa, and the future king says he would like his son to experience the continent when he grows up . William . also discussed his hope that one day Prince George will have the same . love of Africa that he had Harry did as boys. His own passion for the . continent was instilled in him by his father, Prince Charles, and his . late mother Princess Diana.

The blood-stained shirt that the governor of Texas was wearing while riding inside the car with President Kennedy on the day he was shot has now been put on display. Governor John Connally was seated in front of the President in the open-top convertible when the shooting occurred, and he was hit in the chest. Now the bloody shirt and suit that Connally wore on that day when he nearly died have been put on display as part of an exhibit being organized in coordination with the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination. Part of history: The suit and shirt that Governor John Connally wore on the day of the Kennedy assassination have been put on display as part of the 50th anniversary commemorations . Bullet hole: Connally was shot in the chest but managed to be saved, unlike President Kennedy . Close: Connally was seated directly in front of President Kennedy in the fatal car ride on November 22, 1963 . It will be the first public display since 1964 for the clothing Connally wore November 22, 1963, during Kennedy's visit. The white Arrow brand shirt, size 16 with a 35-inch sleeve, has faded over the years and the now brown blood stains and spatters cover nearly all of it. There are bullet holes in the shirt's chest, back shoulder and right cuff and three buttons are missing, presumably due to emergency medical responders ripping the garment away to reach Connelly's chest wound. The damage to the three-button suit, from Oxford Clothiers in Fort Worth, is less pronounced. His wife Nellie Connally had it cleaned before it was presented to the state archives, Anderson said, so there's no evidence of blood but the coat has bullet holes that match those on the shirt, plus a hole on the left leg just above and toward the inside of the knee. Jarring: This is the first time that the shirt and suit will be publicly displayed, seen here in the Archives in Austin . Shot in the chest: The bullet could have killed Connally but he was saved at the hospital . Emergency room staff at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital removed the clothing from Connally after the shooting since he was seriously wounded. John Anderson, preservation officer at the archives, said the display tells an important aspect of a well-known story. 'For Texans, this is something that maybe gets forgotten by some of the rest of the world, that Governor Connally was shot at the same time,' he said, noting that Connally's chest wound could have been fatal. Part of history: Conservator Sarah Norris is seen next to the shirt that was donated by Connally's wife . 'The first thing that jumps out at you is the damage,' said Norris, who has been assembling the exhibit for several months. 'The most dramatic is the shirt.' The shirt and suit are jarring, but they are not necessarily the best-known pieces of clothing from the fatal day. The pink blood-stained suit that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was wearing at the time of the shooting, but that will not be part of the exhibit since it is held at the National Archives in Maryland. It has never been displayed.","Texas Governor John Connally was sitting in front of President Kennedy on that fatal day in Dallas .

A successful lawyer working for a high-profile law firm recently turned in a departure memo saying that she could no longer juggle her work and family responsibilities. The woman, identified only as Mrs X, wrote a heart-wrenching email to her co-workers at law firm Clifford Chance in Washington, D.C., spelling out her 20-hour days filled with stress, spit-up, and sine qua nons. Her letter, obtained by blog Above The Law, spells out a typical day for the working mother, which begins at 4am and didn’t end until 1:30am the next day, punctuated with long commutes, meetings, and parenting duties that go well into the night. Having it all? One lawyer in Washington wrote in a resignation email that she could no longer do 20-hour days juggling work and family (stock photo) Mrs X begins her departure memo with a play-by-play of how she spent a typical day, starting at 4am with checking in on her crying child, and ending only after hours of exhausting meetings, commuting children to and from daycare, and answering thousands of emails on her BlackBerry. By 7:30am, the working mother had already made her children breakfast, dressed them, and changed the sheets of her young son, who wet the bed. She writes: ‘Realize that I am still in my pajamas and haven’t showered, so pull my hair back in a ponytail and throw on a suit.’ She won't have the chance to shower until 1:30 the next morning. Then, Mrs X writes, it’s time for the daily commute, complete with congestion and her infant child spitting up on her suit. By 9:20, she manages to get her children to daycare, gets to the office, and dials in five minutes late to a conference call. From that point on, her day is a blur of client calls, meetings, endless to-do lists, and of course, emails. At 2pm, she explains: ‘Realize I forgot to eat lunch, so go to the 9th floor kitchen to score some leftovers.’ Only a half hour later, she receives a ‘frantic’ email from one of her clients demanding an answer to a question that day. Mrs X writes that she has to pick up her children from daycare by 5:30pm. For every minute late, she must pay $5 per child. Following a 5:50pm pickup, the frazzled mother faces rush-hour traffic and her two children hungry and screaming in the back of the vehicle. All work and no play: The mother, Mrs X, worked at the Washington, D.C. branch of Clifford Chance . By 7:15, she makes a quick dinner of microwaved chicken nuggets for her family, bathes her children (after losing a negotiation with her husband), and puts them to bed. But her day is far from over. After the children are asleep, she checks emails and does even more work. At one point, she dozes off and makes coffee. She manages to find time to shower at 1am (‘Lord knows I won’t have time in the morning,’ she writes), and is asleep by 1:30. The memo then says: ‘REPEAT.’ Argument: The question of whether women can have it all was famously questioned by Ann-Marie Slaughter in the July/August issue of The Atlantic . Mrs X then wrote that she ‘truly admires all of you that have been able to juggle your career and family and do not envy what a challenge it is trying to do each well.’ Above The Law’s Elie Mystal observed that maintaining such a gruelling schedule day to day is simply impossible. ‘You’ve got to keep going back and forth, not just in terms of where you are, but also in terms of your focus,’ she wrote. Mrs X’s time-crunch dilemma is part of a much larger topic that touches on a buzz-worthy subject – if the working woman can ‘have it all.’ The Huffington Post’s Lisa Belkin wrote that especially in law, the workplace is ‘a 1950s model set in a 2012 world,’ requiring workers to put in extreme hours ‘with no distractions, because there is someone (traditionally a wife) at home to sort out the rest of their lives.’ Ms Belkin goes on to say that this model is intrinsically flawed, as the new model is that of a dual-income household, with both parents working out of necessity.  That leaves women - the traditional caregiver - dual responsibility. The Atlantic’s Anne-Marie Slaughter stoically rejected that a work-life balance was possible for working moms in the much-debated cover story from the July/August issue of the magazine. Ms Slaughter worked as a high-profile government official but noted in the article she had little time for her family. ‘I still strongly believe that women can “have it all” (and that men can too),’ she wrote. ’But not today, not with the way America’s economy and society are currently structured. 'My experiences over the past three years have forced me to confront a number of uncomfortable facts that need to be widely acknowledged—and quickly changed.’ A day in the life of Ms. X (and many others here, I presume): . 4:00am: Hear baby screaming, hope I am dreaming, realize I’m not, sleep walk to nursery, give her a pacifier and put her back to sleep . 5:30am: Alarm goes off, hit snooze . 6:00am: See the shadow of a small person standing at my bedroom door, realize it is my son who has wet the bed (time to change the sheets) 6:15am: Hear baby screaming, make a bottle, turn on another excruciating episode of Backyardigans, feed baby . 7:00am: Find some clean clothes for the kids, get them dressed . 7:30am: Realize that I am still in my pajamas and haven’t showered, so pull hair back in a ponytail and throw on a suit . 8:00am: Pile into the car, drive the kids to daycare . 9:00am: finally arrive at daycare, baby spits up on suit, get kids to their classrooms, realize I have a conference call in 15 minutes . 9:20am: Run into my office, dial-in to conference call 5 minutes late and realize that no one would have known whether or not I was on the call, but take notes anyway . 9:30am: Get an email that my time is late, Again! Enter my time . 10:00am: Team meeting; leave with a 50-item to-do list . 2:00pm: Realize I forgot to eat lunch, so go to the 9th floor kitchen to score some leftovers . 5:00pm: receive conflicting comments from Senior Associate and Partner (one in new version and one in track changes); attempt to reconcile; send redline . 5:30pm: wait for approval to send response to client; realize that I am going to be late picking up the kids from daycare ($5 for each minute late) 6:00pm: race to daycare to get the kids (they are the last two there) 6:30pm: TRAFFIC with a side of screaming kids who are starving . 7:15pm: Finally arrive home, throw chicken nuggets in the microwave, feed the family . 7:45pm: Negotiate with husband over who will do bathtime and bedtime routine; lose . 8:00pm: Bath, pajamas, books, bed . 9:00pm: Kids are finally asleep, check blackberry and have 25 unread messages . 11:30pm: Wake up and realize I fell asleep at my desk; make more coffee; get through task number three . 1:00am: Jump in the shower (lord knows I won’t have time in the morning) 1:30am: Finally go to bed .

Serenaded by a jazz band, a chapter of Hell’s Angels, his family and more old geezers than on the Old Kent Road, Ronnie Biggs made his last escape yesterday afternoon — to the hereafter. His wicker coffin draped in the flags of Britain and his adopted Brazil, the best-known — if least important — of the Great Train Robbers was almost a figure of suburban respectability as he took his final bow in the same North London crematorium as Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw and the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar. But here, too, were all the trappings of a traditional gangland funeral — minus the horse-drawn hearse and gold knuckledusters. Scroll down for video . The Great Train Robber's coffin, draped with a Union Flag, a Brazilian flag and a scarf of his beloved Arsenal football team is carried into Golders Green Crematorium . Tribute: Biggs's granddaughter Ingrid and son Michael speak during the funeral service . Guests had been respectfully asked not to dress in black or wear ‘aggressive or offensive jewellery’. How thoughtful. The rules did not seem to apply to floral tributes, though. One mourner had sent one in the shape of Biggs’s trademark V-sign. Shakespeare . and the poems of Biggs the bard himself were liberally quoted in a . service that drew large numbers of shaven-headed men in leather coats . and a few hard-smoking women. How . many actually knew the man? One of the Hell’s Angels cheerfully . admitted he was just a ‘hanger on’, but said he was glad to be part of . it all. There was also a smattering of celebrities from showbusiness and . the criminocracy. Actor . Steven Berkoff arrived late — ‘the traffic was murder’ he told a . congregation not unfamiliar with the real thing — to deliver his . reflections on ‘a modern-day Ulysses’. Drug . smuggler-turned-author Howard Marks saluted ‘a man of great nobility’ while admitting he had never actually met Biggs in person. Celebrity . ex-gangster Dave Courtney arrived bearing a floral display in the shape . of a train and the succinct inscription ‘Gutted’. In loving memory: A copy of the order of service for the funeral of Ronnie Biggs . Send off: The Hells Angels bikers arrive at the funeral, leading the coffin to the crematorium . Armed . robber and certified madman Charles Bronson also sent a bouquet from . prison and a separate message that was read out during the service: . ‘Ronnie was an icon, a man’s man. Max respect to a diamond geezer.’ There . was a lot of this sort of stuff all afternoon and on into the night as . the mourners grew increasingly lachrymose at a boozer on the Finchley . Road. Also represented was . another strand of London criminal folklore in the form of Freddie ‘Brown . Bread’ Foreman, erstwhile henchman of the Kray twins. But . for all the clapped-out tough guy posturing and half-hearted clenched . fist salutes, the most genuine moment of the day was when Biggs’s son, . Michael, delivered a moving eulogy to the father who had, for many . years, raised him as a single parent in Rio. Acknowledging . that Biggs the villain had been a ‘petty crook who never had any real . success’, he spoke emotionally of the jazz-loving, samba-dancing, . Arsenal-mad champion of the underdog who became ‘my dad, my mum, my . entire family’. Tribute: A six-piece Dixie band joined the procession for the final part of the journey to the crematorium.Leading the hearse and funeral cars, it played songs including When the Saints Come Marching In . Defiance: Ronnie Biggs, seen last year when he made his final public appearance (left), gives a two-fingered salute. He was involved in the Great Train Robbery when he was much younger (right) in 1963 . Michael was . the product of Biggs’s affair with a Brazilian dancer after he had fled . to Rio from Australia when his cover was blown in 1970. His . first wife, the devoted Charmian, remained in Australia with their two . surviving sons (another boy, Nicky, died in a car accident). She . still lives there, still bears his name and had sent her own recording . of Shakespeare’s sonnet — ‘Let me not to the marriage of true minds. Admit . impediments ...’  This was more than goodbye to a famous ex-con. This . was a farewell to that black-and-white world of old-style cops and . robbers, of ‘Slipper of the Yard’ and ‘Buster’ Edwards, of bygone heists . planned in smoke-filled pubs and exhaustively chronicled by Fleet . Street for the benefit of a more innocent world. The . Great Train Robbery remains the last criminal showstopper of modern . times which did not involve guns, knives, death, sex or drugs. The . 30-year sentence Biggs received would be inconceivable now. Final sendoff: Draped in both a British flag and a Brazilian flag - in honour of the South American country where he spent so many years on the run - Ronnie Biggs' coffin is taken to his funeral . Hells Angels: The bikers went in front of the funeral cortege as the coffin was driven to the crematorium . Tribute act: The bikers arrive at Ronnie Biggs' family's home in Barnet, north London, to make the journey to the crematorium . For . all the sentimental tosh  spoken about it yesterday, however, it was no . Ealing comedy. Train driver Jack Mills received a savage beating and . many of those involved were never the same again. Biggs . was not a key member of the  gang that seized more than £2.6 million . from the Glasgow-to- London mail train in August 1963. His job had merely been to supply a bent train driver to replace Mills (in the end, Biggs’s man was not even up to the task). Biggs himself once likened his role to that of ‘teaboy’. His . notoriety and enduring  celebrity followed his escape from Wandsworth . Prison to Australia and, latterly, Brazil, where he spent 31 years . raising his proverbial two fingers to British justice. Even after returning home in 2001, upon which he was immediately imprisoned, his attitude was much the same. Short . of cash and laid low by three strokes, he threw himself at the mercy of . the NHS and the British taxpayer, pleading: ‘I am a sick man. My last . wish is to walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of . bitter.’ Defiant to the last: Thief Ronnie Biggs swears at photographers at the funeral of fellow Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds last year . Living it up: Ronnie Biggs relaxes in Brazil in 1997 where he spent 36 years on the run from British justice before returning to get medical care . Notorious: Ronnie Biggs, who died last month, revelled in the fame his heinous crime brought him . In 2009, Britain was taken for another ride when Biggs was released from prison in the belief that he was about to die. Two . years later, he was still well enough to say that he was ‘proud’ to . have been one of the robbers, adding: ‘I would do it all again without . the slightest hesitation!’ Nine . months ago, hunched in a wheelchair at the funeral of gang leader Bruce . Reynolds, Biggs raised another two-fingered salute at the media. Yet . it was the media whom Biggs had to thank for the one thing that kept . the money rolling in long after his stolen loot ran out: the legend of . Ronnie Biggs. Yesterday, that legend came to an end, far from the dancing girls of the Copacabana, in Golders Green crematorium. As his son admitted fondly, the old rogue had not even left enough money to cover last night’s bar bill.","Ronnie Biggs, the Great Train Robber, died last month aged 84 .

The dynamic duo doesn’t face criminal charges because they legally own the gun, and declined to comment through a team spokesperson, according to a Sun Sentinel report. Scroll down for video . Bombshell: Lauren Tannehill, wife of Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill, left an AR-15 assault rifle in the back of a rented SUV . Ms Tannehill rented the white Nissan Rogue Jan 4 for only a few hours before she swapped it for another car. The fully loaded was then rented to Judith Fleissig, 58, of Rochester, New York. Ms Fleissig drove around southern Florida for two days before her daughter discovered a bag in the back of the vehicle. Ms Fleissig’s daughtrer opened the bag expecting to find an ID, she instead found the firearm. ‘We got out of the car, we were kind of freaked out,’ she told the paper. ‘I didn’t want to touch it.’Both women were stunned.

The late actor Richard Griffiths was known for halting plays to tell audience members to leave the theatre when he heard their mobile phones ringing in the stalls. But opera singer Alfie Boe humiliated one woman with a ringing phone in a very different way at a concert in Cardiff - by interrupting his performance to pick up the device and speak to her mother. The 40-year-old tenor revealed in an interview that he put the phone on loudspeaker through his microphone and told the woman he was in the middle of a show and standing next to her daughter. Memorable moment: Tenor Alfie Boe interrupted his performance in Cardiff when a woman's phone began to ring by picking up the device and speaking to her mother (file picture) The father-of-two told the Yorkshire Post: ‘Just as I was introducing the next song, I heard a loud ringing noise, and spotted a woman trying to switch off her phone. ‘So I walked down into the audience, made my way along her row, and introduced myself. I asked if I could have a look at her phone and pressed the redial button. It started buzzing at the other end. ‘Then someone picked up, and it was the woman’s mother. I told her that I was Alfie Boe, that I was in the middle of a show, and that her daughter was standing right next to me.’ Boe said the unidentified mother did not believe him when he told her his name, so he got everyone in the packed audience to shout it out, which ‘convinced her, and we had a very nice conversation’. The singer told the newspaper that it was . one of the most memorable moments of the performance - and he does not . think the woman will ever again take a mobile phone to a concert. Making their opinions known: Other actors who have criticised the owners of mobile phones for allowing them to ring during stage performances include Kevin Spacey (left) and Daniel Craig (right) A spokesman for Boe told MailOnline it was not the first time the singer had answered an audience member's mobile phone at a concert - with the same thing happening at a show in Birmingham. He added that Boe once took the phone of an audience member who was trying to take a photo of a concert - and posed for a 'selfie' with his band on stage, before returning the phone to them.

It’s called LeBroning and is sure to show up at a shopping mall near you very soon. The process is simple: while a friend takes video, the Lebroner ever-so-slightly bumps into an innocent passerby and then flops to the ground with as much flair as possible. Scroll down for video . LeBroning: LeBron James' habit of faking fouls by flopping dramatically to the ground has spawned a viral internet trend of LeBroning . Super flop: This instance of James' alleged flopping from the Miami Heat's 2013 Eastern Conference Final game against the Pacers was a particularly dramatic flop that helped spawn LeBroning . The result is a hilarious jab at a the Miami Heat forward’s controversial habit. The NBA first instituted rules last season in hopes of stopping the act of deceiving referees into making calls when there was little or no contact. James’s most recent display of flopping prowess came just a day after he revealed to CBS his lax attitude toward the practice. Viral: The trend of LeBroning has swept schools and shopping malls nationwide and the tricksters are posting them online en masse . Tribute: The joke is a hilarious tribute to an accomplished basketball star . ‘Guys have been accustomed to doing it for years, and it's not even a bad thing,’ he said. ‘You're just trying to get the advantage. Any way you can get the advantage over an opponent to your team win, then so be it.’ That advantage comes at a price. Houston Rockets guard James Harden was fined $5,000 by the NBA on Monday for flopping and became the first player to get such a penalty. Though a thorn in the side of referees and costly to guilty players, the practice has gifted the world a wealth of hilarious videos.

The average FTSE 100 boss earned more money by 9am today than a typical British worker will earn this year, a report reveals today. On a day dubbed ‘Fat Cat Wednesday’, the report warned there is ‘clearly something wrong’ with the excesses of executive pay in this country. On average, chief executives in the FTSE index of Britain’s 100 biggest public companies earn a total pay package of £4.3million, including their salary and bonus. Intense: Chief executives earn an average of £4.3million a year, which beats £26,500 in just two days . By comparison, the average worker with a full-time job earns £26,500, according to the report from the High Pay Centre, an independent think-tank. It calculates the boss is earning around £1,100 per hour, based on ‘generous’ assumptions that they work 12-hour days, work three in four weekends and take only 10 days’ holiday a year. As a result, Britain’s elite band of chief executives will have earned more money by 9am today after just two days’ back at their desk following their Christmas holiday than an ordinary worker takes a whole year to earn. Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Fat Cat Wednesday highlights how insensitive big company executives have become. ‘When top bosses take home more in two and a half days than the average worker earns in a year, there is clearly something wrong with the way pay is set for both bosses and workers.’ Executive pay remains a hugely controversial subject in this country, with no sign that the recent financial crisis has restrained the gold-plated excesses of the boardrooms. Lord Oakeshott blasts the figures as 'market failure', saying creators, not managers should earn more . Between 2011 and 2012, for example, the average pay package received by a FTSE 100 chief executive jumped by around £400,000, according to the report. Lord Oakeshott, a leading Lib Dem peer, slammed the huge gulf between executive pay and the pay of ordinary workers, who have suffered the longest pay squeeze in history. Lord Oakeshott said: ‘This must be market failure. ‘When the average big company boss – mediocre or worse as well as the best – collects more in a few days than his staff get in a whole year. ‘Most of them are not risk-taking entrepreneurs who have founded and built a business. Creators, not managers, deserve the really big rewards.’ Last week, it emerged Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, had been handed £1.5million in free shares on top of his ‘basic’ salary of £1million. Mr McEwan, who has promised not to sell any RBS shares while he remains chief executive, was given them to persuade him to leave his former employer, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton has spoken of his ‘completely out of body experiences’ when negotiating bankers’ pay packages at the State-owned bank. Some were ‘absolutely outraged’ that they earned only £4million a year when a rival at another bank earns £6million to do the same job, he said. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘Soaring pay inequality, with top bosses now taking home more in a few days than most workers earn in a year, is damaging our economy. ‘Workers need better pay rises so that the recovery is built on growing incomes, rather than falling savings and mounting household debts. ‘But Britain’s fat cat bosses are hoarding earnings owed to staff for shareholders and themselves.’","Average chief executive earns £4.3million a year, which is £1,100 an hour .

'Dune, for the time being, is a concept,' said Michael Horn, Volkswagen Group of America president and chief executive after the unveiling. 'If people like it, we work on the concept and we create a very specific marketing campaign for it'. Such a promotional plan aims to reach young, creative types like those who took over the stage, bohemian flash mob style, during its unveiling.

A group led by the Canadian band 'Walk Off the Earth' serenaded the crowd with a version of their song, 'Gang of Rhythm,' the video for which shows them banging - rhythmically - on a VW Beetle.

The Dune gets the same 210-horsepower, 2-Liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine as the Beetle R-Line, which gets 23 mpg (9.8 kpl) in the city and 29 mpg (12.3 kpl) on the highway. No price or date for production was announced for the Dune. The current R-Line starts at $24,795 excluding shipping.","VW envisions the Beetle Dune appealing to skiers in Aspen, Colorado, or sandboarders in Florence, Oregon .

He told Komo that he has 'no tiny little bit of doubt at all' that the Seahawks will bring the Vince Lombardi trophy home from the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Connors' tattoo artist was worried at first, but has no come round to his client's optimistic way of thinking.

British prosecutors have written to their counterparts in Portugal, seeking urgent help with their investigation into her disappearance. A second ‘International Letter of Request’ – outlining inquiries that Met detectives want carried out by the Portuguese – was sent by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) last week.

A vinyl pressing service is mixing the ashes of dead people into records to create a somewhat macabre memento. A UK company called (somewhat appropriately) And Vinyly put the cremated body parts into raw vinyl that is used to make the discs and turns them into a macabre memento of a person’s life. Basic packages cost £2,000 for up to 30 discs - far less than the cremation or traditional burial. And Vinyly claims that for £10,000 you can have your entire funeral planned around the death song. If you can't choose a song,  predetermined backing tracks are available for £250 each . The hard part is supposedly choosing a record, with some opting for 12 minutes of laughter or songs with puns in the title. For those who prefer a ‘minimal’ approach, And Vinyly can press the ashes into the vinyl with no song. The process involves sprinkling the ash onto a piece of vinyl, known as a puck or biscuit. The vinyl is then pressed by plates to create grooves and press the ash into the record. And Vinyly was founded by British music producer Jason Leach in 2009 but has seen a surge in interest recently. And Vinyly was founded by British music producer Jason Leach in 2009 but has seen a surge in interest recently. One of his clients was a DJ whose family wanted him 'to be played at his favourite clubs a few more times' after he died .

Other options include having your record sent to shops around the world to be sold just like any other album. If you are still not sure how it all works, the website features a death-like character holding a scythe with a needle head on it, a pair of headphones on his head and a record bag on his shoulder. The website states: ‘Please note, despite the light hearted tone, all services are carried out with the utmost respect and care’. Surprisingly, putting your ashes into vinyl is far from the most bizarre thing you can do with them. Leach said he was inspired by an American who put his ashes into fireworks, though others have had them put into gun powder and fired out of shotguns. Space burial company Celestis will send your ashes into orbit for around £1,500 or into deep space for £8,000. Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards once claimed to have snorted a line of his father’s ashes because he ‘couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow’. And U.S. designer Edward ‘Steady Ed’ Headrick, who revolutionised the Frisbee, told his children that he wanted his ashes mixed into a batch of the plastic objects. When he died in 2002, his son Daniel did as he asked and said: ‘He said he wanted to end up in a Frisbee that accidentally lands on someone's roof.’ Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards once claimed to have snorted a line of his father's ashes because he 'couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow' When you lose a loved one, it is common to keep something belonging to them so you can feel that you have a part of them forever. But this has been taken to a whole new level in a craze which sees cremated remains from loved ones turned into ink and used as tattoos. Using cremation ashes, known as cremains, are being used by more and more people to be injected into their skin. Bob Johnson of Finest Lines tattoo parlour in Wickliffe, Ohio, has been doing the commemorative tattoos for 30 years. He explains the process, adding that the amount of ashes they actually use is microscopic: 'The preparation is different but it's the same way we would do any tattoo. We sterilize them first in an autoclave as we would the rest of the equipment, and them make sure it's fine powder and mix it with the ink.' But some health and safety experts worry about the practice and that it may be unhygienic or harmful to clients. Proponents say the ash is made sterile and poses no health risk.","'And Vinyly' mixes cremated ashes into vinyl from £250 .

Billionaire basketball team owner Mark Cuban has won a years-long battle with the US government to prove he did not commit insider trading. Mr Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks, was accused of committing insider trading when he sold his stake in an internet company in 2004. The jury in Dallas's federal district court said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to prove the key elements of the case. Mark Cuban has won a legal battle with the US government to prove he did not commit insider trading . It was claimed that Mr Cuban had agreed to keep certain information confidential and not trade on it. The nine-member jury took only a few hours to deliberate on their verdict after a three-week trial.The original lawsuit was filed in 2008. In an impomptu news conference outside the courthouse, Mr Cuban denounced the SEC and its lead trial attorney, Jan Folena. He claimed they lied about the evidence and targeted him because of his fame. He said defendants of lesser wealth could have been bullied. 'Hopefully people will start paying attention to how the SEC does business,' Mr Cuban said. 'I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I'm glad this happened to me. I'm glad I'm able to be the person who can afford to stand up to them.' Ms Folena, who left the courthouse minutes before Mr Cuban, said, 'We believe we did the best we could in this case, and things turn out the way they turn out.' Mr Cuban said in an impromptu press conference after the verdict that someone with less wealth could have been bullied in the case . The SEC accused Mr Cuban of using inside information to sell $7.9 million of stock in Mamma.com Inc. after he learned of a stock offering that would depress the price of shares in the search engine company. The agency wanted Mr Cuban to repay $750,000 in losses that he avoided, plus pay a penalty. It was a civil lawsuit, so the 55-year-old regular on the ABC reality show 'Shark Tank' didn't face criminal charges. The company's CEO testified by video that Mr Cuban, the largest shareholder, agreed during an eight-minute phone call that he wouldn't disclose what the CEO told him about the stock offering or sell his shares on the news. He sold them a few hours later, however, before the company announced the stock offering to the public. Mr Cuban disputed the CEO's claims. 'This was a credibility contest and Cuban won,' said John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University. Mr Cuban's lawyers attacked the credibility of the CEO, Guy Faure, and Coffee said the SEC failed to produce evidence to support Faure's account of the phone call, which was not recorded. The verdict, he said, 'tells the SEC to stay away from he-said, she-said cases'. Jeffrey Ansley, a former SEC enforcement lawyer now in private practice in Dallas, said the jury's fast verdict was a condemnation of the SEC's case. 'The SEC lost every place where they could have lost, and because of that, this has to impact how the SEC staff decides which cases to bring,' Ansley said. He said the agency may become gun-shy about challenging people with the means to mount an aggressive defense, as Mr Cuban did. SEC spokesman John Nester said the verdict 'will not deter us from bringing and trying cases where we believe defendants have violated the federal securities laws'. Mr Cuban is the owner of basketball team the Dallas Mavericks (in white) The SEC sued Mr Cuban in 2008. U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater dismissed the lawsuit in 2009, but his ruling was overturned by an appeals court, which sent the case back to Fitzwater for the trial that ended Wednesday. Sports Illustrated lists Mr Cuban among the 50 most powerful people in sports. He built the hapless Mavericks into an NBA champion, along the way building a reputation for berating referees. The NBA has fined him at least $1.5 million for his comments. Forbes magazine estimates Mr Cuban's wealth at $2.5 billion. If the jury had ruled for the SEC, Cuban could have faced roughly $2 million to $3 million in fines and penalties. On Wednesday, Mr Cuban said he spent much more than that on the lawyers who delivered him a victory in the courtroom.","Dallas Mavericks owner was accused of committing insider trading .

A Utah mother has given birth to a 14lb baby boy who's already wearing the same sized diapers as his two-year-old twin sisters. Joel Brandon Jr., nicknamed J.J., was born by cesarean section on May 9 at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in . Orem, weighing in at 14 pounds and measuring 22 inches long. He is believed to be the heaviest baby born in the U.S. this year; only Addyson Gale Cessna of Pennsylvania, who weighed 13 pound 12 ounce, comes close. His mother, Sara Brandon, said she was stunned by how big J.J. was when she delivered him at 38-and-a-half weeks, as a previous ultrasound predicted he was going to be 11 pounds. Big bundle: Joel Brandon Jr., or 'J.J.', was born in May weighing 14lbs exactly, shocking his mother Sara (pictured) who thought he was only going to be around 11lbs. He could be the biggest in the U.S. this year . The family is now wondering if their bundle of joy is indeed this year's biggest. 'We've kind of been watching and waiting to see if there is a baby who is bigger, because he might be the biggest of the year,' Brandon told KSL. But because of his size, he needed two doctors to help with the birth, rather than one, and required special maneuvering as he was 'so big and crammed in there', she told the Huffington Post. After he was born, he suffered respiratory problems and needed to spend a week in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. But he has since returned home and is in good health, his mother said. Big brother: He's so large he wears the same size diapers as his identical twin sisters, who are two . Cute: J.J.'s is in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age but will slim down as he gets older . At his last check-up, J.J.'s doctor said he was in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age group - and he's so big that he is wearing the same sized diapers of his twin sisters, aged 2. KSL reported that his size could be because of his mother's Type 1 diabetes or simply because of her family's history of big babies and her husband's height. But doctors said that as J.J. grows and becomes a toddler he'll slim down closer to average size. 'This big bubba melts my heart,' Brandon . said. 'I love him more than I ever imagined I could love a sweet baby . boy. He is my squishy cuddle bug.' Together: His mom said his big sisters love to play with him - but he's too big for them to hold on their own . Brandon joked that she doesn't think she can have normal sized babies as her two-year-old twins were born weighing just 4lbs each. She added that the girls love to play with him - although they can't hold him on their own. While J.J. could be the largest born in the U.S. this year, KSL noted that the biggest newborn in the world is likely George King from England, who was born in February weighing 15 pounds 7 ounces.","J.J.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 20:09 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 4 August 2013 . Millions of payday loan customers may be entitled to refunds and compensation amid allegations of high pressure selling and harassment. Citizens Advice says as many as three in four may be able to take a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). There were 160 complaints to the watchdog about the high cost loans between April and June this year with 72per cent upheld in favour of the consumer. Complaints: If a consumer has difficulty making repayments, the lender should accept a reasonable offer to pay off the debt in installments . This could be just the tip of the iceberg because most people do not know how to bring a complaint, while the lenders also keep customers in the dark. Experts at Citizens Advice studied 665 payday loan cases dealt with by staff in the first half of 2013 and found at least 76per cent could have grounds for an official complaint. More than a third involved issues with continuous payment authorities, where the lenders effectively snatch money from customers’ bank accounts without permission. Some 12per cent involved harassment where lenders pestered people with phone calls and text messages rather than accept affordable repayment offers. One in five were possible cases of fraud, where an individual was chased for a repayment on a loan they had not taken out. This is because some firms have failed to carry out proper checks on loan applicants with the result they have handed huge sums to criminals who have stolen the identities of innocent targets. Consumer minister Jo Swinson (pictured) says unscrupulous lenders should not be getting away with shoddy treatment of their customers. Tough action taken to protect consumers is being taken . Where the Ombudsman upholds a complaint, the lender can be ordered to put things right. This can include paying a refund of repayments and charges plus compensation for any inconvenience caused. If a consumer has difficulty making repayments, the lender should accept a reasonable offer to pay off the debt in installments. However, many pressure customers to roll over the loan, which will mean they end up paying even more. Putting pressure on customers to roll over a loan in these circumstances could be a breach of the Ombudsman’s rules. Citizens Advice said the firms appear to make it difficult for people to complain. Some four in five borrowers were not told how to complain if there is a problem. The organisation’s chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘The level of debt and hardship caused by some payday loans is absolutely scandalous and people often feel completely powerless to do anything about it. ‘But consumers can fight back. If you are struggling to pay back the loan Citizens Advice can help you sort out a reasonable repayment plan and if you make a successful complaint to the Financial Ombudsman service you could find you get a refund for an unauthorised payment or compensation for unfair treatment. ‘By making your voice heard you will expose the bad behaviour of lenders and put pressure on them to clean up their act which could help stop similar problems happening to other people.’ The organisation has put details on its website explaining both the rights of borrowers and the details of how to complain. A spokesman for the ombudsman service said that payday loan customers have apparently been reluctant to make a complaint to date because they do not want to admit that they have used this form of credit. However, he said: ‘The big message is: Nobody is here to judge you. We understand that times are hard, the important thing is to ask for help.’ Payday lenders have come under heavy scrutiny in recent months following an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading, which referred the industry to the Competition Commission after finding ‘deep-rooted’ problems. There are particular concerns that they are not making proper checks that applicants can afford repayments. Consumer minister Jo Swinson said: ‘Unscrupulous lenders should not be getting away with shoddy treatment of their customers, and it has to stop. We are taking tough action to protect consumers from irresponsible lending, which has led to 15 firms leaving the payday market.’ She said a new regulator will police the industry from 2014 and it will have powers to clean up the industry, such as banning products, imposing unlimited fines and ordering firms to give consumers their money back. ‘Consumers should also be aware of what types of practices are not OK. That’s why I fully support Citizens Advice’s work to help people know what their rights are and how to complain when things go wrong,’ she said. The Consumer Finance Association said its members have improved practices in terms of making affordability checks and limiting loan roll-overs.","Could be the tip of the iceberg .

The cute factor went through the roof at Washington, DC's National Zoo on Monday as media got their first adorable shots of giant panda cub Bao Bao. America fell in love with The 4-month-old cub when she became just the second surviving cub born at the zoo back in August. Already the spritely bear is climbing rocks and teething on bamboo in her enclosure and Monday's sneak press peak only heightens excitement for her January 18 public debut. Scroll down for video... Adorable: Bao Bao, the Giant Panda cub was glimpsed by the media for the first time Monday at the National Zoo in Washington, DC . Too cute: Bao Bao won't be on public display until January 18, but media were invited for a brief glimpse on Monday . 'Now is when she's starting to walk a lot more,' National Zoo senior curator Brandie Smith told myfoxdc. 'She's just like a little toy.' Mei Xiang's only other surviving cub, a male named Tai Shan, was born in 2005. Male panda Tian Tian is the father of both cubs. Unfortunately for Tai Shan, her big brother was returned to China in 2010 for breeding. But the frisky cub isn't letting it get her down. Bao Bao has been a hit since her birth and will soon make her debut in a public viewing enclosure . Bouncing baby: Bao Bao weighed nearly 17 pounds at only four months old thanks to a steady diet of rich mother panda milk . Historic: Bao Bao is only the second baby panda born at the National Zoo to survive . Thriving: The cub made headlines when she was born in August and the world has been able to watch her thrive on the zoo's live panda cam . The National Zoo's panda cam, on which viewers can watch Bao Bao play and climb and grow, has become a huge success. Bao Bao's media debut came just as the U.S. was bracing for some of the coldest temperatures on record. While the cub will certainly be kept out of the historic chill, what happens to her mother and the other adult animals? 'Every animal has a protocol for cold weather,' Smith explained. 'Some animals won't go outside at all tomorrow. Other animals will go in and out.' Motherly love: Bao Bao now shares an enclosure with her mother Mei Xiang, who's been caring for her cub in the panda den since she was born August 23 . Tiny: Mei Xiang (right) gets a steady supply of bamboo, which she needs to help produce enough milk to allow Bao Bao to grow so quickly. When she was born, she weighed just 4.8 ounces . Giant pandas are considered critically endangered in the wild, and breeding them in captivity has proved difficult, especially in Washington. Zoo scientists have made numerous attempts to artificially inseminate its female panda because the pair failed to breed naturally. The new birth has given zoo scientists renewed confidence in the Washington pandas' ability to help grow the panda species. Last year, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub, but it died after six days because its lungs hadn't fully developed and weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver. The zoo's first panda couple, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, had five cubs during the 1980s, though none lived more than a few days. Helping hand: Animal keeper Marty Dearie carries Bao Bao, the four and a half month old giant panda cub, as she makes her media debut at an indoor habitat at the National Zoo in Washington .","The four month old baby giant panda live with her mother Mei Xiang in her enclosure .

If you’re struggling to keep up with the demands of your New Year’s resolution, then take inspiration from the man who prides himself on being the king of personal challenges. In 2013, Michael Bandar undertook 12 mammoth tasks such as kayaking to work, taking singing lessons and striking up conversations with complete strangers every day, for a month at a time. His other missions included learning to speak French, getting in touch with long-lost friends or family members, practising meditation and eating meat after being a vegetarian for over 15 years. Inspiration to us all? Michael Bandar undertook twelve eccentric 30 day challenges such as kayaking to work, taking singing lessons and striking up conversations with complete strangers . Michael, 24, from Birmingham said: 'Instead of making one year-long resolution that people tend not to keep, I listed twelve things that I wanted to try or give up. I then structured them as 30-day challenges to do throughout 2013. 'Looking back on the last year, I’m really proud of what I’ve accomplished. Every month, I did something different every day and stayed out of my comfort zone.' Michael - who is the director of dating website, Toyboywarehouse.com - admits that some of the challenges were tough. 'One of my trickiest assignments was in September when I had to speak to a stranger every day for at least ten minutes. 'I looked like a right weirdo introducing myself to random people on the street but during the course of that month, I met some fascinating people. In January 2013, Michael Bandar, 24, went for a month with no TV, going to the gym everyday instead; in February he meditated for an hour every day . In March, Michael ate meat everyday, despite being vegetarian for fifteen years, and in April studied French for an hour a day . 'Another hard challenge for me was ""Meaty March"" when I ate meat every day for a month after being veggie for over half of my life. When I started that task, I hated the taste of meat but I don’t mind it anymore. I actually love Pepperami now!'. In July, Michael’s challenge involved kayaking two miles to his office every day: 'Rowing a kayak to work on the canals provided a lot of entertainment to passers-by. Often, people would walk alongside me and chat to me while I was doing it.' Michael says that he picked up some valuable abilities through embarking on these 30-day-challenges. 'Taking daily singing lessons probably wound my neighbours up but I can now sing well. In May, Michael wrote 500 words every day and in June he woke at 6am daily as part of his mammoth task . In July, the dedicated man kayaked the two-mile journey to work everyday and in August, he went teetotal . 'Additionally after learning French every day for a month, I have a good conversational knowledge of the language. I’m even going to Paris in 2014 to fine-tune my linguistic skills.' Michael claims that these 30-day challenges are far more worthwhile than the traditional New Year’s resolutions. He said: 'I couldn’t recommend them enough - a month is the ideal amount of time to lose a bad habit or experience something new. In October, Michael took singing lessons and practiced everyday, and in September, spoke to a stranger for a minimum of ten minutes each day . In November, the 24-year-old swam 1km every day and in December, spoke to old friends and family as part of his New Year's challenge . 'It’s very easy to get stuck in a rut but 30-day challenges are the perfect way to keep things fresh. I plan to continue doing them for the rest of my life.'

Alexander Berman (left), 16, and his sister Jacqueline (right) 15, were promising music students at Dreyfoos School of The Arts in West Palm Beach . Richard Berman (second right) with his son Alexander and daughter Jacqueline along with two other adults. In a financial affadavit Mr Berman listed his monthly expenses as $4,700 a month but an income of $2,888 . Police were alerted by Mr Berman to the tragic multiple shooting shortly after 8am. Investigators said the deaths are being treated as a murder-suicide after all three died from gunshot wounds. Mr Berman was not considered a suspect, police said. Family friend Brian McManus told WSVN that Mrs Berman had recently been going through a difficult time in her life. Mr McManus said: 'Going through a divorce, foreclosure, a lot of that stuff which, it's an upsetting thing when you're going through a divorce and having to sell the beautiful house in this neighborhood, and it's just she just seemed like she had been upset lately. 'You can't fathom, you can't understand what's going on in someone's head for things like that to happen.' Last year, Mrs Berman had also petitioned a judge to remove her husband from the home because of 'emotional abuse'. The family had previously lived at another home in the historic and exclusive El Cid neighborhood which sold for $1.2million in 2010. The home in which the murder suicide took place had previously belonged to Jennifer Berman's mother. The property had been in foreclosure since 2010 but was recently sold. The mother and her two children were due to move out in February. Mrs Berman had been working 12-hour shifts as a night nurse for an elderly man because she needed the money, a friend, who refused to be identified, told the Palm Beach Post. Alexander and Jacqueline Berman were accomplished musicians and attended the Dreyfoos School of the Arts in Palm Beach, Florida . 'The truth will come out': A friend, speaking for Mr Berman, said: 'Richard has been painted as a terrible father who did not care about his children.That is not true. That is so not true' Past times: Mr Berman used to be successful but was hit hard by the housing crash. However, court records show he gave his wife the family home in the divorce and paid $600-a-month child support . Mrs Berman lost her divorce lawyer because she could not afford to pay him last year. According to the Palm Beach Post, she asked a judge to make her husband pay alimony and child support, claiming she was forced to sell her late father's watch to buy gas and groceries. Court records from the attorney's of Mrs Berman claimed: 'The husband has not paid the mortgage on the former marital home during the entire time of the dissolution of marriage proceeding. He has not contributed to the support of the wife or of the minor children. 'In fact, he has refused to pay for toilet paper, buy food and supplies for himself and keeps them where the wife and children cannot access them.' The Bermans married in 1992 in Miami. Mr Berman first filed for divorce in 2008 but the couple reconciled. Mrs Berman filed for divorced in August 2012 but the couple remained living under the same roof for a while. Last year, Mrs Berman allegedly asked a judge to remove her husband from the home, according to the Palm Beach Post, because of 'extreme emotional abuse and fighting (verbal) in home'. The couple shared equal custody of their two teenage children. Jacqueline Berman, 15, was shot dead by her mother alongside her older brother at their Florida home on Monday . Neighbor Marian Sklodowski said that Mrs Berman had recently appeared 'upset, disappointed and confused'. 'You can notice that, from the face, from the eyes, something was strange in her face,' she added. The teens attended the Dreyfoos School of Arts and were promising musicians, their devastated friends said. Close friends and fellow musicians . said they will remember Alexander Berman for being an accomplished cello . player while his sister Jacqueline was extremely talented at the violin . and a straight A student. Grief counselors were on hand at the school to help classmates cope with the tragedy. 'At . first it was just disbelief, going through stages of grief all at once. It's shocking to hear when it's one of your friends, you hear this on . the news and don't think it will happen to you,' a friend told WPTV. 'Everyone was crying, everyone was silent, it was a sad environment,' another student added.

Randi Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark, has complained that her privacy was breached on the social networking site when one of her photos was taken and shared on Twitter. Randi posted a picture of her family jokingly reacting to Facebook's new Poke application, and someone Tweeted the picture out to the public. Incident comes as Facebook has long been accused of taking advantage of user's privacy concerns, so the fact that one of their own family members felt the sting of an open social network comes as a late Christmas present to the company's critics. In the photo, Randi's younger siblings and parents are seen in what appears to be their family home in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Breach: Randi Zuckerberg posted a photo of her siblings joking in their family kitchen on Christmas day, and she thought that since she was sharing it with only friends it would not be published . Mark is standing in the corner- wearing his trademark hoodie sweatshirt and a bit of a smirk- while the other Zuckerbergs looks aghast at their cell phones, presumably mocking the latest update to the social networking application. The new version of 'pokes' allow users to send fleeting messages, pokes, photos and 10-second videos to friends. The messages expire after a set period of time, from 1 to 10 seconds, and cannot be retrieved by either party again, making it perfect for sending salacious images without leaving a trail. Randi might have wanted to employ a similar self-destructing device for this photo, since she is now furious that it has been made public. Backtracking: Callie Schweitzer saw the photo because she is Facebook friends with Randi's younger sister Arielle who was tagged in the photo . A journalist and recent college graduate named Callie Schweitzer saw the photo in her newsfeed because she is a friend of Randi and Mark's sister Arielle- who was tagged in the picture- and decided to share the personal moment with her own 39,642 followers. 'Not sure where you got this photo. I posted it to friends only on FB. You reposting it to Twitter is way uncool,' Randi told Schweitzer in a public exchange on the microblogging site. She quickly deleted original tweet with the photo but other sites like Buzzfeed quickly got a screengrab, and the Twitter account for hacker group Anonymous sent out that link. Schweitzer responded back to Zuckerberg saying that her reaction was 'totally fair. I would hate for a private photo of mine to be public and would never want to do the same for others.' '(For what it's worth), I thought the photo was incredibly endearing which is why I liked it. We never see humans on the internet! Siblings: Randi (right) worked for her brother Mark (left) since Facebook started but she recently left to begin her own tech venture and executive produce a Bravo show about Silicon Valley . 'I'm completely sensitive to privacy. i loved the photo bc it seemed so fun and normal. You should make it public! ;)' In spite of Schweitzer's grovelling, Randi Zuckerberg, who is now promoting a new show on Bravo about the allegedly glamorous world of tech start-ups in Silicon Valley, used the opportunity to make it a teaching moment. 'Digital etiquette: always ask permission before posting a friend's photo publicly. It's not about privacy settings, it's about human decency,' she wrote via Twitter. Facebook first coined 'poking' as a way to get your friend's attention on their site, similar in style to 'liking' their updated status or a new picture. Now it is an entirely different beast. 'With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you're up to in a lightweight way,' said the site in a blog post announcing the new app. The new version of pokes are similar to Snapchat, an app which is popular with younger age users, and which has gained a reputation as a tool for sending risque images.","Randi Zuckerberg posted of the family looking aghast at their smartphones in their parent's kitchen on Christmas Day .

The seller clung to their car and was dragged, disfigured and then run over . A Houston man was disfigured and nearly killed when the women he was selling Jay Z tickets to sped away as he leaned into their car, leaving him clinging desperately to the door handle. The unnamed victim begged Denitra Green and Cessica Darden, both 20, to stop the car but police say Green continued speeding away while Darden kicked at his hands in an attempt to get him to fall off. As Darden's baby sat in the backseat, Green continued to drive after the car ran over the man's nearly lifeless body. According to the Houston Chronicle, . Darden had told the victim they'd need to meet in a parking lot, with . her in the car, because she was unable to leave her young child.

The owner of a toilet used by Adolf Hitler has revealed he is desperate to sell his piece of history. The Nazi leader's white porcelain toilet was uncovered last year in fully working order in a car repair garage in New Jersey. It was originally installed on the Aviso Grille, the official German State yacht, in a room adjacent to Hitler's elaborate throne room on the luxury 433ft long boat. Nazi khazi: The toilet used by Adolf Hitler on the Nazi Party's luxury yacht was found in full working order - in a car repair garage - last year . The Aviso Grille, built in 1935, was the largest yacht in existence at the time and was used regularly by Hitler. Workers at Greg's Auto Repair in Florence, Burlington County, still use the toilet every day, which is located in a small, plywood walled room. The one-of-a-kind toilet was found by a previous owner in a nearby scrapyard in 1951. Current owner Greg Kohfeldt said: 'I was invited on TV to . sell it on a show dedicated to rare and unusual antiques but one of the . experts called me evil for trying to sell it. 'The episode was never broadcast. It was a real pain because I had to get the toilet disconnected to take there. 'The toilet is getting a bit long in the tooth now.

The white porcelain toilet was originally installed on the Aviso Grille, the official German State yacht, which was built in 1935 . On the sea: The toilet dates back to when the Nazi leader's private yacht the Aviso Grille was taken to America following the party's demise . 'If the right offer came along I'd seriously consider it.' 'Not many people can say they have used the same throne as the most evil man in history, can they? 'There's salvage from the yacht all over town, the toilet was purloined by a previous owner who needed one. 'The local Veterans Association has the map table and one old man has the ship's wheel hanging up in his den. On the toilet: Adolf Hitler (pictured) is believed to have used the john on board the official German state yacht in the 1930s . 'People took anything they could find and the guy who built the garage got this. 'There are some words in German on the toilet but nothing else to indicate that the most evil of cheeks were spread upon its seat. 'Nevertheless over the years hundreds of people have popped by to have a look. 'I've never charged admission, I didn't think it was right to do so. If people want to have a look they're more than welcome.' The years up to the outbreak of  the Second World War saw Hitler take many voyages on his beloved boat which he nicknamed 'The White Swan'. If Britain had been defeated in the war, Hitler planned to sail up the River Thames and disembark at Whitehall to accept Britain's surrender. The yacht spent the rest of the war serving as a command ship in the German Navy. The unique toilet was first sold to a British businessman who failed to make it a tourist attraction. It was then passed through numerous owners - including the King of Egypt - before ending up on the New Jersey coast to be broken for scrap. A desk used by Hitler sold for a staggering £250,000 and Mr Kohfeldt is keen to sell the historical toilet. 'I know we haven't cleaned it much, and it's been a man's toilet without the touch of a woman and I seriously doubt there's any Hitler remnants down there after all these years. 'I want to modernise the toilet. Imagine having it in your house, it would definitely be a conversation starter.

Dutch designer Dave Hakkens developed Phonebloks, pictured, so different features such as the camera or storage can be replaced easily . Rather than spending hundreds of pounds on a new handset each year, what if you could simply keep your phone but upgrade the camera, replace the display, increase storage and more in just one click? That's the idea behind Phonebloks. Created by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens,  Phonebloks is a customisable smartphone made up of what's called 'modular elements', or blocks, that can be instantly swapped and replaced. If a battery dies, for example, a new one can be clipped into place. Storage can be upgraded or cameras with different lenses an be swapped in and out depending on the occasion. Hakkens designed the concept phone as a more environmentally friendly way of recycling smartphones, to prevent the trend of customers replacing handsets on a yearly basis. He said: 'Every year millions of mobile phones are thrown away because they are . broken or obsolete. 'In most of these cases it is just one part that . needs repairing or upgrading and all the other parts work fine.' The Phoneblok handset is made of separate components that can be ‘clicked’ together.

A female assistant principal who abruptly resigned after a former student accused her of sexual abuse is facing fresh allegations from a second victim. Police said the second person came forward after a YouTube video was posted online in which a now 28-year-old mother confronts Andrea Cardosa, a school administrator in Alhambra, California, and former Riverside teacher. Jamie Carrillo posted the video last Friday where she can be seen calling Ms Cardosa at her office. Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12 years old . Jamie Carrillo confronted a teacher on the phone last week whom she alleges sexually abused her when she was 12 years old. She said that she did so as she did not want the woman, who is still a teacher, around other children . Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' The now 28-year-old mother said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Cardosa replies: 'Yes, and I regret it.' Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the alleged molester answers: 'It's not.' The 28-year-old alleges that her former teacher abused her when she was a student at a California high school . Ms Carrillo alleges that she was just 12 years old and a player on the school basketball team when the abuse started . Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her alleged attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And Iâ€™m shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Cardosa, who was named by Ms Carrillo in the, has stepped down from her job. She had worked at the school for four months, according to officials. Ms Carrillo's lawyer questioned whether Chemawa Middle School investigated Ms Cardosa who reportedly met the young girl when she coached her at basketball. Ms Carrillo alleges that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then claims Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the alleged assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. At a press conference on Monday, Ms Carrillo said that she expected others who had allegedly been abused by the teacher to come forward. The 28-year-old told KTLA: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.'

Arrest: Susan Sciacca, 55, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, accused of pulling a gun on another driver in a road rage incident . A female attorney brandished a pistol and screamed obscenities at another driver after following him into a parking lot during a road rage incident last Friday, according to the alleged victim and Texas police. Susan Sciacca, 55, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on Tuesday, accused of pulling a gun on John Leazer, 40, after he possibly cut her off on a suburban Houston highway. Leazer, a married father of three, claims that he feared for his life when an 'enraged' Sciacca pulled up alongside him and got out of her car with a gun drawn. 'I'm basically scared. I honestly thought she was going to shoot me,' he told KHOU, after the attorney followed him into the parking lot of a bank in Tomball, off state highway 249. Leazer says he called 911 and the whole incident was captured on surveillance footage. Officers arrested Sciacca at the scene, according to ABC News. The woman is a Harris County attorney and works in Family Protective Services Divisions on cases involving abused or neglected children. She is now out of jail on a $30,000 bail bond. Police say Sciacca has admitted that she pulled out a handgun but said that she was in fear of her life and that Leazer was the one who followed her into the parking lot. Fear: John Leazer, 40, said he was in 100 percent fear of his life after he was followed by the woman and she threatened him with a handgun in the parking lot of a bank in suburban Houston . She has pleaded not guilty to the charges and her lawyer Dan Cogdelle told ABC: 'We expect her to be exonerated.' Leazer disagrees, and claims he was '100 percent' in fear of his life. He explained to KHOU that he had just had lunch with his wife when he could have cut Sciacca off on the highway. 'Here I see an enraged woman holding a . pistol to me, claiming she's an assistant district attorney with Harris . County and that I have no right scaring her,' Leazer said. He then said that she followed him into the parking lot. 'I . open the door, I get out to walk into the bank, she comes screeching . up... gun drawn,' he continued. Scene: Leazer claims the attorney followed him into the parking lot of a bank in Tomball, off state highway 249 . 'I told her to put the pistol down. She told me no. While I have 911 on the phone, she's screaming obscenities and . everything,' Leazer added. The Harris County Attorney's Office stated that it is aware of the situation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:51 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:11 EST, 22 January 2014 . It has been revealed that two armed officers left the area where a shooter opened fire at a Los Angeles airport last fall just minutes before he started his spree and killed one security screener and injured three others. The new details also note that the armed officers did not tell a dispatcher about their impromptu break as they are required to do. The Los Angeles Airport Police Department officers were outside Terminal 3 when authorities say Paul Ciancia opened fire with an assault rifle in an attack targeting Transportation Security Administration officers. Scroll down for video . On the scene: Police were able to shoot, injure, and take hold of shooter Paul Ciana after he opened fire inside Terminal 3 of Los Angeles International Airport on November 1 (pictured) As terrified travelers dived for cover, TSA officers — who are unarmed — fled the screening area without hitting a panic button or using a landline to call for help. It took a call from an airline contractor to a police dispatcher, who then alerted officers over the radio — a lag of nearly a minute and a half, the officials said. The officials who revealed the damning details to the Associated Press requested anonymity, saying they were briefed on the shooting but were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation. Before officers could get to the scene, Ciancia fatally wounded TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez and then headed to the screening area where he shot two more agents and a traveler, authorities said. Ciancia was subdued after being wounded by officers in the gate area of the terminal. When the shooting started, the two officials say one of the armed officers assigned to the terminal was at or just outside an adjacent terminal. One of the officials said the officer was on a bathroom break and the other foot-beat officer was in a vehicle on the tarmac outside Terminal 3, headed for a meal break. The new details about the whereabouts of the two officers come as authorities review the overall response, including whether emergency medical personnel were forced to wait longer than necessary to remove Hernandez so he could be taken to a hospital. The AP earlier reported that Hernandez did not receive medical care until 33 minutes after he was shot. A coroner's release said he was likely dead within two to five minutes. Crowd control: It has now been revealed that two armed airport police officers were meant to be in the area at the time of the shooting but had taken unannounced breaks, leaving the unarmed TSA agents in the area alone . Departmental procedures require that officers notify a dispatcher before going on break and leaving their patrol area in order to ensure supervisors are aware of their absence and, if necessary, a relief unit can be brought in to cover their area. Airport police union chief Marshall McClain said the two officers assigned to Terminal 3 still were in position to quickly respond to the shooting. He said he'd spoken with both and confirmed one was ‘going to the restroom or coming back from the restroom’ and the other was headed out on a meal break but still within his patrol area. ‘He hadn't gone on break yet. He was going to go on break,’ McClain said. What typically happens is, ‘if you're going to go on a lunch break, you get to your location and you tell them that you're there.’ Officers often do this in order to maximize their lunch break so they don't lose time while traveling. Within a minute of the dispatcher's call, that officer had stopped someone who ran out of the terminal and the other officer was heading toward the shooting, McClain said. Mayor Eric Garcetti told the AP in an interview that he's watched surveillance video and received briefings on the investigation. While officers were able to take Ciancia into custody within five minutes of the shooting, he said, ‘It could have been a lot worse.’ Response: The dispatcher's alert over police radio brought an officer on a Segway, another on a bike, one on a motorcycle, two in a patrol car and one on foot, said one of the law enforcement officials (pictured on November 2) Whatever the investigation's conclusions, Garcetti said, ‘I want to make sure that in any terminal, there's always somebody there, that a bathroom break doesn't result in somebody, even for a few minutes, being out of the action.’ According to investigators, Ciancia, originally from Pennsville, New Jersey, arrived at the airport on November. 1 with the intention of killing TSA workers.  Authorities have said Ciancia had a grudge against the agency, but they have not indicated what prompted it. After entering the terminal, police say Ciancia pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a duffel bag and began spraying the area with gunfire. Hernandez was mortally wounded and became the first TSA agent to die in the line of duty. The dispatcher's alert over police radio brought an officer on a Segway, another on a bike, one on a motorcycle, two in a patrol car and one on foot, said one of the law enforcement officials. Two of the first responding officers shot Ciancia, who survived and now faces murder and other charges. Airport Police Chief Pat Gannon lauded his officers for what he called a swift and brave response to a gunman. He said he was ‘comfortable with what the officers were doing at the time that the shooting occurred and their ability to respond to the incident.’ ‘It's not about who was or was not there and how that all occurred,’ Gannon said. ‘Those officers responsible for that terminal were there as quick as anybody else was to deal with those particular issues. They were not goofing off.’ Airports are allowed to make their own security plans for armed officers, as long as they follow basic guidelines and get their plans approved by the TSA. An updated policy at LAX was outlined last April in an internal memo that was obtained by AP and verified by one of the officials. Officers assigned to the terminals must inform supervisors when they want to take a break. ‘Absent exigent circumstances, (the units) shall not leave the assigned terminal area without prior authorization and a relief unit,’ the memo stated. In an important change, officers no longer were required to remain at a podium by the screening area: in an effort to make security plans less predictable, they are allowed to roam the terminal provided they can respond to an emergency at the screening station within three minutes. TSA Officer Victor Payes, who works at the airport and is president of the local union, said removing the officers from the podiums at the screening stations has been unnerving for screeners. ‘They're not there, and you're saying to yourself, 'Oh, hopefully nothing happens right now,' Payes said. Erroll Southers, a former FBI agent who was chief of homeland security and intelligence at LAX from 2007 to 2010, said the combination of the officers being away and the policy change gave Ciancia the soft target he wanted. Had officers still been stationed at the screening area, ‘that arguably would have put them in a position to know about the incident and respond to it in a much more reduced time span,’ he said.","Two armed officers didn't tell their dispatcher that they were going on breaks, new details from the investigation reveal .

Whether it’s with a good luck dance, whispering a curse or prayers sent directly to God, half of American football fans believe supernatural forces are at play right alongside their favorite quarterback. A study from the Public Religion Research Institute found that a full third of all football fans pray directly to God to help out their favorite teams. With Super Bowl XLVIII just days away, the study forces the question: Will God be rooting for the Broncos or Seahawks? Are you there God? It's me, Peyton: A Public Religion Research Institute study found that whether its God, voodoo curses or prayer, 50 percent of Americans think higher powers are at play during games. But the question of who those forces will shine on--Seattle and QG Russell Wilson (left) or Denver and Peyton Manning (right)--remains to be seen in the upcoming Super Bowl . ‘Just ahead of the 2014 Super Bowl, 50 percent of sports fans see some aspect of the supernatural at play in sports,’ reports the January 16 survey of 1,011 people in English and Spanish between January 8 – 12. The supernatural, as per the survey results, can mean one of several of things and even included wearing a lucky article of clothing to help out a team. Which is exactly what one in four American football fans say they do when they want to sway a game’s outcome. One in three fans takes a more direct approach by praying directly to God to help their team. On the flipside, some 31 percent of fans thinks their team has somehow been cursed when they perform poorly. The Super Bowl is consistently one of the country’s most watched televised events and 100 million are expected to tune in to watch Seattle go head-to-head with Denver. God and football: The study found that football fans are more likely than fans of other sports to believe that God affects the outcome of games . A January 16 survey published from the Public Religion Institute asked 1,011 English and Spanish speaking football fans about their supernatural beliefs as they apply to America's favorite sport. 21 percent do a ritual like wearing good luck clothing or doing a little dance in the belief it helps sway games . 25 percent of fans said they honestly believe the team they root for has been cursed . 22 percent say 'God plays a role in which team wins a sporting event' 26 percent pray to God to hep their team, apparently whether they believe it helps or not (see above) Whether its God, voodoo curses or any other unseen force, 50 percent of fans see some aspect of the supernatural at play in sports . So, as all those fans are praying, donning special jerseys or doing little rituals like a team dance (21 percent), will the Almighty creator be sending good juju in any specific team’s direction? ‘No,’ Rabbi Arthur Weiner of the Jewish Community Center of Paramus told NJ.com. 'The truth is we don't believe that this is the kind of thing God needs to or should be getting involved with.' NFL analyst, former pro-football player and devout Christian Kurt Warner doesn’t see it as quite so black and white. ‘It's one of those tricky questions,’ he said. ‘I believe God has your best interest in mind. How that correlates to winning and losing football games, I'm not fully sure.’ As for individual athletes, Weiner seems to believe there’s more than meets the eye than just physical talent. 'On the other hand, let's take the Tim Tebow phenomenon,' Weiner said. 'A lot of people made fun of it, but here was a devout Christian, an honorable man, a world-class athlete — although he may have not had the success later in his career — at that moment, him choosing to acknowledge his creator as the source of his strength...I think it demonstrated a certain piety which I think is admirable.' And on this, a majority of Americans would agree. According to the PRRI study, ‘more than 6-in-10 white evangelical Protestants (62 percent) and minority Protestants (65 percent) believe that God rewards athletes. Half of Catholics, 44 percent of white mainline Protestants and only 22 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans believe that God rewards athletes who have faith.’ Earlier this week, Seattle Seahawks Defensive Passing Game Coordinator Rocky Seto gave his unequivocal take on religion and football. In what Americans may see as a way of tipping the scales in his team’s favor, Seto told the Christian News Service: . ‘As much as we worship this thing called a ring and championship, although we would like to have one for sure, I just can’t wait to tell people if that happens God willing, we will be able to tell people Jesus is way better still.’","A Public Religion Research Institute study found that whether its God, voodoo curses or prayer, 50 percent of Americans think higher powers are at play during games .

Devastated: She appeared at the press conference with attorney TJ Grimaldi. As she spoke about the tragedy, she cried as she said how excited she had been to share a rare date day with her husband . As they watched the movie, the dedicated father monitored his phone for updates about Lexy, who had been feeling sick when they left home earlier that day, friends revealed to MailOnline. When 71-year-old retired cop Curtis Reeves, who was sitting behind the couple, asked Mr Oulson to put his phone away, he refused and Reeves left to speak with a manager. Learning that the manager was busy, Reeves returned to his seat and started arguing with Oulson. Seconds into the argument, Oulson apparently threw a bag of popcorn at the older man, who then drew a pistol from his pocket and shot the 43-year-old dad in the chest. The bullet passed through Nicoleâ€™s outstretched hand as she desperately tried to save her husband.

As her voice trembled, she thanked the public for supporting her and her family 'during this horrible time of grief and sadness'. 'I'm still trying to recover from the shock,' she said. 'Me and my husband didn't get a date night very often, much less a whole day to spend together, so I was just so excited and looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life at a place of entertainment.'

'She doesn't understand what he was protecting himself from,' he said. He added that Lexy was too young to understand what had happened to her father. 'We're all lucky she's as young as she really . is,' he said. 'She doesn't understand everything. All she understands . right now is that daddy's not there.' Reeves, a father-of-two who was at the movie theater to see 'Lone Survivor' with his wife, was a former police chief in Tampa.

A Texas family is moving to Colorado so they can administer marijuana to their three-year-old epileptic girl, who suffers 50 to 100 seizures a day. Marijuana was legalised for recreational use in Colorado on January 1 this year, but Amber and Paul Loew, from Crosby, want to use the drug to help with their daughter Hannah’s condition. She was diagnosed with a severe and progressive form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome when she was just six months old – and her seizures can last up to an hour. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Three-year-old Hannah suffers up to 100 seizures a day . Hannah Loew has been diagnosed with a severe and progressive form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome . Her parents will give medical marijuana to Hannah in liquid form, hoping it can sooth her condition. Mrs Loew told KHou.com: ‘You’re living every day on the edge of your seat not knowing if you’re going to have to rush to the emergency room. There is no option to try it. It’s you jump in with both feet and go.' She added: ‘This is not something where my family lives all over the United States. We live in Texas. This is our home, and we’re pretty much being forced to leave.’ Mr Loew, who's also father to a seven-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son, said: ‘It will work, and we have faith in that.’ Amber and Paul Loew hope that medical marijuana will help with Hannah's condition . The Loew family won't be allowed to move back to Texas if Hannah is given medical marijuana in Colorado . The five members of the Loew family will be barred from re-entering Texas if they do treat Hannah with marijuana, as the drug is outlawed there. Preparation for the marijuana retail market in Colorado started more than a year ago, soon after voters in 2012 approved the legal pot industry. Washington state has its own version, which is scheduled to open in mid-2014. Uruguay passed a law in December to become the first nation to regulate pot. Pot advocates, who had long pushed legalization as an alternative to the lengthy and costly global drug war, had argued it would generate revenue for state coffers and save money in locking up drug offenders. Sam Walsh, a budtender, sets up marijuana products as the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary prepared to open for retail sales on January 1, 2014 . Still, setting up regulations, taxation and oversight for a drug that's never been regulated before took some time. Colorado set up an elaborate plant-tracking system to try to keep the drug away from the black market, and regulators set up packaging, labeling and testing requirements, along with potency limits for edible pot. The U.S. Justice Department outlined an eight-point slate of priorities for pot regulation, requiring states to keep the drug away from minors, criminal cartels, federal property and other states in order to avoid a federal crackdown. Pot is still illegal under federal law. Police in the eight Colorado towns allowing recreational pot sales stepped up patrols to dispensaries in case of unruly crowds. Denver International Airport placed signs on doors warning fliers they can't take the drug home in their suitcases. With the additional police patrols, the airport warnings and various other measures, officials hoped they have enough safeguards in place to avoid predictions of public health and safety harm from the opening of the pot shops. Marijuana has been decriminalized since 1975 in California, when the state legislature passed a bill making the possession of the drug a $100 civil fine - not an arrestable offense. In 1996, California voters passed a bill that legalized marijuana possession for medical purposes. Doctors are allowed to prescribe the drug to anyone with certain chronic medical conditions. Californians with a prescription can obtain an ID card that allowed the poses, grown and consume the drug. Fifty-five percent of voters approved the measure at the time. However, voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.","Hannah Loew, from Crosby, Texas, suffers up to 100 seizures a day .

Child car seats would for the first time have to protect children from death and injury in side-impact crashes under proposed government regulations, The Associated Press revealed on Wednesday. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeks to upgrade standards for child seats for children weighing up to 40 pounds to include a new test that simulates a side crash. The agency estimates the standards will prevent the deaths of about five children and injuries to 64 others each year. Improvements: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeks to upgrade standards for child seats for children weighing up to 40 pounds to include a new test that simulates a side crash . NHTSA Acting Administrator David Friedman is scheduled to announce the proposal Wednesday. Under the proposal, the new tests will simulate a 'T-bone' crash, where the front of a vehicle traveling 30 mph strikes the side of a small passenger vehicle traveling at 15 mph. The tests will position the car seat on a sled, with another sled ramming the side of the sled with the seat, rather than using actual vehicles since the aim isn't to test the crash worthiness of specific vehicles, NHTSA officials said. Research shows that most child deaths and injuries in side-impact crashes involve a car carrying children that is stopped at an intersection, usually at a light or stop sign, officials said. When the car begins to accelerate to . go through the intersection, it is struck in the side by a vehicle . traveling at a higher rate of speed on the cross street. The . side-impact test - the first of its kind - simulates both the . acceleration of the struck vehicle and the vehicle's door crushing . inward toward the car seat. New developments: Besides using a 12-month-old child dummy already approved under NHTSA standards, the proposed test will also utilize a to-be-developed side-impact dummy representing a 3-year-old child . Besides using a 12-month-old child dummy already approved under NHTSA standards, the proposed test will also utilize a to-be-developed side-impact dummy representing a 3-year-old child. 'As a father of two, I know the peace of mind this proposed test will give parents,' Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. The test 'will give parents and car seat makers important new data on how car seats perform in side crashes.' Friedman called car seats 'an essential tool for keeping young children safe in vehicles and have a proven track record of saving lives.' Safety advocates have long sought tougher standards for car seats to protect against side-impact crashes. 'I think this is terrific,' said Joan Claybrook, who was the NHTSA administrator during the Carter administration and later president of Public Citizen. She noted that today's passenger vehicles have eight air bags, in part to protect adults from side-impact crashes. 'We have an absolute moral obligation to protect children as well,' she said. NHTSA's estimates of the number of lives that will be saved and injuries prevented by the proposed standards are 'very, very conservative,' Claybrook said. Accident: Under the proposal, the new tests will simulate a 'T-bone' crash, where the front of a vehicle traveling 30 mph strikes the side of a small passenger vehicle traveling at 15 mph . The public will have 90 days to comment on the proposed regulations after they are published this week. The regulations won't be made final until after the agency has reviewed the comments and answered any important issues that may be raised.

The family of the SeaWorld trainer who died in 2010 when an orca pulled her under the water have spoken for the first time about the controversial Blackfish documentary. Dawn Brancheau's family say the 40-year-old trainer would never have remained at the Orlando, Florida marine park if she believed the whales were treated badly. The family distanced themselves from the critical documentary Blackfish, which alleged animal cruelty over captive orcas being kept at marine parks. Scroll down for video . Dream job: Dawn Brancheau with one of SeaWorld's orcas . Statement: Dawn's husband, Scott Brancheau, center, her mother Marion Lovedre, and brother Charles, left, at a hearing about the trainer's death in 2010. The family have refused to back the critical Blackfish documentary . In a statement on the Dawn Brancheau Foundation website the trainer's family said they had been asked constantly for their opinion of the film since it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival last year. 'First and foremost we are not . affiliated with this movie in any way,' the statement, which was . released earlier this week, said. Critical: The documentary Blackfish claimed it was cruel to keep orcas in captivity . 'Blackfish is not Dawn's story. Dawn Brancheau believed in the ethical treatment of animals. Dawn followed her dreams and became a marine animal trainer. She loved the whales and was proud of her work as a trainer,' it added. 'Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for.' The family added that they continued to support Ms Brancheau's friends and colleagues who still work at SeaWorld. The statement added: 'Since Dawn’s death nearly four years ago, the media has focused mainly on the whales. 'A human life was lost that day and it feels as though some believe her death was just a footnote.' The family said they would not be releasing further statements about the film. Ms Brancheau had wanted to work with orcas since she first saw the Shamu show when she was a little girl. She worked hard to secure a job at the park and in 1996, the year she married a fellow worker at SeaWorld, she realized her ambition to work in Shamu stadium. Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at the parks. Ms Brancheau was grabbed and drowned by six-ton orca Tilikum after a show in February 2010. The documentary examined Tilikum's background and was critical of keeping whales in captivity. Passion: Dawn performs in one of SeaWorld's shows. The trainer would not have stayed at the marine park if she believed it was cruel, her family say . Natural habitat: Blackfish, which showed footage of wild orcas, above, claimed marine parks were cruel . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed on Tuesday that it was looking into reports that Lara Padgett, who helped investigate Ms Brancheau's death, had fraternized with the makers of Blackfish at film festivals in the U.S. 'OSHA is committed to fair and effective enforcement of safety and health requirements in the workplace,' Jesse Lawder said in an email.

Resignation: Sister Mary Tracy, the president of a suburban Seattle Catholic school, has resigned in the turmoil following the school's decision to force out a vice principal who married his same-sex partner. Students and others have protested Zmuda's departure. Tracy was not immediately reachable by phone, and school lawyer Mike Patterson said he had no additional comment. 'Sister Mary came to this decision after much prayer and reflection,' the trustees' email said. 'For Sister Mary it was a difficult but necessary decision so that a new leader can be brought in to ensure the entire Eastside Catholic community is on a positive path forward.' Tracy is a member of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. The school's website says she joined Eastside Catholic in 2010, bringing 'more than 35 years of Catholic school leadership.' Interim trustee co-chairmen Tom Padilla and Brad Bastian said they realized that students, teachers, parents and others 'may have questions.' They announced a parents-only town-hall meeting for Thursday, with additional meetings planned but not yet scheduled. Fired: Former Vice Principal Mark Zmuda says he was fired, but the school says he resigned after acknowledging that his marriage violated Catholic teaching and thus the terms of his contract . Protest: Students and others have protested Zmuda's departure . Just last week, Catholics protesting the departure of Zmuda, a popular teacher and coach as well as vice principal, turned in a petition to both Eastside Catholic and the Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle. The petitions turned in on Jan. 15 were gathered by Faithful America, a national Christian organization, which called on the archdiocese to reinstate Zmuda. Another petition started on change.org by the senior class president has gathered more than 30,000 signatures since late December. It wants to change the Catholic Church's stance on gay marriage. In response to last week's protest, Archbishop J. Peter Sartain said, 'The recent personnel decision by the board and administrators of Eastside Catholic regarding Mr. Zmuda was made after a great deal of prayer and consultation. In no way was their goal to be discriminatory to anyone but to be faithful to their mission as a Catholic school.' School: Eastside Catholic School, pictured, has about 900 students, mostly in high school. It is located in suburban Seattle, Washington . Archdiocese spokesman Greg Magnoni said Tuesday night that he knew only that Tracy had submitted her resignation. He said Eastside Catholic is a private Catholic school that is not owned by the archdiocese. Earlier this month, a part-time musical coach at Eastside Catholic who recently announced she is engaged to her same-sex partner said the school gave her a new employment agreement as an independent contractor. Stephanie Merrow said she was told her marital status doesn't matter. Her contract did not talk about Catholic teachings, she said. Merrow said she wanted to go public to support the students who have been protesting on behalf of Zmuda.

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 01:12 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 01:13 EST, 22 January 2014 . A 35-year-old mathematician hacked OkCupid and found his future-fiancee in just 90 days all with the help of computer algorithms. The dating site founded by Harvard students in 2004 matches singles looking for love based on a compatibility percentage rendered from a questionnaire. According to Wired, Boston-born Chris McKinlay was working on his PhD at UCLA in June 2012 when he signed up for the site, but was having dismal luck finding a mate.In total, he had gone on just six first dates since signing up and less than 100 women had over a 90 per cent compatibility rating. During an early morning computer lab session, it dawned on McKinlay that he could apply his data skills to the site. Love online: Mathematician Chris McKinlay (right) found his future-fiancee Christine Tien Wang on OkCupid using a computer-generated algorithm - all in less than 90 days . The way OkCupid works is that individuals create their own profiles, and then answer 350 questions from a pool of thousands of questions. They answer each randomly picked question and then they weight the importance of that question on a scale from 'irrelevant' to 'mandatory'. McKinlay realized that he could only be matched with someone if they answered the same questions as him. In order to get around that, he created 12 robot profiles that answered all of the questions randomly, so that he could mine the survey answers from all the female profiles. After three weeks, McKinlay had collected 6 million question answers from 20,000 women across the country while spending most nights sleeping in his computer lab cubicle. Using an algorithm he was then able to sort the women, focusing on a sample of 5,000 who live in LA or San Francisco and had logged onto the site within the last month. The algorithm was then able to sort the women into different clusters of types based on characteristics in their profiles. Two clusters of women he found particularly interesting. The first was a group of women in their mid-twenties who seemed to be indie types, musicians and artists. The other cluster was slightly older who had professional creative jobs in editing and design. So he created two different profiles to focus on each cluster and then he answered the top 500 survey questions for each group. Perfect match: McKinlay was a PhD student at UCLA in June 2012 when he decided to apply his data skills to the dating site . He filled out the questions honestly, since he didn't want any future relationship to be based on 'computer-generated lies', but he did follow the data on what to rank each question for importance. For example, one question was: 'Regardless of future plans, what's more interesting to you right now? Sex or love?' McKinlay picked 'love' but rated the question 'very important' for the first group and 'mandatory' for the second group. After answering the questions he saw his matches and the results were astounding. He had more than ten thousand matches with compatibility over 90 per cent . The last step was to get attention from his matches. On OkCupid, users are notified when someone looks at their profile, so McKinlay set up the computers so that they would view as many profiles as possible. This prompted matches to message him back when they saw his profile and they were interested. 'I haven’t until now come across anyone with such winning numbers, AND I find your profile intriguing,' one woman wrote him. Also, something about a rugged man who’s really good with numbers … Thought I’d say hi. He says he received about 20 messages a day. On June 30, the computer part was over when he went on his first date. By date 20 he noticed that women in the first group usually had two or more tattoos and lived in East LA. Many of the women in the second group seemed to have midsized dogs. Eventually he deleted the profile for the first group of younger women after spending too much time commuting to meet them. After a month he had been on 55 dates. Three led to second dates and only one had led to a third date. It wasn't until date 88 that he met the one: Christine Tien Wang, a 28-year-old artist and prison abolition activist who was getting her masters in fine arts from UCLA. She had been matched with McKinlay while searching for a 6-foot male with blue eyes who lived near campus. They were a 91 per cent match. Self-help: McKinlay has since written a book on the whole experience, advising others on the best way to look for love on the site . For their first date they walked around a sculpture garden and got sushi and something clicked. Soon, McKinlay revealed his OkCupid resaerch and Wang found the whole plan compelling. 'I thought it was dark and cynical,' she said. 'I liked it.' The two continued to date even after Wang got a one-year art fellowship in Qatar. Soon after their first anniversary, McKinlay proposed to her with a diamond ring over Skype. She said yes. While most people wouldn't be able to pull off the complex computer mathematics McKinlay did to find his soul mate, he believes what he did is just a 'large-scale and machine-learning version of what everyone does on the site'. McKinlay adds that it wasn't the math that made their relationship work. 'It was just a mechanism to put us in the same room. I was able to use OkCupid to find someone.' 'People are much more complicated than their profiles,' Wang said. 'So the way we met was kind of superficial, but everything that happened after is not superficial at all. It’s been cultivated through a lot of work.' McKinlay has since received his PhD and is teaching math while working on a postgraduate degree in music. He recently published a book on his OkCupid experience titled 'Optimal Cupid: Mastering the Hidden Logic of OkCupid' which seeks to help other people best use the site.","Mathematician Chris McKinlay hacked OkCupid in June 2012 and found his soul mate on date 88 .

A San Francisco transit police officer has died after a co-worker accidentally shot him during a raid on an apartment. Tom Smith, who had served with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) for 20 years, was shot in Dublin, just outside of the city, at about 1.45pm on Tuesday. The 42-year-old was part of a team of officers who were called to search an apartment belonging to a suspect in a recent spate of robberies on the transit system. Tragic: BART officer Tom Smith died after a colleague's gun went off as they searched an apartment . As Smith and another officer, who has not been named, entered the empty apartment, a shot was fired. It hit Smith. The officer, who was married to a BART worker and had a young daughter, died later in hospital. Sergeant J D Nelson, of the county sheriff's office, told CBS SF Bay Area he assumed the officers had their guns drawn as they entered the building. It is not clear why one of the guns went off. BART officers carry out searches if they are related to crimes committed on the BART system, Sergeant Nelson added. Several officers were involved in the raid, and were wearing bulletproof vests as they entered the apartment belonging to suspect, John Henry Lee, who has been in custody since Thursday. Officers are believed to have knocked . twice on the apartment door and, after hearing no response and finding . the door unlocked, they stepped inside, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Investigation: Officers search the area around the Dublin apartment where Smith was shot . Somber: An officer arrives at the apartment complex where the shot was fired . Devoted dad: Tom Smith, pictured in 2011 with his daughter and police dog, served with BART for 20 years . Because they didn't know if the apartment was empty, the officers followed protocol and had their guns drawn. Sergeant Nelson told SF Gate the officer believed to have shot Smith had been with BART for ten years, and added: 'It was either accidental or target misidentification.' A statement released on Tuesday afternoon read: 'BART has been informed that one of our officers has died from wounds . sustained during a shooting earlier today. The entire BART organization . is deeply saddened by this tragic event.' BART director Gail Murray said: 'Like all peace officers, our BART police risk their lives when they go out to work in the stations and cities.'

The theft of personal information from more than 100million South Korean credit cards and accounts, reportedly including those of President Park Geun-hye and UN chief Ban Ki-moon, has ignited a storm of anger and litigation against credit firms. Worried Koreans on Tuesday packed into branches of one of the banks hit by the theft to ensure their money was safe, while lawyers said 130 people joined a class action suit against their credit card providers in what is expected to be the first of multiple litigations. ‘Of course I'm angry. Anyone might know when I pay my credit card bills, let alone my phone number and where I live. I might as well keep all my money in my closet,’ said one card user, Lee Young-hye, outside a bank branch. Contrite: (left to right) Son Kyung-Ik, head of NH Nonghyup Card, Lotte Card CEO Park Sang-Hoon and KB Kookmin Card CEO Shim Jae-Oh bow to make a joint public apology about the scam . Scam: The data security breach affected around 15million cardholders . The biggest breach of personal privacy ever in South Korea has further highlighted the vulnerability of credit card information after tens of millions of U.S. cardholders' details were stolen from retailer Target Corp during the holiday shopping season. South Koreans on average have more than four credit cards, something that has contributed to one of the highest levels of personal debt relative to the size of the economy in the developed world. The data security breach affected around 15million cardholders, according to official estimates, by far the largest in a series of such scams against financial firms in South Korea going back to 2011. President Park Geun-hye is said to be one of the millions of victims of the scam . Some previous attacks involved hackers believed to originate from North Korea, but this one seems to have been an inside job. Financial regulators said a contractor with the Korea Credit Bureau, a private firm that manages the credit information of millions of Koreans for financial services providers, simply loaded details of 105.8million accounts held by KB Kookmin Card Co Ltd, Lotte Card Co Ltd and NH Nonghyup Card onto a portable hard drive. The technician was allegedly working on forgery-proofing credit cards when he committed the theft in February, June and December last year, according to regulator Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), citing the prosecutor's office leading the investigation. Accused: The data thief was reportedly working for the Korea Credit Bureau (file picture) The man then sold the information to at least two people including a loan marketer and a broker, the FSS said. The contractor and at least one other person have been arrested. The first class action lawsuit was filed against the three credit card companies late on Monday, a day after the FSS revealed the full scale of the theft, according to the law firm representing them. The victims are each claiming 110million won ($103,400 or £62,000) in compensation. Lawyers said they expected more lawsuits to come, as internet chatrooms and social media seethed with complaints about the security failure. ‘We are preparing additional lawsuits regarding the case and are receiving applications from victims,’ an official at the law firm leading the litigation said. Cho Yeon-haeng, president of Korea Finance Consumer Federation, a customer rights group, said: ‘Proving actual damages will be very difficult, which means at best nominal compensation for emotional injury. ‘What is needed is stopping repercussions by re-issuing all the affected credit cards,’ he added. The stolen information included names, home addresses, and phone numbers, bank account numbers, credit card details, identification numbers, income, marriage and passport numbers. The FSS said credit card passwords were not stolen, although this was cold comfort to South Koreans for whom most credit card transactions simply require a card swipe and signature - without the need for a chip and pin process. Some outlets such as home shopping channels do not even need a signature. South Korean media reported that President Park and UN Secretary General Ban were among those whose information was stolen, although government officials and the card firms declined to comment. Park's office declined to comment, while Ban's office could not be reached to comment. Executives from KB Kookmin Card, Kookmin Bank, NH Nonghyup Card, Lotte Card and Korea Credit Bureau, which hired the contractor, offered to resign as investigators probed how such a massive data theft could have occurred so easily. Credit card spending amounted to 451trillion won ($424.01billion or £258billion) in 2012, accounting for 66 percent of the country's private consumption, according to data from the Credit Finance Association of Korea. The Nilson Report, a California trade journal that tracks the payments industry, said in its August issue that global card fraud rose to a record $11.3billion in 2012, from just under $10billion the year before. Nearly half the losses occurred in the United States, helped by the lack of the more advanced card readers.","The theft appears to be an inside job by a Korean Credit Bureau worker .

The Government yesterday issued a glowing report on the Olympics coming in under budget – despite the cost being almost four times the original estimate. Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson said it was a ‘significant achievement’ that spending on the 2012 Games was expected to come in £476million under its £9.3billion budget. But his boast was declared ‘disingenuous’ by critics, who pointed to the initial estimate of £2.4billion made by the Labour Government when London won the bid in 2005. Costly: An aerial view shows the construction starting for the Olympic opening stage designed by Danny Boyle at the Olympic Stadium yesterday . This had ballooned to £9.325billion by 2007, leading to claims that the public was duped over the true cost – or that an overly generous budget had been created to ensure it would not be exceeded. Nevertheless, Mr Robertson used the final quarterly update on Olympic finances before the London Games to say: ‘The project is in an extraordinarily good place financially. 'We are in the process of delivering the largest logistical exercise outside a major war and we have done it on time and under budget, and that’s a fantastic calling card for this country.’ Day 26: Crowds waited on the Royal Mile for a glimpse of the flame as it was carried by wheelchair user Sally Hyder along with her assistance dog Harmony, from Canongate Kirk to Holyrood . Olympic spirit: Local schoolchildren cheering in Dalkeith during day 27 of the torch relay .

He added that there was a . ‘recognition right from the word go that [the £2.4billion estimate] . would have to change dramatically on the basis of delivering the Games’. The figure did not include costs for security, VAT, the regeneration of East London or contingency funds. Yesterday also saw the disclosure that a further £19million would be spent on security. The . decision was made after ministers were ‘surprised’ at the huge turnout . for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee river pageant, which saw 1.2million . people line the banks of the Thames despite poor weather. The . scenes sparked fears of over-crowding during the Games, particularly . around the cycling road races during the opening weekend. The .

The flame will also visit St Paul's Cathedral, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, pass Battersea Dogs Home and travel to the site of the 1908 Olympic Stadium in White City on the penultimate day. The torch relay is currently in Scotland on the 27th day of a tour around Britain. Yesterday thousands of people lined the streets of Scotland's capital to greet the Olympic Flame on its last full day north of the border. Thirteen-year-old Joseph Forrester, trailed by 20 schoolchildren, carried the torch along West Sands beach in St Andrews to recreate the opening scene of Chariots of Fire. The 1981 film opens with a classic scene of British runners churning through waves and sand to the soaring strains of music by Vangelis. The title of the film comes from a refrain in the classic Christian hymn Jerusalem, which is sung later in the film. Home turf support: British Airways has created a giant image of British World Champion heptathlete Jessica Ennis on the flightpath to Heathrow . In Edinburgh, onlookers crowded into the top of the Royal Mile to catch a glimpse of the flame, while thousands more took their seats at the Castle Esplanade for an outdoor celebration and concert. Pop singer Emeli Sande headlined the event, which also featured acrobatic performances, dance displays and community acts. The musician performed a selection of her new songs and well-known hits, including Heaven and Next to Me. The torch was taken into the arena by Lesley Forrest, who lit a cauldron on stage towards the end of the show.

Ms Forrest, 54, received a kidney transplant in 1996 and went on to become a multiple medallist in both the British and World Transplant Games. Reflecting on the experience, she said: 'I was getting to the point where it was quite emotional and I thought I would have a few tears, but the crowd just brings you along and I was just so overwhelmed and excited about it all. 'I think the torch has really pulled all the communities together; you just have to look at Edinburgh today. I think it's gathered momentum and everybody now will be watching the Olympics.' Today the Olympic torch is making its way south after taking in some of Scotland's most famous landmarks during a week-long tour. Lighting up: The city of Newcastle prepares for the Olympic torch relay by displaying the Olympic rings on the famous Tyne Bridge . Work of art: Made of aluminium they are approximately 25m wide by 12m high making them the largest set of metal Olympic Rings in the UK. Each Ring has a width of 720mm and will be 375mm in depth . Crowds lined Edinburgh's Royal Mile as the torch was carried past the Scottish Parliament on its 140.2-mile journey from the Scottish capital to Northumberland. Day 27 of the relay finishes with a party at Alnwick Castle - used in the Harry Potter films. A total of 8,000 people are to carry the . flame during its 8,000-mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of . the Olympic Games in London on July 27. Tomorrow the route will start in Alnwick and finish in Newcastle upon Tyne. It is being carried by 130 torchbearers through 24 communities including Musselburgh, Dalkeith, Lasswade, Loanhead, Bilston, Milton Bridge and Penicuik. The torch is also visiting Eddleston, Peebles, Innerleithen, Walkerburn, Selkirk, Galashiels, Earlston, Gordon, Greenlaw, Duns, Chirnside, Foulden, Berwick-Upon-Tweed and Bamburgh. The day's first torchbearer was 16-year-old Raquel Matos from Edinburgh, who started the flame at the city's Festival Square. She was nominated for her swimming achievements. Many schoolchildren waited on the Royal Mile for a glimpse of the flame as it was carried by wheelchair user Sally Hyder along with her assistance dog Harmony, from Canongate Kirk to Holyrood. The 49-year-old, from Edinburgh, has multiple sclerosis and was nominated for the work she does to promote the charity Canine Partners. Later in the day Olympian Allan Wells, 60, carries the flame in Selkirk. He won gold in the 100m at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. In Galashiels it will be carried by Chris Paterson, Scotland's most-capped rugby player. The torch arrives in the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed at around 4.30pm, taking in the splendour of Bamburgh Castle above the beach on the North Sea. Finally torchbearers will run around Alnwick, Northumberland, and end their relay at the town's castle. The Olympic Torch arrived in Scotland on June 7 by ferry from Northern Ireland and set off the next day. Its journey through the country began in Stranraer and headed to Stornoway, Orkney, Shetland and down the east coast, taking in Loch Ness, the Falkirk Wheel, the Forth Road Bridge, Stirling Castle and the Old Course at St Andrews.

"By . John Hall . PUBLISHED: . 20:51 EST, 21 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:45 EST, 22 January 2014 . An 18th century cook book filled with bizarre meals enjoyed by King George II, including blackbirds and puffins, has emerged for sale. The recipes include items Heston Blumenthal would think twice about experimenting with today but 300 years ago it was deemed fit for a king. The book is made up of lists of day-to-day meals served to the German-born monarch and his guests at Kensington Palace between 1736 to 1737. Fascinating: The Kensington Palace cook book (right) is effectively a list of the daily meals served for King George II (left), his wife Queen Caroline, and their guests. The date appears on top of each page . Fit for a king? Puffins are among the many unusual creatures that found themselves on George II's dinner plate . Roasted sea birds and garden birds were frequently devoured by George and his wife, Queen Caroline, including larkes, snipes, teals, godwits, puffins, pigeons and blackbirds. The royal couple also scoffed tiny ortolans, a small migratory bird that was drowned in Armagnac, plucked, roasted and then eaten whole on a spoon. Quail and rooster were also on the menu at Kensington Palace along with frogs, lamb and boar heads, mutton and roasted pig. The meals were created by master cook William Daniell who noted them in a 77 page book that took 18 months to compile. It was later given to Daniel Durant, the clerk of the kitchen at Kensington Palace. It has now been made available for sale at Dominic Winter auctions in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a pre-sale estimate of Â£8,000. There are several grease spots on the book from where it was close proximity to boiling fatty food . Chris Albury, a spokesman for the auction house, said: 'This manuscript gives us a magnificent insight into dining at the royal household in the early 18th century. 'Some of the food eaten back them isn't for the squeamish... It seemed that any bird that could fly and be shot at was fair game for the dinner table. 'Our tastes have changed over time and you would never consider eating a garden bird now.' A lot of the food in the cook book is incredibly rich, with vast quantities of roasted meat requiring plenty of exercise to burn it all off. The book is effectively a list of the daily meals served for the King, Queen and their guests, with each day's date on top of each page. Mr Albury said: 'The manuscript opens with dinner for Her Majesty Queen Caroline alone at Kensington on June 1, 1736 and continues until December 1, 1737... There are some missing periods which include Queen Caroline's illness and death in November 1737.' He added: 'But her demise didn't put the Royal family off enjoying their Christmas dinner a month later... His Majesty was served bisk squabs, chicks friccasy, capon grill, cold turkey, shoulder ofmutton, plumb broth, minced pies. 'And for supper there was supper mutton and chicks cold, veal fille broiled, oysters in lemons, spinnage and eggs, stewed lettuce, herring salad, jelly pippins and peepers which I believe are frogs,' he said. Mr Albury went on to say: 'There is also a dinner menu for the commemoration of Coronation Day, 11 October 1737... This gastronomic feast included quails, ortolans, teal, snipe, larkes, English morels and roatsed capons and pig."" The book was written in sepia ink in informal handwriting with calligraphic flourishes. There are several grease spots on some of the pages from where the book was in close proximity of boiling fatty food taken out of the ovens. William Daniell died in 1739 aged 75 and is buried in the gardens at Chelsea Hospital. The book is being sold on January 29.","Kensington Palace cook book documents bizarre food eaten by George II .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:51 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:01 EST, 22 January 2014 . Wendy Davis, the overnight Democratic Party success story whose hardscrabble roots and Texas-sized abortion rights filibuster made her a household name in June 2013, is in a sudden downward spiral. A day after the Dallas Morning News published a profile of the 50-year-old state senator and gubernatorial candidate that found problems with her public biography, Davis began lashing out at her Republican opponent, state Attorney General Gregg Abbott, complaining that he had never 'walked a day in my shoes.' Abbott is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair from the age of 26 after a tree fell on him during a long-distance jog. In her defense, Annie's List, a progressive group that promotes female Democratic candidates, blasted the handicapped Abbott for 'running scared.' And Davis herself tweeted on Tuesday that 'the only thing Abbott & his allies have proven with these desperate attacks is that they don’t understand these Texas stories of struggle.' Democratic candidate for Texas governor Wendy Davis is struggling to explain misstatements in her own biography, and resorted to attacking her opponent, a paraplegic, for never having 'walked a day in my shoes' Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, Republican candidate for Texas Governor, lost the use of his legs at age 26 in a freak accident, when an oak tree fell on his back as he jogged by . 'We’re not surprised by Greg Abbott’s campaign attacks on the personal story of my life as a single mother who worked hard to get ahead,'  Davis said in a statement after the Dallas newspaper published its exploration of her life story. 'I am proud of where I came from,' she said, 'and I am proud of what I’ve been able to achieve through hard work and perseverance. And I guarantee you that anyone who tries to say otherwise hasn’t walked a day in my shoes.' Wayne Slater, the reporter who started the news cycle with a deep-dive into Davis' life story, insists that he never spoke to Abbott or his campaign staff for his story. Slater is regarded as a liberal partisan, and wrote an unflattering 2003 book-length critique of then-President George W. Bush and his deputy chief of staff Karl Rove. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is no stranger to public gaffes. He will vacate the governor's mansion after the 2014 election. Perry surprised abortion-rights defenders when he trumped Davis' filibuster by extending the state's legislative calendar long enough to pass the bill she opposed . Davis, who rocketed to stardom in pink sneakers that sustained her through an 11-hour filibuster aimed at killing new restrictions on abortion clinics, isn't backing down from new punchlines that Slater has provided her GOP rivals. While she has styled herself as a self-made single mother who put herself through Harvard Law School, Slater found that her older husband Jeff paid most of the bills, including footing her last two years at Texas Christian University and then her law school tuition. He cashed in his 401(k) retirement account and borrowed still more money to cover his wife's educational bills. Ultimately their marriage soured, and conservative pundits are finding the timing noteworthy since Jeff Davis recalled that his ex-wife left him right after he made the final payment on her student loans. 'It was ironic, he told the Dallas Morning News. 'I made the last payment, and it was the next day she left.' Slater also found fault with the life timeline Wendy Davis has promoted for herself, learning that she became a single mother later in life than she has claimed and didn't struggle financially while she completed her education. She was 21 – not 19 as her online Texas Senate biography claims – when she divorced her first husband. She lived in a mobile home with her daughter Amber, but only for a few months, it turns out. And life became much easier when she married again just a few years later. Jeff's income as a lawyer helped with expenses raising Amber and Dru, another daughter the couple had together. He ended up with custody of both daughters, casting more doubt on Wendy Davis' narrative as a professional woman who successfully raised two children. She has made these questions fair game herself, Slater wrote, because she 'has made her personal story of struggle and success a centerpiece of her campaign' for governor. And 'some facts have been blurred.' The shoes: Davis' pink running sneakers made her an overnight feminist icon after she stood for 11 hours straight in opposition to a bill -- which eventually became law -- tightening requirements for abortion providers . The shoes: Davis' pink running sneakers made her an overnight feminist icon after she stood for 11 hours straight in opposition to a bill -- which eventually became law -- tightening requirements for abortion providers . Davis acknowledged to the Dallas newspaper that her 'language should be tighter' when telling her life story. She admitted that she was now 'learning about' the dangers of 'using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.' Although Abbott's campaign didn't contribute to Slater's story, it came out swinging after it hit newsstands. Matt Hirsch, the Abbott campaign's communications director, said in a statement that Davis is 'trying to hide her past.' 'Sen. Wendy Davis systematically, intentionally and repeatedly deceived Texans for years about her background, yet she expects voters to indulge her fanciful narrative,' Hirsch claimed. 'If voters can't trust what Sen. Davis says, how can they trust her to lead?' The conservative punditry website HotAir.com snarked that 'a guy who’s spent nearly 30 years in a wheelchair can relate to struggle, but it’s telling that Team Victim still thinks they can win a ""my life sucked even harder than yours"" debate with someone like him.' 'Sure, he was crippled and needed spinal surgery and extensive rehabilitation and overcame it all to become attorney general of Texas, but what hardship is that compared to a woman overcoming young motherhood to attend Harvard Law?' Wendy's army: Opponents of the right-to-life movement have stood behind Davis, putting millions into her coffers in hope of making her governor . Abbott, the Republican nominee for governor, hasn't spoken publicly about the 'walk a day in my shoes' slight, but the Dallas Morning News profile's author insists his story wasn't a politically generated hit piece . Davis faces an uphill climb in her unlikely battle to become the first Democratic statewide office-holder in Texas since Ann Richards lost the governor's mansion to George W. Bush in 1994. Her campaign collected $12.2 million last year and had $9.5 million banked as of last week. But Abbott has a war chest of $27 million amassed for the battle. Davis has fired back, using the episode as a chance to build her email list and raise still more money. 'Mine is a story about a teenage single mother who struggled to keep her young family afloat,' she wrote online Tuesday. 'It’s a story about a young woman who was given a precious opportunity to work her way up in the world. It’s a story about resiliency, and sacrifice, and perseverance.' 'And you’re damn right it’s a true story.'","Wendy Davis is becoming a punchline for using 'walk a day in my shoes' line against Greg Abbott, the wheelchair-bound attorney general of Texas .

Kanwal Butt, 17, died immediately after putting his ear to the tracks to see if his train was approaching . A teenage boy was fatally electrocuted after trying to 'listen' to train tracks – as is done in his native Pakistan. Kanwal Butt, 17, suffered severe burns and died immediately after putting his ear to the live rail to see if his train was approaching Godstone station in Surrey, an inquest heard. Kanwal, who had come to the UK from Pakistan with his family 18 months earlier, had already walked across the tracks to the intercom to ask staff why his train was late. The 17-year-old then clambered down from the platform again, knelt down and leaned towards the deadly rail, which discharged a shock that killed him instantly. An inquest was told that the teenager, who was making his first solo train journey in Britain, would probably not have known about live rails. His father, Amjad Butt, told police in a statement: ‘He has never travelled alone by train. In Pakistan trains operate on coal or diesel. I don’t think Kanwal would have known the rails are full of electricity. ‘In Pakistan you can walk across the track.’ The popular teenager was three weeks into a work experience placement at an Indian and Nepalese restaurant in Godstone and had been excited about returning to his family in Aldershot, Hampshire, to celebrate the Muslim festival of Eid. His death prompted his family and a local councillor to call for greater emphasis on rail-side warnings, especially in an age when more people are travelling to Britain to live and work. Gary Roberts, a customer service operator for Southern Railways, told police in a statement how on August 7 last year he was on duty in his office, answering calls from the public and operating the CCTV cameras across the network. He said he received a call at 10.20pm from Godstone station from a foreign man who was asking why the board at the station said the train was at 10.40pm when online it had said it would call at 10.30pm. He told him it was running late and then advised him on where to change for the journey home. The next thing Mr Roberts knew of the situation was when a duty manager called him asking him to review CCTV footage from Godstone after receiving reports of a body on the line. Detective Sergeant Danny Stockdale, of British Transport Police, said: ‘It shows Mr Butt arriving at the station at about 10.09pm, on his own, carrying a suitcase. ‘He goes onto the platform. He jumps down onto the tracks crosses the tracks on foot, on to the other platform, where he is for a couple of minutes, then crosses back over the tracks. ‘He stays for a few seconds, goes down on the tracks, goes on to his knees, leans forward, puts his head onto the tracks.’ An inquest was told that the teenager, who was making his first solo train journey in Britain from Godstone station (pictured), would probably not have known about live rails . Mr Roberts said the next thing visible was smoke, before Kanwal was seen lying on the tracks. Parshuram Pandey, from the Lal Akash restaurant, said: ‘In Pakistan to find out if a train is approaching you would kneel on the ground and put your ear to the rail.’ Mr Pandey also described Kanwal as ‘a very nice boy’ who was liked by everybody at the restaurant and had already become good friends with people in the short time he was with them. Chef Sandip Pokharel said: ‘I only knew him for three weeks but I’m upset because he was such a lovely person.’ He had been excited at the prospect of going home but turned down an offer to be dropped off at Redhill railway station because he did not want to be any trouble. Instead he accepted help in working out train times, packed his case and made his way to the nearby station. Soon afterwards, staff saw emergency vehicles converging on the site. The inquest heard that officers told them there was a trespasser on the railway. Mr Butt, through local district and county councillor Charles Choudhary, questioned whether the train information boards had been working at the time his son was at the station, because he had been agitated by the late-running train. Mr Butt told the coroner: ‘My son was a lovely, lively, happy boy who had just sat his exams at college and has got good results. He wanted to go to further education college. ‘I can’t believe this has happened and my family are all in great shock.’ Kanwal's death prompted his family and a local councillor to call for greater emphasis on rail-side warnings . But assistant coroner Belinda Cheney, presiding at the inquest in Woking, Surrey, said: ‘It’s not the fact that the train was running late that causes his death. It’s his going down on to the track.’ She concluded: ‘He was an extremely likeable young man who was looking forward to going home and may well have been anxious about his late-running train. ‘However, for reasons we will never know he decided to go down onto the track rather than use the footbridge to ascertain when that train was coming. ‘He appears to place his ear to the track, possibly to determine when his late-running train will arrive and not appreciating the tracks are electrified. ‘I will record that he died as an accident.’ Afterwards Mr Choudhary said: ‘What we have to do is make the public more aware of the dangers of people jumping onto the tracks. ‘A large number of people are coming from Europe, Asia and Africa and there needs to be a system to let the public know it’s dangerous. ‘The warnings have to be on the platform, in front of you.’","Kanwal Butt, 17, died immediately in Godstone, Surrey, an inquest heard .

"PUBLISHED: . 14:42 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:17 EST, 22 January 2014 . Report: Heavily pregnant Fiona Anderson, 23, was visited by social workers more than 50 times before she drowned her her three children and then jumped to her death from a multi-storey car park . A mother who killed herself after drowning her three children had been visited by social services more than 50 times, a report into the horrifying case has found. Heavily pregnant Fiona Anderson, 23, jumped to her death off a multi-storey car park in April last year. Police discovered the bodies of her three children Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden, at the family home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, several hours later. A report carried out by the Suffolk Local Safeguarding Children Board has now revealed the family were visited by officials dozens of times. The review, which concluded today, revealed the children were neglected by their mother and being forced to survive on just biscuits. It also found the children spent hours strapped into their pushchairs and strongly criticised 'poor management oversight' and 'inappropriate' decisions by council staff. But the investigation concluded social workers - including a student who shouldn’t have been sent to deal with such a serious case - were not to blame for the deaths. The children's father Craig McLelland today called for change to 'prevent this ever happening again'. He said: 'They have put in the report that social services need to change a lot of things and give more support for people. 'I am just hoping that people get the support now and it is being offered to prevent this ever happening again.' Concerns about the family stretched back to 2009 when worried social workers tried and failed to force the mother to give up her first child over fears about her mental health. The report acknowledged this action resulted in the relationship between the family and children’s social care becoming strained. By June 2010, when Levina was 12 months old, the concerns had diminished sufficiently for formal involvement to cease. But in May 2011, staff received reports that Levina and Addy had been sleeping in a double pushchair for 13 nights and had only been fed biscuits. Police and social workers visited the house where they found the children 'malnourished' and trapped in play pens without toys for hours. Tragedy: Levina, three, Addy, two, and Kyden, 11 months, who are pictured here with their father Craig McLelland, had been forced to survive on biscuits in the months leading up to their deaths . Victims: Kyden McLelland, 11-months-old, pictured left, and Levina McLelland, three . Innocent: Addy McLelland was just two. He was found dead at the flat with his brother and sister . Levina rarely went to nursery - reportedly because her mother feared the teachers would abuse her. Her attendance was so inconsistent that it was said to be 'like her first time' each day she turned up. There was also evidence that the young girl was given sanitary towels to use as knickers. Staff who visited the home also reported that Addy was underweight and 'worryingly passive'. In late 2011 the two children were put on Child Protection Plans for neglect after workers judged them to be emotionally stunted with poor language skills. Professionals who met the children said they were 'frozen' in their responses, with a sense of 'learned helplessness'. Staff were also aware of domestic fights between the parents - on one occasion when the mother was holding one of the children. When Kyden was born in May 2012 he was included in the Child Protection Plan, the report said. By August 2012, child protection officers decided to start legal proceedings against the family but a social worker sent to gather evidence failed to report back - so the process stalled. CCTV shows Fiona Anderson at outside the building complex where the father of her children lived early on the morning that she died . She appeared to try the door at the building which is home to St John's Housing Trust . Thirty seconds later she left the building - less than two hours later her body was found . During January and February last year, there were plans to have a legal strategy meeting 'as a matter of urgency', but this never happened. The report slammed the decision to send a student social worker to deal with the troubled family, calling it 'most inappropriate in the circumstances'. It revealed that even after a worried lawyer urged the council to send a more experienced worker to solve the situation, the student was still sent on most visits. An unannounced Ofsted inspection in July 2010 in the area where the family lived found that cases were 'carried out by unqualified staff or staff who are not yet registered as social workers'. At the time, the inspector said: 'This practice falls well below expected standards and may place children at risk of inadequate protection'. The report also said there was a 'failure to collect and collate information and evidence which would demonstrate not only physical neglect but also emotional abuse/neglect'. Fiona Anderson clutching a teddy bear moments before she fell to her death in Lowestoft . Anderson died from injuries sustained from jumping 40ft from a  multi-storey car park . It also said: 'The poor management oversight which allowed such drift to occur with the case from August 2011 to March 2013 was concerning.' The report also found the mother’s mental health had been assessed before the birth of her first child, but never after she became a mother, despite longstanding concerns. It identified 13 ‘learning points’, aimed at preventing future tragedies. But it concluded that staff had been hampered by the mother’s unwillingness to engage with social workers, saying: 'None of the professionals who had worked with the family would have been able to prevent or predict the final tragic outcome. 'There was never any evidence to suggest that the mother would harm herself or the children, and without any letter or definitive statement of intent by the mother, it remains unclear why she took the actions she did.'

A man has been charged with over 2,000 rapes of the same female spanning 20 years - they are among a sickening 5,100 sex counts. Donald Burrell is said to have started raping his victim in 1991 when she was seven-years-old, according to Pennsylvania State Police. The abuse by the now 55-year-old continued 'non-stop' for more than 20 years, state police said, and led to Burrell's recent arrest on more than 5,100 sexual abuse charges. Burrell remained locked up in the Bradford County Jail Tuesday night on $2.2 million bond. Preliminary court hearings are pending. Troopers said Burrell was involved in an unrelated police matter during an investigation in May 2013. At the time the Towanda Borough Police Department was looking for Blake Dieffenbach, who left Burrell in Robert Packer Hospital with serious injuries during an attack in May 2013, according to Action News archives. Dieffenbach eventually turned himself in on charges of attempted criminal homicide and aggravated assault. He is serving his sentence in the State Correctional Institute-Camp Hill, according to online records. Witnesses then told authorities last year Burrell was dealing drugs and sexually abusing a female. State police said an investigation by the Towanda Borough Police Department that followed revealed Burrell was 'responsible for the possession and delivery of a minimum of 700 grams of bath salts' between 2011 and 2013. Burrell remained locked up in the Bradford County Jail Tuesday night on $2.2 million bond . It was at that time, a female victim was identified, state police said. Burrell is facing more than 5,100 charges, including 2,258 counts of rape and thousands more added on due to the victim's age - from age 13 to incidents that allegedly happened after she turned 18. He also faces eight counts of possession of child pornography and 25 counts of delivery of a controlled substance (bath salts), according to the news release.","Donald Burrell 'starting raping his victim in 1991', when she was child .

Andrew Woodhouse, 44, was today on trial accused of assaulting two raiders he found stealing diesel from his business . A businessman who attacked two thieves caught red-handed in a night-time raid was arrested after defending his property, a court has heard. Andrew Woodhouse, 44, was today on trial facing assault charges on the two raiders he found stealing diesel from his business. A jury heard how Woodhouse grabbed a fence post one was carrying as a weapon - and used it to fight back against them. The father-of-five - who says he has repeatedly been a victim of crime at his gardening company - kept hold of the two burglars until police arrived. But the court was told it was Woodhouse who was then arrested and accused of using excessive force. The thieves ended up with £75 fines - but businessman Woodhouse could face a prison sentence if he is found guilty of attacking them. Defence lawyer Andrew Taylor said: 'These thieves thought they would have nice easy pickings that night. 'Many people would have given up and just claimed on their insurance but Mr Woodhouse is made of sterner stuff. 'He showed stoicism, courage and fitness to chase them. One of the men was armed and went to attack him. He acted in lawful self-defence. 'He agrees the red mist came down which you can understand when his business has almost been wiped out by crime. 'If it hadn’t been for him these men . would not have been caught. Where are we in society when a person cannot . act in self-defence to protect his property. That is what Mr Woodhouse . was doing.' Woodhouse chased Kevin Green (left) and left him with two broken legs and a broken arm, the court heard. He then allegedly rugby-tackled Timothy Cross (right) and lay on top of him until police arrived . Kevin Green, 53, and Timothy Cross, 32, tried to escape into a neighbouring field with jerry cans full of stolen fuel, the court heard. But Woodhouse chased Green - and caught him near their getaway car. The court heard he then attacked Green leaving him with two broken legs and a broken arm. The court heard he then chased Cross before rugby-tackling him. He lay on top of the raider until police arrived. Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'When he saw his hard-earned money carted off by a couple of ne’er-do-wells, he gave chase in anger intending to injure them.' Mr Wilson described it an 'unreasonable and unlawful assault.' He said: 'It was not reasonable self-defence. Mr Woodhouse lost his temper and went over the top. Woodhouse denies grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent . 'He is a hard-working businessman but he has let his frustration get the better of him. He lost it.' The court heard how Woodhouse gave police a full account of how he fought with the two raiders like a 'mad man'. He said: 'I swore at the men and grabbed one of them, I then felt a blow to my hand and shoulder and began grappling with them. 'If it hadn’t been for him these men . would not have been caught. Where are we in society when a person cannot . act in self-defence to protect his property. That is what Mr Woodhouse . was doing' - Defence lawyer Andrew Taylor . 'I was pushed over and then I grabbed something from one of their hands which felt like a wooden fence post. 'I didn’t want to be on the floor with someone hitting me with the wood like that. 'I swung out like a mad man between six and ten times. I was just lashing out man, I was hitting as hard as I could.' Woodhouse said he was 'gutted and sickened' to learn the extent of Green’s injuries. Woodhouse was woken in the middle of the night by a text message telling him a burglar alarm had gone off at the tyre yard where he runs his business. Married Woodhouse was in bed with his wife Lisa at their detached home in the village of Govilon, near Abergavenny, when his burglar alarm went off at about 12.30am. Green and Cross (pictured) were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates . The alarm is fitted to his business premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 home. Woodhouse drove to the premises where he disturbed two men stealing diesel from his machinery. A court heard how his wife drove to the scene to help him and she called the police to come and arrest the thieves. She told the court: 'I knew something was wrong when he didn’t ring me after leaving the house. 'When I drove there myself, I saw him lying on the floor with the second chap. He was holding him and shouting at me to ring the police.' The court heard officers found Green lying injured under a blanket - and Cross claiming the businessmen had gone 'over the top'. PC Aime McSherry said: 'I asked him what happened. 'He said: “I been nicking diesel and some bloke has beaten me up with a stick and broken my legs and my arm. I need an ambulance”.' Green claimed he was left in 'terrible pain' - and that Woodhouse kicked him in the ribs and punched him in the face. The court heard he is still using crutches ten months after the incident in March last year. Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago. He had been targeted by thieves in recent years who took between £15,000 and £25,000 of machinery. The court heard how he didn’t feel like officers had given him enough assistance when he had been the victim of crime. Green and Cross were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates. Woodhouse denies grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial at Cardiff Crown Court continues.","Andrew Woodhouse on trial facing assault charges on two raiders .

A heartbroken daughter has revealed how her elderly parents' implication in four gruesome murders 40 years ago has turned her idyllic, rural life upside down and shattered her childhood memories. Erica Hayes, the youngest daughter of Gerald Uden, 71, and 74-year-old Alice . Louise Uden, admitted that although her mother and step-father had done terrible things 'they're still the people I love'. Gerald Uden, from Chadwick, Missouri, was sentenced to life in prison in November after he confessed to the 1980 shootings of his ex-wife and her two sons, aged 10 and 11. Alice Louise . Uden has pleaded not guilty to the murder of her third husband Ronald Holtz, 25, whose body was recently found in an abandoned Wyoming mine. Gerald Uden has been sentenced to life for murdering his first wife and her two sons.  Alice Louise Uden is awaiting trial for the first-degree murder of her third husband and has pleaded not guilty . The couple hid the . bodies in Wyoming decades ago - then married each other and moved . 1,100 miles away to the tiny community of Chadwick, Missouri. Ms Hayes describes her childhood in the rural farming town as idyllic saying that her parents were very happily married and 'always laughing'. That peaceful world was obliterated on . September 26 last year when Mrs Uden, a trained nurse, was arrested for . the murder of Holtz. Someone had led police in 2007 to the mine where he was buried after he was last seen in December 1974 in Sheridan, Wyoming. Mr Uden, a long-distance truck driver, was arrested a day later for the murders of his ex-wife and her two boys. Their . daughter Erica Hayes, a 41-year-old truck driver, described the moment . that her stepfather found out that his lifelong lie was finally over. Uden took Erica's son Mackenzie, 20, into the bedroom and gave him his hunting rifles and guitars. Ms Hayes told People: 'He [Uden] then heard the knock at the door and he said, ''Mackenzie, don't be scared, but this is it.'' Erica Hayes, daughter of Alice and Gerald Uden, spoke to People magazine about her killer parents . 'It was the FBI. I gave him a hug. And he said, ''God I am sorry for what I did.''' In September 1980, the wife of Gerald Uden disappeared from Lander, Wyoming, along with her two sons, Reagan aged 10, and 11-year-old Richard. Uden had adopted the two boys during his short marriage to Virginia but was not the biological father. Mrs Uden, 32, and her sons were last seen at her mother Claire Martin's house before setting off to meet Gerald Uden and go hunting. A few days later, Virginia's car was found vandalized and soaked with blood. It had been covered in pine boughs in an attempt to hide it. Sadly, Gerald Uden's confessions did not . come in time for Mrs Martin who died last April at the age of 92 without . ever knowing what happened to her only daughter and grandsons. According to People, Mrs Martin felt certain that Gerald Uden was to blame but had no proof. Ms Hayes told the magazine that she already knew her mother's dark secret after Alice Louise Uden confessed to her in 2004 that she had killed someone. Reagan Uden, 10, left, and Richard Uden, 11, right, were shot in the back of the head by their stepfather Gerald Uden. He is now serving life in prison for their murders . Ms Hayes told People: 'She sat me down and said she had killed someone...She said Holtz was abusive and threatened to kill both of us and that she did it to protect me. 'She started crying and then wrapped me up in her arms and told me ''Whatever happens, happens.''' Ms Hayes said that the dark secrets have blown her world apart but that despite what she now knows about her parents' pasts, 'they're still the people I love'. Virginia Uden was murdered by her husband Gerald so that he could be with Alice Louise . Alice Uden's long-held secret appears to have come to light after someone reportedly told police in 1989 that she had confessed to shooting her husband in his sleep. The same source in 2007 then reportedly took police to a mining shaft. Authorities say they recovered Ronald Holtz's body in a mine on a ranch . in Laramie County in southeast Wyoming last summer. Investigators say a . bullet hole was in his skull. Gerald Uden confessed that Virginia Uden and the two boys were in drums at the bottom of Freemont Lake. He was sentenced on November 1 to life in prison. Uden was vague about his motive but said Virginia Uden had become 'intolerable'. 'Virginia did her very best to split Alice and me apart,' he said. 'She used the boys to do that.' He said he had no excuse for the murders - and Fremont County District Judge Norman Young said he agreed. Gerald Uden married Virginia Uden in 1974. 'She came to me in false pretenses,' Uden told the courtroom in November. 'She came to me looking for a husband, and through circumstances, I fell in love with this woman, and we married.' He said Virginia asked him to adopt her children. He did but she filed for divorce six weeks later. Gerald then married Alice. While some investigators have thought that child support was his motive, Uden said paying child support was not a problem. He said he finally ended up 'having to make a choice' between Alice and Virginia. He said on the day of the slayings, he met Virginia and the boys at a corner near his home east of Pavillion. He said Virginia brought along a .22-caliber rifle, but he denied asking her to bring it. He said they drove 5 or 6 miles north in a 1973 Ford Country Squire station wagon, then got out near an irrigation canal. 'The boys wanted to shoot the rifle,' Uden said. 'I said I wanted to test it. I tested it; it worked just fine.' He said he walked up behind Virginia Uden, shot her in the back of the head, then shot Richard behind the ear. 'Reagan saw what was happening. He ran, tripped and fell in the ditch,' Uden said. 'When he did, I walked up and shot him behind the ear.' Authorities later found the station wagon with blood in it, but no sign of the victims. Uden said he disposed of the bodies in an old mine but went back a couple months later and retrieved them. He put Virginia's body in a 55-gallon steel drum and sealed it, he said, then put the boys' bodies in a 30-gallon drum and sealed it, too. He said he took his boat to Fremont Lake and dumped the drums. The bodies have not yet been found.","Gerald Uden, 71, sentenced to life in prison in November for the murders of his ex-wife Virginia and her two sons in 1980 .

Margaret Pratt yesterday returned to the boat on which her husband, Roger, was brutally murdered . Just one week ago, she was enjoying a dream holiday sailing around the Caribbean with her husband on their luxury yacht. But yesterday, Margaret Pratt returned to the boat a widow following the brutal murder of Roger, 62, in St Lucia, last Friday. Her sunglasses failed to hide two black eyes and bruised cheekbones - a result of the brutal beating inflicted upon her by a gang of robbers who attacked them on their £200,000 vessel in the middle of the night. Stood on a concrete jetty in a straw hat, she bit her lip and put her hand to her mouth as her beloved boat, Magnetic Attraction, was moved to another harbour. Dressed in a white sleeveless dress and a straw hat with red ribbon, she looked distressed as she watched the yacht sail away. Two friends boarded the 41ft vessel yesterday lunchtime and manoeuvred it out of the marine police unit, as Mrs Pratt looked on, flanked by maritime police officers. Only last week, the same friends had enjoyed dinner with Mr and Mrs Pratt, who had been married for 37 years. A picture on Mrs Pratt’s travel blog showed the four of them, smiling and tanned, as they ate at the beautiful Marigot Bay resort. Beneath the photograph, she wrote that the meal was ‘exquisite’, saying: ‘Altogether a delightful and memorable day. Happiness is...’. Mr Pratt, a retired financial consultant and engineer, was bludgeoned to death by at least three robbers, in the industrial port of Vieux Fort. A post-mortem found he died of asphyxiation due to ‘blunt force trauma’. The couple were halfway through a year-long round-the-world trip and planned to sail to Trinidad on Monday. Police said the attackers reached the yacht in a stolen green canoe before forcing the couple into separate rooms, where they beat them in an attempt to obtain valuables. Boarded: The yacht is removed from the police holding area to another harbour on St Lucia . Stood on a concrete jetty in a straw hat, she bit her lip and put her hand to her mouth as her beloved boat, Magnetic Attraction, was moved to another harbour . When the gang fled, Mrs Pratt went looking for her husband and found him floating in the water. She sought help from the occupants of a nearby boat, who called the police. Five men have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and police said they expected to charge some of the men ‘imminently’. Vernon Francois, the commissioner of the island’s police force, told the Mail he believed the men ‘did not intend to kill’ Mr Pratt and that it was a robbery which ‘got out of hand’. Mr Pratt (pictured with his wife, Margaret) was bludgeoned to death by at least three robbers . Mr Francois said: ‘We know that five individuals planned the robbery, but we do not know how many boarded the boat. ‘The men are cooperating and giving information about it. ‘We believe they had done some planning and wanted to rob a yacht. ‘They did not know these people or specifically target this couple. ‘We understand they did not go with the intention to kill. They beat them to say ‘give me what we want’. He said that, in St Lucia, the charge . of ‘manslaughter’ did not exist, however, and that the men were likely . to be charged with murder, even if they did not all board the boat. ‘They did not have guns or knives but they used physical force to try to get them to get what they wanted. ‘Normally they ask for cash.’ Mr . Francois said the suspects, in their twenties, were all from Vieux . Fort, a depressed region of St Lucia away from the tourist resorts, . where unemployment is high. He said Mr Pratt’s body had been released and forensic tests were now complete on the yacht. ‘Mrs Pratt is free to leave St Lucia whenever she wants. We have finished our questioning.’ Mrs Pratt is receiving support from the British consulate and the St Lucian government. Aniel Innocent, press officer for the Royal Saint Lucia Police, said: ‘Mrs Pratt also has some good friends in the area, British people, who are providing emotional support for her at this difficult time.’ The couple were halfway through a year-long round-the-world trip and planned to sail to Trinidad on Monday . A source close to the investigation said Mr Pratt had been punched eight times on his face and head. They said: 'The bruising is consistent with a fist. It was mostly on the left side of his face. 'We believe he was punched unconscious and then fell overboard. 'He remained unconscious and asphyxiated or, in other words, he drowned. 'We do not believe anyone pushed him into the water because they would not have needed to. He was unconscious. 'He also had two minor rib fractures, which could be from hitting something as he fell on to the deck.' There was no sign of skin beneath his fingernails, a common sign that there was a struggle during the attack. However, the source said: 'The police are checking the injuries of the assailants to determine if there was a fight or night.'","Margaret Pratt returned to vessel on which her husband, Roger, was killed .

Former DJ Dave Lee Travis 'groped a journalist's breasts and asked her to pose for a suggestive photograph, Southwark Crown Court heard today . A journalist has told a court that veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis 'groped' her breasts after asking her to pose for suggestive photographs for him. The woman, who was in her 20s at the time, said she knew Travis, now 68, was suggesting she pose in a bikini or her underwear after noticing a similar photo of a pop star on his wall. The witness, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said the incident took place when she went to the former BBC presenter’s home to interview him about a photograph of him and Jimmy Savile. She told London’s Southwark Crown Court that while there she noticed a 'provocative' photograph on the wall of a pop star she believed to be Jo O'Meara from S Club 7 posing on her knees in a bikini. She said: ‘I’m not an expert but it was a lady . from S Club 7. I knew there were two blonde ones and I recognised it to . be the taller one, who I thought was Jo. Giving evidence from behind a screen, she recalled events, and told jurors that as they both looked at the picture: 'Dave Lee Travis said to me ""I’m also a photographer and I took this photograph"". 'He slightly looked down at me and said ""Well, you’ve got a good figure, I could take a photograph of you"".' The woman said she felt 'embarrassed' and 'taken aback' but did not say much in reply. Describing the former Top Of The Pops presenter, known as DLT, as a 'larger- than-life character', she said they then proceeded with the interview in the recording studio at his home before chatting more generally as there was time to kill before he dropped her at the station. The woman said she felt as though she was in an 'enclosed space' as they spoke face to face in his kitchen. She went on: 'He raised photography and said again ""I could take some photos of you"". Travis, 68, had a suggestive photograph of S Club 7 star Jo O'Meara, right, on his wall, the court was told . 'The first time when I dismissed it, I thought the conversation wouldn’t happen again. 'The fact that he raised it again, I almost felt like I had to justify myself. 'I burst out ""No - and anyway, my boobs aren’t big enough"", because I thought that would put him off. 'He didn’t say anything, there was a split second where neither of us said anything, and then suddenly he put his arms out and put his hands on my breasts and then quizzically put his head to the side as if he was judging himself - whether they were big enough.' The woman said she thought Travis left his hands there for a 'couple of seconds'. She went on: 'It felt to me like he knew that this was an opportunity. In hindsight I see that he was looking for an opportunity and he took it. I did not invite him to touch me. 'The picture was very obviously about a young girl in a bikini showing her cleavage. 'I knew what he meant when he said I had a good figure. He wanted me to strip down.' The journalist said she went to interview Travis for an article about him and Jimmy Savile, pictured in 1980 . During cross-examination from Stephen Vullo, defending Travis, the woman said she would never pose for such photographs for anyone. 'It’s highly inappropriate and tacky and I’d be highly embarrassed if I’d be coerced into doing something like that,' she told jurors. Mr Vullo put it to the woman that Travis had said the incident did not happen. 'That’s a lie,' she said. Wearing a light grey blazer and patterned tie, Travis sat in the dock listening to the evidence through headphones and smiled as the photograph of him and Savile was mentioned. Describing the moments after Travis allegedly groped her, the woman said she did not acknowledge what he had done as she 'didn’t process it at all at the time' and wanted to remain professional. They carried on talking but 'his behaviour changed a bit' and he became less chatty. She said no-one else was in the house apart from a cleaner she saw briefly when she arrived, but he said his wife was resting upstairs. Southwark Crown Court: Jurors heard from the journalist's flatmates, who said she was upset after the interview . The witness said she did not go to police or say anything to her bosses at the time as she 'didn’t want to make a big fuss' or jeopardise her career. She said she simply thought Travis was a 'pervy old man taking the opportunity to do that to me', but decided to go to police after other allegations about Travis came out in the press and she 'felt a real responsibility to come forward'. Friends of the journalist who lived with her also gave evidence, telling jurors they discussed what Travis had allegedly done to her that evening. One friend said she appeared 'stressed' and 'upset' when she came home from work. The witness said her friend told her: 'He’d made a lascivious comment about, I don’t know, drawing her or something, and then after that he’d placed both his hands on her breasts.' Another friend who lived with her told jurors: 'She was quite shaken and upset and talked to me about what had happened. 'She said that the whole time she was conducting the interview Dave Lee Travis was being very touchy feely with her - very tactile, giving her hugs, putting his arm around her, that sort of thing. 'Towards the end of their meeting she had been in his kitchen and Dave Lee Travis had sort of lunged at her and touched her breasts.' Travis, of Buckinghamshire, denies a charge of sexual assault against the woman in 2008. He is also charged with 13 counts of indecent assault dating back to 1976 and as recently as 2003, covering the time when he worked as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, on Top of the Pops, and as a panto star. He denies all the charges.","Woman, in her 20s at the time, had gone to DJ's house to interview him .

"By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 10:50 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:22 EST, 22 January 2014 . The elderly widow of a World War II spy who spent six months hiding in a loft from the Nazis ended her own life by taking poison, an inquest heard. Noreen Orange, 85, killed herself four years after the death of her husband John, who worked for British intelligence and spoke fluent German. Neighbours knew very little about the secretive couple who had lived together in Budleigh Salterton, east Devon, for 60 years. Inquest: Noreen orange, 85, took her own life in her home, the inquest at County Hall in Exeter (pictured) was told . But the inquest heard Mr Orange was a spy who joined the army after being forced to abandon his Cambridge University medicine degree after the war broke out in 1939. He went to Sandhurst before later working on the 'intelligence side', the coroner in Exeter, Devon was told. Friends said they believed Mr Orange had been ‘spying in the war for the Russians’ - although the family said they were mistaken and he worked for the British secret service. The retired spy had told neighbours that he was in Austria during the war when he hid from the Germans in a loft. He was shot in the left arm during the war and also in his calf but 'never discussed it', the coroner was told. It is unclear exactly what Mr Orange did in the military because he never discussed it, his niece Sarah Richards added. The family don't know whether he still worked for British intelligence after the war. 'John was a very very private person. He did not talk about what he got up to. I am sure he was not a spy for . the Russians because he was definitely a patriot. 'He was involved in British intelligence.' She added that he always wore a shirt and waistcoat because they covered the wound on his arm. He later worked in the clock-making business repairing expensive timepieces for Christies and Sothebys. Private couple: John and Noreen Orange were 'very private' people who lived down this rural road in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, the inquest heard . The coroner was told she ended her own life last February, four years after her husband had passed away. The emergency services were called to a chemical incident at her house last February. They had to wear special chemical suits and breathing gear to enter the property because of the poisonous fumes. No post-mortem examination was carried out on her body because of the chemicals. Mrs Orange, who worked as a journalist and never had any children, left a suicide note written several days before her death. Mrs Richards said her uncle John had been a 'possessive and needy' man. She added that her aunt had threatened to end her own life if she ever got a terminal illness. 'She was a very intelligent lady who would think about things very carefully and her decision would not have been taken lightly,' Mrs Richards said. The inquest heard Mrs Orange was suffering with back pain and sciatica in the days before she killed herself and had told friends that she would not see another spring. Chris Sampson, who had known the pensioner for 43 years, said she was a ‘proud and independent’ woman who had been in a lot of pain in the final weeks of her life. She said to him 'thank you for everything you have done for me’ hours before she ended her life. PC David Evans said the handwritten suicide note found at the scene was written two days before Mrs Orange killed herself. Coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland concluded that Mrs Orange had ended her own life with cyanide some time after 3pm on February 1 last year. 'John was absolutely devoted to Noreen and he was possessive because he found it difficult to socialise. He taught her German and they enjoyed socialising together,' she said.

Angry: Sonita Claire, pictured, has been jailed for seven years after mowing down her ex-lover and his partner as they walked along the pavement in Derby last October . An aspiring actress has been jailed for seven years after she mounted a pavement and used her car 'as a weapon' to plough into her former lover and his partner. Sonita Claire smashed into Kevin O'Neill - the father of her child - and Mary Jane Kimble at 30mph, hitting them from behind as they walked hand-in-hand on a busy Derby street. The couple were thrown onto the roof of Claire's Ford Fiesta before falling to the road 40 yards from where they were struck. Mr O'Neill, 38, suffered a broken neck fractured vertebrae in his neck and a broken collar bone, while 33-year-old Miss Kimble sustained multiple cuts to her head and face and a broken collar bone. Both were knocked unconscious and left in pools of blood. Nottingham Crown Court heard they have since made good recoveries from their injuries, but neither has any recollection of what happened. Judge Michael Stokes QC, sentencing, told Claire: 'Heaven has no rage like love turned to hatred, nor hell a woman like a woman scorned.' He said the 28-year-old, whose profile is still available on acting directory The Casting Website, that she had committed a 'wicked' offence, adding: 'You had no control over whether they lived or died. 'This is a very unusual, if not bizarre, case. You were driven by a combination of jealousy and revenge.' Motive: The court heard that she had been driven by 'a combination of jealousy and revenge' when she smashed into the couple . The judge said that Claire 'couldn't cope' with the fact her ex-partner 'preferred another woman', and that her actions had been brought on by 'obsession and jealousy'. The court heard how Claire, kitchen worker Mr O'Neill, and Miss Kimble had been caught in a 'love triangle' which had left Claire 'bitter and hurt'. David Allan, prosecuting, said Mr O'Neill and Miss Kimble were going out together in 2004 when he had a short 'fling' with Claire. A year later he split from Miss Kimble and re-kindled his relationship with Claire - who gave birth to his son in 2006. But their relationship broke down last year, and Mr O'Neill and Miss Kimble got back together. Mr Allan said that in the days before the offence Claire had confronted her former lover and hit him with an umbrella. She also contacted Miss Kimble and threatened to run her over. Violence: Claire, who had threatened to run them over in the past,  carried the victims nearly 40 metres before they fell off her car, leaving them with broken bones and lying in pools of blood . Knocked down: Claire mounted the pavement here in City Road, Derby, and hit the couple from behind. The markings on wall where the incident occurred . The hearing was told Claire followed through on her threat at 4.15pm October 6 last year. She targeted the couple as they strolled through Chester Green in Derby, using her car as a 'weapon'. As she ploughed into Mr O'Neill and Miss Kimble, one witness described Claire as 'totally expressionless and straight-faced, as though she was doing nothing wrong'. Mr Allan said several mothers with young children in pushchairs saw the horrific incident, after which Claire sped off. She handed herself in at a police station later that day. Claire, of Derby, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, which was accepted by the prosecution, but admitted two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Stuart Newsam, defending, said Claire, who has no previous convictions, had been made 'vulnerable by emotional strain' and on the day of the attack had been 'deeply upset' because Mr O'Neill had cancelled an appointment to see their son. Claire, who was also banned from driving for seven years, showed no emotion when she was sentenced. After the case, Detective Constable Annie Vernon, of Derbys Police, said: 'This is the first case I've dealt with where the weapon used was a motor vehicle as opposed to a fist or knife. In my experience it's fairly rare.'","Sonita Claire smashed into Kevin O'Neill and Mary Jane Kimble on path .

After returning from a Christmas break to Disneyworld, Joshua Boren killed Kelly Boren, 32, her mother Marie King, 55, his son Jaden, seven, and daughter Haley, five, at their home in Utah. The five bodies were discovered in bedrooms after Boren, 34, failed to turn up for a night shift. The murder victims are being laid to rest on Wednesday, while Josh will be buried on Thursday. Now friends have spoken to the Salt Lake Tribune about Mrs Boren's fears and frustrations with her husband - and how she claimed she was about to file for divorce.

Whiting asked her what she meant and Kelly said she would explain later that night at the gym - but she never showed up. The separation was nothing new, Archuleta said, explaining that in 2010, Joshua had slept on the couch for six months as Kelly considered divorcing him. Another friend, Stacy Archuleta, said that 'many other people in our community knew of these problems, and none of us dared to go to anybody'.

Circuit Judge Chet Tharpe said on Wednesday that he'll decide on a treatment facility for Joshua Hakken on March 4. He'll also examine psychological reports on Hakken's wife, Sharyn. Authorities say the couple kidnapped their two young sons from Mrs Hakken's parents last April after they lost custody following run-ins with police.

Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which could be the smaller handset. Scroll down for videos . Apple's latest iPhones: The firm is believed to be preparing to release two new large-screen phones in June . The two new handsets are expected to be revealed at Apple's annual annual developer conference, held in San Francisco in June. It is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements. If announced, the hansets are expected to go on sale within weeks. The latest claims come from Chinese analyst Sun Changxu. He told Chinese-language website QQ Tech that Apple will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes. According to Sun, the iPhone 6 will come with a 4.7-inch screen, with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels. The company would then launch a larger 5.7-inch model shortly afterwards. Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its iPhone. Concept images have emerged that show Apple's next-generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis.

SET Solution’s concept, instead, keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top. It also appears taller than Fuse Chicken’s version in order to fit the larger screen. Apple’s iPhone has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the iPhone 5S would be the first to break the 4-inch mark - but it didn't. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand. However, with main rivals Samsung, HTC and Nokia releasing phones with screens in the 5-inch region, analysts claim Apple may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the iPhone's screen size, without drastically increasing the size of the handset. In his image, the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges. However, because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident, when it’s picked up for example, the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced. According to Forbes journalist Anthony Wing Kosner: 'The only way I could see something that thin working for users, is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket.' He continued that if Apple was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest, which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis, it could also pave the way for foldable devices. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm, pictured left. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm, pictured right .

Special guest: White Dee, Deidre Kelly, surprised Nick Clegg on his radio show today and invited him to 'Benefits Street', assuring him it was not full of 'scroungers' A star of the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street surprised Nick Clegg on his weekly radio show today and told him she and her friends are not 'scroungers'. ‘White Dee’ – the self-proclaimed ‘mother of the street’ in Birmingham - told the Deputy Prime Minister the show's producers had hoodwinked them by saying it would be a 'documentary about community spirit'. The 42-year-old also invited the Liberal Democrat leader to visit for a cup of tea and said he would see a 'clean street', not the rubbish-strewn images shown on television. But she admitted she voted Labour because she was 'annoyed' his party had gone into coalition with the Tories. The five-part series has been a massive ratings success for Channel 4 but its stars have said they were betrayed and made to look like 'scumbags'. Mr Clegg admitted he had been too busy to watch it. During her surprise appearance on Call Clegg, Dee told him: 'I think it’s very cleverly edited. We had no idea it would be this big. 'They told us it was going to be a documentary about community spirit, and even though some of us are on benefits, how we get along and help eachother'. Yesterday Channel 4 was accused of exploiting children as young as seven by showing children on Benefits Street swearing and misbehaving. Critics . said it was 'utterly reprehensible' that 'distressing' scenes were . being shown where youngsters clashed with their parents. Dee was seen yelling at her tearaway seven-year-old son Gerrard . after he lost his bicycle before she shouted at him 'you're grounded'. Scroll down for video . Surprise: Nick Clegg could not hide his surprise when Dee introduced herself to him, and said that producers had hoodwinked residents . Today she told Mr Clegg James Turner Street would welcome him. 'We would love him to come to the street,' she said. 'He would see a very clean street. He would see people getting together, helping each other - not scrounging - and children at school. 'He would be very, very welcome. I am very into politics. I vote every year. I discuss with people whether they vote because I do say, if you don't vote, why are you moaning about the situation? 'The last time I voted it was Labour because I was really annoyed when . you went into coalition with the Tories, but you can win me back, Mr . Clegg. You can attempt to win me back.' Challenge: Residents of James Turner Street had a challenge ahead of them to compete in the Britain in Bloom competition . Mess: A resident shown by a pile of rubbish left on the street, but Dee maintains it is a 'clean street' Nick Clegg said there was a big debate about the welfare state going on around the country. 'We need to be quite hard-headed about that,' he said. 'But I think we have to avoid demonising whole groups of people . I think that makes it more difficult to take the difficult, tough decisions about how we continue to reform welfare'. Benefits Street has brought Channel 4 its highest ratings for more than a year. The programme has courted controversy . from the start, with the inhabitants of James Turner Street in . Birmingham saying that the producers 'did anything they could' to get . the most shocking footage. Child star: Gerrard Kelly, the seven-year-old son of 'White Dee' who appears on Benefits Street on Channel 4 but questions have been raised about whether the broadcaster got proper consent before showing the youngsters on screen . Claimant culture: On James Turner Street in Birmingham it is claimed that over 90 per cent of the residents are on benefits . Although . the people who appear on the programme were not paid for their . appearance - which could affect their ability to claim benefits - they . claim producers used gifts instead to assure their co-operation. The third episode in the series on Monday pulled in 5.2million people - the biggest audience since the . Paralympic closing ceremony. However, the programme has attracted hundreds of complaints to Ofcom from viewers. The television watchdog will wait until the end of the series before deciding whether to launch a full investigation.","'Mother of the street' said Mr Clegg should visit her for a cup of tea .

A British man who kidnapped his son from his mother in Austria has revealed he took him to his home on the Channel Islands as the local laws do not give unmarried mothers right to custody for children born out of wedlock. Millionaire lawyer Stefan Gomoll snatched . his four-year-old son Caspar and took him by private jet to the island . of Sark in October last year. Mr Gomoll has been involved in a bitter custody row with Caspar's mother Dominique Ruggaber, who is of German descent but living in Austria, where a local court awarded her sole custody last year. Taken: Four-year-old Caspar was flown to the Channel Island of Sark by his father Stefan Gomoll (right), who took the boy from a playground in Baden, Austria when Caspar's grandfather went to the bathroom . Gomoll is a Sark resident and also a chairman of the island's Finance and Commerce Committee. In October last year, he visited Ms Ruggaber, from whom he has been separated since April 2012, in Baden, Lower Austria, demanding to see Caspar. Ms Ruggaber allowed Mr Gomoll to take Caspar to a nearby playground under the premise that her father, Caspar's maternal grandfather, accompanied them. Distressed: Caspar's mother Dominique Ruggaber had been awarded sole custody by an Austrian court . However, when the older man went to the bathroom, Mr Gomoll grabbed the boy and drove to the airport where he left on a private plane before police could act to put out an alert. Once back in Sark he filed an application for custody under the islands archaic laws, which state that as he and Ms Ruggaber never married, he is entitled to sole custody. This is now to be heard at the Supreme Court in the Channel Islands, and until then the youngster has to remain in Sark. The mother's lawyer Britta SchÃ¶nhart said: 'The father has appealed the decisions which have so far been in the mother's favour, but until the final ruling nothing counts. 'Until that happens the mother and child are not allowed to leave the island. It is difficult because the financial resources are not unlimited and she now has to stay in Sark.' Mr Gomoll and Ms Ruggaber split in April 2012 and she returned to Austria to live with the child near her parents in Baden. In February last year, Ms Ruggaber returned to the Channel Islands, but left again in August after Mr Gomoll threatened to send Caspar to boarding school. Mr Gomoll faces child abduction charges in Austria and the prosecutor in Wiener Neustadt is investigating the case. As both Caspar's passports, he has joint German and British nationality, were with Ms Ruggaber when he was seized, Austrian police are also investigating how Mr Gomoll managed to get the boy onto the plane without a passport. Worried: Ms Ruggaber moved to Baden to be close to her parents, pictured, and Mr Ruggaber, Caspar's grandfather, left, was at the playground when he was taken .

Moors murderer Ian Brady was rushed to hospital after falling and breaking his hip inside his high-security facility, it was revealed today. The killer, 76, suffered two broken bones in the accident and is currently said to be in a stable condition. Brady was taken by ambulance six miles from Ashworth Hospital, in Maghull, Merseyside, to Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool. Behind bars: Ian Brady (left), 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his now-dead girlfriend Myra Hindley (right) Appeal: Ian Brady at a mental health tribunal last year when he was seen in public for the first time since the 1980s. He was appealing for the right to be released . The incident happened just days after it was claimed that the Moors Murderer may be suffering from the early stages of dementia. He was last seen in public last year at a week-long mental health tribunal as he applied to be released from custody for the first time since 1966. His case was rejected. Jackie Powell, the Moors Murderer's self-styled mental health advocate, said his behaviour had become increasingly bizarre and medical experts believed he was now seriously ill. The revelation has prompted fears that he may become unable to remember where he buried Keith Bennett, the only one of his five young victims whose remains have never been found. Brady, 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his girlfriend Myra Hindley for abducting, abusing, torturing and killing five youngsters in Manchester before burying them on nearby Saddleworth Moor. He has been held at Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Liverpool since 1985. Victim: Keith Bennett, 12, who was murdered by Ian Brady (left) and his mother Winnie who spent her life calling for the killer to reveal what he did with his son's body . Miss Powell, who has visited Brady regularly since 1999, said that during a recent meeting with him she saw signs of dementia, and believed he was nearing the end of his life. But she said that Brady would not accept that there was anything wrong and refused to undergo tests that could confirm whether he has Alzheimer's disease. Miss Powell said that Brady had withdrawn into himself, and that he now seems to be ‘waiting to die’.She also said she believed it highly unlikely he would ever reveal where Keith Bennett is buried, saying that he refuses to even discuss it. A spokesman for Ashworth Hospital confirmed that the 76-year-old has been taken to hospital. 'Ian Brady was admitted to a general hospital yesterday for . treatment for two broken bones suffered following a fall,' he said. 'He remained in hospital overnight and his condition today is stable.' Along with Hindley - who died in jail aged 60 in 2002 - Brady killed Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965.

The runaways were pictured in the same clothes they were seen in a day earlier suggesting they had not had much time to pack before making their bolt to freedom . Yesterday they were pictured having a tense-looking meal with Edward’s mother, Susannah Bunyan, who had flown out to help the search. The pair are believed to have ran up an estimated £3,000 credit card bill after they sneaked out . of  school last Monday and flying to Spain where they caught at second flight to the Caribbean. Keeping his head down: Edward Bunyan sparked an international manhunt when he sneaked out of school with girlfriend Indira Gainiyeva . They initially checked in to the Occidental Grande resort, where a week's stay costs around £1,600 and are believed to have spent . several days there quaffing cocktails and enjoying lavish meals. But as news of their escapades spread they checked in to a dingy £75-a-week apartment nearby. After . British police alerted Interpol, local officers spent days scouring 250 . miles of coastline packed with resorts. They were finally caught late on Sunday when plain clothes police found . them sitting at a beachside restaurant in the resort of Punta Cana. They had been stocking up on bread and water and dining at cheap beachside restaurants. On Tuesday Mrs Bunyan frogmarched the sheepish couple from their bolthole to a . taxi and reluctantly returned them to the luxury hotel where she had . checked in. She later accompanied them for a meeting at the police . station flanked by motorcycle outriders.

A new record-breaking atomic clock is so precise it neither loses nor gains a second in five billion years - longer than the age of the Earth. The 'strontium lattice clock' is 50% more accurate than the previous record holder, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantum logic clock. It is also incredibly stable, in that each tick matches the duration of every other. The watch of the future? US scientists say the 'strontium lattice clock' is 50% more accurate than the previous record holder, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantum logic clock. Atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels. In the strontium lattice clock, a few thousand atoms of strontium are held in a column of laser optical traps. Scientists detect the clock's 'ticks' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light. The precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels. The clock, described in the journal Nature, was developed in the US at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA), by a team from NIST and the University of Colorado. Group leader Dr Jun Ye said: 'We already have plans to push the performance even more. 'So in this sense, even this new Nature paper represents only a 'mid-term' report.

Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, both in South London, are accused of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. They appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court today and are next due at Isleworth Crown Court on February 5. Following the death of Daniel Spargo-Mabbs (right), Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk (left), 20, from Beckenham, both in South London, are accused of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs . The pair, along with another . 19-year-old man who has been bailed until March, were arrested after . Daniel died from a suspected drugs overdose after going to an illegal . rave. It is believed the teenager fell unconscious after taking ecstasy at the party at an industrial site in Hayes, West London. Paramedics were called at around 4am on Saturday and he was taken to hospital and put on life support, but died on Monday. His father, who along with his wife is a devoted Christian, warned yesterday: ‘It could happen to anyone.’ Speaking at the family home in Croydon, Tim Spargo-Mabbs, 50, described his son as ‘a lovely, mercurial kid’. He said: ‘He was up for adventure. He was a really normal kid. He spent a bunch of his spare time with his girlfriend and played a lot on his Xbox. ‘This was the first time he’d taken anything and if it could happen to him it could happen to anyone. We very much want to get that message across.’ Mr Spargo-Mabbs added that Daniel’s girlfriend, a fellow pupil at Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England High School in Croydon, was ‘traumatised’ by his death. Final words: The schoolboy, pictured left, told his mother, pictured right, 'I love you, I promise I won't die' as he left home on Friday night - just hours before he was taken to hospital suffering from a drugs overdose . His mother Fiona said she would always hug and kiss her two sons, Daniel and his brother Jacob, before they left the house. She . told reporters: ‘Danny always used to say, “I love you too mum, I . promise I won’t die”. And that’s exactly what he said when he went out . on Friday.’ They were the . last words he ever said to her. The next time his parents saw him he was . in intensive care after taking ecstasy for the first time at an illegal . rave. The 16-year-old had suffered a massive heart attack and died two days later. His . Oxford-educated mother Fiona, 46, who works as a manager in adult . education at Croydon Council, said Daniel had never taken drugs before . and had been lectured by his parents and school about the scourge of . ecstasy. On Friday night . the bright student, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England . School in Croydon, which is known for its high academic standards, . persuaded his mother to let him go to a party in Clapham, South London, . saying: ‘Come on, Mum, I hardly ever go to parties and I am sensible and . responsible.’ But instead of the party he went to an illegal rave on an industrial estate in Hayes, West London. Aid: Daniel was taken to hospital on Saturday believed to be suffering from the effects of a drugs overdose . In a warehouse, owned . by a commercial cleaning firm and said to be packed with 3,000 . revellers, his parents believe he experimented with ecstasy for the . first time. Shortly . afterwards the youngster collapsed and was taken to hospital. His . reaction to the drug sent his temperature rocketing to 42C (107.6F), . causing a massive heart attack. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs recalled how she had kissed her son goodbye for the last time hours before he took the substance. ‘A . few years ago I heard a talk by murder victim Jimmy Mizen’s mum and she . said that something that comforted her was that she had told Jimmy she . loved him and had given him a hug and a kiss before he had left the . house,’ she said. Place of education: Daniel was a pupil at Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School in Croydon . ‘After that I always did the same . with my boys and it became an in-joke. Danny always used to say “I love . you too, Mum. I promise I won’t die.” ‘And that’s exactly what he said when he went out on Friday. He didn’t keep that promise.’ Speaking . at the family’s home in Croydon, South London, which she shares with . her husband Tim, 50, and son Jacob, 18, she added: ‘I  woke up early on . Saturday morning and when I saw he wasn’t back I started to worry. ‘Then at about 5.30am there was a knock on the door. It was the police. It was completely my worst nightmare coming true.’ The . family rushed to Hillingdon Hospital where Daniel was in intensive . care. He was transferred to a specialist liver unit at King’s College . Hospital for emergency surgery but he died on Monday. 'We grieve together': Daniel was praised by his headteacher as a 'bright, articulate and talented' boy . Deaths involving ecstasy have increased almost four-fold in recent years. In 2012 there were 31 deaths linked to the class A drug, up from eight in 2010. There . was also a large increase in the number of death certificates . mentioning PMA or PMMA, strong psychedelic stimulants usually found in . ecstasy pills. The . substances, which can cause severe overheating of the body, were linked . to only one death in 2011, but in 2012 they were involved in 20 . fatalities. Campaigners believe many people may be ingesting PMA or PMMA in the belief they are taking ecstasy tablets. According . to government estimates, around 2.8million Britons have tried ecstasy . at least once and 179,000 people take it at least once a month. It is usually sold as tablets but the powder form, MDMA, has become more common.","Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, are accused of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs .

Former England footballer Stan Collymore has hit out at Twitter for failing to act against internet trolls tweeting racist and sexist abuse - and even death threats. The star, now a pundit on Talksport radio, claims the web giant has not done enough to crack down on the vile messages he has received from trolls as young as 10 years old. Staffordshire Police are now investigating the threats after Mr Collymore passed on the tweets to officers - but Twitter has refused to comment on the case, saying that users can report abuse whenever it occurs. Outspoken: Stan Collymore has accused Twitter of not doing enough to tackle racist and abusive messages . The ex-Liverpool striker, who also played for Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, claims he has repeatedly been subjected to online racism since joining Twitter. Yesterday he tweeted: 'I accuse Twitter directly of not doing enough to combat racist/homophobic/sexist hate messages, all of which are illegal in the UK. 'In the last 24 hours I've been threatened with murder several times, demeaned on my race, and many of these accounts are still active. Why?' The 43-year-old then shared a number of appalling messages he was sent after criticising Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, with some web users calling him the N-word and using offensive racial stereotypes. Anger: The former footballer blames the U.S.-based web giant for failing to stop the flood of vile messages . Claims: Mr Collymore has repeatedly been targeted by racist trolls and has even received death threats . Appearing on BBC1's Breakfast programme this morning, Mr Collymore said: 'The age user range of Twitter has gone down dramatically. 'I am seeing gangs of kids from 10 to 18 goaded by adults to make racist and homophobic and sexist insults on Twitter, so Twitter need to deal with it. It's quite horrific. 'Today's my birthday and I would rather not be here but I am going to try to talk about this issue. Nothing seems to be done. Twitter are now hiding behind, ""We don't discuss individual cases."" 'If it's illegal I reserve the right as a United Kingdom citizen to live within the laws of the United Kingdom, and so should Twitter.' Asked how he responded to the abusive messages, the ex-footballer said: 'I retweet, I report, I block and if it is sufficiently threatening, I will go to the police. Abuse: Police have launched an investigation over this message, which Mr Collymore retweeted to his followers . Call to action: Mr Collymore has received dozens of messages of support from his followers . 'I have been on it for six years now and it's a fantastic tool to engage in my sport, football, with fans. 'If you disagree with a point that I make it's absolutely fine. But I shouldn't be racially abused for it, I shouldn't have somebody that tweets me two days ago saying I am going to turn up at your house and murder you.' When Mr Collymore appeared on BBC News today, a presenter suggested that trolls had targeted him because he had 'been on the wrong side of the law' in the past. The star hit back against that claim, saying: 'I've never been convicted of anything other than speeding, so maybe you'd like to retract that.' The ex-footballer's personal life frequently made headlines during his career - he broke up with TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson after punching her in a bar, and was once caught dogging - but he has never been implicated in a crime. He added: 'Regardless of what the perception of me as a character is, I have the right to be able to walk down the road, and if someone calls me the N-word to be able to report it and get it to dealt with.

Ed Balls prides himself on being a political heavyweight, but the BBC seem to have taken the idea a bit too literally. The Corporation used a picture of Labour’s shadow chancellor with his belly hanging out to illustrate a story on the health benefits of playing football. The BBC had the grace to crop his head off, but one of the most famous ‘squeezed middles’ in Westminster was quickly spotted. Whoops: The BBC used this cropped picture of Ed Balls for a story on the health benefits of football . The tweet used this picture of Ed Balls warming up for a football match against journalists in 2008 . A study in The Lancet found that playing football is a good way for men to lose weight. When 374 men took part in a 12-week programme of training sessions at a local football club, they had lost and kept off 11lb a year later. The BBC would usually use a generic stock image of an overweight man to illustrate the story. But instead a reporter chose the snap of Mr Balls, warming up for a game of football in 2008. Despite being cropped at the neck, Mr Balls’ green shorts and white shirt made the stomach all too identifiable. Aides to the shadow chancellor brushed off the apparent gibe, insisting he was too busy training for a marathon to complain . Aides to the shadow chancellor laughed off the apparent gibe at their boss: ‘He is too busy training for his third marathon to complain.’ However, BBC insiders suggested the gaffe had not gone down well with bosses keen to avoid accusations of political bias. A BBC spokesman said: ‘In retrospect, we accept it would have been better to use a picture that was completely unrecognisable to the public. ‘However we've had no complaints from Ed Balls' office about the use of the image.’","Corporation cropped picture of Labour heavyweight playing football .

Disgraced Vicky Pryce who was jailed for taking the speeding points of ex-husband Chris Huhne has been hired as an adviser to the government. The respected economist whose dramatic downfall culminated in her being jailed and even losing an honour from the Queen is now back working alongside Business Secretary Vince Cable on how to maintain growth. It marks a surprise return to Whitehall for the 62-year-old who has maintained close friendships with senior Liberal Democrats. Vicky Pryce, the ex-wife of former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, is advising Vince Cable on the economy . Far from disappearing from the limelight, the former head of the government economic service wrote a book - Prisonomics - on the economic and human cost of keeping women locked up. In March last year Miss Pryce was convicted of perverting the course of justice along with Huhne after it emerged she had taken three speeding points to stop him losing his licence in 2003. She served 62 days of an eight-month prison sentence. However, she has remained good friends with Mr Cable who has appointed her to a panel of experts advising ministers on the state of the economy. With little fanfare, Miss Pryce returned to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills this week for an unpaid role on the ‘Monitoring The Economy’ panel. A spokesman said: ‘The panel debates and discusses macroeconomic issues and Ms Pryce has attended in her capacity as a highly regarded economist over the past ten years, including as chief economist for the department.' Miss Pryce and her former husband Chris Huhne (left) were jailed in March last year, but she has remained friends with Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable who has now appointed her to his 'Monitoring The Economy' panel . The panel sees economists and external experts sit alongside company bosses and civil servants from the Treasury and BIS. It meets three or four times a year to advise Mr Cable. Miss Pryce used to be the head of the economic service under the Labour government, but stepped down when her then-husband Mr Huhne became Energy Secretary as the coalition was formed. She split from the Lib Dem Cabinet minister after he had an affair with his press officer, Carina Trimingham. It led to a bitter and very public feud between the former couple, culminating in revelations that Mr Huhne had asked his wife to take three speeding points for him in 2003. Her subsequent conviction and jail sentence saw her stripped of her official honour, the Companion of the Order of the Bath. A BIS source told The Times: ‘As a distinguished economist, she continued to be part of this panel after leaving the department. “She has now resumed her unpaid position as part of this panel after serving her sentence, which in no way brought into question her ability or judgment as an economist.”","Economist jailed last year has been hired by Lib Dem Business Secretary .

Some of America's best selling small cars  - including the Ford Fiesta, Fiat 500 and Toyota Prius  - have folded under high-speed crash tests. Most of the best selling mini models across America - including the Fit, the Versa, Mitsubishi Mirage and Hyundai Accent - were branded  'poor' or 'marginal' in the U.S. tests. None of the 12 minicars tested got the highest rating of 'good' from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, making them the 'worst performing group of any evaluated so far.' Some of America's best selling small cars  - including the Ford Fiesta - have folded under frontal crash tests . The Toyota Prius was among a number of cars given a 'poor' rating in tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . All of the cars were from the 2013 or 2014 model years. The Chevrolet Spark was the only car that earned the second-highest rating of 'acceptable' in the frontal crash tests. Six of the cars - including best-seller, the Nissan Versa - got the lowest rating of 'poor.' The institute's small overlap test, which was introduced in 2012, mimics what happens when a car's front corner collides with another vehicle or an object like a utility pole. Joe Nolan, IIHS's . senior vice president for vehicle research, said: 'Small, lightweight vehicles have an . inherent safety disadvantage. That's why it's even more important to . choose one with the best occupant protection.' In the test, 25 percent of a vehicle's front end on the driver's side strikes a rigid barrier at 40 mph. The test differs from the U.S. government's frontal crash test, in which a car strikes a rigid barrier head-on at 35 mph. IIHS says hitting only part of the front end makes it harder for cars to manage the energy from a crash. In several of the subcompacts, the structures collapsed, which can exacerbate injuries because the air bags, seats and other parts get knocked out of position. In the test of the Honda Fit, for example, the steering column pushed so far into the vehicle that the dummy's head slid off the air bag and hit the instrument panel. IIHS said the Fit was one of the worst performers in terms of potential injuries to the driver. Cars with 'marginal' ratings included the Kia Rio. Most of the best selling mini models across America were branded  'poor' or 'marginal' in the U.S. test . Honda responded that the 2015 Fit, which goes on sale in a few months, should earn a top score on the small offset test. The recently redesigned Honda Civic, which is one size up from the Fit, is among five small cars with 'good' ratings on the test. A four-door Civic is around 300 pounds heavier and 18 inches longer than the current four-door Fit. The current Fit does get top scores in the institute's other four tests, including measurements of roof strength and side impact protection. IIHS said the Fiat 500 was also one of the worst performers. The crash force ripped the door hinges off the 500, causing it to fall open during the test. Spokesman Eric Maybe said the Fiat 500 meets all government safety requirements and, like the Fit, gets 'good' ratings in all four of the institute's other crash tests. Cars with 'marginal' ratings were the Kia Rio, Mazda2, Toyota Yaris and Ford Fiesta. Cars with 'poor' ratings - in addition to the Fit, the Fiat 500 and the Versa - were the Toyota Prius C, Mitsubishi Mirage and Hyundai Accent.","Most of best-selling mini models across America crushed in frontal tests .

James Edward Maxwell, 41, has been jailed after admitting 17 counts of fraud - he promised clients meetings with celebrities and luxury holidays . A conman who lured people into handing over tens of thousands of pounds for bogus meetings with famous people has been jailed for fraud. James Edward Maxwell, 41, from Sittingbourne, Kent, swindled clients out of £750,000 by offering them deals where they could attend high-profile sporting events and meet their heroes. A gambling addict, he tricked dozens of customers into paying for 'dream encounters' with celebrities, as well as luxury holidays and investment deals, but none of the promises ever came to fruition. Maxwell, who helped run The Autograph Store and Sports Idols, based in Sittingbourne, and also set up Premier Signings and Hospitality Ltd, was jailed on Friday after admitting 17 counts of fraud. Maidstone Crown Court heard that when customers complained, Maxwell spun even more lies, claiming his young son had a rare form of bone cancer and saying he himself had testicular cancer. Detective Constable Steve Payne said Maxwell spun a 'staggering . web of lies' in an attempt to pay for his gambling habit. He said: 'He betrayed dozens of people with his fraud when it emerged the deals he was offering were simply too good to be true.' Maxwell's offers included flights and . five star hotels, packages for the Monaco and British Grand Prix, and accommodation on a super-yacht . owned by motorsport tycoon Eddie Jordan. He . falsely claimed he could offer bargains at cost price because he had . ‘connections’ with celebrities, telling them: 'It’s not what you know in . this business, it’s who.' Customers . would be told days before that the yacht had been double-booked or the . deal had been cancelled, only for Maxwell to promise to invest their . money into another package. The swindler made up other aliases to protect his own reputation, and manipulated friends and customers into investing into his businesses by . saying he had ‘cash flow’ troubles. Court: Maxwell was jailed for three years, four months at Maidstone Crown Court after admitting fraud . He . then spent the money on his gambling habit or luxury holidays for his family. Clients grew suspicious after Maxwell made repeated excuses, or got his aliases muddled up, the court was told, but when . challenged, he would seek his clients' sympathies by telling them his father had just died, or spinning lies about cancer. Detectives, who were alerted by some of Maxwell's clients, discovered he had a gambling problem and had been spending up to £1,000 of his victims’ money feeding his habit in a single day. Maxwell was jailed for three years and four months, and was also disqualified from holding any limited company position for ten years.","James Edward Maxwell, 41, from Sittingbourne, promised bogus meetings .

The book, entitled The Lawes of Resolutions of Women's Rights: or the Lawes, Provision for Women, was compiled by Thomas Edgar and sold by John Grove in 1632 . The first ever English book of women’s rights, written in the 17th century, is set to go under the hammer. The revolutionary read is the first book in English to compile laws on the rights of women and is expected to fetch over £3,000 when it reaches sale. The book, entitled The Lawes Of Resolutions Of Women’s Rights: or The Lawes, Provision for Women, was compiled by Thomas Edgar and sold by John Grove in 1632. The work features the laws and rights applicable to women including issues such as divorce, polygamy, marriage and rape. It features such intriguing chapters as 'What Persons Women May Not Marry', 'The Baron May Beat His Wife' and 'Of Wooing'. In the radical text Thomas Edgar said: 'The Theme, as the subject, is, The Lawes Resolutions of Womens Rights; which comprehend all our Lawes concerning Women, either Children in government or nurture of their Parents or Gardians, Mayds, Wives, and Widowes, and their goods, inheritances, and other estates. 'Women have nothing to do in constituting Lawes, or consenting to them, in interpreting of Lawes, or in hearing them interpreted at lectures, leets or charges, and yet they stand strictly tyed to mens establishments, little or nothing excused by ignorance. 'Mee thinkes it were pitty and impiety any longer to hold from them such Customes, Lawes, and Statutes, as are in a maner proper, or principally belonging unto them.' The idea of a pastor defending polygamy, and subjugating women in marriage seems bizarre now . The book will be sold at Bonhams Auctioneers on March 5th as part of the sale of rare and historic European law books from the collection of the Los Angeles County Law Library. Head of Bonhams Book Department in the UK, Matthew Haley, said: 'Marriage in one form or another has, of course, been a central institution of human societies for thousands of years so it is not surprising to find so many books dedicated to laws about it. 'Some of the preoccupations, however, do seem strange to modern eyes - the idea of a 17th century Lutheran pastor issuing a defence of polygamy is odd today but this was a live issue for Christian commentators during and after the Reformation. 'Both Luther and Milton, for example, were defenders of the practice.'","The Lawes of Resolutions Of Women's Rights written by Thomas Edgar .

Guilty plea: Michelle Roberts, 45, stole bank cards, vouchers and cash from her 'vulnerable' relatives at a wake . A thief broke down into tears in court as she admitted stealing cash, bank cards and vouchers from relatives at her uncle's wake. Michelle Roberts, 45, admitted four counts of theft and three counts of fraud at Basildon Crown Court, Essex, on Monday.

She . also ordered £270 worth of goods from Asda online, which included two . mobile phones and an iPod dock, which was discovered by police at her . Ascot Road home in Gravesend. The . court heard that when Roberts was arrested she blamed the thefts on her . partner, who was found later to have nothing to do with the crime. In a lengthy police interview after her arrest in April 2012 she also admitted to spending the John Lewis vouchers. Tony Abelle, prosecuting, told the court that Roberts hadn’t seen some of her family for 25 years before attending the service. He said: 'She was seen by a family member hunched over a handbag in the living room, rifling through it. 'The lady didn’t think anything of it till later when she discovered her bag open, her car keys on the window sill and her son’s library card hidden behind a cushion. 'The defendant was also seen trying to distract people by telling them to look at old photos so they would come away from their handbags.' Roberts was also heard asking for people’s addresses and dates of birth. Members . of the family became suspicious about her behaviour and in the . following days discovered items were missing.

Each of the 650 482-foot tall wind turbines are clearly visible as white dots sitting in the silt generated where the Thames meets the North Sea . The London Array is an off-shore wind farm in the Thames Estuary. It is located approximately 12 miles (20km) from the Kent and Essex coasts. The farm has a maximum generating power of 630 megawatts, enough to supply as many as 500,000 homes. It . has been fully operational since 8 April, 2013 and the turbines are spread over 40 square miles with each generator sitting between 2,100 and 3,900ft apart.

It has been fully operational since April 8, 2013 and this recently published image was taken 20 days after its launch, showing the massive scale of the site. According to Nasa's Earth Observatory, the turbines are spread over 40 square miles with each generator sitting between 2,100 and 3,900ft apart. Each is connected by cables buried under the seafloor, and power is transmitted to two substations offshore and to an onshore station at Cleve Hill near Graveney, on the north coast of Kent. With construction operations working out of Ramsgate, the Array is eventually supposed to grow to 95 square miles.

It has been fully operational since April 8th last year and this recently published image was taken 20 days later showing the massive scale of the site in Kent . The wind farm sits on two natural sandbanks, with water as deep as 80 feet (25m). The site was chosen because of its proximity to onshore electric power infrastructure and because it stays out of the main shipping lanes through the area. Promoters of the London Array project believe that it will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tons, equal to the emissions of 300,000 automobiles. Critics of the project and its second phase are concerned that the wind farm will decimate the population of red-throated divers and other bird species.
