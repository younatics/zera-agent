President Barack Obama has said South Sudan 'stands on the precipice' of civil war as conflict in the country enters its sixth day. The US has sent 45 troops to the young state to protect its embassy in the capital of Juba, which has seen at least 500 people killed in violence so far. In a statement the President said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people. The US President has warned that South Sudan's 'great progress' towards breaking the cycle of violence in the country could be undone by this latest spate of fighting (file picture) On Sunday President Salva Kiir said that troops loyal to his ousted Vice President Riek Machar opened fire on a government meeting in an attempted coup . 'In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history. 'Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past.' The State Department has issued a warning to US citizens in the country that they should leave immediately, and has evacuated all non-emergency government personnel. Elsewhere South Sudan government officials have said that rebels are in control of the town of Bor, 125 miles north of the capital, and that the military is using heavy artillery. The conflict began on Sunday when . troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire . at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir from . power. Machar was sacked . along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he . was going to contest the 2015 general election. Fears that fighting could spread into . all-out civil war stem from the fact that Kiir is from the minority . Dinka ethnic group, while Machar is a Nuer. Around . 20,000 South Sudanese are now sheltering in UN camps, with the Akobo . base being attacked yesterday with the possible death of civilians. Fighting has now spread to Bor, 125 miles north of Juba, the capital, and the military are using heavy artillery . Since the fighting started Kiir has imposed a night time curfew and has arrested ten former ministers . As well as drawing the attention of the US President, the conflict has also concerned neighbouring African states including Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda who have sent mediators to attempt to find a resolution. In a statement on Thursday, Kiir said he was willing to talk to anyone who would listen, but that he was unsure what the possible outcome could be. Since the fighting began Kiir has imposed an all night curfew and arrested ten former government ministers. Machar is thought to be in hiding, and has previously dismissed the coup attempt as a disagreement between presidential guards. South Sudan became an independent nation in 2011, and since then has struggled to establish a stable government with many active armed groups across the country.","Barack Obama has warned that South Sudan could be starting a civil war .

A storm with a 2,000-mile footprint threatened to frustrate Christmas travelers from Texas to Nova Scotia with a mix of freezing rain, ice and snow, flooding, thunderstorms and possibly some tornadoes. Some of the millions of people hitting the roads and airports Saturday squeaked through before any major weather hit, but as the afternoon wore on some cancellations and delays started to mount at major aviation hubs. Forecasters said roads that are passable one minute could become treacherous the next as a cold blast on the back end of the storm turns rain to ice and snow. Winter Wonderland: Ice storms were expected to wreak havoc on travel in Midwestern states . Winter Storm Gemini is the seventh named storm of the year . Whiteout? Freezing rain on Friday morning snarled traffic and forced some school closures in Michigan and Wisconsin. The states were bracing for significant snow, sleet and ice . Making it harder for forecasters to . stay a step ahead, the system, dubbed 'Gemini,' was a weird swirl of wintry and . spring-like weather as it passed over areas in the Midwest with freezing . temperatures and places like Nashville, where it could surpass 70 . degrees. Temperatures in New York City are also expected to approach the 70-degree mark Sunday, but by tomorrow night, the storm systems . will be hammering the East Coast. Some New England and mid-Atlantic . states could see rare winter thunderstorms. ‘This . is a particularly strong storm with very warm, near record-breaking . temperatures in the East and very cold air in the Midwest, and that . contrast is the sort of conditions that are favorable for not only . winter weather but also tornadoes,’ said National Weather Service . meteorologist Ed Danaher in College Park, Maryland.

Flight cancellations were creeping up above 400 around the country, according to aviation tracking website FlightAware.com, and there were more than 1,000 flight delays. Most . of the disruptions were affecting flights in and out of major hubs like . O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, though the weather there was . not yet nasty.

The WPC National Forecast Charts provide an overview of expected weather for up to the next three days, with emphasis on certain hazardous and significant weather . Travel trouble: Flight cancellations were creeping up above 400 around the country, especially in major hubs like O'Hare International Airport in Chicago . It's bad timing for the estimated 94.5million Americans planning to travel by road or air during this holiday season, which runs from Saturday through January 1, and those hitting the roads for some last-minute shopping. The storm had several bands of strikingly different weather. In the Upper Midwest, forecasters expected 6-8 inches of snow north and west of Chicago and into Wisconsin. It . was already bringing significant ice accumulations to Oklahoma, . southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, splitting trees and snapping . power lines. That was expected to change over to snow by Saturday night. Parts . of Maine could get more than a half-inch coating of ice, which would . make roads treacherous and cause widespread power outages. ‘The . best advice for everyone is just to really pay attention.

While . the Midwest and Plains were preparing for ice and snow, residents down .

A tornado outbreak on Christmas Day 2012 reached from northeastern Texas through central Alabama - one twister hit Mobile, Ala. A tornado on December 16, 2000, killed 11 people in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The area most threatened stretched from central and northeastern Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and southeast Missouri, where 80 mph wind gusts and flash flooding were possible. Rain and ice in Oklahoma were blamed for two fatal traffic accidents and thousands of power outages. A 16-year-old boy died early Saturday after his car crashed and overturned on U.S. 64 near Tulsa, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. And Oklahoma City police said a woman was killed Friday night in a collision on a slick roadway. Forecasters said up to a half-inch of ice could accumulate across the middle of the state. A woman sleeping in a hotel in Holland in western Michigan was injured when a motorist lost control of his car on an icy street early Friday and slammed into the wall outside her room, MLive.com reported. The weather wasn't the only headache maker. A baggage-equipment breakdown lasted for hours at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, creating a backed-up line of travelers that stretched onto the sidewalk outside one of the terminals. If there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year, AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter said. ‘When a holiday falls on a Wednesday it gives travelers more flexibility of either leaving the weekend before, or traveling right before the holiday and extending the trip through the following weekend,’ Hunter said.

Britain is 'a nation of porkers' eating themselves into an early grave, a leading diabetes expert has claimed. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live this morning, Professor Craig Currie from the Cardiff University said that Britons are refusing to take responsibility for their weight and the health consequences that go with it. He said: 'Essentially we are nation of lazy . porkers. At a very young age we are getting a disease which could lead . to a number of very severe complications. Fat Britain: Dr Craig Currie believes that despite knowing the risks, Britons are continuing to gain weight and refusing to take measures to prevent the complications . The Professor believes the number of people under 40 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over the last 20 years has almost trebled. 'For every hundred cases 20 years ago there now would be 300 cases. In people under 40 years old for every 100 cases 20 years ago you'd get 600 cases.' Dr Currie believes that despite knowing the risks, Britons are continuing to gain weight and refusing to take measures to prevent the resulting complications. 'You've got to have lived on Mars if you don't realise that being fat is going to cause you a few problems,' he said. 'There are things people won't discuss, such as if you're overweight your body won't work.' 'If you get diabetes at a young age you are going to get a lot of vascular problems, you'll be popping pills for a long time if you're not careful.' It is possible to develop type 2 diabetes and not be obese, but says Dr Currie, 'the vast majority of people are what is called insulin resistant which develops because we are eating too much. 'The body's natural reaction is to defend itself to become insulin resistant and we become fatter and fatter.' If you're obese when you're young, it can lead to severe complications later on, says Professor Craig Currie . 'Normally when people get type 2 diabetes they are an older age and it can lead to large vessel disease, heart attacks, strokes and cancer. 'But when you have sugar problems for many years you get micro vascular complications: diseases of the eye, kidney and peripheral neuropathy, so essentially you can get renal failure and blindness.' 'People who are getting it much younger will have sugar problems for a much longer period, so are more likely to get these types of problems - and considerable premature mortality.' 'They're going to lose quite a few years off their life expectancy.' The professor added that young people with type 2 diabetes are a heavy burden on the NHS. 'If you get diabetes, you cost a fortune. You're double or treble your average cost per year. 'You look at the US and a lot of Western countries and we're all just getting fatter and fatter. 'If you are a porker when you're young and you get diabetes, you're storing up bother. 'It seems so futile that we know about these things but we don't do anything about it.' The number diagnosed with diabetes has risen by more than a third since 2006. One in 20 Britons now suffer from diabetes as a result of soaring obesity rates, a recent study found. Nine . out of ten people with diabetes have type 2, which occurs when the body . gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, which can damage . the organs and lead to years of ill health. It . is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or . obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet. Barbara . Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘We are hugely concerned . that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes has reached three . million for the first time and there is no reason to think this will . mark the end of what has been a rapid rise.'","Prof Craig Currie says cases of type 2 diabetes have trebled in past 20 years .

Exclusion zones could be set up around tourist hotspots and major public areas to stop an expected surge of Roma migrants sleeping rough and harassing passers-by with aggressive begging, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. New powers called Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) which come into operation next April will be deployed to stop gangs of homeless Eastern Europeans squatting around some of the country’s most famous landmarks and transport hubs. The move comes as Bulgarians and Romanians are handed unrestricted working rights in the UK from January 1, prompting fears that up to 50,000 people from those countries will come here every year for the next five years. Police have been given new powers to enforce a rough sleeping 'exclusion zone' around tourist hotspots in London . The new powers could be used to create no-go areas around Marble Arch, Park Lane and Victoria  Station – scenes of an 18-month fight to remove Roma squatters. This proposal has been backed by Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, who favours using the PSPOs to create an extensive no-go zone around Victoria Station, including Westminster Cathedral. And he predicted that with the expected rise in immigration, other councils around the country would follow suit. ‘I hope that come January 1 we’re not going to have a major problem with Romanians and Bulgarians, but I think it could be quite a big problem,’ he said. ‘And it won’t be just a problem for Central London, it will apply to other parts of the country. It could become a major issue of social unrest, if we are not careful.’ Ironically Mr Field’s remarks come as he warns the Prime Minister not to ‘bang on’ about immigration because it would alienate minority ethnic voters. But he said there was no contradiction between calling for sensible measures to combat antisocial behaviour and getting the tone right on immigration. Councillor Nickie Aiken, head of community protection at Westminster Council, said it had struggled to stop 50-strong groups of Romanians setting up camp. And she added: ‘We’ve got a major problem now.’ Preventative measures: The new powers could be used to create a no-go area around Victoria Station in London - the scene of an 18-month fight to remove Roma squatters . David Longstaff, head of safety at Barnet Council in North London, said he would consider using PSPOs. His comments come after a group of 68 Romanians were evicted from a vermin-infested camp set up on a local football pitch in June. He said: ‘It is a major concern  in residents’ minds that there’s going to be a major influx again.’ But a Westminster Council Spokesperson insisted no plans have yet been put in place to use PSPOS. She said: 'Westminster Council is not planning to create 'exclusion' zones around Victoria. This piece of legislation will not come into effect until April 2014 and we will consider our options then.' Paul Carter, leader of Kent County Council, said there had been a rise in aggressive begging, particularly coming up to Christmas. He predicted PSPOs would ‘undoubtedly’ be used to target anti-social behaviour. Mr Carter said: ‘We do have significant pockets where migrants are presenting some problems. These powers will be exceedingly useful.’ A spokesman for the Home Office said PSPOs – part of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill currently going through Parliament – would speed up councils’ ability to stamp  out problems. He added: ‘We are bringing in new, fast and adaptable powers to make it quicker and easier for local authorities to protect their communities while protecting the freedoms of law-abiding people.’","Tourist hotspots in London could be protected by new 'no-go' zones .

Workers at Poundland have slammed their Christmas bonus as 'miserly' after bosses offered them a 10 per cent store discount. The offer gives them just 10p off each item at the bargain chain. But remarkably it excludes festive treats such as fizzy drinks and chocolate - and expires on January 7. 'Miserly' offer: Workers at Poundland have slammed their Christmas bonus of a 10 per cent store discount . In contrast, staff at other major retailers, such as BHS and Marks & Spencer, are granted a 20 per cent discount throughout the year. It comes after Poundland celebrated the opening its 500th store last month - with annual gross revenues of nearly £1billion. Europe's biggest single-price value retailer has seen sales surge by 15 per cent in the last year alone as cash-strapped shoppers seek out bargains on the high street. Bosses say they plan to more than double the number of UK stores to over 1,000 - with at least 50 earmarked for next year. Issue: Rob Johnston, of the TUC (pictured), said the bonus was indicative of a wider problem in the economy . More than 12,000 Poundland workers were informed about their Christmas bonus by letter. One employee - who does not wish to be named - said: 'It is totally disrespectful - a slap in the face for staff who . have been coming in day in day out. 'A lot of people just ripped the letter up and put it in the bin. 'Poundland has just opened its 500th store and is one of the biggest shops in England. It is disgraceful.' The TUC's Rob Johnston said the bonus was indicative of a wider problem in the economy. 'While the Government is talking about recovery, working people aren't seeing the benefits,' he said. 'In the run-up to Christmas, the least you can expect is for companies to reward staff and stop being miserly. 'This . is not an isolated case and is indicative of a broader problem of the . economy turning a corner, but workers not getting the benefit.' However, a Poundland spokesman defended the bonus - claiming it would help make the festive season 'even more affordable'.

Experts are investigating why the vintage Tiger Moth plane being flown by Alex 'Jimmy' Rae, 26, plummeted in to the water during an aerobatic flight. Mr Rae, who recently married wife Alice, was killed along with 21 year-old French passenger Taissia Umenc. Tragic: Alex Rae, 26, from Easingwold, North Yorks had recently married his wife Alice. He died on Monday off South Stradbroke Island, Queensland . Australian media have reported that Alex - originally from Easingwold, North Yorks., but living in Australia - radioed base before the accident saying: 'Conducting aerobatics over 3,500 feet' but then there was silence. Pieces of the plane, including parts of the propeller and its ID badge, subsequently washed up on to a beach after the accident off South Stradbroke Island, Queensland, on Monday. In a statement released through Australian police, Alice, who met her husband when they were both pupils at Easingwold School, said he died 'doing what he loved'. Investigation: Mr Rae was killed along with 21 year-old French passenger Taissia Umenc . She added: 'On behalf of all Jimmy's family and friends, we would like to thank everyone for their support and well wishes.' Tributes have also been paid to talented boxer Mr Rae in the Gold Coast boxing community, where he used to train . A statement released by flight organisers Tiger Moth Joy Rides said: 'Our hearts go out to the family of the international visitor who has tragically lost her life. 'As a small tight-knit community we are devastated by the death of Jimmy Rae who was an experienced pilot with a passion for flying. 'Jimmy was an outstanding person who connected extremely well with his passengers and the rest of the team.' The company has voluntarily suspended its operations while the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and Queensland Police investigate the crash. Wayne Nicholson, a teacher at Easingwold School, who taught Alex graphic design and kept in touch with him after he left school, said: 'Whatever he got involved in, he was passionate about and gave it his all. He was interested in travelling and experiencing the world.' Assistant head teacher John Butcher said: 'He was a popular student and the school is very sorry to hear of his death.

"By . Jenny Wood . PUBLISHED: . 16:52 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:25 EST, 30 May 2013 . Going through my wardrobe recently, I found a pile of brightly coloured bikinis languishing in a drawer. They can go straight to the charity shop, I thought glumly, stuffing them into a bin bag. When I gave birth to my little boy 18 months ago, I gained something else as well - a wobbly belly, or, as it’s affectionately known, a ‘mum tum’. So, I was pretty sure my bikini-wearing days were over. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate my body. Long walks with a buggy, breastfeeding and running after a toddler have actually helped me lose more than the three stone I put on during pregnancy. But, while the rest of me has slowly shrunk back into shape, my tummy hasn’t followed suit. Wearing anything body-hugging  still fills me with fear. Scroll down for video of a You Hoop class . Hula happy: Jenny Wood learmt how to use the hoop to get in shape . I’d love to have abs like Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis. And, it would seem, I’m not alone. In a recent survey of 3,000 women, 58 per cent said their stomach was the body part they most wished they could change. The problem is, like most people with children or busy lives, I can’t spend hours in the gym or afford to hire a personal trainer. But now, thanks to the latest celebrity fitness craze, I may have found an unlikely solution: hula hooping. ‘I’m all about hula-hooping right now!’ tweeted Kelly Osbourne recently. ‘Five mins in the morning, five mins at night ... in five days I lost two inches from my waistline!’ Michelle Obama, who can apparently hula while kneeling, Grace Jones, who hooped throughout her Queen’s Diamond Jubilee performance last year, and Beyoncé have all credited the humble hoop for their fantastic figures. If they can do it, I reckon, so can I. So I arrange to meet hula hooping expert Anna Drury, 30, at a gym in South London. Anna first picked up a hoop in 2006 after seeing them used in a performance at a music festival. Noticeable difference: Jenny before the challenge, left, and, right, 5lb lighter with a flatter stomach . She’s been hooping professionally for five years now and teaches in schools, runs adult classes and performs at events worldwide, often using several hoops at once and even setting them on fire. Crikey. The last time I picked up a hula hoop, I had ankle socks and pigtails, so I’m understandably nervous as I join the 12 other women in the evening’s class. Anna believes that everyone - even those who are hopelessly uncoordinated like me - can learn to hula hoop. The secret is lots of practice and the right equipment - the larger and heavier the hoop, the easier it is to control and the more it’ll help you tone up. Anna recommends the Pro Fitness Weighted Hoop, £14.99 from Argos, to start with. As for what to wear, apparently the fewer or tighter the clothes the better. That way the hoop sticks to you rather than the fabric, so I opt for a purple vest top and blue leggings. As the class starts, Anna explains that hooping is like riding a bike - it’s all about finding your own personal rhythm and once you’ve got it, it never goes. Music helps you relax, making the whole process much easier, so she turns on the stereo and off we go. Toned up: Jenny shifted her 'mummy tummy' by regularly hula hooping . Getting the hula hoop ‘in flight’ (to use the technical term) is actually easier than I’d thought - I just hold it around my waist and fling it sideways - but keeping it twirling for more than a few rotations is going to take some practice. Anna’s tip is to stay positive - just concentrate on trying to keeping the hoop from falling. That’s easy for her to say, casually spinning her hoop around her neck, but I get countless knocks as mine keeps clattering to the ground. Anna cheerfully explains that bruises are par for the course when learning, and that my stomach will toughen up, so I should look at them as war wounds. Slowly, I start to get the hang of it, although I find it much easier to hoop in an anti-clockwise direction than a clockwise one (apparently this is normal for right-handed people). However, if I can learn to hoop in both directions I’ll get better-looking abs, because I will then be working the muscles on both sides of my body. Multi-tasking: Once you get the hang of it, you should be able to hula while texting or reading . Some of the women in the class have been hooping for months and Anna shows them how to do tricks like twirling smaller hoops around their wrists at the same time, and moving the hoop from their waist to above their head like a lassoo in one smooth movement. It certainly looks impressive, but I’d settle for just being able to keep mine going for more than 60 seconds. As for my mission to lose my mum tum, Anna recommends following Kelly Osborne’s example and hooping for ten minutes a day. For a more intensive workout, I can try turning round slowly on the spot while the hoop is spinning, walking while hooping and sticking my bottom out to make those muscles work harder. To burn even more calories I should vary the pace - exaggerating my movements to make the hoop go faster, then slowing things down which is actually harder). Armed with this advice, I go home, hoop in hand, to try it for myself. My first problem is where to practise. It’s freezing outside, and after an unfortunate incident in the kitchen involving a fully-loaded mug tree, . I quickly realise that with my hoop measuring over a metre wide, I will need at least two metres of space to exercise in. Which leaves me with the living room. Celeb fans: Beyonce, left, and Kelly Osbourne use hula hoops to keep in shape . The next problem is it’s exhausting! My waist feels warm and I’m out of breath within seconds. Ten minutes suddenly feels a very long time. Still, after a week of dogged determination, I’ve worked out that looking straight ahead rather than down at the hoop helps, meaning I can do 40 rotations before it drops. Three weeks in and I’m improving in leaps and bounds - I can manage 100 rotations at a time (about two minutes) and have an impressive golf-ball sized bruise (sorry, ‘war wound’) on my hip to show for it. I’ve also lost a centimetre from around my tummy. The hoop splits into six pieces for travel, so I’m even able to take it on a family weekend away. There are still a few issues - the hoop’s weight makes it surprisingly noisy as it whooshes around you. I’m finding sticking out my bottom so far almost impossible. And my arms really ache with the effort of trying to keep them out of the way. Oh, and my husband finds it annoying if I hoop when he’s trying to watch football. (Tough). When Anna rings for a progress update after four weeks, I’m thrilled to tell her just how much I’ve improved. I’m starting to walk around the room while hooping, can turn in a full circle and manage over 1,000 rotations in both directions. OK, I realise it’s not even close to the world record of 74 hours non-stop, but it’s a start. Queen of the swingers: Grace Jones hula hooped during her performance at the Diamond Jubilee concert . I’m eager to up my game - to be honest, hooping on the spot can get repetitive - so Anna suggests reading a book or chatting to a friend while I exercise. Not only will this make the time go faster and occupy my arms, but it should help me learn to hoop almost without thinking. She also suggests going outside and jogging in the park with the hoop. I’m less sure about that, mainly because I don’t want to become a local laughing stock. Yet surprisingly, it’s not as embarrassing as I’d thought - aside from nearly beheading a passing Labrador, no one gives me a second glance. Plus it’s a lot easier trying new moves when you’re not in danger of tripping over a coffee table . By the end of week five, my tummy is definitely shrinking - I’m amazed to find I measure 4cm less than when I started. My skills are improving, too. I can hula and jog on the spot, enjoy a bit of television and move around my living room without smashing things. Who’d have thought it? After six weeks of hooping for ten minutes a day, I’ve improved so much I can now make a phone call mid hooping without sounding like I’m running for a bus. I can even paint my nails without a smudge. What’s more, the difference it’s made to my body is phenomenal. My ‘mum tum’ has shrunk by an amazing 5cm, I’ve shaved 2cm off my waist and my bottom is 3cm smaller. Plus, I’ve lost 5lb and when I went shopping the other day, I managed to fit into a size 12 dress for the first time in 15 years! My husband can’t believe the change in me and concedes that the inconvenience of having his football matches interrupted was well worth it. Now I’m looking forward to showing off my tummy on the beach this summer. Looks like I won’t be taking those bikinis to the charity shop after all...

"PUBLISHED: . 09:56 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:13 EST, 10 May 2013 . Microsoft is believed to be considering a billion dollar offer for Barnes and Noble's Nook tablet business. The move would allow the giant to quickly launch a range of tablets under its Surface brand to take on Apple, Amazing and Google in the tablet wars. Shares in Barnes & Noble Inc soared 22 percent following the report Microsoft is considering an offer to acquire the tablet and e-book business of B&N's Nook Media unit. The Nook range of tablets, which range from Android HD tablets to e-book with 'paper' e-ink screens. Microsoft is rumoured to be purchasing the business for a billion dollars . The latest IDC market share data for tablets, released earlier this month, leaves B&N out of the industry's top five vendors, suggesting its share of the global market is negligible. Microsoft's new Surface tablets - the first of which hit the market last October - have only a 1.8 percent share. B&N has typically launched a new edition of the Nook every year. But this year it simply updated its high-definition tablets by adding Google's app store, which a number of analysts saw as an easy way for the company to launch a 'new' Nook. The technology website TechCrunch reported that Microsoft, which already owns a 17 percent stake in Nook Media, was proposing a $1 billion offer to buy all of Nook's digital assets. The report also suggested that Nook . would stop selling Android-based tablets entirely by the end of fiscal . 2014 in favor of distributing content via other publishers' platforms. A . source familiar with the documents cited by TechCrunch confirmed their . authenticity. The source said the documents dated from March, suggesting . that any deal - if one is even pending - was not imminent. It . was not clear from the TechCrunch story whether Microsoft had formally . made an offer to B&N or whether B&N had replied. B&N and Microsoft declined to comment. Microsoft . acquired its stake in the Nook Media unit a little more than a year ago . in a deal that valued the entire unit at $1.7 billion. In December the British publisher Pearson Plc bought a stake in the unit at a $1.8 billion valuation. But Nook Media sales have disappointed since. Revenue . dropped 26 percent in the most recent holiday quarter as Nook sold . fewer digital readers and tablets and had to cut prices. Just this week B&N slashed the price of its best tablet by one-third as a special promotion for Mother's Day. It was not immediately clear why Microsoft would want to buy Nook's digital assets, unless it wished to make a preemptive strike against Google and shift Nook away from the Android platform. There is already a Nook app for Windows 8 devices. Microsoft's recent acquisitions - such as online chat service Skype and business networking site Yammer - have not been content-focused. Barclays analyst Alan Rifkin, in a note to clients on Thursday, said a lower valuation for the Nook Media unit was appropriate and that $1 billion was even higher than he had modeled. B&N shares rose 22 percent to $21.70 in afternoon trading. The move would Microsoft in a head ion battle with Apple. Here, Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the new iPad during an event in San Francisco . The stock last traded at those levels a year ago, around the time of the Microsoft investment. Nook Media also includes a college bookstore chain, but the TechCrunch report suggested the Microsoft offer would include only the e-book, digital reader and tablet assets. If Microsoft carves the college bookstore chain out of the Nook Media unit, and B&N takes back those stores, Credit Suisse said the valuation of B&N could rise even higher. While the college bookstore chain has provided B&N with much needed cash, sales have been weak. In the first three quarters of the fiscal year, sales fell 0.3 percent, while operating profit fell 7 percent to $115.8 million. The college textbook business is undergoing a transformation with the shift to digital, as publishers move away from large, heavy books that last for years to multiple packages with smaller bites of content. Companies like News Corp and Apple have started to make plays on the digital textbook market as that shift accelerates. Earlier this year, B&N Chairman Leonard Riggio said he wanted to buy the company's chain of nearly 700 namesake bookstores. Selling off Nook could simplify that process, especially if it reunited Riggio with the college bookstore business, which he sold to B&N in 2009. B&N first indicated it might spin off the Nook business in early 2012.","Claims Microsoft will buy Nook business lead to 22% rise in Barnes & Noble stock .

A robotic multi-camera system has been developed in Japan that can record a single scene simultaneously from multiple angles. A computer can then stitch the individual images together to create a video clip of that scene, which can sped up or slowed down. The effect the system creates is called 'bullet time' and is the same effect used in 1999 film The Matrix in which the main character Neo is shown dodging bullets in slow motion as a camera virtually moves the audience 360-degrees around the shot.

Each of the remote-controlled 'Hi-Vision' HDTV cameras is equipped with two motors for left-right pans, up-down tilts and zooms. As the main camera moves, the eight cameras follow the action with it, pointed at different angles . This image shows NHK's system in use at a volleyball match. The cameras are all directed at the back of the player making a spike. The images from each camera can be quickly displayed in a sequence giving viewers an all-round view of the player .

It is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable-speeds, such as  slow motion and time-lapse photography. It is used in films, adverts and video games. Bullet Time slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience's point of view. This isn't possible with traditional cameras because the cameras would have move round a scene at the same speed at which the event is taking place. This makes it impossible. The term 'bullet time' is a registered trademark of Warner Bros who first used it in March 2005 in the video game The Matrix Online. It was also used to promote the 1999 The Matrix film.

A sunny day usually brings crowds to the beach – unless it’s your own private sandy spot on the coast. Now there is a rare chance to snap up a Georgian manor house with its own secluded cove as well as stunning views, links with royalty and 30 acres. The benefits will cost a pretty penny, however, as Redlap House in Devon is on the  market for £7.5 million. Picturesque: Redlap House boasts seven bedrooms and a history bound up in illegal shipping activity . Private: The house's beach is only accessible from the property itself or the sea . Set away: The countryside residence (circled) is said to be the most expensive in the West County . For that, the new owner will enjoy . seven bedrooms, four reception rooms, a 60ft indoor infinity pool and . cliff-top  garden with hot tub. There . is also a guest house with a cinema, barbecue room and art studio. Parking is unlikely to be a problem with six garages and the garden . rarely suffers frost, allowing tropical plants to flourish. Yesterday, . Martin Lamb, director of the Exeter office of estate agents Savills, . said: ‘In 30 years, this is the only house I have sold with its own . private beach. This is the best house I have sold. It is like the South . of France but in Devon.” In the last century, the estate played host to various royals on visits to Dartmouth to see the Fleet or Royal Naval College. Its . location, with access to the cove only via the house or sea, made it . perfect for ships to drop off contraband. The Governor of Dartmouth, who . owned the estate in the 18th century, was an active smuggler. During his ownership the property was fitted with false walls to conceal contraband, and there are longstanding rumours of a secret tunnel linking the property to nearby Redlap Cove. However a tunnel has never been found, and the beach is accessed by steps leading down from the garden. There are also rumours that George V visited the house, as he was frequently seen in the area while he was Prince of Wales in the earlier 20th Century. Fancy a dip? The house has its own indoor pool which looks out over the sea . Secret access: The governer of Dartmouth used the links between the house (left) and beach (centre) for smuggling in the 18th Century . It has now been put on the market for . 'offers in excess of £7.5 million', making it one of the West Country's . most expensive homes - though it is still a third of the price of a . five-bedroom flat in One Hyde Park, London.

Martin Lamb, director of the Exeter office, said: 'In 30 years this is the only house I have ever sold with its own private beach. 'It is in a cove on a very rugged coastline and it was perfect for ships to drop off contraband before arriving in Dartmouth.

Former workers at MG Rover are to receive compensation of just £3 each after fighting a seven-year battle for redundancy payments. Campaigners fighting for more money for the 6,500 employees who lost their jobs following the collapse of Britain's last major car maker were told of the tiny payout this week. When the firm collapsed in 2005, workers were told by the company's owners that millions of pounds would be available for them in a compensation fund. Shocking: Former workers at MG Rover are to be handed compensation of just £3 each after fighting a seven-year battle for redundancy payments . But, as reported by The Guardian, the fund has instead just £22,000 which needs to be shared among the thousands of workers whose jobs were lost. Following news of the payouts on Monday, campaigners are now calling for personal donations to the workers' fund from the 'Phoenix Four' – made up of John Towers, Nick Stephenson, John Edwards and Peter Beale. The businessmen bought the company for just £10 in 2000 and then paid themselves and Kevin Howe, the managing director, a total of £42m. A formal request for contributions to the fund has now been sent to representatives of the Phoenix Four. Demands: Campaigners are calling for personal donations to the workers' fund from the Phoenix Four - which includes John Towers, left, and Peter Beale, right . Speaking to MailOnline, Oliver Thomas, a former Longbridge employee and founder of the Justice for Rover Workers group, said: . 'Obviously we are disappointed, given that they took £42m so it is not as if they would struggle to put some money in. 'We campaigned for these guys to come . in and once they came in they took as much as they could. They made us . redundant, made false promises and left us hanging. 'It is very upsetting and cruel. Let down: Workers had been told that millions would be available to them in a compensation fund. Pictured are John Edwards, left, and Nick Stephenson, right, both members of the Phoenix Four . 'There are people out there who needed that money and were relying on it. I just think it is very sad for the ex-workers.' Mr Thomas added that, despite the request, he was not confident the workers would get any extra money from the 'Phoenix Four'. 1904: Rover, founded in Coventry as a bicycle business, produces its first car. 1924: MG set up by Cecil Kimber in Oxford, producing sports cars and saloons. 1959: Mini launched. 1964: Sales of Mini Austin 1100 peak at 380,000. 1968: British Leyland Motor Corporation takes over BMC and Rover. 1975: Government effectively nationalises British Leyland. 1980: Austin Metro launched. 1988: British Aerospace takes over Rover. 1994: Rover sold to BMW .

August 2004: News emerges that MG Rover could be bought by the Chinese. November 2004: BMW calls Rover bosses 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. April 2005: Government goes to China to try to secure a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. April 7, 2005: Production suspended at Longbridge. Speaking to The Guardian, a spokesman for the four businessmen - who last May were disqualified from working as company directors in Britain for a total of 19 years - said: 'All we would want to say is that the request has been noted.' Campaigners hopes for securing an additional £12.5m have recently been dashed in the High Court. It ruled that Phoenix Venture Holdings - MG Rover's former parent - was not allowed more information on money paid to creditor HBOS by administrators in 2005. Lloyds Banking Group  - the bank which now owns HBOS, said it made losses from the firm's collapse and has a duty to its shareholders to try and minimise the losses. When Phoenix bought Rover in 2000 they had the backing of Rover workers and the Labour government. It followed a warning from BMW that it could close the Longbridge plant, with the loss of thousands of jobs, unless a sale was secured within a month. In one of the most dramatic rescue bids in the history of British industry, former Rover executive John Towers paid a nominal £10 for MG Rover when his Phoenix consortium took over the company from the German car giant. But in October 2003, the car maker announced it had lost £111 million in the year to December, compared with £175 million in the previous 12 months. Two years later, figures showed the firm had sold 12,545 cars in March, down by almost 17 per cent on March 2004. In April, 2005,  MG Rover suspended production and it was later announced that the car giant was calling in the receivers.","Following firm's collapse ex-workers were told millions of pounds would be available for them .

People who live near airports should pay less tax for ‘tolerating’ high levels of noise, a new report suggests. The Institute of Economic Affairs argues that the area around runways could become ‘tax havens’ for local residents with public services paid for through taxes on airport operators. The radical idea emerged ahead of tomorrow’s publication of an interim report by Sir Howard Davies into airport expansion in the South East . Noise: People who live near airports should pay less tax as compensation for the disruption caused by flights, the IEA said . The IEA says there must be a ‘more decentralised tax system’ which would ensure that revenue ‘generated at and around an airport stays in the local area’ instead of being taken by the Treasury. The report adds: ‘The surroundings of large airports could then become “tax havens”: airports would account for a large share of the local tax revenue, so residents could enjoy both low taxes and excellent local public services/infrastructure. ‘Localism cannot be meaningfully separated from fiscal autonomy at the local level. The local level should have the right to keep most of the locally generated tax revenue. ‘But the logical correlate of that right is that areas which permit a high level of economic activity . are no longer obliged to share their revenue with areas that do not. ‘In a decentralised system, the vicinities of airports would become ‘tax havens’. It is often claimed that high tax rates are the necessary price to pay for high-quality infrastructure and public services, because there is no way to combine ‘Swedish social services with Singaporean tax rates’. Sir Howard Davies, who is running a commission into airport expansion for the government . ‘That claim is wrong. In a localised system, areas with sufficiently high levels of airport activity could achieve precisely that. There is no free lunch, but residents in those areas would ‘pay’ by tolerating high noise levels. That is a near-market solution for economic progress that benefits all sides.’ The Davies Commission is expected to say that new runways are Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick should all be considered. But an increase in flights will be viciously opposed by people living nearby. Before the last election the Tories vowed not to expand Heathrow, with Justine Greening, now the International Development Secretary, leading a campaign against a third runway. London Mayor Boris Johnson is also opposed to the idea of expanding Heathrow, warning it would be ‘environmentally disastrous and wrong for the country’. But some senior Conservatives now believe it is the only realistic option to provide the extra capacity needed to attract investment in the UK. The IEA argues that those in favour of airport expansion also need to make the case for allowing more families to go on holiday. ‘Supporters of airport expansion should stop hiding behind an instrumental defence of aviation, and openly make the case for air travel as a leisure industry, its report adds. ‘They should confront the mindset of ‘Malthusian miserabilism’ which characterises modern environmentalism. ‘Environmentalists have become the latter-day heirs of the Duke of Wellington, who opposed railway travel on the grounds that it would “only encourage the lower classes to move about needlessly”.’","Institute for Economic Affairs says local residents should be compensated .

To anyone under the age of 40, Paul Elliott is instantly recognisable as one half of the Chuckle Brothers, children’s TV favourites from 1987 onwards. With Paul playing straight man to his hapless older brother Barry, the pair made  an impressive 21 series of their hit BBC show Chucklevision, famous for its slapstick humour and catchphrases such as ‘to me, to you’. They filmed their last series in 2009, making it the longest running sitcom after Last Of The Summer Wine. Regular at this pub: Chuckle Brother Paul Elliot in the bar at his home 'Half Acre' in Hatfield, Doncaster, South Yorkshire . With their success came all the trappings, and Paul’s five-bedroom gated home, Half Acres – with its well-stocked bar room, snooker room and grounds of one-and-a-half acres – is testimony to this. Set in the pleasant village of Hatfield in South Yorkshire, Half Acres is a 15-minute drive from Doncaster and not far from Rotherham, where Paul and Barry grew up in a council house with their two older brothers and their parents – mum Amy and father James, a gang show performer. However,  you could say that Paul has become a victim of his own success. The palatial house, set down a private road, has been on the market for nearly two years. Despite reducing the asking price by £150,000 to £550,000, he has yet to find a buyer. ‘We’ve had only four or five viewings in all that time,’ says Paul, who believes the house may be just too expensive for local buyers. ‘The average house price around here is in the region of £95,000; we’re charging more than five times that.’ Hard sell: Mr Elliot has been forced to lower the price for the home with £150,000 to £550,000 as he struggles to find a buyer . In frustration, he has just changed estate agents. According to Julian Brown, director at Portfield, Garrard and Wright, Paul’s new agents, it has been a tough few years for prices in the region. He explains that prices have yet to recover to pre-2008 levels but things are starting to look up. ‘Last month was cracking, our best in four years,’ he says, ‘but there are few buyers in Paul’s price range and because it’s such a unique property, it has to find its own level.’ Paul’s material possessions have been hard won. This is the Chuckle Brothers’ 50th year as a double act – they found fame after winning the TV talent show New Faces in 1974 – and the pair have just embarked on their 46th panto run, in Darlington. Although both in their late 60s, the brothers show no sign of slowing down and spend their time travelling around the country for personal appearances at everything from pub quizzes to corporate team-building events, as well as touring with their own show. ‘I can’t imagine retiring because it’s such good fun,’ says Paul. Chuckling away: The five-bedroom home also has a snooker table and an en-suite master bedroom . He admits the panto season – two performances a day, six days a week until February – is pretty exhausting. ‘It’s not an easy life but it’s better than going down the pit,’ says Paul, whose first job was working in a Sheffield steelworks. Paul and wife Sue, 56, bought Half Acres for £300,000 in 2002 and have spent about £50,000 extending it, adding a master bedroom suite with bathroom and dressing room. Now that their youngest two sons are in their early 20s, they are keen to downsize and plan to spend much of the year at their Brittany farmhouse. Despite struggling to sell his current home, Paul still thinks property is a good place to invest his money. ‘Obviously I’m not happy about having to reduce the price but we will still have made money on the house if we sell for the new asking price.’ The couple decided to invest in other properties soon after moving to Half Acres. They built a five-bedroom villa with pool on the Greek island of Kefalonia, which they rent to holidaymakers, and own a two-bedroom apartment on the island, where they themselves holiday. They have also bought a two-bed apartment in Calabria, Italy, which they visit twice a year. portfieldgarrard.com .","Gated South Yorkshire mansion complete with bar and snooker room .

Miss Reid has praised her partner Kevin Clifton for being a role model for her three sons and all young boys . Paxman told Steve Wright on BBC Radio 2: 'They're making t*** of themselves.' But today Miss Reid said: 'I would say to anybody who is offered the chance to appear on Strictly that they should grab it with both hands because it is the most fantastic, intense, enjoyable, wonderful experience. 'I don't understand how anyone would ever turn it down, but obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion about the people who do it.'

"UPDATED: . 07:52 EST, 5 October 2011 . The relief is clearly etched across Michael Morton's face as he enjoys his first rays of sunlight as a free man. The 57-year-old was walking from the Williamson County courthouse in Taylor, Texas, on Tuesday after a judge freed him from the life sentence he had been serving after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife Christine. The former grocery store employee was convicted on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to life in prison in August 1986. Freedom: Michael Morton, right, lifts his face to the sun as he leaves the Williamson County courthouse as a free man for the first time in nearly 25 years . However, thanks to the New York-based Innocence Project, new DNA evidence came to light which showed that another man was responsible. Mr Morton's release from prison came on the same day that Obie Anthony was freed from the Twin Towers jail in Los Angeles. The 37-year-old had served 17 years of a life sentence after being wrongfully convicted of the murder of Felipe Gonzales outside a south Los Angeles brothel. Happy family: Michael Morton, centre, embraces his parents, Bill and Pat Morton, after he was freed from prison. After District Judge Sid Harle told Mr Morton that he was a free man, he hugged each of his defence attorneys before hugging his parents. Addressing reporters moments later, Mr Morton struggled to hold back tears. 'I thank God this wasn't a capital case,' he said. 'That I only had life because it gave these saints here at the Innocence Projects time to do this,' he said. 'Colours seem real bright to me now. Women are real good looking,' he said with a smile. Emotional: Michael Morton, left, looks on during a news conference at the Williamson County courthouse on Tuesday. His mother and father are pictured by his side. Asked if he ever thought he would be released, Mr Morton replied, 'I prayed for it, and I had faith it would arise.' He then headed to a celebratory dinner with his family and lawyers. Prosecutors had claimed Mr Morton killed his wife in a fit of rage after she wouldn't have sex with him following a dinner celebrating his 32nd birthday. She was found dead at their home having been beaten with a blunt wooden object . which was never found. Morton had always maintained that he had left his wife and their three-year-old son to head to work early on the morning of the slaying, and throughout his time in prison said that an intruder must have killed her. Motherly love: Pat Morton squeezes her son Michael on the shoulder as they leave the courthouse where a judge freed him from prison. This summer, using techniques that weren't available during his 1987 trial, authorities detected Christine Morton's DNA on a bloody bandana discovered near the Morton home soon after her death, along with that of a convicted felon whose name has not been released. Mr Morton was helped by the Innocence Project, which specialises in using DNA testing to overturn wrongful convictions. Judge Harle signed an agreement on Monday recommending that Morton's conviction be overturned. Happier times: Michael Morton, left, with his three-year-old son and wife Christine before her death . It was passed on to the state Court of . Criminal Appeals, which will make the final ruling that could make Mr . Morton eligible for state compensation of $80,000 for every year that he . was wrongfully imprisoned - which would be around $2 million in total. Upon . releasing Mr Morton, Judge Harle said: 'You do have my sympathies. You . have my apologies. We do not have a perfect system of justice, but we . have the best system of justice in the world.' Good work: The legal team for Michael Morton, left to right, John Raley, Nina Morrison, Gerald Goldstein and Barry Scheck speak to the media after it was announced that Mr Morton would freed from prison after 25 years. Mr Morton is not allowed to leave Texas until the Court of Criminal Appeals rules. This process could take up to three months. His defence attorney, John Raley, said his client was told a few years ago that if he showed remorse for the crime, he would probably have been paroled. 'I don't know what I would respond with after the system had let me down the way it had him and I'd been in prison 23, 24 years,' Mr Raley said. 'But this man told them, ""All I have left is my actual innocence. And if I have to spend the rest of my life in prison I'm not giving that up.""'","'Thank God this wasn't a capital case' says relieved former prisoner .

Former NFL star and actor Alex Karras died today after years of health woes which his wife blamed on the punishing, physical toll of a long football career. The former All-Pro defensive lineman and actor passed away at the age of 77 surrounded by family at his Los Angeles home. He had fought kidney disease, heart disease and for the last two years stomach cancer. The NFL veteran had also been suffering from . dementia and his death puts the spotlight on the NFL's conflict with thousands of former players over concussions. Scroll down for video . NFL hero: Alex Karras, pictured in 1971, has died at the age of 77, at home in Los Angeles surrounded by his family . Legacy: Karras, pictured bloodied on the football field in 1967, had joined thousands of former players suing the NFL for not better protecting them from head injuries . Battle: Alex Karras with his wife Susan Clark who said the injuries he had sustained while playing for the NFL had made his family life difficult . In April, Karras joined more than 3,500 former players suing the league for not protecting them better from head injuries, immediately becoming one of the best-known names in the legal fight. 'It's the same thing as back in the . gladiator days when the gladiators fought to death,' said his lawyer . Craig Mitnick, who represents Karras and hundreds of others in the suit. 'Fans care about these guys when . they're playing and they are heroes. But as soon as you're not a hero . and not playing the fan doesn't really care what happens to them.' The family had not yet decided whether to donate Karras' brain for study, as other families have done, according to the lawyer. Karras' wife said his quality of life had been made worse because of head injuries sustained during his playing career. Susan . Clark said earlier this year that her husband couldn't drive after . loving to get behind the wheel and could no longer remember recipes . for some of his favorite Italian and Greek dishes he used to cook. Love of the game: Karras (left) with author and life-long friend George Plimpton (right). Karras became a minor celebrity after Plimpton wrote a book about being an NFL player in Detroit . True love: Alex Karras with his wife Susan Clark whom he met on the set of hit TV show Webster . Clark, who also played the on-screen . wife of Karras' character on TV show Webster, said he was formally diagnosed . with dementia several years ago and had symptoms for more than ten . years. She and Karras were among those who filed suit nearly six months ago in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. 'This . physical beating that he took as a football player has impacted his . life, and therefore it has impacted his family life,' Clark said earlier . this year. 'He is . interested in making the game of football safer and hoping that other . families of retired players will have a healthier and happier . retirement.' For many former football stars, life after their careers have ended is far from the glory of cheering crowds and championship titles. Doctors from the Center for Study of Traumatic Encephalopthy at Boston University, are currently studying brain injuries in professional athletes, looking for signs of the condition linked to more than a dozen dead NFL players. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioural problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia. Also known as 'punch drunk syndrome', it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey stars. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or decades later. In July, Tennessee Titans' wide receiver O.J. Murdock died aged 25 after shooting himself while sitting in his car. He became the sixth NFL star to commit suicide in the last two years. In May 2012 Junior Seau, of the San Diego . Chargers, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. He was found by his . girlfriend at his home in California. South Alabama associate head . coach Kurt Crain, who once played in the NFL, shot himself in April . 2012. He had reportedly been suffering from a severe prostate . infection. Also in April, Ray Easterling, a one-time Atlanta Falcons star, shot himself at home after struggling to cope with dementia. Former Nashville Predator Wade Belak was found dead in September 2011, having hanged himself in a Toronto hotel room. Two-time Super Bowl winner Dave Duerson shot himself in February 2011 after texting family members asking for his brain to be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease. The NFL has . said it did not intentionally seek to mislead players and has taken . action to better protect players and to advance the science of . concussion management and treatment. Speaking about Karras' deteriorating . condition yesterday, Lions president Tom Lewand said: 'The entire . Detroit Lions family is deeply saddened to learn of the news regarding . the condition of one of our all-time greats, Alex Karras. 'Perhaps no player in Lions history attained as much success and notoriety for what he did after his playing days as did Alex.' Born in Gary, Indiana, Karras starred for four years at Iowa. Detroit drafted Karras with the 10th overall pick in 1958 and he was a four-time All-Pro defensive tackle over 12 seasons with the franchise. He was the heart of the Lions' famed 'Fearsome Foursome', terrorizing quarterbacks for years. The Lions handed the powerful 1962 Green Bay Packers their only defeat that season, a 26-14 upset on Thanksgiving during which they harassed quarterback Bart Starr constantly. Packers guard Jerry Kramer wrote in his diary of the 1967 season about his trepidation over having to play Karras. 'I'm thinking about him every minute,' Kramer wrote. For all his prowess on the field, Karras may have gained more fame when he turned to acting. Playing a not-so-bright bruiser in . Mel Brooks' 1974 comedy Blazing Saddles, he not only slugged a horse but . also delivered the classic line: 'Mongo only pawn in game of life.' Several years before that, Karras had . already become a minor celebrity through George Plimpton's . behind-the-scenes book about what it was like to be an NFL player in the . Motor City - Paper Lion: Confessions of a Second-string Quarterback. That led to Karras playing himself . alongside Alan Alda in the successful movie adaption - Karras and . Plimpton remained friends for life and one of Karras' sons is named . after Plimpton - and it opened doors for Karras to be an analyst . alongside Howard Cosell and Frank Gifford on Monday Night Football. In the 1980s, he played a sheriff in . the comedy Porky's and became a hit on the small screen as Emmanuel . Lewis' adoptive father, George Papadapolis, in the sitcom Webster. Karras played his entire NFL career with the Lions before retiring in 1970 at age 35. He . was a first-team All-Pro in 1960, 1961 and 1965, and he made the Pro . Bowl four times. Beloved: Alex Karras in Webster with co-stars Emmanuel Lewis (center) and on-screen wife Susan Clark who he later married . On screen: Following his dazzling NFL career with the Detroit Lions, Karras went on to star on TV and in movies such as Blazing Saddles in 1974 . Famous friends: Karras appears on SNL in 1985 alongside Billy Crystal and Tina Turner . He missed the 1963 season when he was suspended by NFL . Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a gambling probe. Karras was recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a defensive tackle on the All-Decade Team of the 1960s. 'We . know Alex first and foremost as one of the cornerstones to our Fearsome . Foursome defensive line of the 1960s and also as one of the greatest . defensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,' Lewand added. Alex . Karras is survived by his wife Susan and six children - five from his . first marriage to Joan Jurgensen and a daughter to Susan.

"Data breach led to theft of credit card information for 40 million Target customers who shopped the first three weeks of holiday season . Data for millions of cards are being sold on black markets for $20-$100 . One man speeding in Brooklyn was pulled over and cops found $20,000 worth of Apple goods bought with gift cards that had been purchased using the stolen credit card data . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:35 EST, 21 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 21 December 2013 . The CEO of Target has apologized for slower call center and website access and is now offering a 10 percent discount to lure customers back into stores, after a massive data breach left information of about 40 million shoppers vulnerable to hackers. CEO Gregg Steinhafel said on Friday that the issue of unauthorized access to payment card data at their U.S. stores 'has been identified and eliminated', and not all customers who shopped between Black Friday and last week are victims of fraud. 'Most importantly, we want to reassure guests that they will not be held financially responsible for any credit and debit card fraud,' he told ABC News. 'And to provide guests with extra assurance, we will be offering free credit monitoring services. We will be in touch with those impacted by this issue soon on how and where to access the service.' Steinhafel apologized to guests who tried to reach Target via its website or call center while it faces 'unprecedented call volume'. Out of the store: The credit card data for millions of Target shoppers is now being sold on the black market after a massive security breach that hit more than 40million shoppers . Investigators believe that overseas . hackers were responsible for the cyber attack on Target that compromised . up to 40 million payment cards during the first three weeks of the . holiday shopping season. Brian Krebs, reporting for KrebsOnSecurity.com . reported on Friday that cards stolen from Target were being offered at the black market . 'card shops' for rates starting at $20 each and going to more than $100. A person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the matter, said that government investigators do not believe that the hackers had inside help. The source declined to say how the hackers got in or where investigators believe they are based, saying investigators don't want to show their hand to the criminals or afford them a chance to destroy evidence. A Secret Service spokesman declined comment on the investigation, which the agency is running. The retailer reported the breach on Thursday, a day after news broke of the attack. Target has declined to say how its systems were compromised and has provided few other details about the case. Spokeswoman Molly Snyder released a written statement on Friday that downplayed the initial impact from the incident. 'To date, we are hearing very few reports of actual fraud, but are closely monitoring the situation,' she said. She said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip. The hackers did not obtain PIN numbers used to access ATMs or the three or four-digit security codes that are printed on cards to verify online purchases, Snyder said. She said Target has provided exposed card numbers to Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. Those companies are in turn providing the information to the financial institutions that issue them. The retailer said it was offering a 10 percent discount on December 21 and 22 and free credit monitoring, calling the situation 'confusing and disruptive'. They are also adding more people to answer the phone as some potential credit card fraud victims have said they were having trouble reaching the store. Tricky: Credit card information stolen from a Target customer was used to purchase a gift card that then was used to buy $20,000 worth of Apple products found in a Brooklyn car . A traffic stop may have exposed at least one purchase of stolen data. A speeding driver who was pulled over in Brooklyn on Thursday was found to have up to $20,000 worth of stolen Apple products in his car and now police are investigating whether or not those items were connected to the collection of Target customers' financial data. The accidental discovery came after a series of mistakes on the part of the alleged thieves, as Isiah Ramdaran was pulled over in Flatbush after running a red light. The New York Post reports that when he opened the glove compartment to get his registration papers, police saw that it was also holding a loaded 32-caliber handgun. That reveal prompted police to search the vehicle and they found Target bags filled with 17 Apple iPad Airs, 14 Apple iPad Minis and 11 iTouches. Those Apple products are not believed to have been used to steal the information, but instead they may be the byproduct of it since they were purchased with gift cards that had been bought with the stolen credit card information. Target spokeswoman said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip and she tried on Friday to downplay the situation . There were two . other men in the car but their names have not been released, though they . were charged with possession of stolen property and a gun alongside . 21-year-old Isiah Ramdaran. All of the Apple products in the car were bought in Target stores across Long Island and neighboring areas. Those were far from the only stores effected by the credit card data theft, which is the second biggest in U.S. history. An earlier theory about the theft suggested that hackers broke into Target's computer system and installed data mining software on credit card machines. That software is installed on 40,000 machines across the 1,797 stores in the U.S. All the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet over the course of three weeks before the theft was discovered. The software could have spread through the Target network after being installed on a company machine, possibly by fooling an employee into clicking on a fake link in a 'phishing' scam. The breach did not affect online purchases, Target officials said.","Data breach led to theft of credit card information for 40 million Target customers who shopped the first three weeks of holiday season .

But today Britain's last ever mobile cinema is back on the road, restored to its former glory thanks to the love and attention bestowed on it by a pair of film buffs. Ollie Halls and his partner Emma Giffard, both 35, stumbled across the rusty Bedford SB3 bus eight years ago. The last-ever mobile cinema is back on the roads touring the UK after film buffs Ollie Halls and Emma Giffards rescued it from rotting in an Essex field eight years ago . The 22-seater theatre shows films on its state-of-the-art HD digital projection unit as well as archive footage . Mr Halls and Miss Giffard bought the rusty Bedford SB3 bus for £1,200 in 2005 . It was one of seven built by the Ministry of Technology in 1967 to tour around the country's factories showcasing modern production techniques. It showed films including Machining With Throwaway Tip Tools to bosses and workers to try and promote British industry's reputation as a global leader. After spending £1,200 for the bus in 2005, Mr Halls and Miss Giffard invested £35,000 over the next five years. With painstaking care and attention the couple renovated the historic vintage cinema, restoring its hidden charms. And while the other six drab-looking grey cinema vehicles were lost to history, the last existing is now back touring the UK showing a variety of films and archive footage. The bus was used by the Ministry of Technology in the 1960s to showcase British production techniques to staff at factories across the country in a bid to promote the country's industry . These two images reveal the transformation inside the vintage bus. Mr Halls and Miss Giffard have added 22 1930s-style seats, tiered to ensure the entire audience can enjoy the screenings . The unique theatre has 22 1930s-style . cinema seats which are tiered to ensure everyone in the audience gets . the best view possible. But . the 1960s vintage bus has been propelled into the 21st Century with a . brand new HD digital projection unit, complete with Dolby 7:1 surround . sound, to beam the films before the audience. Vintage vehicle enthusiast Ollie said the couple's labour of love would not even move when they bought it eight years ago. He . said: 'I used to live in a similar bus and was trying to do cinema from . that but I could never really take it to a public space. 'Friends of mine said buy Rob's cinema bus and I went to see it and it was a big old grey rusty heap. 'The engine was seized, the breaks were seized, so it was a mess. When Mr Halls, pictured, discovered the vintage gem lying rotting in a field, he rescued it and with the help of partner Miss Giffard the project became the couple's labour of love . The couple invested £35,000 over five years restoring the wreck to its former glory . 'But structurally it was there, it had only done 11,000 miles. 'I did most of the work with a really good friend. It was the same mechanics as the bus I used to live on. 'As we went along I tried not to think about the fact I was spending so much money on it. 'People . appreciate it because it's a piece of cinema history but other people . see it as a piece of automative industrial history.' His partner-of-seven-years Miss Giffard, added: 'It was a beast really - the inside was gutted and it was just a complete mess. 'Ollie was a visual arts student specialising in cinema and he's also a vintage vehicle enthusiast. 'So when someone told him about the bus, it married together his two loves. 'It has taken a lot of blood, sweat and tears to reach this point, plus help from volunteers. Mr Halls and Miss Giffard's bus is the only surviving mobile cinema after seven were manufactured in 1967. The remaining six were resigned to the scrapheap . The seven buses were operated by PERA, the Production Engineering Research Association. In 1974 the Government sold off the buses . 'It looks great. The inside was particularly utilitarian - it had 28 coach seats originally, and we have put in 22 cinema seats from the 1930s. 'We were very, very lucky to get the bus just in time. It's quite a unique piece of heritage.' The couple - who have a 17-month-old daughter Iona May - now run The Vintage Mobile Cinema from their home in the Mendip Hills near Bristol as a full-time business. When the extensive renovations were complete in 2010, the couple secured National Lottery funding to use films stored by the South West Film and Television Archive. They then hit the road, touring towns and villages in Devon showing eight 20-minute films featuring clips about the region that had laid buried in archives, away from public view, for 50 years or more. The pair now take the historic bus across the country for company's to hire out for events. While the bus has the capability to show any DVD or film, Mr Halls said the short 20-minute independent films and archive footage are the most popular. The couple completely gutted the inside of the bus, to allow them to start from scratch . Mr Halls, left, and Miss Giffard, right, spent five years restoring the bus getting it back on the road in 2010 . The Vintage Mobile Cinema is now run as a full-time business by the couple, who take the bus across the UK for company's to hire out for events . He added: 'We do the occasional feature film but because of the small audience we tend to do short films more. 'Often people have films they want to show that's poignant to their event but we have got a collection that has been donated to our library. 'It is quiet in the winter but between March and November it's generally out a couple of times a month. 'Last summer we did a tour of four weeks on the run where it was used most days. 'And we have toured it through France in the past.' Their mobile cinema featured on George Clarke's Amazing Spaces on Channel 4 on December 5. The popular Geordie host described the unique vehicle as looking like a 'collision between a bus and a greenhouse'. Well-know film critic Mark Kermode also praised Mr Halls and Miss Giffard for: 'Reminding us what a real cinema looks like.'","Ollie Halls, 35, bought the rusty Bedford SB3 bus in 2005 for £1,200 .

South Sudan has seen some of the its worst ever violence over the past week - claiming at least 500 lives so far. The US military has dispatched 45 troops to protect its embassy in the capital of Juba, while the State Department has warned American citizens in the country to leave immediately. Hundreds of people are believed to be trapped in Bor, which is currently in hands of rebels. Meanwhile, thousands of others have fled to UN compounds to seek shelter from the violence. The conflict began on Sunday when troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir from power. Machar was sacked along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he was going to contest the 2015 general election. Yesterday, President Barack Obama said the country 'stands on the precipice' of civil war as conflict in the country entered its sixth day. In a statement, he said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people. 'In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history. 'Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past.' A number of other nations, including Britain, have sent in military troops to rescue their civilians.","Servicemen had been trying to rescue American citizens from Bor, Jonglei .

A rapist offered fellow inmates $20,000 cash, a Mercedes-Benz and a $14,000 ring so they would kill his victim before she testified against him, court documents have claimed. Tony Dotson, who was convicted of raping one of his fiancee's friends at knife point in 2012 after staging a burglary at her home, tried to recruit inmates at the Van Cise-Simonet Detention Center in Denver, Colorado before she could appear in court, the grand jury indictment said.

Residents of several upper Midwest states are expected to awaken to a new layer of snow, while northern New England could find a world frozen over in more than a half-inch of ice brought by a sloppy storm that already has claimed at least two lives. A storm system that dished a bit of everything Saturday on an area of about 2,000 miles stretching from Texas to eastern Canada was expected to bring rain Sunday to areas back East that enjoyed spring-like temperatures the day before. Travelers likely avoided the worst if they left or arrived in the Midwest by midday Saturday. But by afternoon, roads in many areas became slick and flight cancellations and delays started mounting. Sloppy storm: The Books-A-Million store is seen damaged by heavy wind and rain during a major storm in Monroe, La., Saturday . Soggy mess: Thunderstorms stretching from southern Louisiana to Indiana caused rivers and creeks to swell . By midnight eastern time Saturday, nearly 500 flights into or out of U.S. airports had been cancelled and some 7,000 had been delayed, aviation tracking website FlightAware.com reported. A line of thunderstorms stretching from southern Louisiana to Indiana began wreaking havoc, causing rivers and creeks to swell, flooding roads and spawning winds strong enough to force cars and trucks off of highways. At least two suspected tornadoes touched down in Arkansas, injuring a total of five people and damaging nearly two-dozen homes in or near the towns of Dermott and Hughes. The Weather Channel map shows areas that will be hit by snow and rain . And the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) reported at least two deaths, one of them in Coahoma County, in the northwestern part of the state, and Jasper County in the central part of the state. The Coahoma County coroner identified the victim as James Sanders, 43, who was killed when gusty winds blew over his mobile home, pinning him against a tree, MS News Now reported. ‘This is a particularly strong storm with very warm, near record-breaking temperatures in the East and very cold air in the Midwest, and that contrast is the sort of conditions that are favorable for not only winter weather but also tornadoes,’ said National Weather Service meteorologist Ed Danaher in College Park, Maryland. Frozen in time: Thousands of tiny icicles hang from the pedestrian bridge in Tulsa, Oklahoma . Force of nature: David Puffer calls for help after he stranded his vehicle in floodwaters in Baxter County, Ark., where The National Weather Service has issued a tornado watch and flood warnings . Richard Chase walks carefully along a pedestrian bridge in Tulsa, Okla., after attempting to fish during the ice storm . The worst of Winter Storm Gemini wasn't supposed to hit Chicago until late Saturday or early Sunday, giving those traveling to, from or through the Windy City a window at the start of the holiday rush. As of midnight, most of the air travel disruptions were affecting flights in and out of airports that serve as major hubs, including Chicago's O'Hare, Houston's Bush International, Dallas/Fort Worth and Denver International. Given the potential problems with flying and driving, some travelers opted for rail. Darren Hall, 45, of Raymore, Mo., normally drives to St. Louis for the holiday, but decided not to risk it because of the freezing rain hitting the area and the promise of worse to come. Instead, he was waiting for a train at Kansas City's Union Station. ‘You don't have to deal with all the roads. It's safer, less hassle,’ Hall said. Chaotic scene: An Ellettsville fire fighter sets up a safety rope as they prepare to wade through moving flood water in Ellettsville, Ind. First responders: Ellettsville Fire Department personnel give a ride to people they rescued from cars stranded on flooded roads . Freezing rain coated parts of northern New England Saturday night, as officials warned people to stay off the roads and utilities prepared for the possibility of widespread power outages. Burlington, Vermont, had received a quarter-inch of ice by late Saturday, and the city's airport was forced to rely briefly on generators after losing power briefly. ‘We've lined up hundreds of additional out-of-state line workers and tree trimmers in addition to all the GMP employees who will be working until all power is restored,’ Vermont Green Mountain Power spokeswoman Dorothy Schnure said. Many Midwest cities that spent Saturday dealing with rain and ice were expected to get significant snowfall overnight, with up to 6 inches forecast for the Kansas City area and up to 8 inches for southern Wisconsin, eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois. Forecasters said roads that are passable one minute could become treacherous the next as a cold blast on the back end of the storm turns rain to ice and snow. Winter Wonderland: Ice storms were expected to wreak havoc on travel in Midwestern states . Winter Storm Gemini is the seventh named storm of the year . Whiteout? Freezing rain on Friday morning snarled traffic and forced some school closures in Michigan and Wisconsin. The states were bracing for significant snow, sleet and ice . Making it harder for forecasters to . stay a step ahead, the system, dubbed 'Gemini,' was a weird swirl of wintry and . spring-like weather as it passed over areas in the Midwest with freezing . temperatures and places like Nashville, where it could surpass 70 . degrees. Temperatures in New York City are also expected to approach the 70-degree mark Sunday, but by tomorrow night, the storm systems . will be hammering the East Coast. CNN reported that New York Gov.

Frosty: Trees covered by ice in Norman, Oklahoma on December 21 . Brittle beauty: Tree limbs encased in ice in Oklahoma City . Travel trouble: Flight cancellations were creeping up above 400 around the country, especially in major hubs like O'Hare International Airport in Chicago . It's bad timing for the estimated 94.5million Americans planning to travel by road or air during this holiday season, which runs from Saturday through January 1, and those hitting the roads for some last-minute shopping. The storm had several bands of strikingly different weather. In the Upper Midwest, forecasters expected 6-8 inches of snow north and west of Chicago and into Wisconsin. It . was already bringing significant ice accumulations to Oklahoma, . southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, splitting trees and snapping . power lines. That was expected to change over to snow by Saturday night. Parts . of Maine could get more than a half-inch coating of ice, which would . make roads treacherous and cause widespread power outages. ‘The . best advice for everyone is just to really pay attention. With every . few hours, we're going to get better information,’ Maine Emergency . Management Agency spokeswoman Lynnette Miller said Friday. With . falling temperatures, some of that could be freezing rain by Saturday . night in the St. Louis area, weather service meteorologist Jon Carney . said. In Indiana, the . National Weather Service posted flood warnings along southern and . central Indiana streams and predicted the highest flood crests along the . East Fork of the White River since April 2011. While . the Midwest and Plains were preparing for ice and snow, residents down . South were concerned about tornadoes, which forecasters said were . possible this weekend even though they are uncommon this time of year - . but not unheard of. Winter Storm Gemini: A storm system moving across the United States is pictured in this NASA handout satellite photo taken December 20 . A tornado outbreak on Christmas Day 2012 reached from northeastern Texas through central Alabama - one twister hit Mobile, Ala. A tornado on December 16, 2000, killed 11 people in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The area most threatened stretched from central and northeastern Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and southeast Missouri, where 80 mph wind gusts and flash flooding were possible. Rain and ice in Oklahoma were blamed for two fatal traffic accidents and thousands of power outages. A 16-year-old boy died early Saturday after his car crashed and overturned on U.S. 64 near Tulsa, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. And Oklahoma City police said a woman was killed Friday night in a collision on a slick roadway. Forecasters said up to a half-inch of ice could accumulate across the middle of the state. A woman sleeping in a hotel in Holland in western Michigan was injured when a motorist lost control of his car on an icy street early Friday and slammed into the wall outside her room, MLive.com reported. The weather wasn't the only headache maker. A baggage-equipment breakdown lasted for hours at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, creating a backed-up line of travelers that stretched onto the sidewalk outside one of the terminals. If there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year, AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter said. ‘When a holiday falls on a Wednesday it gives travelers more flexibility of either leaving the weekend before, or traveling right before the holiday and extending the trip through the following weekend,’ Hunter said.

British spies targeted the Prime Minister of Israel, and other senior figures in the Israeli government, according to leaked documents. Information from the cache of files released by Edward Snowden allegedly show that GCHQ, the British intelligence agency, had targeted an email account belonging to Ehud Olmert while he was in office. The agency, working with the American NSA, also targeted defence minister Ehud Barak and Yoni Koren, his chief of staff, according to GCHQ documents. Targets: Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, left, and former defence minster Ehud Barak, right, were both allegedly targeted by GCHQ and the NSA while in office in 2009 . The collection of documents, seen by the Guardian, New York Times and German magazine Der Spiegel, says that the account associated with Mr Olmert was targeted in January 2009, with attempts made on email between Mr Barak and Mr Koren the following month. Two Israeli embassies also appeared on a list of intelligence-gathering targets. Speaking to the New York Times today, Mr Olmert explained that the address was used for correspondence with his office. But he said the information on the account was unlikely to have contained any state secrets, as sensitive matters were discussed more privately. He said: 'This was an unimpressive target. 'I would be surprised if there was any attempt by American intelligence in Israel to listen to the prime minister’s [telehpone] lines.' Mr Barak declined to comment on the latest information, but has previously said he took it for granted that he was under surveillance. Other international organisations were also revealed as being on the joint target list, which the NSA and GCHQ used between 2008 and 2011. They include senior EU officials, charitable arms of the United Nations and Médecines du Monde, a French organisation which sends doctors to war zones. Targets: The Israeli politicians, along with other significant figures, appeared on a list for targets made by GCHQ, the headquarters of which are pictured . Joaquín Almunia, the Spanish vice-president of the European commission, who has power over competition policy, was among the names on the list. Today a spokesman for the commission said that being targeted by spy agencies is 'unacceptable' and deserves 'our strongest condemnation'. They said: 'This is not the type of behaviour that we expect from strategic partners, let alone from our own member states.' The UK executive director of Médecins du Monde, Leigh Daynes, said: 'Our doctors, nurses and midwives are not a threat to national security. There is absolutely no reason for our operations to be secretly monitored.' Leaks: The new information comes from documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who was a contractor with the National Security Agency . The documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who was formerly a contractor with the NSA, has prompted condemnation around the world by showing how the huge intelligence agencies gather their information. Mr Snowden fled the USA before the cache of documents he leaked came to light, and is now living in Russia, which has granted him asylum. Previously released documents have suggested that the agencies have spied on friendly powers at international conferences, including German chancellor Angela Merkel. GCHQ said that it does not comment on intelligence matters.","Reports say the Israeli leader and his defence minister were spying targets .

The total raised on the page, which is growing constantly, stood at £33,406 just after 9pm this evening. But, according to Ashley Clark, 20, who runs the page, an additional £10,000 has been donated by X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne, a cancer survivor herself, after she read their story. According to Ashley, the star sent in the donation accompanied by a note saying: 'Dear Felix,From a survivor, never give up the fight and hope. God Bless you & your family. Love, Sharon Osbourne.' Felix was admitted to hospital in November after suffering for several weeks with what he first thought were stomach cramps.

Forensic scientists in Colombia are embarking on a huge project to identify the remains of 500 children who were taken by guerrilla fighters and later found in mass unmarked graves. Their investigations have identified one girl through her bones as the victim of a bombing, after she had been missing for more than a decade after being taken by leftist rebels from her home aged 14.

The parents of a teenager who committed suicide on July 17 have filed a claim against their city for negligence after police failed to follow up the boy's social media post stating his intention to kill himself. Matthew Cline was a 17-year-old high school football player when he shot himself in the head at home with a gun belonging to his parents. His parents say that on July 16, their son posted on social media site iFunny: 'My name is Matthew Cline. This will be my last post on ifunny as I will be committing suicide tonight.' Cry for help: Matthew Cline posted his intention to commit suicide on a social networking site . They allege the police knew about the post and had the Clines' address but did not send a car to the home or telephone the Clines to make them aware of the post. On the evening of July 16, high school student Ana Gutierrez, 17, some 300 miles away from Matthew Cline in Los Banos, saw his iFunny post and became concerned. She did some sleuthing and managed to locate Cline's Facebook profile. To her surprise, he accepted her friend request immediately and she was able to discover that he lived in Huntington Beach and attended Liberty Christian School. Records show Gutierrez called the Huntington Beach Police Department at 12:22am July 17. She told an officer about Matthew Cline's iFunny posting and emailed police screenshots of the post and his Facebook account. Officers found the correct Matthew Cline on their database as well as his address and his father Bill Cline's cell phone number. Hidden: Matthew Cline's suicide came as a shock to his family, who didn't know anything was amiss . According to the Courthouse News, a police report states that officers attempted to call William Cline two or three times. The Clines say they never received any calls. Approximately 20 hours after Gutierrez called the Huntingdon Beach Police Department, Matthew Cline committed suicide. 'Bottom line is he reached out for help and somebody did everything in her power to help,' Matthew's mother Kathy Cline told the Orange County Register. 'It was a failure by the adults. That's the saddest thing. A knock on the door and Matt would be alive. We could have got him help.' According to Courthouse News, the claim states that officers responding to Matthew Cline's suicide 'immediately recognized' him as the teenager who made the iFunny post. Matthew Cline's parents claim that an officer questioned Cline's sister about the post while they were out of earshot. Their world: The Clines believe their son Matthew (seen here with his mother Kathy) would still be with them today if police had followed up on his social media post . The Orange County Register reports that the Clines' neighbor Kasha Buhman said the officer 'came up to [Matthew Cline's sister] Jackie and I stayed close by, because she was by herself and her parents weren't there,' Buhman said. 'He asked, â€˜Do you know if your brother ever went on an app called iFunny?' and asked if she had the password to his phone.' The Clines had no idea their sporty son was troubled, and say that knowing about the iFunny post would have prevented their son's death. 'We just wanted a chance,' Bill Cline told the Orange County Register. 'He was our world.' Sportsman: The athletic teen was a talented footballer with a 'great attitude' Lieutenant Mitchell O'Brien says there is no procedure for handling social media post such as Matthew Cline's. 'We get calls all the time and we follow up on what we can follow up on, but we can't follow up all the time,' O'Brien told the Orange County Register. 'We take threats of suicide very seriously â€¦ but it really comes down to, do we have a call for service and do we have a place to go? It's a judgment call.' The Clines allege negligence, civil rights violations and are seeking damages for severe emotional distress and loss of companionship as well as expected loss of their son's future income. According to the Courthouse News, the claim is seeking damages of more than $10,000. Claims of this nature are usually precursors to lawsuits. The Clines are grateful to Ana Gutierrez for doing everything in her power to help their son, but Gutierrez herself struggles with what happened to the boy she tried to save.

The centerpiece: This uniform once worn by Saddam Hussein is the focal point of the exhibit . An exhibit dedicated to the 10-year anniversary of the capture of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein will open this week – in Oklahoma City. The Oklahoma Historical Society came into the items on display after they were donated by the man who led the US Army’s effort to topple the dictator. Mr Hussein was removed from power in 2003 following a US-led invasion spearheaded by retired Army Lt. Col. and former Oklahoma State Sen. Steve Russell. The exhibit will feature many of the former despot’s personal possessions, including a European-tailored military uniform worn by a younger Mr Hussein, several firearms and other objects. ‘We’re very excited to have this exhibit,’ Dr. Bob Blackburn, executive director of the Oklahoma Historical Society, said in a statement. ‘It is not every day that such historic items from recent history can be viewed by the public and we are very proud of the ties they have to Oklahoma.’ Those Oklahoma ties are in reference to Mr Russell, who is loaning the collection for a special temporary exhibit. He helped lead the hunt for Saddam and is also the author of ‘We Got Him!” His personal memoir of the hunt and capture of Saddam. Baghdad was captured months before the former Iraqi leader was infamously found hiding in an underground bunker . Deadly: Some of the many weapons formerly owned by the dictator . ‘For years I have kept low key about these artifacts,’ Mr Russell said in a statement released by the Oklahoma History Center. ‘I realize that they are an incredible part of our nation’s history that should be enjoyed by the public and hope the display will call to remembrance the soldiers wounded and lost during the hunt and capture of Saddam,’ he added. The exhibit will go on full display later this month and is open to the public.","The exhibit will feature a military uniform, firearms and other objects once owned by former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein .

Most brides dream of throwing a white wedding which will make other women green with envy. But one bride has instead painted herself and her husband-to-be green, for their fairy-tale wedding based on the film Shrek. Amanda, 44, and Nathan Gibbs, 39, from Kingswinford, West Midlands planned their rather unusual ceremony after eight years together. Green with envy? A couple dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona for their wedding in Dudley, West Midlands . Happy couple: Newlyweds Nathan and Amanda Gibbs sign the register in full costume . Themed: The couple's guests were also encouraged to dress up for their big day, held at Priory Hall, Dudley . After losing a number of friends to cancer, the couple decided to dress as the fairytale couple and use the day to raise money for charity. Dressed in full costume, the pair wed this morning at Priory Hall near Dudley. Guests also dressed up for the themed celebrations - dressing up as the Gingerbread Man, Mickey Mouse and Jack Sparrow from Pirates Of The Caribbean. Cause: Having lost a number of friends to cancer, the couple decided to have a themed wedding in aid of charity . Group photo: The couple's guests donated money to charity rather than giving the pair a wedding present . Instead of wedding gifts, the couple - who run an ironing service business, asked that people donate money to Cancer Research. Mr Gibbs said: 'In the last 15 months we've lost seven of our customers to cancer. 'It just broke our hearts. We wanted to do something to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage more people to go and get checked out.' Vows: The couple - pictured just after the ceremony - always joked they would have a 'fairytale wedding' The former bricklayer said the couple used to joke that if they ever got married, they would have a fairytale wedding. 'It was a standing joke between us. All our friends started getting married and I said ""When we do it we'll have a fairytale wedding. I'll be Shrek and you can be Princess Fiona"". 'Earlier this year we held a fundraiser for Cancer Research and we were talking about what else we could do when Shrek came on the TV. We turned to each other and laughed.' Inspiration: The pair decided to make their wedding Shrek-themed when the film came on the television . Fancy dress: Guests came as a selection of characters - including Mr T, pirates and mini mouse . 'I do': One guest throws confetti while Snow White, Buzz Lightgear and a Gingerbread man watch on . Plans got under way for the fairytale wedding but the couple were then hit with more bad news. 'My sister Donna was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was such a shock. 'We were trying to do something to help others and then it happened to us.' In the spirit: One guest came as Donkey from the film while another came as a monk . Family: Nathan's sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer - but was given the all-clear before the day . Luckily his sister has been given the all-clear but it made the couple even more determined to raise awareness of the disease. Mr Gibbs said: 'We've had a great day today and it's fantastic to think the money raised will go towards helping to support those with cancer and their families. 'Also, if this story encourages just one person who has found a lump to go and get checked out then we will have succeeded.'","Nathan, 39, and Amanda Gibbs, 44, dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona .

Teresa Newcome-Baker, 37, had lost all hope of seeing her beloved bay cob Quincey again, after he was taken in 2010 . A horse has been reunited with his owner, after being discovered 400 miles away from home three years after he was stolen. Teresa Newcome-Baker, 37, had lost all hope of seeing her beloved bay cob Quincey again, after he was taken in 2010. The sales representative, from Northamptonshire, said the horse was stolen when she was forced to loan him after she injured her shoulder in a riding accident and was unable to ride. According to Ms Newcome-Baker, the person who hired the 15-year-old horse never returned him, and despite reporting the matter to the police she couldn't prove she had loaned the animal rather than giving it away. But just two weeks ago Ms Newcome-Baker received a call from a riding school north of the border in Perth, central Scotland. They told her that they found a description online of a missing horse that matched Quincey - who they had just bought for thousands of pounds. Ms Newcome-Baker,, who lives with her partner Kinglsey Underwood, 24, in Woodford, said she had been moved to tears by the news. She said: 'I injured my shoulder a few years ago and couldn't ride for a while so I decided to loan Quincey out to get some riding. 'But the woman I loaned him to gave me a false name and false contact details and wouldn't give Quincey back. 'In fact she was a horse dealer and sold him on. 'I contacted the police and gave them evidence of what she was doing but they couldn't do anything and told me I had to go through civil courts. 'We just could not afford that and I thought that was the end of it - my Quincey was gone. 'But a few weeks ago I got a phone call from these people saying they had my horse. 'I was ecstatic. They didn't ask for payment. They gave me a phone call while I was at work. I sat and cried for 10 minutes, out of shock more than anything. 'I hired a horsebox to go and pick him up. After three years the first thing I wanted to do was to to see him. 'He was immediately his old self again, as soon as he saw his field it was like he had never left. 'He's not been treated properly but he's still the same Quincey underneath and he's getting back to normal now. Ms Newcome-Baker said the person who hired the 15-year-old horse never returned him, and despite reporting the matter to the police she couldn't prove she had loaned the animal rather than giving it away. But just two weeks ago Ms Newcome-Baker received a call out of the blue from a riding school north of the border in Perth, central Scotland . 'The people who had him have either removed or deliberately scrambled the microchip saying he was mine. 'So when the riding school got him they had no reason to suspect anything. 'It really was amazing how they found me, and I cannot thank them enough for what they have done.' Quincey had been sold on to Crieff Hydro Riding School who had bought the horse in good faith. But when the school's owner Liz Simpson searched the internet and found that a horse identical to their new arrival has been reported stolen they decided to get in touch with Ms Newcome-Baker. She said the horse was returned - free of charge. She said: 'Seeing the bond that exists between Teresa and Quincey, even after three years apart, confirmed to us that giving the horse back to the owner was undoubtedly the right thing to do. 'Teresa has had Quincey since he was 14-months-old and he knew who she was when he saw her. 'It really was a very touching moment and we're delighted that Teresa can look forward to happier times, having Quincey back where he belongs.'","Teresa Newcome-Baker had lost hope of seeing her bay cob Quincey again .

Marissa, Marissa, Marissa: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's looks may be one explanation as to why her career has been so successful . In Marissa Mayer's first year as the head of Yahoo, the company saw a stock price boost of 74.6 per cent. While some may point to Mayer's leadership skills or many years at rival Google as reasons for the company' s recent boom, there's always another explanation to consider: her looks. Ever since Richard Nixon lost to John Kennedy in their televised presidential debates, scholars have been pondering whether attraction has something to do with success - an academic field of study called Pulchrinomics. The New Yorker references a working paper released by researchers at the University of Wisconsin last month which seems to bolster the idea that pretty people have it easier.The Wisconsin researchers studied the 677 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and how stock prices were impacted for the five days after their appointments were announced. The CEO's headshots were run through a program that calculates attraction based on seventeen facial criteria, and for each point of attraction on a ten-point scale, the CEOs' companies noticed a once per cent boost in stock price. Those results seem to confirm an earlier study published in 1994 by Daniel Hamermesh - the father of pulchrinomics - and economist Jeff Biddle. Skyrocketed: In the year after Mayer's appointment to the position of CEO at Yahoo, prices in the company went up 74.6 per cent. Scholars of Pulchrinomics would say her attractiveness helped boost the company's stock value . For the 1994 study, Hamermesh and Biddle evaluated data on thousands of U.S. and Canadian workers from the late 1970s. Each worker was given an attraction rating, and researchers found that workers who were rated above average for attraction earned a five per cent premium over just average-rated workers. That difference translated to the average-rated workers who made 10 per cent more than the below-average attractive workers. Researchers also discovered that the above-average attractive workers tended to have jobs which capitalized off their looks in some way. Pretty people win: Ever since Nixon 'lost' to Kennedy in the 1960 televised presidential debates, scholars have been wondering about the connection between attractiveness and success . The problem with beautiful people making more money is that it goes against the American idea that all you need to do is work hard to achieve success. But that's still true in one important way. While Hamermesh believes attraction does have a positive impact on earnings, there's still one great equalizer that trumps a pretty face: education. Hamermesh says that 'each additional year of education represents a ten per cent increase in earning potential'. It's true - those with a master's degree earn on average 400,000 more in a lifetime than those with just a bachelor's degree. So if you're not a looker, just keep your head in the books.","A new working paper released last month found that Fortune 500 companies with attractive CEOs did better on the stock market .

The . photo sold at an auction in New England for $62,500 is unrecognizable when compared to the bright lights and bustling energy of Broadway today. The New York Daily News reported that on the back of the photograph it said, 'taken the last of October, when nearly half of the leaves were off the trees.' The real deal: This photo sold for $62,500 at an auction a few years ago and shows a quite different Broadway than the one we know today . The photo is likely of Bloomingdale road which became Broadway in 1899, reported Gizmodo.com. The New York Daily News reported that Bloomingdale road is now what would be Manhattan's Upper West Side. The photograph referred to the location as being 'the main road' and is thought to be an extension of Broadway. The photo is a daguerreotype, a style of photography invented by Louis Daguerre and Joseph Niepce in 1839. It is one of the earliest photographic processes and is the world's first permanent camera, according to The Daguerreian Society. Daguerre was a visual artist and a developer of the diorama theater. Neipce invented the world's first image capturing heliograph in July 1822 and when the men joined forces they were able to create a contraption that would capture an image that could later be developed into a photograph. According to daguerreobase.org, 'A daguerreotype consists of a silvered copper plate, which bears the image, and a housing to protect the plate.' The photo was then developed in a dark room in two ways: either by exposing the plate to heated mercury or by exposing the plate to solar rays through a red filter. Broadway today: Towering skyscrapers and blinking lights replace trees and quaint estates . The daguerreotype (pictured here) was invented by Louis Daguerre and Joseph Niepce in 1839 and is the world's first permanent camera . Gizmodo reports that the daguerreotype made it's way from France to New York in 1839 and very few photos have survived. Therefore, there may be an old photo of New York somewhere else but it is highly unlikely. The oldest photo surfaced yesterday when a twitter user by the name of NewYorkologist posted a photo he claimed was the oldest. It read, 'Believed to be the oldest photograph taken of New York City.-Broadway 1850.'

Thousands of cancer patients are being denied urgent tests by their GPs, figures show (file picture) Thousands of cancer patients are being denied urgent tests by their GPs, figures show. Family doctors are typically referring fewer than half of all victims for fast-track appointments that are meant to ensure they have the best chance of survival. Campaigners say some patients with bowel cancer – one of the most common forms – have been back to their GP two or three times before being diagnosed, having initially been told they have irritable bowel syndrome. The figures are revealed in league tables, published yesterday by NHS England, which rank surgeries by diagnosis and treatment for cancer and some other illnesses. Government guidelines state that all patients suspected by their GP of having cancer must be referred for an urgent appointment with a hospital specialist within two weeks. But the data shows that in one practice, 1 Marine Parade, in Lowestoft, Suffolk, only 6 per cent of patients were sent for these fast-track consultations. At the Apollos Surgery in Birmingham only 7 per cent were referred within two weeks, while at the A. S. Khan surgery in Field Road Walsall it was 7.7 per cent. But there were 18 practices where 100 per cent of patients had been given appointments within two weeks. None of the GP surgeries with the worst figures was available to comment. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the figures showed ‘unacceptable variation’ across the country. ‘Every single patient in the NHS has a right to the very best care,’ he added. Shocking: At 1 Marine Parade, left, in Lowerstoft, Suffolk, only 6 per cent of  patients were sent for fast-track consultations. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, said there was 'unacceptable variation' across the UK . The figures also suggest that thousands of patients who have suffered strokes or mini-strokes are not being prescribed blood-thinning drugs by their GPs to prevent them happening again. In the worst practices, 40 per cent of stroke victims were not being given this medication. The number of knee replacements and cataract removal have fallen to their lowest level for five years, figures showed yesterday. Campaigners say thousands of the elderly are being denied vital treatment to improve their quality of life due to NHS rationing. Figures from Dr Foster Intelligence, which analyses performance across the Health Service, show the number of cataract removals dropped from 327,210 in 2010-11 to 321,957 last year. Decline: The number of knee replacements and cataract removal have fallen to their lowest level for five years . The numbers of patients receiving a new knee, because of arthritis or a break, fell slightly, from 82,122 in 2011-12 to 81,572 last year. Steve Winyard, head of campaigns at the RNIB, formerly the Royal National Institute for the Blind said: ‘It is scandalous that some commissioners continue to restrict access to cataract surgery through the use of arbitrary thresholds, and that they do so without a robust evidence base and without being able to demonstrate that they will not harm patients.’","Doctors are referring fewer that half of victims for fast-track appointments .

'Perhaps these words are introduced . through popular culture, for example movies ... so they catch on,' said . Mary Azzoli, of Marist. 'It has a lot to do with how accepted and how . popular they become in every day speech.' 'Whatever' has had people grinding their teeth for decades after the catchphrase of Nineties Valley girls in California went global thanks to movies such as Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash and Elisa Donovan. A poll by New York's Marist College of 1,100 people earlier this month found that 'whatever' was the most annoying word in conversation - for the fifth year running . The number of people irritated by 'whatever' was up 6 per cent on last year, the poll revealed. Those surveyed were asked what words they would like banned when talking about politics. The answers were: . Obamacare - 41 per cent . Shutdown - 30 per cent . Gridlock - 11 per cent . Fiscal cliff - 10 per cent . Sequestration - 4 per cent . Unsure - 4 per cent . Those who were most annoyed by the catchphrase were men from the Midwest, aged 45 to 59, who hadn't been to college.

The fairy lights will not go out on Arsenal's title tilt this Christmas but recent history will count against them should they surrender top spot in the Barclays Premier League this coming weekend. Heading into the Yuletide period, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea are all in with a shout of being top on Christmas Day and there could hardly be a greater incentive - the last four title winners were also all top of the tree heading into the festive period.

Of course, it offers no assurance of success but it is an encouraging omen and one that is only accentuated when we look a little further back to discover that seven of the last nine Premier League champions assumed first place on Christmas Day. Arsenal can guarantee their place at the summit with a win over Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Monday evening but should they falter, others could move in to seal the Christmas No 1. Liverpool, who have scored 14 goals in their past three leagues games, will leapfrog Arsene Wenger's side with victory at home to Cardiff on Saturday lunchtime and - courtesy of a superior goal difference - they will remain there for Christmas should Arsenal fail to defeat Chelsea. As for Jose Mourinho's side, they will only go top if they take all three points from the Emirates and if Liverpool are unable to beat Cardiff on Saturday. Yet with just four points separating Arsenal in first and Everton in fifth, the title race has rarely been more difficult to call. Last week's humbling at Manchester City offered the first indications that the wheels may be coming off Arsenal's pursuit. The Gunners appearing exhausted after a gruelling schedule pitted a Saturday lunchtime kick-off at the Etihad in the same week as assignments against Everton and at Napoli. For seasoned Arsenal followers though, defeat against Mourinho's Chelsea would feel so wearingly typical - Wenger is still to defeat the Portuguese manager in nine previous meetings. Fortunately for Arsenal, imperfections remain among their title rivals. City themselves continue to belie their majesty at the Etihad with listless showings away from home, where they have conceded more than they have scored and a trip to Fulham this weekend is exactly the kind of match they must negotiate to back up their flamboyant showing against Arsenal. Leading man: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . Sniffing around: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . In with a shout: Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho . Feeling Blue: Chelsea are within striking distance of the summit, but crashed out of the Capital One Cup last night after Sunderland's Ki Sung-Yong (second left) scored the extra-time winner . In Luis Suarez, Liverpool have the gift that keeps on giving but the next fortnight represents an acid test of their credentials. For Brendan Rodgers' side, it will be a Christmas in the workhouse, with visits to Manchester City and Chelsea before Big Ben strikes on New Years Eve, in a three-day double-header that will reveal much about the durability of the Anfield challenge. There is no shortage of Christmas crackers to come, as Chelsea, whose form remains unconvincing, pockmarked by sloppy defending and a misfiring forward line will also come under pressure, facing Arsenal, Liverpool and a visit to Southampton. At some point, the threat from Goodison Park must be taken more seriously. The challenge for Everton will be keeping their first-team fresh and ready to shine but Roberto Martinez has four pretty negotiable fixtures upcoming - Swansea, Sunderland, Southampton and Stoke. The statistics read less favourably for Manchester United, who will be placed no higher than sixth on Christmas Day, and possibly below, should Tottenham or Newcastle win their respective matches. What they're playing for: Sir Alex Ferguson lifts the Premier League trophy last May . Leading light: Arsenal are top of the Premier League but have stuttered recently and were thumped 6-3 at City - Alvaro Negredo here scoring the second past Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny . United, may, however sense an opportunity to cut down that 10 point gap. As their rivals face off in quick succession, Yuletide resembles a season of goodwill for the Champions with West Ham, Hull and Norwich next on the agenda. Only once before has a team languishing in sixth on Christmas Day gone on to lift the Premier League title - Arsenal's 1998 side, which went 21 games unbeaten, winning 18 of those after a poor first half of the season. You would imagine that David Moyes now requires a similarly improbable run of stunning consistency to hand United any chance whatsoever of retaining their crown. Standing out from the crowd: West Brom fans celebrate survival in 2005 when they became the only side bottom at Christmas to avoid the drop . Champagne moment: Baggies2005 boss Bryan Robson celebrates completing mission impossible. Sunderland of 2013/14 will be hoping to emulate West Brom's feat . Never before has a team positioned below sixth on Christmas Day recovered to win the Premier League title. If you think United's chances are slim, spare a thought for poor old Sunderland, who are already consigned to bottom spot this Christmas, after recording a measly nine points so far this season and falling four points adrift of fellow strugglers Crystal Palace and Fulham. History dictates that Gus Poyet's side are all but finished - only one side that was bottom at Christmas have recovered to stay up in the Premier League era - Bryan Robson's West Bromwich Albion in 2005.

She might have earned the title 'Fit Mom' with her impeccably toned body post three children. But Maria Kang, 32, from Sacramento, California, finds keeping in shape a constant struggle because she's not genetically predisposed to looking 'like a model' or 'Barbie doll.' In her twenties she suffered from bulimia, which saw her weight fluctuate dramatically. At her heaviest, her 5ft 4in frame tipped the scales at 152lbs - putting her in the overweight category. Scroll down for video . Fit mom: Maria Kang, 32, from Los Angeles, California, (pictured in 2007) says keeping in shape is something she has to work hard at because she's not genetically predisposed to 'look like a model' In an interview with MailOnline, she reveals how she started feeling self-conscious about her body from a young age. Often she would compare herself to her taller, leaner sisters or supermodels in magazines. 'I was always heavier . . . I was chunky. ' she said. Her mother also battled weight problems and was put on a special diet in a bid to cure diabetes and high blood pressure. Becoming aware of the connection between food intake and weight, Ms Kang says, was a trigger for her eventual disordered eating. Lots of hard work: The petite brunette was overweight and suffered from bulimia before getting in shape - she said the real turning point was meeting her husband and falling pregnant with her first child . Feeling 'lost' in her early twenties, the self-described 'pear-shape' brunette would binge and purge on sweet foods two to three times almost every day of the week. 'I used disordered eating to fill an empty void. It was worse when I was feeling anxious. People often call bulimia the ""good girl drug"" because we don’t do drugs or drink alcohol we just abuse food.' 'I had to let go of being perfect, When I became pregnant with my first child I was like ""Wow this is what my body is really made for""' As is often the case with bulimia, Ms Kang saw her weight yo-yo and her metabolism 'shut down'. Although friends and family were aware of what was happening, they didn't know how to help. In the end it was Ms Kang who made the conscious decision to start 'loving' herself. Determined to get physically fit and healthy, she started practicing mindful eating. However, the real turning point came . when she met her husband, David Casler, in 2007 and fell pregnant with . her first son two years later. 'I . had to let go of being perfect,' she said. 'When I became pregnant with . my first child I was like ""Wow this is what my body is really made . for.""' Bouncing back: This photograph shows Ms Kang one week after giving birth with her first child . Made for motherhood: Ms Kang said she got healthier with each pregnancy through diet and exercise - here she is pictured carrying her first child in 2009 (left) and her third son in 2011 (right) Looking back on her days as a bulimic, on her blog she writes: 'It was a horrible habit. 'I felt like I had no control over my  mind and I had such self-defeating thoughts. I felt a variety of emotions, sadness, guilt, emptiness.' After giving birth she started treating herself 'kindly' and eating right. Because she was in a regular pattern the pounds slipped away and she managed to slim down to 125lbs. 'I think fitness always makes me . happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your . life' Ms Kang fell pregnant with another boy a year later in 2010 and again in 2011. Each time, she said she was able to bounce back because the foundations of a 'toned figure' were already in place. Offering a tip to other women she said: 'Be fit before you get pregnant.' Now her favorite parts of her 125lb, . size 2 body include her arms and 'toned abs' but she is less . enthusiastic about her 'short', 'muscular' legs. 'I don’t have long legs. I never wear skinny jeans.' Ms Kang came to the public's attention last month when she posted a photograph of her toned post-baby body to Facebook, captioned 'What's your excuse?' Stirring trouble: Ms Kang came to the public's attention last month when she posted this photo of her toned post-baby body to Facebook . The photo, which Ms Kang has since used as her profile picture, shows her knelt alongside her three young sons, dressed in a workout bra and matching micro shorts. While many of her 256,000 followers cited her as an 'inspiration' some also accused her of being 'insulting', 'obnoxious' and a 'fat shaming bully'. Indeed, one woman wrote: 'You are . . . hurtful to women and think way too much of yourself. Disgusting is what you are!' 'If I can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues, then you can too!' And a mother-of-two named Sarah added on Ms Kang's website, mariakang.com: 'I have two kids and both have caused my skin to stretch soo bad my stomach, from my rib cage straight down the the middle of my vaginal area, look like the U.S. road atlas. 'People like you who post pictures like this make people like me cry because I know that without surgery to lose the extra skin I will never look like you.' But Ms Kang told MailOnline that she was merely being 'playful' and saying if 'if I can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues, then you can too!’ To maintain her figure she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of 'intense' strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week. Keeping fit and healthy: Ms Kang said that she didn't intend to upset people and she hoped the photo would inspire others to feel better about themselves . Breaking a sweat: The pretty brunette says that she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week . On a typical day she tries to get to the gym before her sons wake up or in-between her morning errands. She . then focuses attention on managing her elderly care homes and fitness . progams for a non-profit she founded, Fitness without Borders, which . promotes fitness education in schools and local communities. 'My issue is that people are often push body image before health.

It’s the ability to be set a goal, take action, remain consistent and create a result. that process takes a lot of discipline.' she said. When it comes to food she likes to eat protein and carbohydrates at each meal. Describing her daily diet she said: 'I have eggs and oatmeal or eggs and fruit for breakfast. 'On the go I like to eat nuts – mainly almonds. Lunch I usually have what we had for dinner the night before. Today it will be turkey meatballs and sweet potato fries. I love salads too.' But it's not all clean eating and, as a busy mother-of-three running on a budget, Ms Kang has admitted to eating fast food, especially when it’s convenient with her kids in tow. 'I think fitness always makes me happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your life' Starting from a young age: She says her sons know how to do sit-ups because they watch her workout . ‘There are healthier fast food options that are affordable. for example, I like the $1.50 grilled chicken wraps from Taco bell.' Two of her other biggest temptations - bar pre-made chicken wraps - are dark chocolate and red wine. Concluding on the topic of fitness and health she said: 'I think that we’re obviously struggling as a nation with our weight and it’s a sensitive issue. 'My issue is that people are often push body image before health. Right now, I’m talking about health.’ 'I work to be a role model. It's important to love yourself and remember to strive to be better physically, professionally and personally.'","Maria Kang, 32, from California, caused outcry when she posted a photo of her toned post-baby body to Facebook, captioned 'What's your excuse?'

A man who left an elderly grave digger with horrific facial injuries after mugging him has been jailed for 10 years. Eric Hicks, 74, was on his way home to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary with wife, Doreen, when he was set upon by Jamie Evans. He had just completed a day of voluntary work at Atherton Cemetery in Greater Manchester when he was repeatedly punched, leaving him with a fractured cheek bone, cuts and bruises. Behind bars: Jamie Evans, 32, has been jailed for 10 years after leaving elderly gravedigger Eric Hicks with these horrific facial injuries, including a fractured cheek bone, pictured, in a brutal assault . Mr Hicks, who has volunteered at the cemetery for 15 years, agreed to let pictures of his bruised and bloodied face be released by police to help them track Evans down. He was today branded a 'coward' by police as he was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court after it emerged that Evans had previously threatened to stab a disabled man in his own bedroom. The attack against Mr Hicks happened on November 30, 2011, as he left to celebrate his golden wedding anniversary. Jamie Evans, pictured, mugged and brutally beat up elderly gravedigger Eric Hicks who was on his way home to celebrate 50th wedding anniversary . He noticed Evans walking towards the cemetery as he put his German Shepherd in his car and told him it was now closed. However, Evans punched Mr Hicks in . the face so hard that he fell to the floor. Evans then told Mr Hicks . that he had a knife and ordered him not to scream or shout. When Mr Hicks fell unconscious, Evans rifled through his pockets stealing his keys, cash, bank card and a torch. Following the attack Mr Hicks regained consciousness and staggered into the road where he flagged down a couple in a passing car. They alerted the emergency services and went to bring Mrs Hicks to be with her husband. He was taken to be hospital where he was treated for a fractured cheek bone, a . serious cut to his lip and several other bruises to his ribs, body and . neck and has suffered permanent sensory injuries as a result of the attack. Evans was linked to the scene by DNA which was discovered on the torch that he had robbed off Mr Hicks. Following the case detective sergeant Nigel Rigby said: 'These incidents were vicious, unprovoked and cowardly and the level of . violence used, particularly in the robbery, to take a few items of . little financial value was wholly unnecessary. 'The community was obviously appalled by the violent robbery. 'Evans . is a violent man who targeted vulnerable people and thankfully he has . now been put behind bars. I hope this sentence brings some comfort to . his victims, the victim's family and the community.' Brutal beating: Jamie Evans was only caught after his victim Eric Hicks, 74, who has been left with permanent sensory damage, agreed for these pictures of his injuries to be released in a police appeal for information . At the time of the attack Mr Hicks' daughter Sue Metcalfe, . 47, said: 'My father wouldn't hurt a fly. This has sickened me and our . whole family. 'Dad told . me he thought the man was going to kill him. I am absolutely disgusted . that some loser, some scum, can inflict such injuries on a man of 72 . years. 'The fact that . he had been tending his sister's grave, and it was his and my mum's . golden wedding anniversary, just makes it even more sickening.' She added that, despite the attack, Mr Hicks plans to continue his voluntary work at the cemetery. 'At . the moment, he says he wants to go back to work, but only in daylight. We would rather he stopped altogether, but it is something that keeps . him busy, and lets him get the dog out, too. 'It . was unfortunate that he had put the dog away in the car, because it . would have protected him. He said it was breaking his heart hearing it . barking and howling to get out as he was being attacked. 'I . hope the man who did this feels miserable for what he has done.

'Huge numbers' of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria could place a major strain on Britain’s education system, Sir Michael Wilshaw warned last night. The Government faced a ‘big job’ in ensuring England has enough quality teachers to cope with the potential influx from the two countries when immigration restrictions are lifted at the end of this month, said the Chief Inspector of Schools. ‘Obviously I have got concerns about that,’ he said. ‘If we get huge numbers of children from overseas and from Eastern Europe coming in, we have to have enough teachers to teach them and resources available in schools.’ Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Chief Inspector of Schools, said he 'huge numbers' of migrants could place a strain on the education system . England’s schools are already facing a potential classroom crisis as they deal with a rising birthrate which is being partly fuelled by immigration. A survey by the Local Government Association in September found that almost half of England’s school districts will have more primary pupils than places within two years. Some areas face a 20 per cent shortfall, according to analysis of official date from 2012. He said schools needed the right number of teachers and resources to educate increased numbers of pupils . Sir Michael also said grammar schools are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’ and had almost no role in improving the education of the poor. ‘A tiny percentage are on free school meals – three per cent. That . is a nonsense,’ he said. ‘Anyone . who thinks grammar schools are going to increase social mobility needs . to look at those figures. I don’t think they work.’ His comments angered .

A young woman rescued from a cliff face after an abseiling accident did not know her boyfriend had fallen to his death as he was trying to help her. Katherine Donohue, who is in her 20s, and her boyfriend Darren Bull, 34, had been abseiling in the Blue Mountains in Australia, in an area west of Sydney, on Saturday. They were halfway down a 200-metre descent in the popular climbing area known as Malaita Point when the accident occurred. Police said Miss Donohue ran into difficulties when her rope became tangled. She started calling for help and Mr Bull went to her aid. But . as he started out on his rescue mission, he plunged to his death - an . incident that was not witnessed by his stranded girlfriend. Mr . Bull's family did not wish to talk about his death, but friends from . the Macquarie University Football Club remembered him today as a man . with a 'big heart and a big personality'. Teammate Simon Lawrenson told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'He was quiet... but once you really got him to open up, he was hilarious.' Inspector Ken Shack-Evans of Katoomba Police said: 'They commenced abseiling in this area and shortly after have struck difficulties with the female becoming stranded on the rope halfway down the abseil. Beauty: Australia's Blue Mountains are popular with climbers and usually seen as a safe place to abseil . 'Unfortunately, the male person, a bit further down the abseil, fell off the cliff edge.' The Blue Mountains National Park covers more than 10,000 sq km and stretches 220km from north to south. It lies just 60km from the centre of Sydney. The area ranges in elevation from sea level to 1,334 metres on the Boyd Plateau . Accidents are relatively unusual, but do occur. In September this year, British man Gary Tweddle was found after he vanished in Sydney having apparently taken drugs. The trapped woman continued to call help and her cries were heard by a tourist, who raised the alarm. Specialist police climbers were able to reach the woman, who was winched up the cliff to safety. Police said she was still unaware that her boyfriend had died when she was rescued. His body was located at the base of the steep cliff, but police and other climbing experts said recovering it would be a dangerous mission. Steve McNamara, a freelance cameraman who arrived at the scene, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the recovery operation involved moving the body into a position so that a helicopter could lift it out. A spokeswoman from the Ambulance Service of New South Wales said emergency personnel had constructed a rope system allowing experts to reach the stranded woman and lift her to the top of the cliff. It was not known whether the couple were experienced abseilers.","Katherine Donohue ran into difficulties in Australia's Blue Mountains .

A young woman critically injured in Britain’s worst ever motorway pile-up – a crash that claimed the lives of her father and sister – has given birth to her first child. For Emma Barton, 21, the arrival of son Gianni ten days ago is a Christmas miracle, as surgeons said her chances of becoming a mother after the horrific smash were ‘remote’. She was left in a coma following the crash on the M5 in Somerset on November 4, 2011. Seven people died and 100 others were hurt in the incident. Emma Barton gave birth to Gianni ten days ago. The 21-year-old lost her father and sister in last year's crash . When Emma regained consciousness, her first question to medics was: Will I still be able to have a baby? After being told her injuries – bruising on the brain, two collapsed lungs, five broken ribs, two fractures of  the pelvis and a crushed foot after being cut free from the wreckage – were so severe that the chances were remote, Emma was left heartbroken. But, defying the odds, she gave birth to her healthy 8lb 11oz son on December 12 by caesarean section, and Gianni’s birth has been a blessing for a woman whose life seems to have been stalked by tragedy. Her mother, Teresa, was diagnosed with a brain tumour when Emma was just a year-old, and died aged only 46 in 2005. Ms Barton's car was trapped under a lorry in the pile-up which has been described as the worst in Britain's history . Then the motorway pile-up robbed her of her 67-year-old father Michael and her elder sister Maggie, 30. ‘Gianni means Christmas is back on the agenda,’ she says. ‘Having a baby is the start of a new family and new life for me.’ Emma and husband Chris Burbell, 25, hope the tragedies  of the past are now behind them. Emma and her family were driving back to their home in Windsor from a funeral in Cornwall at the time of the accident. Earlier this month Geoffrey Counsell, who was  in charge of a fireworks display close to the motorway on the night of the crash, was cleared of breaching health  and safety laws. ‘When I saw Gianni I thought he looked just like my dad, which was a wonderful. We’ve given him the second name Michael in memory of him,’ says Emma. ‘The past years have been full of pain. Now Gianni has wiped away the sadness.

Spotlight: Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in 2012, 12,909 parents in England and Wales were taken to court for failing to ensure their children go to school (file picture) Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in 2012, 12,909 parents in England and Wales were taken to court for failing to ensure their children go to school. Of these, 10,185 were found guilty and sentenced - a 3.5 per cent rise on 2011’s figures of 9,836. Two-thirds - 6,871 were fined; 516 undertook community service and 20 were jailed. The number of convictions has risen more than fivefold from 2001 when only 2,243 were prosecuted and 1,845 found guilty and sentenced. Between 2001 and 2012, 71,552 parents have been convicted and 173 jailed. The MoJ will release figures for 2013 next May. Among the parents recently sanctioned is mother-of-six Kelly Murphy, 35, from Cardiff, who was jailed after her two teenage daughters attended fewer than a third of their school days. She was sent to prison for 16 weeks in June after pleading guilty to two offences of failing to secure the attendance of the girls aged 16 and 14. Cardiff magistrates’ court heard that the girls had made just 59 and 56 attendances respectively out of 182. Leah Griffiths, defending, told the court that Ms Murphy had withdrawn pocket money, mobile phones, laptops and even refused to buy Christmas presents in a bid to make them go to lessons. Magistrates gained new powers to deal with the parents of truanting children in 2000, when the maximum fine they could impose was more than doubled from £1,000 to £2,500. Since September 2012, head teachers have been able to impose a £60 spot fine on parents, rising to £120 if it goes unpaid. This compares to just £50 under the previous government. The time limit for paying has also slashed cut from 28 to 21 days for a £60 fine and 42 to 28 days for a £120 charge. Excuses: The results also suggested that parents might be attempting to get around the new rules by claiming sickness as the reason for absences (file picture) Meanwhile legislation came into force in England this September which scrapped a system that allowed head teachers to grant ‘authorised absences’ to pupils to go on holiday during term time. Now they can only approve days off under ‘exceptional circumstances’. A recent survey found that a quarter of head teachers have fined parents for flouting the new rules. The survey of more than 800 primary school head teachers and deputies in England - conducted by The Key consultancy service - also suggested that parents might be attempting to get around the new rules by claiming sickness as the reason for absences. Latest figures show that ‘unauthorised absences’ between September 2012 and March this year increased from 0.9 per cent to one per cent. This meant that around 63,000 youngsters were missing lessons without permission on a typical day. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘It’s clear from the figures there’s been a crackdown. ‘It would be good to have evidence of how successful this approach is. I suspect that many of the families are dysfunctional and a criminal conviction isn’t necessarily going to be that effective in giving the young person the start in life that we would want. ‘Clearly, to get as much out of life as you can, you need the best possible education. It’s important you should be in schools. But I wonder if it would be more effective making sure that within schools there’s provision that enhances the lives of those who are deciding to truant.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. ‘That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay.’","The Ministry of Justice figures come as Coalition focuses on the issue .

A Batman impersonator who was caught on CCTV handing in his friend to the police earlier this year has been spared jail today after being found guilty of burglary. Stan Worby, 40, took Daniel Frayne, 27, to a Bradford police station in February to answer an arrest warrant issued over claims he tried to cash a stolen cheque. Just like with the real Batman, the public wanted to unmask the hero - and father-of-five Worby was eventually identified. But today Worby stood in the dock - minus his costume - to be sentenced for a burglary seven weeks later in which he and Frayne stole almost £800 worth of power tools from a garage. Scroll down for video . Batman impersonator Stan Worby, who was caught on CCTV handing in his friend to the police earlier this year, was spared jail today after being found guilty of burglary . This image of Worby handing over Daniel Frayne to police in Bradford, West Yorks, in February caught the public imagination - but seven weeks later they were both charged with stealing £800 worth of power tools from a garage . During a one-day trial last month, a jury at Bradford Crown Court found Worby guilty of burglary after hearing that just after 4am on April 14, police found him and Frayne in a silver Mondeo car 50 metres away from a garage that had been burgled. Stashed in the boot was £770 worth of power tools including a drill set worth £150, three grinders worth between £50 and £80, a socket set worth £100 and a box of screwdrivers worth £40. Worby claimed he knew nothing about the stolen goods, and that Frayne had piled them into his car  while en route to a car boot sale. The jury took just half an hour to convict Worby, and Judge David Hatton QC handed him a six-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours in unpaid work and pay an £80 victim surcharge. The court heard that Worby had a 'lengthy record' which started at the juvenile courts, and included burglaries, battery, drug offences and motoring offences. He was given a suspended jail term in 2010 for possession with intent to supply cannabis, and last appeared before courts in September 2011 where he was given an absolute discharge for depositing environmental waste. Frayne, left, was previously sentenced to eight months in prison for . burglary, handling stolen goods and breach of a community order.  Worby was handed a six-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months . Mitigating, Simon Hustler said that Worby had been employed at the time of the burglary by Kirklees Council but was let go from this job after a local paper printed the story of the burglary on their front page. Judge Hatton told Worby: 'You have committed no offences of burglary or attempted burglary for 13 years. 'That is what prevents you going to prison immediately. 'The offence is so serious that it passes the custody threshold, but I impose a sentence of six months' imprisonment suspended for 12 months.' Frayne was previously sentenced to eight months in prison for burglary, handling stolen goods and breach of a community order.","Stan Worby, 40, was filmed in February handing Daniel Frayne to West Yorks police .

Some towns will see their population soar by more than a fifth over the next few years, according to new estimates. The Office for National Statistics says some areas will see expansion of more than 20 per cent between 2011 and 2021, in a population boom that looks certain to engulf much of the south of the country. The forecasts come at a time of political concern over immigration – responsible for around two thirds of current population increase – and the need for large-scale housing construction. Crowded streets: The Office for National Statistics says some areas will see expansion of more than 20 per cent between 2011 and 2021, in a population boom that looks certain to engulf much of the south of England . The Government is also facing pressure from conservation groups led by the National Trust, which says councils are now aiming to meet the pressure for development by building on Green Belt land. According to ONS projections, the population of England will rise from 53.1 million to nearly 58 million by 2021, up 8.6 per cent on 2011 levels. Growth will be at its slowest in the north, it says, with an increase of 4.4 per cent in the North West and 4.9 per cent in the North East. Hart in Hampshire is the UK’s most desirable place to live for the third year in a row. Factors such as life expectancy, crime rates, jobs and schools figure in the annual Halifax quality of life survey. Hart had the healthiest residents – 97.4 per cent in good or fairly good health and average male life expectancy of 82.9 years against a national 79. Nowhere in Wales or Northern Ireland made the ‘top 50’ list, but the Orkney Islands put Scotland in at number 50. This contrasts with a projected 14.2 per cent rise in London; 10.2 per cent in the East region; and 9.3 per cent in the South East. Population pressure will also be high in the East Midlands, which will have to make room for nearly 400,000 more people, an 8.6 per cent increase, and in the South West, where an expected extra 440,000 people will mean a 8.3 per cent rise. Increases of more than a fifth are expected in a string of London boroughs and the districts of Welwyn Hatfield, north of London, and East Cambridgeshire. The town of Boston in Lincolnshire, already one of the most popular destinations for immigrant workers from Poland and Eastern Europe, is set to take another 11,200 by 2021, pushing up its numbers by 17.4 per cent. The population increases in the south and east are in line with the past impact of immigration, which over the past 15 years has seen most new arrivals heading for London and its prosperous  neighbouring areas.

Death: Daniel Jones, who ingested a small but lethal amount of heroin at his home in Wolverhampton . A toddler killed when he took a fatal heroin overdose in . the house where he lived with his drug-addicted parents was failed by social services, according to a report. In May last year, 23-month-old Daniel Jones ingested a tiny but . lethal amount of heroin at the family’s home in Wolverhampton. A serious case review published today concluded those . tasked with looking out for the toddler failed to properly assess the risk . of harm presented to him by his parent’s habitual drug use. If care workers, doctors and health professionals had been . more ‘professionally curious’, had more ‘respectful uncertainty’ and been ‘more . assertive’ in their approach to the family, Daniel’s death may have been . avoidable, it concluded. The report stated there had been ‘a number of missed . opportunities’ to intervene in the boy’s care by the different agencies . involved. However, it also acknowledged there had been ‘examples of good inter-agency . working’. The report’s authors also said despite the . parents’ long-standing drug addiction, none of the care workers involved in the . case foresaw the risk that Daniel might be exposed to heroin, or other . substances. Earlier this year, Daniel’s father Simon Jones, 30, was . jailed for six years after admitting the boy’s manslaughter. His mother . Emma Bradburn, 34, received four years after pleading guilty to allowing the . toddler’s death. Jones fully accepted culpability for his son’s death, admitting he had been taking heroin when his son fell ill. Bradburn was drug-tested following her arrest and found to be clear of the . drug. At their sentencing hearing in July this year, judge Mrs . Justice Thirlwall told the couple it was beyond doubt they had loved their . little boy but, she added: ‘You failed woefully to protect him from the very . obvious dangers you exposed him to. ‘The danger was mortal danger, as you should have realised,’ she said. Following the death, Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children . Board immediately launched a serious case review - carried out whenever a child . has died and abuse or neglect is suspected to have been a factor. The board’s chairman Alan Coe said: ‘What comes across very . strongly from this serious case review is that practitioners who worked with . Daniel and his family should have looked beyond his apparent well-being and . understood what life was like from his perspective. ‘That they failed to do this is clearly unacceptable, and we . have a duty to Daniel to ensure that, as far as is possible, the same thing . doesn’t happen again.’ He added many parents, who had drug addictions, coped with . being parents. The report has put forward 44 recommendations, which have . now either been acted upon or are being implemented, relating to better support . for frontline staff, improvement to working practices and particularly . assessments of the risk harm to a child, and also better inter-agency . communication. Addiction: Daniel's father Simon Jones, 30 and Emma Bradburn, 34,  pictured with their son at their Wolverhampton home. They both used drugs in the house . Both Jones - who had served time in jail for . robbery  and Bradburn, 34, were known to . the addiction services team which at the time was run by the Black Country . Partnership NHS Foundation Trust prior to Daniel’s birth. There was a history of domestic trouble between the couple, . with Bradburn, a heavy drinker, on a prescription for methadone, having been a . heroin addict for 12 years. When she became pregnant with Daniel, they were referred to . Wolverhampton City Council’s children’s services, and following his birth his . development was monitored by health visitors from The Royal Wolverhampton NHS . Trust. The report found that 'Daniel died as a result of an event . that had not been foreseen by any of the professionals involved with the . family' but concluded a more assertive approach by care workers might have made . all the difference. Findings: Had social services been more 'professionally curious' and . been 'more assertive' in their approach to the family, Daniel's death . may have been avoidable, a report today concluded . It acknowledged the parents had not always been . co-operative, but concluded this had made follow-up work all the more . important. However, the report set out the frequent examples where it . found those checks were simply not carried out, or followed through on. There were 11 multi-agency Child in Need meetings between . the parents and care and health workers. But the report’s authors said the . action plans developing out of these meetings were 'not robust and did not . sufficiently address the risks to Daniel of his parents’ substance use.' ‘There do not appear to have been any significant changes . effected by the Child in Need plan over the almost two years that it had been . in place.’ Bradburn, suffering constant pain and disability from a . severe accident prior to the birth of her son, was getting medication from her . GP but also topped up the methadone she was prescribed by taking heroin, she . said, to cope with her on-going discomfort. The report said: ‘Unfortunately there was no collaborative . working between the GP practice and the addiction service, which may have . better addressed her pain and reduced her need for illicit drugs.’ Board chairman Mr Coe said the parents’ drug-use meant their ‘capacity to . meet his needs was compromised’, adding different care and health workers had ‘failed . to fully understand the potential impact of their drug use on Daniel’. ‘Their focus was too much on the parents, and not enough on . their son and the family unit as a whole. ‘Their assessments depended on the parents’ co-operation and . candour, and this was not always forthcoming. ‘Had the practitioners challenged them properly, they may . have appreciated the full extent of the potential risks that Daniel faced.’ Mr Coe added: ‘It is important to stress that things do . change as a result of tragedies like this. Already, we’ve seen a number of . improvements.’ He said the board would be monitoring the implementation of . its recommendations. Aware: Both Jones, who had served time in jail for robbery and Bradburn, . both pictured, were known to the local addiction services team prior to . Daniel's birth . A spokesman for the Black Country NHS trust said: ‘Although . the trust does not provide these addiction services any more, during the 10 . months following Daniel’s death, we took action to improve the way the service . supported the whole family and took into account the impact that substance . misuse has upon a child. ‘These improvements were transferred over to the new . provider when the service was decommissioned in April 2013.’ The Royal Wolverhampton Trust, in a statement, said: ‘Patient . safety is of paramount importance to us so we will take the review’s findings . on board and learn any lessons we can in terms of safeguarding children.’ John Welsby, Wolverhampton council assistant children’s services . director, said it was ‘very clear that more could and should have been done by . the agencies who worked with Daniel and his family, including the council’. He added: ‘If the parents are deemed capable of looking . after their child, they must be given, and be seen to act upon, clear advice . about ensuring their children remain safe.This didn’t happen in this instance.’ He added the council had fully accepted all the . recommendations, had implemented changes, and was ‘determined to do all we can . to help prevent a similar tragedy from happening again’. ‘Once again, I’d like to offer our sympathies to Daniel’s . family and reassure them that, through the changes we and our partner agencies . are making, we will be doing all we can to keep our children and young people . safer in the future.’","23-month-old Daniel Jones ingested drug at family home in Wolverhampton .

Young women are under so much pressure to look attractive that they first start considering plastic surgery aged just 17, according to a worrying new report. One in five girls has thought about going under the knife by the age of 20, compared to just one in nine older women aged 50 or over. And girls are getting younger when it comes to actually undergoing a cosmetic surgical procedure, with the average age for a first op now just 21. The number of young people who are both considering and undergoing cosmetic procedures is rising . While around eight per cent of women admitted they have had some kind of surgical enhancement, a further 21 per cent are actively ‘considering it’ – and only 17 per cent claimed they would ‘never’ have any form of plastic surgery. Botox remains the most popular form of cosmetic treatment in the UK, with a quarter of women who have had some form of procedure having the wrinkly-busting jabs. A further 23 per cent have had a breast enlargement while four per cent have had a breast reduction. One in 14 has opted for a breast reshaping while staying the same cup size. Tummy tucks are the most popular major body surgery, with 16 per cent of women who had surgery undergoing them. But surgery to obtain a celebrity-style thigh gap is on the rise, with nine per cent of women who have ops undergoing liposuction on their legs. The study, conducted by women’s website SoFemine.co.uk also shows fewer operations like eyelash transplants and intimate surgery are also growing in popularity with one in 24 girls having surgery opting for these. Botox remains the most popular form of cosmetic treatment in the UK, with a quarter of women who have had some form of procedure having it . However the very first treatment women opt to have done is split equally between Botox, breast enhancement and facial peels. A huge two thirds of women (66 per cent) said going under the knife made them feel more confident and over half (51 per cent) claimed they did it ‘simply to look better for myself’. But a third (32 per cent) admitted it was to be more attractive to men and 13 per cent had surgery to ‘try to keep a partner’. And in a new trend, 11 per cent insisted surgery enhanced their career prospects by making them look younger and less stressed at work. But worryingly, 16 per cent said they were worried having surgery could become ‘addictive’, as after the high of looking better after an op, they craved changes to other parts of their face or body. However, the poll of 1,042 women revealed just 20 per cent thought surgery was ‘fully accepted’ in the UK. Two in five claimed women still tried to cover up the fact they had had it while 23 per cent believed admitting to having cosmetic surgery risked making you ‘look like a bimbo’. The study also revealed clear surgery trends. While nose jobs and facelifts were seen as the most fashionable ways to look good in the 1980s, these had been replaced by breast enhancements in the 90s. The noughties saw the rise of Botox, while the current most desired operations include thigh gap surgery and bottom enlargement and reshaping, such as the Brazilian Butt Lift, along with gastric bands. But there was also anger at the status of cosmetic surgery in the UK. Almost half (47 per cent) were furious at the lack of consumer protection following the PIP implant scandal, while a third (31 per cent) believed treatments were ‘too easy to get’ and undertaken without proper checks and counseling. Surgery to obtain a celebrity and model-style thigh . gap is on the rise with nine per cent of women who have had operations undergoing . liposuction on their legs . One in five claimed surgery firms used ‘hard sell’ tactics to get women to sign up for ops, while 17 per cent worried the company bosses and surgeons were mainly men who ‘did not understand what women want’. Almost half (47 per cent) were furious at the lack of consumer protection following the PIP implant scandal . However a further 47 per cent complained treatments were too expensive, putting them out of the reach of a lot of people. Worryingly, the high cost of surgery had seen 1.5 per cent of women perform DIY surgery on themselves or a friend, including Botox, fillers and ‘silicone bum boosting’ injections. Commenting on the report, Sofeminine.co.uk Editorial Manager Ursula Dewey said: 'Once seen as the preserve of the old and rich, surgery is now a normal part of everyday life for tens of thousands of young women. 'Some may argue girls are doing it as they feel empowered to take control of their bodies while others complain they are under pressure from society to look good  - but women are thinking about it during their teenage years before they show any signs of aging. 'However what we are seeing is a real schism in the way women think about surgery. While two thirds claim surgery makes them feel confident inside and out, four in five women would be wary of admitting to having it. So while it’s acceptable to go under the knife, it’s still seen as something to keep secret.'","One in five girls have thought about going under the knife by age 20 .

Tragic: City worker Elsa Carneau, 25, was discovered face down in the water at Virgin Active in Kensington, West London, two years ago . One of Sir Richard Branson’s health clubs has been fined £100,000 after a former model drowned in an unsupervised swimming pool. City worker Elsa Carneau, 25, was discovered face down in the water at Virgin Active in Kensington, West London, two years ago. She was discovered face down in the water at the company’s flagship £145-a-month High Street Kensington branch two years ago. Yesterday her grieving parents were in court to hear the company blasted for a series of health and safety failings. Prosecutors said the risks leading to Elsa’s death were ‘entirely foreseeable’ and said managers were responsible for a string of ‘serious shortcomings’. It was revealed that blundering staff didn’t even know the young woman’s identity and were forced to search her clothing after her death. They then falsified paperwork to pretend they had been monitoring the pool in a ‘distasteful’ bid to cover their tracks. But her father, Pierre, 61, said his daughter’s death has left a ‘scar on our lives’ and many questions remain unanswered. He said: ‘We are interested in only one thing - to try and understand exactly what happened, there are still a number of questions. ‘This is the beginning of an explanation. We hope a number of other important things will be addressed in due course.’ Staff discovered Elsa floating in the unsupervised pool at Virgin Active, near London’s Hyde Park, as the closed up on the evening of Saturday, December 3, 2011. The Imperial College graduate and 200m runner had been seen swimming 25 lengths of breast stroke in a ‘relaxed manner’ before the tragedy. She was also seen holding her breath under water while timing herself at the health club, which includes a luxury gym and spa. But it is not known how long the French national was unconscious, as the pool was not manned by a lifeguard or adequately monitored by CCTV. Staff dragged her out of the water and desperately tried to revive her and she was rushed to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where she was pronounced dead. An investigation found ‘serious shortcomings in the management of risks connected with swimming activity at the club’. Prosecutor James Ageros said there were a catalogue of errors and anomalies in risk assessments dating back to 2009. He told Southwark Crown Court that ‘the risks were entirely foreseeable’ and staff failed to check the pool every 30 minutes. Documents on CCTV checks were then falsified on the day of the tragedy by unknown staff members in a ‘distasteful’ bid to cover their tracks. Mr Ageros, who represented Kensington and Chelsea Council, said: ‘There were no recorded checks at all on the day. ‘We say there was deliberate falsification of the records to make it seem as though checks, which had not been done, were done.’ An investigation found staff had not . been properly briefed on potential risk. There were also no signs to . inform visitors the pool was unsupervised. Staff . failed to ensure Elsa filled in a customer questionnaire and were . forced to search her belongings to find her identification. Fining . the club £100,000 and ordering them to pay almost £32,000 costs, Judge . Alistair McCreath said: ‘The first thing that must be said is a word of . sympathy for those who grieve for a young life needlessly lost. ‘A fine cannot be any measure of the value of life that has been lost. ‘It’s . impossible to demonstrate the corporate faults of Virgin Active caused . this dreadful death so I must punish them not for causing that harm. ‘But . I must punish them for the culpability they have, the blame they must . bear, for failures to make proper assessments of risk and to manage that . effectively. ‘This is a . company that generally has a good safety record but it’s equally clear . in relation to the premises where this event happened, the picture is . entirely different.’ 'The risks were entirely foreseeable': Prosecutor James Ageros said there were a catalogue of errors and anomalies in risk assessments at the Virgin Gym branch in Kensington dating back to 2009 . Elsa, who lived with her family at their £1m home in Gunnersbury, West London, switched careers from modelling to finance and had a job at Man Group, the world’s biggest hedge fund. She was working in the client advisory group at GLG Partners, which was bought by Man Group for £1.1billion in 2010. Prior to that she worked as an analyst for investment management firm, M3 Capital Partners, which has offices in London, Chicago, Hong Kong and New York. She had been on the books of Time Models in Zurich where she was described her as ‘a great girl’ who was loved by staff. Simon Antrobus, for Virgin Active, said the business deeply regretted the tragedy, adding that an ‘apology counts for very little in the circumstances.’ He told the court: 'The findings of the investigation, damaging and embarrassing as they are, are out of corporate character for the business. ‘No one thought this was a swimming pool that required constant supervision and it demonstrably did not.’ He said staff have been sacked in Kensington venue and pools across all 112 Virgin Active clubs now have ‘constant poolside supervision’. A Virgin Active spokesman said: 'Elsa Carneau’s family and friends have our deepest sympathies for this tragic incident. 'Health and safety is of paramount importance in our clubs and with our staff.  Following an extensive investigation by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, as well as one by Virgin Active, there has not been any suggestion that Elsa Carneau’s tragic death was related to the health and safety standards at our Kensington club. 'Under Health & Safety Executive guidance, it is not a requirement to have a dedicated lifeguard on duty at the Kensington pool. 'However, the safety of our members is of primary importance which is why we took the decision in 2012 to exceed the requirements of HSE guidance and have a dedicated lifeguard on duty at all times at every one of our pools.' Speaking after the hearing, Elsa’s sister, Heidi, 31, said: ‘It just seems so unreal. We are just trying to work out how this could possibly happen. ‘It makes it very hard to find closure. We are constantly asking, ‘what if?’ and wondering if things could have been changed. ‘It’s out of our control, there is information we don’t have access to, to get the answers we need.’ Describing her younger sister she said: ‘To me, she was bright, very bubbly, energetic, always someone who would stand out. ‘She was very elegant, stylish and was always smiling.’ Standing with his wife Veronique, 59, Mr Carneau added: ‘We are a very close family and life is not the same. It’s a scar on our lives.’","Elsa Carneau was found dead in the pool at Virgin Active in Kensington .

The Lurcher-Saluki cross, nicknamed Wufra, was 10kg underweight and had a broken leg when a mountain rescue team found him in near-freezing temperatures. He had to be carried a mile to safety from Buckden Pike in the Yorkshire Dales on a stretcher before he could be given emergency medical treatment. Home: Helen Coates, 51, who works for The Dog People, took over his treatment and has now taken Wufra in . Christmas: Miss Coates said she could not bear leaving him to find a home as Christmas approached . Vets gave him just two hours to live but two months on Wufra has made a remarkable recovery and is bounding around the garden of his new owner, Helen Coates. Miss Coates, 51, who works for The Dog People in Grassington, North Yorkshire, helped the rescue team nurse Wufra back to health - and just days before Christmas has offered him a permanent home. She said he has received 'a mountain' of Christmas presents from well-wishers who were touched by his plight.

'The day he was brought into us we were told that his organs were failing and his heart beat was half what it should have been. 'He was so skinny and I had to hold him up if he needed the toilet because he just didn’t have the strength to lift himself. 'He wasn’t responsive and it was like he was comatose. Treatment: He was wrapped in a protective sheet to warm him up, and carried a mile down the hill . Harsh weather: The climbers hiked through treacherous conditions carrying Wufra to safety . With his broken leg, he could not have clambered down the rocky hill, and vets gave him two hours to live . Treatment: Here Wufra is pictured shortly after being found, wrapped in a blanket and weary . 'He was given just two hours to live and the vet said he probably wouldn’t make it through the first night. 'We were all amazed but he managed to pull through. It was touch and go for a few days after that but Wufra was eating really well and started to put weight on. 'He was fed every two hours on high-calorie foods and he was given antibiotics. 'When he was rescued he weighed just 13kg and now he weighs 21kg.' Abandoned: Wufra was found with a broken leg and 10kg underweight after three weeks in the cold . Rescue team leader Andy Jackson, 44, said eight members went up and carefully carried Wufra a mile down hill to safety. He said: 'He was so camouflaged he was probably hard to see. 'Fortunately, he was on the side that was protected from the worst of the weather and he had been there so long the grass had started to die where he had been sitting. 'When we eventually moved him, we put him into a casualty bag and onto the stretcher. 'He was happy to see us. He just had nothing in him. There was a lot of bone. He was obviously a thin dog anyway, but it looked like he hadn’t eaten.' Mr Jackson said he thought Wufra, whose name is an anamgram of the team that saved him, Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association, had previously been used for rabbiting as he had scars on his face. Still recovering, he is supposed to be resting, but Miss Coates says he cannot resist running around. She added: 'He’s so loving and an absolute pleasure. 'He’s incredibly lucky to be here and I think if he’d been found just a few hours later it would have been a different story. 'I’m absolutely amazed at how healthy he is now. He is due to have an x-ray on his leg next week but other than that he’s fine. 'He’s not supposed to be doing any running on it until it’s checked but try telling him that. Healthy: After two months, he is now feeling healthier and bounds around his new owner's garden all the time . Presents: Well-wishers have sent dozens of gifts for the lurcher-Saluki cross over the festive season . Progress: He was forecast just two hours to live, but aside from a scan on his leg, Wufra has almost recovered . Vets believe he was used for rabbitting due to his condition, but he is healthy now - though still loves running . 'When I let him out into the garden he runs round and round and there’s no stopping him. 'I think he’s very glad he’s alive and he obviously doesn’t realise he’s recovering from an injury. 'He’s been loving all the visitors he’s been getting too and they often find him lying flat out on the sofa with his legs in the air.

A Chinese newspaper has accused the US makers of computer game Battlefield 4 of 'demonising' their country with 'cultural aggression'. The article, which appeared in military paper Zhongguo Guofangbao last week, also accuses American company Electronic Arts of discrediting China with 'cultural aggression'. The editorial also criticised the plot as 'making no sense' and the language used as 'profane'. Battlefield 4, in which players fight as American soldiers against China, has been criticised by a Chinese newspaper for 'demonising' the country with 'cultural aggression' In the story mode of the first person shooter game, players take control of an American soldier in a conflict against a rouge Chinese general and missions include an attack on Beijing. According to the South China Morning Post, the comment piece read: 'When western countries would make war games in the past, they would settle on Russia if they needed an imaginary enemy. 'But in recent years, with the boosting of China’s national strength, China threat theories run rampant, and foreign companies are increasingly keen to put the Sino-US conflict in their games as a gimmick to attract attention. 'The use of video games…to discredit one country’s image in the eyes of other countries is a new form of cultural penetration and aggression.' In the article Wang Jiahang, an associate professor of journalism at the China University of Political Science and Law, said that the game would distort the values of young people. Battlefield 4 is the latest offering in the Battlefield series from US company Electronic Arts. The games have pitted players against Middle Eastern terrorists, space soldiers and Nazis in the past . Ma Zhengang, vice director for the China Public Diplomacy Association, added that Chinese people should rise up against the image of China the video game presents. The original article was commented on hundreds of times, with some pointing out that the newspaper may have been missing the point. 'Exploboom' wrote: 'I had the feeling that the Chinese were portrayed extremely positively in Battlefield 4. 'In the [game], you actually work with the Chinese military to stop this rogue general, who'd tried to have a promising new leader assassinated and subsequently framed the US as the perpetrators in order to orchestrate a war.' Battlefield 4 is the latest offering in the Battlefield series, which has previously featured Middle Eastern terrorists, futuristic space soldiers and Nazis as enemies for players to fight against.","In computer game players take control of US soldier in fight against rogue Chinese general and in one mission launch an attack on Beijing .

Body image: Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington said she would not rule out surgery to make her a 'pretty girl' admitting she does not feel comfortable with her appearance . Her body is her power, her strength and the root of her success. As Britain's most successful swimmer ever, Rebecca Adlington's strong limbs have propelled her to Olympic glory. But the 24-year-old today said while she hopes her achievements will inspire women struggling with their insecurities she would not rule out plastic surgery to make her a 'pretty girl'. The swimmer, who hails from Mansfield, admits she does not feel comfortable in her body. It is a body which has driven her to take part in four Olympic finals, winning two gold medals in Beijing and two bronze medals - one in Beijing and another at last summer's London games. While on paper, Adlington should be brimming with confidence, a barrage of abuse inflicted by spiteful critics hiding behind their Twitter handles, has taken its toll. ‘Every day I look in the mirror and go, “God, I’m not pretty,” ’ she said. ‘I’ve got a very big nose. That’s what most of the negative comments on Twitter are about — my nose. ‘People say, “Oh God you look like a dolphin,” or “I didn’t realise they let whales into the Olympics, but at least you should be able to swim faster with a nose like that.”’ 'I’ve always known I’m not particularly attractive. I don’t have high cheekbones and I’ve got big fishy lips. I don’t have a womanly figure — people say I’m butch . . . manly.’ She goes on. Her shoulders are 'too big', Her boobs are 'not big enough'. Her hips are 'getting bigger'. Adlington's insecurities haunt her. And it is that insight into the mind of one of the most successful female Olympians this country has seen, which the now retired-swimmer hopes will help young girls. In an interview with the Times Magazine she said it is important for women to realise that true beauty is not the slim image of perfection, so sought-after by celebrities. She said she hopes her honesty will resonate with others, helping them in their battle with insecurity. She said: 'I will always be insecure and I will always look in the mirror and wish I was a pretty girl. 'I was never one of those girls that got any attention. It never really bothered me because it was my swimming that gave me confidence. Tears: The most successful British swimmer of all time broke down while filming ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, admitting she had always battled with insecurities about her body . Engaged: Adlington, who will marry her fiance, fellow swimmer Harry Needs next year, said any decision to have surgery would be hers and hers alone, adding Needs loves her whatever her size or shape . I am very aware that when I look in the mirror, it's not the person who I want to be.' It was while she endured a stint in the Australian jungle for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, the the public first got a glimpse of life inside the mind of the Olympic heroine. She broke down in tears as she admitted she is unhappy with the way she looks, . In an interview with the Daily Mail after she was voted off the show, she said: 'I never went into swimming to be famous. Ask anyone — you don’t. 'And I didn’t expect it. It was the hardest . thing to get used to, particularly people judging you. I thought: “Why . are people judging me for the way I look?” It wasn’t as if I was trying . to be a model. ‘I always had a bit of an insecurity about the way I looked growing up. I knew I wasn’t the most attractive girl at school. 'Even when I’ve been on a night out, no boys would want to talk to me. So those comments hurt.’ The 24-year-old, who retired from swimming in February, said she hopes her honesty will help others facing their own insecurities. Adlington left, after winning one of two gold medals, right, at the Beijing Olympics . But she is resolute, having plastic surgery is a step she would do for herself, and herself alone. She knows her fiance and fellow swimmer Harry Needs adores her, whatever size or shape she is, but said considering surgery as an option is just her way of striving to be the best version of herself. Adlington announced her retirement from the sport, which threw her into the spotlight, in February. But leaving competitive pool behind her, Adlington's passion for swimming remains undiminished. Indeed her next chapter is one she believes will present her biggest challenge yet, as she crafts her legacy to inspire generations of youngsters into the pool. In a statement on her website she says: 'I'm very proud of what I have achieved so far, but my journey is not finished yet. 'My vision is that every child in Britain will be able to swim 25 metres by the time they leave primary school. 'Being able to swim is such a wonderful life skill, and I see this as my greatest challenge in swimming.'","Britain's most successful swimmer ever reveals painful insecurities .

Tepid ratings and a reported production cost of $30 to $40 million per year have spelled the end of Katie Couric's tw-year-old talk show . This according to Deadline, where it was also reported that Katie's lack of draw was hurting ratings of the newscasts that followed. 'While production will continue on Katie through June 2014, we've mutually agreed that there will not be a third season of the show,' said Couric and Disney. 'We’re very proud of everyone’s contributions to making Katie the #1 new syndicated talk show of 2012-2013, and we look forward to the rest of the season.' Too stiff?

The Elf on the Shelf tradition brings joy to millions of children, but for one seven-year-old boy with autism it has helped open up a new world of possibilities. Norrin Quinones-Fontanez's mother, Lisa, told MailOnline that she bought him a toy elf last year and quickly noticed how the daily game of hide-and-seek fostered his communication and imagination. The 38-year-old New York-based writer and founder of the blog site Autism Wonderland continued: 'He liked it, especially after we read the story to him. He liked that ""Elfie"" was in a different place every day.' Close bond: Lisa Quinones-Fontanez bought her autistic son Norrin a toy elf last year and quickly noticed how the daily game of hide-and-seek fostered his communication and imagination . Norrin's behavior also improved as he 'believed that Elfie was watching him' and if he stepped out of line Santa would know. Yesterday, Ms Quinones-Fontanez  said she forgot to hide the red-clothed character and was surprised by her son's quick-witted reaction. 'When I forgot to move the toy Norrin . noticed and moved it. Then he asked me to look for Elfie. I think he . liked the idea of us switching roles.' 'Seeing Norrin excited about Elfie makes the few seconds of finding a new spot makes it worth it' While she acknowledges that Elf on the Shelf is a nightmare for most parents, she says she's 'all for' anything that gets her son 'talking and engaging'. Norrin was diagnosed with autism when he was two-and-a-half years old, at the time he had no speech or 'imaginative play skills'. Ms Quinones-Fontanez said she had suspected long before that something was 'wrong.' In one of her regular blogs for . Parents.com she recalls: 'Norrin was about 16 months old [and] I . remember asking my husband - [but] he dismissed my concerns. The holiday ritual enjoyed by families around the world was inspired by 2005 best-selling children's picture book The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition . 'Experienced mom friends told me I was just being a ""new mom."" My mother told me I was reading too many books. And my pediatrician suggested we wait and see. 'So that’s what I did. I waited. I listened to everyone else instead of going with my gut instinct. 'But I knew. I knew as soon as I took Norrin in for that fist evaluation. I knew when I started flipping through Norrin’s milestone calendar. It was practically empty. 'It brings a little of the holiday magic . to us, rather than having to seek it out. It’s Christmas fun in the . comfort of our home' 'I wasn’t too busy to fill it out, he hadn’t met most of the milestones of a typically developing child. I knew - before the doctor even diagnosed him - that Norrin had autism.' Occupational therapy has helped him to develop communication and social skills and he currently attends a special education school for children with autism. Ms Quinones-Fontanez says at home, playing video games and building with Lego blocks have also proved effective in reducing symptoms. Returning to the subject of Elf on the Shelf, she concludes on Parents.com: 'I’ve read so many negative things about [the ritual]: it’ a waste of time, it’s creepy. 'To me it’s just fun. [It's] our holiday thing. It brings a little of the holiday magic to us, rather than having to seek it out. It’s Christmas fun in the comfort of our home.

A desperate sister started a campaign to get a kidney for her dying sister after she was told she couldn’t donate. But after her plea went worldwide doctors reconsidered and she has now saved her life by giving her  one of her own kidneys. Celebrities including comic Ricky Gervais backed the campaign that Jude Skilton set up for her desperately ill sister, Jo Shipley, in a bid to find her a new life-saving kidney. Jude was three when her sister . Jo was born. Jo was born with spina bifida and at just at eight days old she needed her left kidney removed . In July last year Jo was referred to Bristol's Southmead Hospital and began dialysis.  She was also put on the transplant list - but with no guarantees of a donor . Thousands jammed a hospital switchboard, begging to get tested. But in the nick of time Jude pleaded with doctors to be tested again and was told she could be a donor. Now she has given her little sister the greatest gift of all - a new life. Mum of two Jude Skilton, 35, says: ‘It was the most painful experience of my life but the most amazing too. To see my sister Jo go from death’s door to blossoming before my eyes is nothing short of a miracle. ‘We’ve always had a close bond and taken the mickey out of each other and now I joke I’m  going to be taking the pee out of her for the rest of my life!’ Jude, who is three years older than Jo says: ‘She looked like a doll with her big blue eyes and blonde hair and she laughed constantly. But straightaway it was clear she’d face huge challenges.’ Jude (left) was finally able to give Jo (right) her kidney after being told she couldn't donate . Jo was born with the congenital condition spina bifida - at the base of her spine was a huge fluid-filled lump and although her spinal cord was intact, the bones hadn’t formed properly. At just eight days old, she had her left kidney removed. She underwent numerous operations and suffered from kidney disease but despite her ill health she's always been determined to lead as normal a life as possible. Jude says: ‘She was so gutsy and faced life head on. Her health problems didn’t stop her doing anything. ‘Aged four she’d been in hospital five months having the lump removed from her back and bone grafts. When she came home our mum caught us both sliding down the stairs in a suitcase. ‘She’d climb trees, ride a bike, did everything I did. And our bond was amazing, we’d giggle with each other constantly. Jude says that even as children she was 'so protective of her (Jo) that when I was six I promised that she could have one of my kidneys if ever she needed it' ‘But I was so protective of her and and when I was six I promised that she could have one of my kidneys if ever she needed it. ‘I think it gave her the idea that what was mine was hers - she was always pinching my clothes and makeup as a teenager!’ In their twenties the sisters married and had two sons each, during which time their bond remained strong. And despite kidney disease Jo was able to lead a fairly normal life. Jude says: ‘We’d see each other constantly and help out with the kids. We also supported each other when both our marriages broke down. Jude went on to meet and marry her second husband Pete, 33, who runs an extreme sports website. The sisters have always had a close bond and taken the mickey out of each other . In 2010 Jo also met her new partner Ben, now 27, and in 2011 they got engaged. Jude says: ‘It was fantastic seeing her in love.  But then her sparkle began to fade. She was getting slower and said she felt groggy.  It wasn’t like her to complain.’ At the time Jo and Ben were running a pub but had to give up because of Jo’s failing health. Then in July last year Ben had to rush her to A&E at their local hospital, Weston General, in Weston-super -Mare. There doctors delivered the shattering news that Jo had kidney failure. Jude says: ‘She’d lost so much weight where she was being sick all the time and she looked so ill and grey.  When the doctors said her remaining kidney was only functioning at eight percent I knew she was dying. ‘It was unbearable seeing the life draining out of my beautiful sister.’ Jo was referred to Bristol’s Southmead Hospital and began dialysis.  She was also put on the transplant list - but with no guarantees of a donor. Their paternal grandfather, Roy, had died from kidney failure just six years earlier. But Jude stepped in to keep her childhood promise. She says: ‘I told her not to worry, that she could have one of mine.  I’d always meant what I’d said and I wasn’t going to back out now.’ A blood test was carried out to see if she was match. But in 2004 Jude had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which causes muscle pain and in the years that followed she’d suffered other unexplained symptoms. She says: ‘I came up in itchy hives all over my body and I suffered from so much pain and exhaustion that for a long time I could barely leave the house.  If I did I needed a wheelchair to get around. ‘ . Jude Skilton (left), now 35, jokes that she will now be taking the pee out of her sister Jo Shipley, now 33 (right) Her symptoms left doctors baffled. At first they thought they were down to a post-viral infection, then . their thoughts turned to a connective tissue disorder. But Jude’s blood . tests came back clear and after a few years the symptoms diminished . considerably. However, because of her medical past, her application to donate was refused. Jude . says: ‘The bottom felt out of my world.  Worse still, Jo had seen the . medical notes - which revealed that the blood test I’d had proved I was . perfect match. ‘It was unbearable, there I was carrying the one thing that could save Jo’s life yet I was unable to give it to her.’ Jo’s fiance Ben was tested and four of their friends, but none proved a match. But Jude refused to just sit back. She began an online blog about Jo and why she needed a kidney. She says: ‘I decided if I couldn’t help her then I wanted to find someone who could.’ Keeping it humorous, her blog exploded - as it was tweeted it went viral global  - sent on by a host of stars, including comedian Ricky Gervais. Jude says: ‘He sent his best wishes and retweeted the link to his 4.5 million followers - spreading the word about Jo. Other celebrities became involved, including Boy George, H from Steps and some of the Emmerdale cast. Would-be donors ended up jamming the hospital renal unit’s switchboard. Then in October 2012 one doctor reviewed Jude’s medical notes, deciding that her unexplained symptoms were part of her fibromyalgia and nothing more sinister. He concluded her condition may not prevent her from becoming a possible donor. Jude says: ‘I was ecstatic, now was my chance to save Jo but I didn’t realise it was only the first hurdle.’ For the next five months Jude had to fight her corner, trying to convince other medics that she was suitable and that she accepted the risks attached. All the time Jo struggled on, as dialysis became less effective - yet without it she’d be dead within two weeks. But finally Jude managed to convince every single one of them. Last stop was her husband Peter and their children Jake, 16 and Brandon,14. Jude says: ‘They were so scared for me but I tried to reassure them and said it was just something I had to do, that I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do all I could to save Jo.’ Jude sailed through the normal series of tests. And five months ago she was able to give her sister the gift of life as the transplant was carried out at Southmead Hospital via a keyhole procedure. Jude even asked for a picture to be taken of her kidney before it was given into Jo. She says: ‘As a big sister I’d always looked after Jo and I’d made that promise when we were little. ‘When they wheeled her back up onto the ward next to me and I saw her catheter filling up it was the best sight in the world - my kidney was doing its job, the transplant had worked.’ Jo adds: ‘‘What Jude’s done is truly amazing, I’m now back on my feet and I've never felt so good. She’s literally given me life and I’ll never be able to thank her enough. ‘I didn’t realise how ill I was but now I have more energy than my kids.  And Jude’s kidney’s also come with an added extra - her big appetite!’","Jude Skilton, 35, has always been protective of little sister Jo Shipley, 33 .

A quarter of women surveyed said they are very anxious or have been diagnosed with depression . Alarming levels of poor health in women have been exposed in a report which reveals that millions are depressed, in constant pain  and inactive. Nearly half say they suffer from a long-term illness or complaint, while a quarter say they are very anxious or have been diagnosed with depression. A quarter are officially inactive – and do less than half an hour’s exercise a week – while only half are managing to do the bare minimum of physical exertion recommended by the Government. The findings from the NHS’s annual health survey of 8,000 adults  - from the Health and Social Care Information Centre - come a day after figures revealed worryingly high levels of drinking among women over 65. One in seven women of that age consumes alcohol at least five days a week, far more often than the under-40s, according to the Office for National Statistics. Experts are particularly concerned over the levels of inactivity, which have been linked to cancer, heart disease, depression and dementia. Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘These disappointing findings show that even an  Olympic year could not boost  dwindling levels of physical activity in England. Keeping active is one of the main ways we can  all reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease. Physical activity also helps children grow up fit and healthy and protects their hearts into adulthood. ‘We need to educate adults and children alike about the major health benefits of an active lifestyle. 'Being active doesn’t have to cost the earth and there are many activities the whole family can enjoy together, such as dancing, cycle rides or long walks.’ The NHS¿s annual health survey of 8,000 adults found almost half of women said they suffered from a long term illness or complaint . The survey also reveals that 23 per cent . of women are depressed or anxious while 45 per cent suffer from a . long-term health problem such as arthritis, diabetes, heart failure or . asthma. Figures are far lower in men – just 16 per cent suffer depression or anxiety and 36 per cent have a long standing health complaint. Beth Murphy from Mind, the mental health charity, said: ‘This new survey suggests that many people are self-reporting poor mental health, anxiety and depression. She added: ‘Whilst this research shows a difference between the numbers of men and women reporting mental health problems, we know that men are less likely to seek help.’ The survey involves asking lifestyle questions and taking measurements of height and weight of 8,000 adults and 2,000 children. It also found that 25 per cent of women and 24 per cent of men were obese – and 14 per cent of children. The Government recommends that adults do at least an hour and a half’s exercise a week which can include walking, gardening or housework, while children should do three hours. But only 45 per cent of women manage this amount compared to 33 per cent of men.","Quarter of women do less than half an hour's exercise a week .

It would be the perfect festive treat for those looking to keep the weight off –  low-fat chocolate. And scientists claim to have found a way to make it happen. The have come up with ‘choco-lite, which contains microscopic bubbles of a jelly made from seaweed that bulk out the chocolate. Scientists at Warwick University claim they have found a way to make tasty low-fat chocolate using agar bubbles . The agar bubbles are also high in fibre, a natural appetite suppressant. Previous attempts to reduce the fat content of chocolate – usually about 30 per cent – while retaining the taste and texture have failed. For instance, tiny air bubbles leave . chocolate feeling too light, while water bubbles take away the crispness . of the snapping sound and risk a white bloom forming on the bar. So Dr Stefan Bon, of Warwick University, turned to agar, which is already used in the cosmetics industry. Heated in the right way, it solidifies at the same temperature as chocolate. The bubbles are so small that the mouth cannot distinguish them from fat. Jianshe Chen, of Leeds University, told New Scientist magazine: ‘Fat replacer is something the food industry is very keen to have.’ The microscopic agar bubbles are high in fibre and therefore more filling than the fat in normal chocolate . Agar is 80 per cent fibre, meaning it’s a lot more filling than normal chocolate. As for how it tastes, according to this week’s New Scientist, that is ‘pretty darned good’. Dr Bon, who usually works on new recipes for paints and industrial coatings, has tried adding vodka to the mix. This ‘didn’t taste particularly nice’  but he is looking forward to trying out Baileys and amaretto flavourings. Industry experts welcomed the advance but questioned whether the public will embrace healthy chocolate. But Angus Kennedy, of trade magazine Kennedy’s Confection, said: ‘This is very clever and it’s dinner party chat but people don’ t eat chocolate to be healthy.’","Scientists at Warwick University used agar to create 'choco-lite'

A maid was stabbed to death with a meat skewer and another critically injured with a knife during a bloody fight in a laundry cupboard, police have revealed. The pair, both Ethiopian women in their 20s, clashed at their employer's villa in Bar Dubai yesterday morning. Police found them at 11am lying in a pool of their blood after breaking down the door, which had been locked from the outside. Violent affair: One maid died on the way to hospital and the other, who had been stabbed with a knife, is recovering in intensive care . One of the maids, identified only as HSS, died on the way to Rashid Hospital, according to The National. The condition of the other woman, known as FYA, is now starting to stabilise. 'She has been moved out of intensive-care unit, but is still in a . very bad psychological condition,' said Col Ali Ghanem, director of the . Bur Dubai Police station. Most households in Dubai employ foreign maids and some face difficult working conditions. The majority of large properties - particularly those of wealthy Western expats - are built with cramped living quarters for maids and the staff do their employers' washing, ironing, cleaning, babysitting and cooking. According to a survey conducted by the Saudi magazine Sayidaty at the end of last year, more than three million maids in the Arab world are living in deplorable conditions and even more incidents of verbal and physical abuse are reported. Crimes committed by housemaids in Dubai increased by nearly 17 per cent in 2011 and police believe this was mainly because of employers' cruelty as well as workers' ignorance of the region’s traditions. 'She tried to hurt herself and she was banging . her head in the wall. We are not sure of her mental condition, but we . are still waiting until she gets better to be able to question her.' Authorities still do not know what caused the fight between the two women, who worked in the same household along with 10 other maids, but police said there had been no previous fights between the two. 'Employers must be careful in selecting their housemaids,' said Dubai police commander Lieutenant General Dahi Tamim, according to Emirates 247. 'They should keep an eye on them for any abnormal behaviour to ensure they do not have any psychiatric problems.' Another police officer was quoted as saying it was an 'individual crime' which should not be 'generalised'. Major General Khamis Al Mazinah, Dubai’s deputy police commander, said: 'There could be an old dispute between the two… but it is unfortunate that such a violent and ugly crime takes place inside a house, whose owners are not used to this… .

Most parents look forward to seeing their child perform in a school Christmas play, but for one mother, it was a source of fear. Zara Green, whose daughter Connie was born with a bright red birthmark on her nose, said she had dreaded the possibility of her being asked to play Rudolph. Fortunately, an operation to remove the large red growth was successful. Miss Green noticed the birthmark just after Connie was born. At first she assumed it was a pressure mark from the delivery, but after two months the growth had darkened and became lumpy . Miss Green, 27, a former care worker, said: ‘When she was a baby I wondered whether the part of Rudolph would always be set aside for Connie in her Christmas plays. ‘I imagined well-meaning teachers and parents asking us year after year whether she would like the part. ‘Connie would have hated that kind of attention. At pre-school she had to be brave while the other children asked about her differences. ‘Today, I’m left wondering what Connie’s school life would have been like if she hadn’t had the surgery. Would she have felt comfortable? Would she have found it easy to make friends?’ Miss Green, of Slough, Berkshire, fought for Connie to have surgery to remove the red growth at a young age, despite doctors warning her that Connie would not be eligible for the procedure until she turned ten. Connie Lloyd, pictured, had an operation to remove a bright red birthmark on his nose. Her mother had been worried that she would be type cast as Rudolph in the school Christmas play, but Connie played a cat and people no longer associate her with a birthmark at all, her mother said . She said: ‘We noticed the birthmark just after she was born. At first we assumed it was a pressure mark from the delivery. ‘After two weeks, the growth had darkened in colour and had become lumpy. We were told it was a regular birthmark which would disappear of its own accord eventually.’ Miss Green sought a second opinion at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, where specialists diagnosed the mark as hemangioma - a benign tumour - in and around Connie’s nostrils. Connie was prescribed medication to halt the spread of the growth and a consultant advised that she would be able to undergo surgery to remove it completely when she turned ten years old. Miss Green said that her daughter told her at 18 months old that she didn’t like her nose and she wanted one like her mother’s. Miss Green fought for Connie to have surgery to remove the red growth at a young age, despite doctors warning her that Connie would not be eligible for the procedure until she turned ten . ‘It was very difficult to hear. As her mother I wanted to do everything I could for her’, she said. Negative reactions at pre-school eventually prompted Miss Green, her partner and Connie’s father Tom Lloyd, 26, a mechanic, to pursue options for removing the birthmark. ‘Children in Connie’s playgroup were curious and sometimes they would prod at her nose. She found it very upsetting,’ Miss Green said. ‘The school photographer even asked me whether I would like Connie’s birthmark airbrushed out of the final class picture. I found it offensive. Connie was who she was, and we loved every bit her of her. ‘But I started to think about Connie going through her school years, dealing with those kinds of reactions at every turn.

She’s not shy in the slightest. ‘She has loads of friends and loves going to class. Miss Green said that while surgery can be daunting for parents but she had to think of Connie’s future long-term. ‘If I’d had left it to the doctors who suggested we didn’t go for surgery, Connie’s life would have been completely different. ‘I’m so glad we did.

Cancer death rates in the UK have dropped by more than a fifth since the 1990s, according to new figures from a leading charity. In 1990, the disease killed 220 out of every 100,000 people, but by 2011 this figure had fallen by 22 per cent to 170 people in 100,000, according to Cancer Research UK. Improvements in disease prevention, surgical techniques, targeted radiotherapy and drug treatments are all said to have played a part in reducing the death toll. In 1990, the disease killed 220 out of every 100,000 people, but by 2011 this figure had fallen by 22 per cent to 170 in 100,000, according to Cancer Research UK . The decrease in the number of people dying from cancer comes despite an increase in the number cases being diagnosed, largely because cancer is more common in an ageing population. Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘20 years ago I was training to become a cancer specialist, excited by the findings we were making in the laboratory and desperate to see better ways for us to treat the disease in the clinic. ‘We needed to give patients more options and better news about their future. I was impatient for more advances sooner and I still am. But clearly we're moving in the right direction. ‘I've personally seen in my clinics, incredible advances in cures for cancers like leukaemia and improvements in treatment options for prostate cancer. Ground-breaking science in the 1950s led to lung cancer (illustrated) death rates plummeting by 41 per cent in the last 20 year . ‘But no clinician, no researcher and no patient will be happy until we've driven down the death rate even further through research.’ The Cancer Research UK report shows that men are faring slightly better than women. Between 1990 and 2011 cancer mortality for women fell by 20 per cent from 185 to 147 per 100,000 and 26 per cent for men, from 277 to 203 per 100,000. The figures were released to mark the launch of the charity's latest campaign to raise awareness of the importance of scientific research in beating cancer. Ground-breaking science in the 1950s led to lung cancer death rates plummeting by 41 per cent in the last 20 years, the charity said and today research promises to have a similar impact on bowel cancer. A 16-year trial funded by Cancer Research UK has shown how a one-off screening test for bowel cancer could cut deaths from the disease by 43 per cent and potentially reduce new cases by a third. Harpal Kumar, the charity's chief executive, said: ‘The words “you have cancer” are among the most devastating a patient can hear. And for far too long far too many people have had those words ringing in their ears as they leave the consulting room. ‘Today cancer is not the death sentence people once believed it to be. As these new figures show, mortality rates from this much feared disease are dropping significantly as the fruits of research are producing more effective treatments with fewer side effects. ‘But while we're heading in the right direction, too many lives are still being lost to the disease, highlighting how much more work there is to do. ‘Our aim is that one day everyone will beat cancer and the more research we can fund, the sooner that day will come.’","In 1990, the disease killed 220 out of every 100,000 people, but by 2011 this figure had fallen by 22 per cent to 170 in 100,000 people .

The process of extracting natural gas called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is already controversial. But now U.S. scientists have found that fracking uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body’s hormones. These chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects and infertility in previous studies, raising fresh fears about safety. The study looked at 12 suspected or known endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in fracking (a tower in Colorado is pictured) and measured their ability to mimic or block the effects on men and women's reproductive hormones . Researchers from the University of . Missouri found greater hormone-disrupting properties in water located . near drilling sites in Colorado than in areas without drilling. Hormone-disrupting chemicals can be found in man-made products, some foods, water and soil and can interfere with the body's endocrine system, which controls numerous body functions with hormones such as the female hormone oestrogen and the male hormone androgen. ‘More than 700 chemicals are used in the fracking process, and many of them disturb hormone function,’ said Susan Nagel, associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the University's School of Medicine. ‘With fracking on the rise, populations may face greater health risks from increased endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure.’ Shale gas has been hailed a possible ingredient in the UK's future energy mix (a map of reserves is pictured), but now U.S scientists have found the process uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body's hormones . A health watchdog said last month that while fracking is unlikely to cause cancer,more research is needed into its long-term effects. Public Health England (PHE) has criticised a U.S. study, which claimed that residents living within half a mile of a site were slightly more likely to get cancer. Scientists in Colorado used a computer model to predict that there would be an extra ten cases of cancer for those living within half a mile radius of a fracking drilling well. The PHE dismissed the idea that people living near the sites will develop breathing difficulties and other medical problems, saying they ‘know enough’ to allay fears for now - although they admitted that very little research has been carried out into potential harms of the process. Dr John Harrison, director of PHE’s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, insisted that as long as fracking was carried out properly, the potential risks to public health would be ‘low’. He said: ‘The currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to emissions that are associated with shale gas extraction process are low if the operations are properly run and regulated.’ However he conceded that research into the long-term health implications had been ‘limited’ – and said they would need to continue to monitor evidence as it emerged. The study, which is published in the journal Endocrinology, looked at 12 suspected or . known endocrine disrupting chemicals used in fracking and measured their . ability to mimic or block the effects on men and women’s reproductive . hormones. The scientists collected samples of ground and surface water from drilling and accident sites, including: parts of the Colorado River, which is the main source of drainage for the fracking-rich region, parts of nearby Garfield County where there are 10,000 wells and where fracking fluids have been spilled and Boone County sites where there has been no drilling activity. The samples from drilling sites had higher levels of endocrime disrupting chemicals that could interfere with the body's response to human reproductive hormones. Samples taken from the Colorado River had moderate levels, while those taken from sites without drilling displayed little activity. In the U.S., waste water from the fracking process is generally stored in open pits. But if it goes ahead in the UK, it is expected that the waste water would be contained in a closed system if at all possible, to reduce the risk of contamination, according to a recent report produced by UK scientific institutions. Dr Nagel said that in the U.S. fracking 'is exempt from federal regulations to protect water quality, but spills associated with natural gas drilling can contaminate surface, ground and drinking water. ‘We found more endocrine-disrupting activity in the water close to drilling locations that had experienced spills than at control sites. ‘This could raise the risk of reproductive, metabolic, neurological and other diseases, especially in children who are exposed to EDCs.’ The process of extracting natural gas called hydraulic fracturing or fracking is already controversial as there are fears about earthquakes, pollution and contamination. Here, protestors have their say at a fracking site in Balcombe, West Sussex .","Scientists at the University of Missouri discovered that the process of hydraulic fracturing uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body's hormones .

Around 150,000 Britons a year suffer a stroke. Mikey Cousland, 42, a taxi driver from West Lothian, Scotland, had one last year and underwent a new procedure to help him recover movement in his arm, as he tells CAROL DAVIS. After driving my taxi around Edinburgh one Sunday in May 2012, I went to fitness training and then to my granddaughter Mya’s first birthday party. I fell into bed, exhausted. My next shift was due to start at 4am. But when my wife Tracey woke at 5am, I was still asleep. She shook me to wake me up, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get up - my right leg was numb. Nor could I move my right arm or hand, and I couldn’t speak. I’d try to move my mouth but couldn’t think of the words. It was terrifying. I had tests at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert, including an MRI scan of my brain, and was told I’d had a stroke. I was shocked - I was fit with no risk factors such as a family history or smoking. I spent three months in hospital, doing physiotherapy to learn to use my body again. But I was still left in a wheelchair and could barely speak above a whisper. My right arm hung uselessly, supported by a sling. Luckily, I’m left-handed, so I could feed myself.Over three or four weeks, I learned to walk again using a stick, and had speech therapy and physiotherapy. But my right hand was next to useless - I could move my fingers but barely raise my hand. The physiotherapist said to keep trying to move it so my brain could learn new pathways.I still couldn’t form words, so I’d point to things to communicate with Tracey. She stopped work as a taxi driver to become my carer. She even had to dress me. After my speech therapist told me about a trial of a new device that could help, I saw Dr Jesse Dawson at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow in July. He asked me to lift a tiny ball bearing and a marble to test my strength and dexterity, but I struggled and dropped them. Even lifting a baseball cap from the table was difficult. Dr Dawson told me a nerve stimulator would be fitted around my vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen. The stimulator (the size of a matchbox) would be implanted in my chest and linked to an electrode wrapped around the nerve in my neck. It sends electrical signals to activate the nerve to prompt my brain to release more chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that help make connections in the brain. The stimulator would be fired while doing my arm rehabilitation exercises and would hopefully retrain my brain to do the actions. Mikey pictured before the stroke. He underwent three months of physiotherapy . The one-hour operation took place in August under general anaesthetic and I left the next day with dressings on my neck and chest. I had six weeks of physiotherapy, when doctors fired the stimulator using a remote control. At first, I struggled to reach a bottle on the table, but after a few weeks I could do it. It was like magic. When the stimulator was on, I felt an odd tickle in my throat but it didn’t hurt. Week by week, I improved. Gradually, I could lift a baseball cap above my shoulder, and pass a newspaper from my damaged right hand to my left. Doctors can’t say for sure if it is due to the stimulator, though. Now I only use a stick on long walks, I can drink tea and dress myself again. It’s been a long haul, but I’ve been told I should keep improving - and by next year I hope to be driving again. Dr Jesse Dawson is clinical senior lecturer in medicine at the University of Glasgow and consultant physician at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Strokes occur when the brain is damaged by blood supply being interrupted by a blood clot or a ruptured artery. It can interfere with speech or memory and leave weakness in arms or legs. Don't put off visiting your GP if you . experience worrying symptoms. Two in five UK residents admitted to doing . this, according to a new survey from The Information Standard, and as a . result, one in five had to be prescribed a stronger course of . treatment. When asked why they put off visiting their GP, half of . respondents thought symptoms would clear up on their own and more than . one in three didn’t want to waste their GP’s time. Weakness down one side is common . after a stroke and often the arm recovers poorly, because rehab usually . focuses on getting patients walking, and complex functions in the hand . need a lot of input from the brain. Despite . the damage, new connections between brain cells can form, probably . mediated by neurotransmitters. Effectively it means the brain can rewire . itself, so different parts do jobs usually done by the damaged part. Patients have extensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation to stimulate . this. Many are left with permanent one-sided weakness. Our trial aims to tackle arm weakness with a device to stimulate the left vagus nerve (the right one controls heart rate, so could cause it to drop if used). Around 90,000 patients worldwide have had vagus nerve stimulation for conditions such as epilepsy and depression, but this is the first time it has been used  for stroke rehabilitation. Stimulating the nerve can prompt production of more neuro-transmitters (the nerve is linked to important networks of brain cells). We are testing to see if doing this during physical therapy helps the brain re-wire more effectively.  This is designed for arm movement, but it has potential for other body parts affected by stroke. In the trial, all the patients will have extensive physiotherapy, but half will also have the vagus nerve stimulator fitted. The operation takes about an hour under general anaesthetic. First, we make a 5cm incision in the side of the neck above the vagus nerve. Moving blood vessels to one side, we wind the last 2cm of the electrode - a 15-30cm long thin wire - around the nerve. Now he only uses a stick on long walks, can drink tea and dress himself again . We then make a 6cm incision on the left . side of the chest, between the collarbone and the nipple. This is where . we implant the 1cm thick matchbox-sized stimulator, which is stitched . into place. We then plug in leads from the stimulator to the electrode . (tunnelled under the skin) and close the incisions with stitches. Most . patients go home the next morning. When patients return for rehabilitation exercises two weeks later, we use a remote control linked to a laptop to fire the stimulator. It sends an impulse to the electrode wirelessly, which stimulates the nerve. During two-hour rehab sessions, we fire the device repeatedly as the patient attempts to do tasks.The implant can remain in situ for life as it’s virtually risk-free, which means we can continue giving therapy if it’s beneficial. So far, three patients we’ve finished treating with the stimulator responded well, while one didn’t have much response. This compares with two having a good response to just the rehabilitation (two had a poor response to that). When the trial finishes next summer we should see if the implant produces greater improvements. There is a 1 to 3 per cent chance of damaging the vagus nerve, says Dr Dawson. As the nerve stimulates vocal cords, it can cause a hoarse voice. This is rare and usually temporary if it happens, although there is a very low chance this could be permanent. There is a small risk of nerve damage, which could cause drooping eyelids and facial numbness.The risks are very low since this is a straightforward procedure, adds Dr Jeremy Rees, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, and Spire Bushey Hospital, Hertfordshire. 'Vagus nerve stimulation has been used for other conditions, so we know it’s safe. The main risk is it not working. All operations carry small risks of bleeding and infection.’ The operation costs the NHS about £10,000 and is available only through the trial. It is recruiting in Glasgow and Newcastle.

Mention binary numbers and images of modern computers and complex arithmetic are probably evoked.

'Those were probably the numbers that were most frequent in their trading and redistribution systems,' study co-author Andrea Bender, a cognitive scientist at the University of Bergen told Live Science. 'For that specific range, it was helpful to have these binary steps that make mental arithmetic much easier — they didn't have a writing or notational system, so they had to do everything in their mind.'

A woman who ground her teeth so badly that she could no longer open her mouth, has had part of her jaw bone replaced with titanium implants to allow her to speak and eat again. Toni Lovell-Clarke, 50, lost both her sandwich shop businesses after the recession hit, which caused her to grind her teeth from stress in her sleep. At first, the grinding was only occasional, but soon the condition worsened and she developed muscle dystonia -  a neurological movement disorder, in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements - which left her jaw jammed shut. Toni Lovell-Clarke, 50, who ground her teeth so badly she could no longer open her mouth, has had part of her jaw bone replaced with titanium implants to allow her to speak and eat again . Dystonia is a medical term that describes a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions. The spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go. Movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Dystonia can affect one muscle, a muscle group, or the entire body.  It affects about 1 per cent of the population, and women are more prone to it than men. Dystonia of the jaw is referred to as oromandibular dystonia. Stress or fatigue may bring on the symptoms or cause them to worsen. Treatment for oromandibular dystonia can range from antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications to Botox. In rare cases surgery will be needed to replace the damaged bone. She was left unable to eat, drink or even talk for months and needed to be given fluids through a tube. But thanks to a rare type of surgery, Ms Lovell-Clarke, from Nottingham, had £16,000 titanium plates inserted into her jaw in an operation performed only around 75 times a year. Despite a successful fitting of the implants, her troubles continued, as the dystonia dislocated the new jaw. She was again forced to feed through a . straw for four weeks after surgeons took the decision to wire her new . mouth shut until the muscle contractions stopped. Ms Lovell-Clarke has now credited her . surgeon Andrew Sidebottom with turning her life around, allowing her to . enjoy food and drink again as well as talk to her friends and family. Mr Sidebottom said: 'The only way to stop . this [the dislocation] from happening was by wiring her jaw shut for a long enough amount . of time the muscles would heal.'

The discovery of a human bone in East Africa may finally reveal the mystery of when our hands evolved to be able to use tools. Researchers from Missouri found the bone, which has a unique projection that helps it to connect it to the wrist, in Kenya and it is thought to have belonged to early ancestor Homo erectus. Until now the unique bone structure has only been seen in modern-day humans and Neanderthals, and the discovery means the feature may have evolved more half a million years earlier than previously thought. Researchers have discovered what is believed to be a Homo eructus hand bone in Kenya, pictured. It has a unique projection previouslt only seen in Neanderthals and modern-day humans. The finding  hints that the evolutionary feature may have appeared half a million years earlier than first thought . The styloid process helps the hand . bone lock into the wrist bones, allowing for greater amounts of pressure . to be applied to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and fingers. The lack of the styloid process . created challenges for apes and earlier humans when they attempted to . make and use tools and may have increased the chances of having . arthritis earlier. It has previously only been seen in Neanderthals and modern-day humans, yet the discovery of a bone with this projection in Kenya dates back 1.42 million years. This is half a million years earlier than previously thought and would would have been when Homo erectus lived in Africa. The earliest fossil evidence ever found of Homo erectus dates back 1.8 million years and originated in Africa. Whereas, the first humans said to have Neanderthal features are thought to have lived in Europe as early as 600,000 to 350,000 years ago. Humans have a distinctive hand anatomy that means we can grip and use tools and grasp items much tighter than apes and other non-human primates. The evolutionary point at which our hands developed this feature has, until now, remained a mystery, because it had only been found in more recent ancestors. The new bone, found at the Kaitio site in West Turkana, Kenya, is thought to be the missing link because it dates back approximately 1.42 million years - when Homo erectus would have lived in Africa. It is the earliest evidence of a modern human-like hand, indicating that this anatomical feature existed much earlier than first thought. Professor of pathology and anatomical sciences Carol Ward of University of Missouri said: ‘This bone is the third metacarpal in the hand, which connects to the middle finger. ‘What makes this bone so distinct is that the presence of a styloid process, or projection of bone, at the end that connects to the wrist. ‘Until now, this styloid process has been found only in us, Neanderthals and other archaic humans.’ The styloid process helps the hand bone lock into the wrist bones, allowing for greater amounts of pressure to be applied to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and fingers. This diagram shows the different hand bones in apes, left, the hominid Australopithecus, humans and the recently discovered Homo erectus bone, right. The researchers found a styloid process at the end of this latest discovery, which helps connect it to the wrist, and this is a unique feature found in more recent ancestors . The bone was found at the Kaitio site in West Turkana, Kenya, pictured. The earliest fossil evidence ever found of Homo erectus dates back 1.8 million years and the species originated in Africa . The Homo erectus, model pictured at the Field Museum in Chicago, may be the missing link in the evolution of the modern-day human hand . The lack of the styloid process created challenges for apes and earlier humans when they attempted to make and use tools and may have increased the chances of having arthritis earlier. The bone was found near sites where the earliest Acheulian tools have appeared. These are ancient, shaped stone tools that include stone hand axes more than 1.6 million years old and indicate early humans were almost certainly using their hands for many other complex tasks as well. Professor Ward added: ‘The styloid process reflects an increased dexterity that allowed early human species to use powerful yet precise grips when manipulating objects. ‘This was something that their predecessors couldn’t do as well due to the lack of this styloid process and its associated anatomy. ‘With this discovery, we are closing the gap on the evolutionary history of the human hand. ‘This may not be the first appearance of the modern human hand, but we believe that it is close to the origin, given that we do not see this anatomy in any human fossils older than 1.8 million years. ‘Our specialised, dexterous hands have been with us for most of the evolutionary history of our genus, Homo. They are - and have been for almost 1.5 million years - fundamental to our survival.’ The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.","A bone found in Kenya is the earliest evidence of a modern human hand .

We may think of Neanderthals as a brutish, primitive species, but a recent find suggests they were more thoughtful than we give them credit for. Researchers claim a Neanderthal skeleton unearthed in France over a century ago was intentionally buried. This is according to a 13-year reanalysis of the site which suggests careful burials existed among the Neanderthals 50,000 years ago. A 13-year re-analysis of a French cave suggests careful burials existed among Neanderthals 50,000 years ago . Scientists believe the friends and family of the Neanderthal went to great care to dig a grave and protect his body. ‘This discovery not only confirms the existence of Neanderthal burials in Western Europe, but also reveals a relatively sophisticated cognitive capacity to produce them,’ said Dr William Rendu, a paleontologist at New York University. Neanderthals were similar to early modern humans but belonged to a separate human sub-species. The two tribes co-existed for thousands of years in Europe before Neanderthals vanished around 30,000 years ago, probably because they could not compete with the modern humans. The friends and family of the Neanderthal went to great care to dig a grave and protect his body . The concept that Neanderthals carefully buried their dead fits with recent discoveries that they were capable of developing rich cultures. Earlier this month, evidence was found that Neanderthals lived in organised and tidy spaces - much in the same way as modern humans. Investigation of three Neanderthal levels at Riparo Bombrini, a collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy, revealed how areas were divided up for different activities. The top level, containing animal remains, seemed to have been reserved for butchering animals. The middle level was a long-term sleeping area, and the bottom level a place for shorter stays. In the middle level, containing the most traces of human occupation, artefacts were distributed to avoid clutter around the hearth at the back of the cave. The findings centre on Neanderthal remains first discovered by two brothers in 1908 at La Chapelle-aux-Saints in southwestern France. The well-preserved bones led its early 20th-century excavators to believe the site marked a burial ground created by a predecessor to early modern humans. But their conclusions have sparked controversy in the scientific community ever since. Skeptics maintain that the discovery had been misinterpreted and that the burial may not have been intentional. Beginning in 1999, Dr Rendu and his team began excavating seven other caves in the area. In this excavation, which was completed last year, the scientists found more Neanderthal remains of two children and one adult along with bones of bison and reindeer. Geological analysis of the hole in which the remains were found suggests that it was not a natural feature of the cave floor. As part of their study, the scientists also re-examined the human remains found in 1908. In contrast to the reindeer and bison remains at the site, the Neanderthal remains contained few cracks, no weathering-related smoothing, and no signs of disturbance by animals. ‘The relatively pristine nature of these 50,000-year-old remains implies that they were covered soon after death, strongly supporting our conclusion that Neanderthals in this part of Europe took steps to bury their dead,’ said Dr Rendu. The findings centre on Neanderthal remains first discovered by two brothers in 1908 at La Chapelle-aux-Saints in southwestern France . ‘While we cannot know if this practice was part of a ritual or merely pragmatic, the discovery reduces the behavioural distance between them and us.’ The concept that Neanderthals carefully buried their dead fits with recent discoveries that they were capable of developing rich cultures. Previous findings have shown that they probably decorated themselves using pigments, and wore jewellry made of feathers and colourful shells.

Your money is no good here: Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, say Bitcoin is not a currency . The fortunes of Bitcoins continue to fluctuate after the Norwegian government announced that is does not count as real money. The virtual currency has left governments throughout the world scratching their heads as it is not controlled by a government or any central bank. But a government offical in Norway, Scandinavia's richest nation, is the latest to express doubts over the legitimacy of Bitcoins. 'Bitcoins don’t fall under the usual definition of money or currency,' Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, said. Instead, Norway will classify Bitcoins as an asset, subject to capital gains tax. 'We’ve done some assessments on what’s the right and sound way to handle this in the tax system,' he added. Paul Ehling, associate professor in the department of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School, said the government’s definition of money may be too restrictive, reports Bloomberg. 'Currency is any agreed upon means of exchanges of goods and services, so you could have some small stones, as used in history, and if it’s accepted by a sufficiently large population, then that’s enough,' Ehling said. 'These days we do mean that a much larger group of people is willing to exchange goods or services for this currency.' The value of Bitcoins plunged earlier this month after the Chinese government questioned the legal status of the virtual currency. A joint statement from several Chinese official bodies such as the People's Bank of China said Bitcoins are not a currency and cannot be used as a form of payment by any businesses or financial institutions. The value of Bitcoins plunged earlier this month after the Chinese government questioned the legal status of the virtual currency . Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. A . Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than . half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four . years ago. The central bank of France also weighed in on the Bitcoin impasse, warning investors that the unregulated currency could pose financial and legal risks for those who hold it, MarketWatch reported. Germany said it will impose tax on the virtual currency. However, analysts with Bank of America's Merrill Lynch came out on the side of Bitcoin, saying in a report that came out Friday that the crypto-currency (so-called because it uses encryption as a security measure) become a significant tool for those purchasing products online. Bitcoins have also received several boosts in recent months with illegal trading platforms closed and the U.S. senate considering the potential use of the currency.

Most of us have old tech gadgets lying around gathering dust, but one engineer has decided to put his to good use. Jeff Keacher from Colorado successfully managed to wire up a 27-year-old Mac Plus - an early version of the Apple Mac computer - to the web using a Raspberry Pi and proxy server. This is particularly impressive because the computer was built in 1986 - five years before the first web servers were switched on and the world wide web officially launched - and it is said to be '200,000 times slower' than modern-day desktop PCs. Scroll down for video . Engineer Jeff Keacher from Colorado used an early web browser called MacWeb 2.0 to run basic versions of Wikipedia and Hacker News on his 1986 Mac Plus, pictured. Pages took 'minutes' to load, but Keacher was able to access the sites through a proxy server . Manufactured in 1986 . 4MB RAM and 8MHz MC68000 CPU . 100MB Zip disk . 50MB hard drive . 512 x 384 pixel black-and-white screen . System 7.0 . MacWeb v2.0 browser (1994) This means it didn’t have a web browser, couldn’t read web addresses and didn’t even have an Ethernet port in order to connect it to Keacher’s router. The full process of how Keacher managed to connect his now antique hardware is available on his blog. He began by installing a version of MacWeb 2.0 - an early version of the Mac web browser that runs on the Mac System 7 operating system. To connect the computer to the router, . without an Ethernet port, Keacher used a series of old adapters to to connect a Raspberry Pi to the Mac Plus. He then . connected the Pi to the router. To connect to his home network, Keacher had to wire up his computer to a Raspberry Pi, pictured, and then connect the Pi to his router. This was necessary because the Mac Plus is so old it doesn't have an Ethernet port, so couldn't connect to the router directly . MacWeb 2.0 is not capable of reading web addresses and serving links and pages in the same way as modern-day browsers because it doesn’t recognise computer languages such as Javascript or CSS. Instead, Keacher recruited a friend to write a proxy program that took the URL of websites, removed all modern-day computer language, cookies and images and turned the sites into basic text versions. Keacher was then able to read Wikipedia pages and access Hacker News through the retro browser. On . his blog, Keacher explained: ‘Yes, in a certain sense, my Mac has . already been on the internet through dial-up shell sessions. A Wikipedia page viewed through the MacWeb 2.0 browser. MacWeb 2.0 isn't capable of reading web pages because it doesn't recognise computer languages such as Javascript of CSS. Instead, Keacher used a program that stripped the sites of this computer language and turned them into basic text versions . The Mac Plus was manufactured in 1986. It has 4MB RAM and is powered by an 8MHz MC68000 CPU. The black and white screen has 512 x 384 pixels and it runs on the System 7.0 from 1991. According to Keacher the computer is '200,000 times' slower than modern-day PCs . ‘What it never did was run a TCP/IP stack of its own. It was always just a dumb terminal on the ‘net, never a full-fledged member.’ ‘Sure, it was slow as hell, but it worked! Data loaded, pages rendered, and links were clickable.

David Coleman, a BBC sports presenter and commentator with almost 50 years of service, has died after a brief illness. His family confirmed his passing, saying: 'We regret to announce the death of David Coleman OBE, after a short illness. He died peacefully with his family at his bedside.' The legendary figure presented some of the Corporation's most iconic programmes in his time behind the camera, including Grandstand, Sportsnight and A Question of Sport, which he hosted for 18 years. Scroll down for video . Iconic: David Coleman, centre, in the studio for Question of Sport alongside Ally McCoist, left and John Parrott, right . Veteran: David Coleman presenting Grandstand . Classic: Mr Coleman on air for the BBC in 1959 . Olympic contribution: Mr COleman covering the summer Olympic Games from Moscow in 1980 . The renowned athletics commentator worked for the corporation for almost 50 years, covering 11 summer Olympic Games, his final one in Sydney in 2000. He also covered six football World Cups as a commentator or presenter. Mr Coleman's humorous turns of phrase were regularly documented in a column in Private Eye magazine, and are remembered fondly to this day. Some of the standout examples include: . 'If that had gone in it would have been a goal' 'He is one of the great unknown champions because very little is known about him.' 'We estimate, and this isn't an estimation, that Greta Waltz is 80 seconds behind.' 'He is accelerating all the time. The last lap was run in 64 seconds and the one before in 62.' 'He's even smaller in real life than he is on the track.' 'He's got his hands on his knees and holds his head in despair.' 'He is 31 this year - last year he was 30.' 'And the line-up for the final of the women's 400 metres hurdles includes three Russians, two East Germans, a Pole, a Swede and a Frenchman.' 'The Republic of China: back in the Olympic Games for the first time.' 'That's the fastest time ever run, but it's not as fast as the world record.' 'There is a fine line between serendipity and stalking.' 'Don’t tell those coming in the final result of that fantastic match, but let’s just have another look at Italy’s winning goal.' 'For those of you watching who do not have television sets, live commentary is on Radio 2.' 'It’s gold or nothing…and it’s nothing. He comes away with the silver medal.' 'Forest have now lost six matches without winning.' 'And here’s Moses Kiptanui – the 19-year-old Kenyan who turned 20 a few weeks ago.' 'The front wheel crosses the finish line, closely followed by the back wheel.' 'This evening is a very different evening from the morning we had this morning.' 'I think there is no doubt, she'll probably qualify for the final.' 'A truly international field, no Britons involved.' 'He just can’t believe what’s not happening to him.' 'In a moment we hope to see the pole vault over the satellite.' 'Nobody has ever won the title twice before. He has already done that.' 'Both of the Villa scorers – Withe and Mortimer – were born in Liverpool as was the Villa manager Ron Saunders who was born in Birkenhead.' 'The late start is due to the time.' In his lengthy broadcasting career, Mr Coleman became famous for making nonsensical or bizarre statements on air while covering live events, which later became lovingly known as 'Colemanballs'. Some of the most famous instances include: 'That's the fastest time ever run, but it's not as fast as the world record.' and 'He is one of the great unknown champions because very little is known about him.' Mr Coleman had Irish parents but was born and educated in Cheshire. He worked as a reporter for a time on the Stockton Express newspaper, and joined the BBC after a period of national service. He made his first television appearance in 1955 on Sportsview, and three years later he was taken on as the presenter of Grandstand, a new Saturday afternoon sports programme. He would continue to present the show until 1968, and took the lead on the Sports Review of the Year programme from 1961 to 1983. He also put in a four-year stint on Sportsnight with Coleman between 1968 and 1972. From 1979 to 1997 he hosted sports quiz show A Question of Sport. In 1992 he was granted the OBE in the New Year’s Honours List, and four years later he received the Judges’ Award For Sport in the 1996 Royal Television Society Awards. His excited, high-pitched commentaries made him a favourite among viewers but also a target for impersonators. His professionalism as a broadcaster was widely acknowledged after his efforts covering the 1972 Munich Olympics. During the games, Arab terrorists invaded the Olympic Village and took hostage and killed 11 Israeli athletes. Mr Coleman continued broadcasting during the tragedy and was praised for his professionalism. His work at Grandstand, particularly his feats of memory and mind for football league statistics, were also widely praised. Mr Coleman . ran this immensely complex live four-and-a-half-hour programme for nine years. He told one interviewer that each Grandstand involved . him in 16 hours of preparation, checking records and memorising league . tables. This meant that as the dozens of soccer results poured out, . from a teleprinter in those days, Mr Coleman would demonstrate his . expertise about even the obscure byways of League football. However he retained a fondness for the light-hearted side of sports broadcasting. He later jokingly recalled his role on the programme, saying: 'I just sit . there and generally take the mickey.' He . was awarded an OBE in the 1993 New Year's Honours, and later a special . accolade in the Royal Television Society presentations, when the judges . called him 'the pivotal voice of BBC sport for over five decades'. After hosting the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he received the Olympic movement's highest accolade, the Olympic Order, in recognition of his services to the spirit and ideals of the Games. He is survived by his wife Barbara, and their six children, Anne – a British ladies show jumping champion – Dean, David, Mandy, Michael and Samantha. Today former colleagues and friends paid tribute to Mr Coleman, praising him as 'one of the this country's greatest and most respected broadcasters.' Former BBC colleague Barry Davies said Mr Coleman was 'the master who set the standard for sports broadcasting on television'. Mr Davies said: 'He had such authority in his voice which could bring even the most mundane event to life. And at the big events he was superb. 'I feel privileged to have known him, worked with him and occasionally stood in for him when he was in his prime.' Barbara Slater, director of . sport and the BBC, said: 'David Coleman was a giant in the sports broadcasting . world, an iconic and hugely respected figure. 'In . a BBC career that spanned over 40 years he set the standard that so . many others have tried to emulate.

'Our thoughts are with his family and many friends.' Former England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker joined those remembering Mr Coleman - whose brevity at the microphone, including his signature 'one-nil' catchphrase, earned him many fans. The former Leicester, Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona forward wrote on Twitter: 'Sad to hear, David Coleman has died. A giant of sports broadcasting. Brilliant, gifted, precise and concise. Much more than ""one-nil"" #RIP' Fellow sports host Jake Humphrey added on Twitter: 'RIP David Coleman. People like me do this job dreaming one day we'll be as good as you were. We won't.

Progressive polygamy: Patriarch Brady (center) and his five wives . Nonie (far left), Robyn (near left),  Paulie (near right) and Rhonda (center right) and Rosemarie left the Mormon church due to its conservative beliefs . Despite having left the church, the family still lives in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake Cit . Williams and his wives slowly withdrew from the . fundamentalist Mormon church in their rural community outside of Salt . Lake City during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. The . family no longer teaches the tenets of fundamental Mormonism to their . children at home, opting instead to take from other teachings such as . Buddhism to instill good, moral values in their two dozen children, who . range in age from 2-20. 'Since we have left . the religion, it's now about love and it's about commitment, and it's . about happiness as a family,' said Mr Williams, 43, a project manager . in his brother's construction business. 'It's not about the fear of . hell or the promise of heaven.' It wasn't the . first time Mr Williams has crossed religious lines. Husband of five: Brady was raised in the mainstream Mormon church, but when he was 16 his family became fundamentalist and began believing in polygamy . As a teenager, . his parents left mainstream Mormonism and joined polygamy. He said that . transition was very difficult, but not as hard as leaving the . fundamentalist church his five wives all grew up in. The . show will go behind closed doors and focus on the frustrations, needs . and fears of a family living the controversial lifestyle, according to a . TLC press release. Though their beliefs have estranged from many family members, the members of the Williams family believe that their sacrifices are worth it. First wife Paulie, a dental hygienist, has been married to Brady for 21 years, and the couple's six children range in age from 20 to nine years old. Good friends: The Williams five wives, from left to right, Robyn, Nonie, Rhonda, Rosemary and Paulie, all get along on the show. Robyn and Rhonda are also cousins . She was raised in a polygamist family and expected her husband to have additional wives, but her oldest daughter is recently married and plans a monogamist lifestyle. He then married second wife Robyn - dubbed 'the creative wife' for her art classes and love of making gifts for the family - about nine months after his ceremony to Paulie, and they have five children. Divide and conquer: Each wife cooks dinner for the 30-strong family one night a week . Each wife has her own space. The family is divided across 5 apartments in two homes they are just yards from each other. Three wives live in this home, each with their own front door, separate kitchen and own personal bedroom. Brady rotates between the five nightly . Third wife Rosemary worked in the family construction business but stopped after winning a scholarship at the local college, where she is studying for her teaching degree in music. She has four children with Mr Williams. Nonie, the fourth wife, was living in Montana when she met her husband 15 year ago, and the duo had a long-distance relationship. She is the only wife that works with him, handling the administrative side of the family's construction business, while being a mom to their five children. Fifth wife Rhonda is Robyn's cousin. She entered the picture 12 years ago, and admits that it took eight years before she really felt that she belonged in the family. Though she says that there are downsides to polygamy, she loves that her four children have other mothers around. Cameras were allowed into the bedroom, and the women will speak openly about their frustrations with Brady's schedule. Sister Wives: Kody Brown (center), his wives Meri (far left), Robyn (near left), Christine (near right) and Janelle (far right) and their 17 children introduced many Americans to the polygamous lifestyle . On the show the wives detailed how they each cook dinner for the massive family of 30 one night a week. Brady rotates bedrooms on a nightly basis, so each wife gets him one night of five. The family lives on a two home compound in polygamous community outside Salt Lake City. Two homes are divided into five apartments. Each wife has her own kitchen and living space, as well her own bedroom and bedrooms for her biological children. Brady goes between. The wives also pend their birthday and anniversary with Brady.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 14:32 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:40 EST, 20 December 2013 . On a day when his signature health care program suffered the latest in a series of website outages, President Barack Obama made one last 2013 pitch to a standing-room-only thong of journalists who have engaged lately in more knife-sharpening than hero-worship. He tried to tee up a series of economic achievements, noting the addition of 'another 2 million jobs, adding up to 8 million in just over the past 45 months.' We head into next year with an economy that is stronger than it was when we started the year,' he insisted,' with unemployment 'the lowest in 5 years' and budget deficits that have fallen to half their 20078 levels. 'I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America.' His economic policies, Obama predicted, would bring 'bigger paychecks for middle-class families' in the new year. Then, a surprise: More than 1 million Americans, Obama announced, have enrolled in Obamacare-based insurance plans plans through federal and state marketplaces this month. That includes '15,000 a day in California,' he said, and 'tens of thousands' each day on healthcare.gov. A cheerful Obama put a positive spin on his fifth year in office as reporters peppered him about the public-opinion disasters he's suffered during 2013 . Every seat was full and every square foot of carpet covered as Obama made the year?s final public pitch for his policy objectives . 'For all the challenges we've had ... more than half a million Americans have enrolled in healthcare.gov through the first three weeks of December alone,' Obama said. A White House official added on background that more than 1 million people have entered the ranks of the insured during December, if both the federal and state exchanges are included. And Obama later said millions of Americans, 'whether they know it or not,' had already benefited from the Affordable Care Act, including 'a couple of million' who will have health insurance on January 1. But estimates of Americans who have lost insurance because their policies didn't meet the law's strict benefit requirements range from 5 to 15 million. The Department of Health and Human Services insists that the number is less than 500,000. It's unclear how many of those enrollees have selected taxpayer-subsidized Medicaid coverage, as did a large majority of Americans represented in the Department of Health and Human Services' numbers through the end of November. It's also unknown whether the administration can continue adding enrollees at a fast enough pace to reach its goal of more than 7 million by the end of March, including 2.7 million Americans under age 35. But few people likely signed up on Friday, as the main Obamacare portal experienced crashes and again demonstrated an inability to keep up with a year-end crush of traffic brought on as uninsured Americans panicked. Obama made the rare appearance in the White House's James Brady Press Briefing Room just hours before departing for a lengthy family vacation in Hawaii. Obama talked about economic recovery and defended his administration against claims that 2013 was Obama's worst year in office . Anchormen IV: Network correspondents preened and made last-minute predictions before Obama strode in with one foot already out the door to Hawaii . It's been a rough year for the . president, with his approval ratings in a seemingly one-way slump and . members of Congress from his own party, sensing his short electoral . coat-tails next November, deserting him on issues as varied as Iran and . Obamacare. Thirteen Senate . Democrats joined the same number of Republicans on Friday in filing a . bill that would authorize tough new sanctions on Iran at the same time . Obama's State Department is counseling diplomacy and patience with the . Islamic republic's leader, Hassan Rouhani. And between a website that once again is failing to function and the White House's latest effort to rewrite the Affordable Care Act without congressional approval – the 14th such move to date – administration insiders are starting to sweat. Obama openly evaded a question about the politifact.com website's 'Lie of the year' award, which went to his guarantee that Americans who liked their health insurance policies could keep them. 'We're going to make mistakes and we're going to have problems,' Obama said without offering apologies for misleading Americans in the run-up to his 2012 re-election, 'but my intentions have been clear throughout, which is, I just want to help as many people as possible.' On the healthcare.gov website's failings, though, he was more direct: 'Since I'm in charge, we screwed it up.' Add the White House's health care woes to the most recent developments on the National Security Agency's controversial surveillance programs – a federal judge ruled them essentially unconstitutional on Monday – and a picture is emerging of a presidency in crisis during a time when most presidents have an easy go of things. The fifth year of a two-term White House incumbent is usually more liberating than frustrating, and usually provides a president with a clean-slate chance to accomplish something significant before the realities of politics intrude in the form of perilous congressional elections. 'Conflation': Obama bristled at one reporter's complaint about Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's testimony that misled Congress about the NSA's spying. 'You're conflating, first of all, me and Mr. Clapper,' he said . Snowden-gate: Obama said he wouldn't comment publicly on the future of the NSA leaker, who is enjoying temporary asylum in Russia, because Edward Snowden is under federal indictment . But the tea party is angry, moderates in Congress are unsure what Obama is thinking, and liberals are increasingly disillusioned. Obama took questions, saying first that White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 'had prepared a list of who's naughty and nice,' 'Has this been the worst year of your presidency?' came question #1. Another focused on Iran's nuclear program, a problem so vexing that Democrat Bob Menendez is using his Senate committee chair to push for new sanctions if the Islamic nation breaks its word on a new round of international transparency. 'There is no need for new sanctions legislation, not yet,' Obama said, explaining that he still prefers a diplomatic route. 'It is very important to test whether that is possible. Not because it's guaranteed, but be cause the alternative is possibly us having to engage in some sort of conflict to resolve the problem – with all kinds of unintended consequences. 'It is my goal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,' the president said, 'but I sure would rather do it diplomatically.' Obama dodged most bullets, but was cornered on an early question about the National Security Agency spying scandal. Asked how he now justified his administration's early assurances that the situation as well in-hand, the president bristled at the idea that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's testimony – which is widely considered to have misled Congress – reflected the White House's positions. 'You're conflating, first of all, me and Mr. Clapper,' said Obama, before generally defending U.S. intelligence-gathering programs. He cited the healthcare.gov rollout flop as his biggest mistake this year, but later expressed an interest in starting fresh after 'a couple days of sleep and sun' in Hawaii. Obama defended the National Security Agency, saying that there has been no proof the government spy shop abused its power . And asked what could lie ahead if Republicans leapt back into crisis mode by using the recent calm over budgets as a springboard for new negotiations over the federal debt ceiling, Obama winced. 'I've got to assume folks aren't crazy enough to start that all over again,' he said, warning against 'brinksmanship' and 'government by crisis' if conservatives move again to use the debt ceiling as 'leverage.' On NSA snooping, Obama insisted that his administration 'is evaluating all the recommendations that were made,' in a recent task force report. 'I'll make a pretty definitive statement' in January, he promised. 'I'm taking this pretty seriously.' The NSA, Obama said, had determined that it 'was pretty important to track' phone calls that come into the U.S. from known terrorists, and he defended the program by saying that 'in all the reviews of this program that have been done,' there was no evidence that the agency has used its power inappropriately. 'The question we are going to have to ask is can we accomplish the same goal' in another way,' and 'give the public more confidence' in its government. 'Just because we can do something doesn’t mean we necessarily should,' Obama said.

A great-grandmother who was the oldest member of the Royal British Legion and held the record for being the world's oldest paraglider has died at 106 years old. Peggy McAlpine from Stirling, Scotland, was 104 when she became the world's oldest paraglider. At 101, Daredevil Peggy, as she became known, enjoyed a ride on a powerful Harley Davidson motorcycle. And years earlier she celebrated her 80th birthday doing a bungee jump. Scroll down for video . Daredevil Peggy McAlpine, who has died at 106, pictured on her 105th birthday in October 2012 . But Peggy's fun-filled life of extreme pursuits and daring exploits came to an end last Friday December 6 when she passed away at her adopted home of Karaman, Kyrenia, in northern Cyprus. Peggy, who had two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, died of pneumonia following a bout of flu. The Scot's late husband Thomas, who died of cancer in 1980, was a member of the wealthy McAlpine construction business family. Peggy had a colourful life and her daughter Elizabeth Forsyth, 77, was caught up in the scandal . surrounding the costly collapse of his Polly Peck business empire as an employee of jailed tycoon Asil Nadir. Peggy, 100, gives a thumbs up as she paraglides off a 2,500ft mountain peak in Kyrenia, Cyprus, October 07 . Today the Royal British Legion in London confirmed Peggy was their oldest member. An RBL standard bearer from the Legion's branch in Kyrenia, northern Cyprus, will attend her funeral in Karaman tomorrow. Peggy, born in October 1907, had revealed she ‘loved heights' from a young age. She recalled her first time on an aeroplane was as the passenger of aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham in the late 1920s. Highlighting her passion for ‘danger', Peggy entered the Guinness Book of Records in 2007 for being the oldest person to take part in paragliding at the age of 100. Peggy with daughter Elizabeth, far right, granddaughter Fiona, centre, and great-granddaughter Megan, left . Her record was broken in 2011 by 101-year-old American womant Mary Allen Hardison. But Peggy, despite being wheelchair-bound, was determined to get her record back and in April 2012 she leapt from a 2,400ft peak in the Kyrenia mountain range in northern Cyprus. She was in tandem on a paraglider with pilot Ozgur Gokasan after helpers carried her from her wheelchair to be attached to him. Peggy said at the time: 'I enjoyed every minute of it. It was better than the last time. I would certainly like to do it again - especially if anyone takes my record.' Her adventure was recorded on video and posted on YouTube and she celebrated with a glass of champagne. Peggy said she first got a taste for extreme sports at the age of 80 when her grandchildren talked her into trying bungee jumping at a show in Essex. 'I climbed to the top and looked down and saw the people like ants and my heart sank,' she said. 'But I'd gone so far, I couldn't stop. So I stepped on the platform and drew up my courage and leaped from the top.' Peggy's friend Keith Lloyd, 72, a fellow member of the RBL in Kyrenia, commented on her passing. 'She was a very warm lady but also very feisty. She never lost her sense of humour and bubbly nature even when she was confined to a wheelchair,' he said. Peggy with Major Brian Thomas, chairman of RBL in Kyrenia, on her 105th birthday last year . 'She had a wonderful retirement, full of adventurous pursuits. 'I . remember after her frist paragliding record was broken she said to her . daughter Elizabeth, ‘Well, we can't have that, can we?' Of course, she . went and did it again and regained her record. 'I knew Peggy for 10 years. She lived in a beautiful house in the village of Karaman and was very happy there. 'She was one of the early members of the Kyrenia branch of the Royal British Legion. 'She felt very happy to be part of an organisation which is the only one in northern Cyprus to have the Queen as its patron.' A spokesman for the Royal British Legion in London said: 'Peggy was our oldest member based on those whose dates of birth we know of. We were very sad to hear of her death.' Major Brian Thomas MBE, chairman of the Kyrenia branch of the RBL, said: 'Peggy was such a well loved woman, a truly remarkable person. She had so much spirit. 'We are expecting more than 200 people to attend her funeral.' He said she was the oldest known member of the RBL although there may be 'one or two' elder ones from World War One who have no record of their exact dates of birth. Peggy became involved with the RBL in Kyrenia through her son-in-law Mike Forsyth, who was in the RAF.","Peggy McAlpine, from Stirling, Scotland, died of pneumonia following flu .

The father of the man shot dead on live television by Los Angeles police officers has broken his silence over the traumatic ordeal. Bill Beaird, 80, watched as three LAPD officers shot son Brian Beaird 22 times after he led them on an hour-long car chase through the city before crashing his silver Corvette and spinning out of control. The grieving father claims he told his son, 55, to pull over in a frantic phone call during the pursuit in which insisted he had done nothing wrong. Bill Beaird said his dead son was a disabled vet who suffered from severe paranoia after brain tumor surgery that caused him to be discharged from the military - that paranoia fueled his paranoid flight. Scroll down to see the dramatic chase and crash: . Taken out: When broadcast live, Brian Beaird was seen running around the back of his car before being shot by police, clutching his stomach and falling over on the sidewalk . Bill Beaird told the Los Angeles Times he turned on the television soon after receiving the panicked call. He watched a sports car bob and weave its way through Los Angeles. The chase looks like a scene out of Grand Theft Auto V, but this was no game. His son Brian had just called, and frantically insisted he had done nothing wrong but was being chased by police. 'Pull over,' Bill Beaird told his son, 'he said he was going to do it, but he didn't do it.' A military veteran himself, Bill Beaird watched a Corvette similar to his son's, silver, speed through the city. Soon the muscle car t-boned another car and spun onto the sidewalk. The driver stumbled out of the bashed up vehicle, cameras rolling, hands in the air, back to the police. 'I thought it was my son, but I wasn't sure,' Bill Beaird recalled. LAPD officers opened fire with live . rounds after they allegedly mistook the sound of a colleague's . non-lethal 'bean-bag' shotgun for a real gunfire. More than 20 gunshots and several unanswered phone calls later it all made sense - Bill Beaird just watched police execute his unarmed son live on television. On foot: After the crash, the DUI suspect tries to drive his totaled car but crashes it into a telephone pole while backing up and it won't move. He is then seen getting out of the car . The elder Beaird said his son likely fled the police because he suffered from paranoia that developed after a 1988 surgery to remove a brain tumor. He, along with KTLA anchors, briefly thought his son must have been shot with a Taser - the grim reality soon set in. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told NBC News: 'After . hearing the preliminary briefing, I am very concerned about the . circumstances that led up to and resulted in this Officer Involved . Shooting. 'Because of those . concerns I have directed that the three involved officers be assigned . home pending the final results of the investigation. 'Determinations regarding training or possible disciplining of the involved officers will be made at that time.' Video captured the moment when Beaird seemed to speed through a red light and crashed into the back half of a Nissan Maxima on December 17. LAPD is investigating claims that when one officer fired a non-lethal 'bean bag' round, another mistook it for gunfire and used a real weapon. 'The suspect got out of the vehicle and at that point, something occurred that prompted the officer-involved shooting,' Lt Neiman said. Crash: The Corvette's tires were impervious to police spike strips so it was only when he rammed into another car that the chase came to a halt at the intersection of Olympic Boulevard and Los Angeles Street . When the car chase was broadcast live by KTLA-TV, video showed the man getting out of his car, running around the back of the Corvette and heading up East Olympic Blvd before being shot, clutching his stomach and falling to the ground. Lt Neiman says there was 'great concern that he was going to hurt someone severely'. LAPD Cmdr. Alexander Smith told 10news: . 'Policy dictates that the officer using the non-lethal bean bag shotgun . notify other officers so they don't think lethal force is being used'. He added that part of the investigation will be whether verbal warning was given. Beaird's brother John said during the chase, Beaird called his father asking, 'Why are they after me? I didn't do anything.' Won't stop: The car chase started around 9pm in South Gate when police tried to pull over the unidentified driver of this silver Corvette for reckless driving and a possible DUI . Tracking: When the man refused to yield, police pursued the vehicle as it made its way through the streets of Los Angeles for more than an hour . Officers . from three police agencies tailed the man for more than an hour starting at 9pm when police in South Gate attempted to pull . him over for reckless driving and a possible DUI. When . the driver refused to pull over, police followed him in cars and with a . helicopter as he spend through Cudahy, Huntington Park, South Gate, . Walnut Park and into South Los Angeles. Sky9's Meghan Reyes reported that the man was driving without his headlights on and 'just driving in circles'. The man's corvette was also outfitted with special tires that resisted puncture when police tried to use a spike strip to stop him. The chase finally came to an end around 10:30pm when he sped through a light and hit another driver crossing the intersection in front of him in a T-bone collision. The . corvette spun all the way around before stopping on the side of the . road at the intersection of South Los Angeles St and East Olympic Blvd. The other car was thrown into a fire hydrant which sent water shooting into the air and spilling onto the street.","Brian Beaird led police on an hour-long speed chase through Los Angeles .

A woman has described how going through the menopause killed her sex life - because intercourse became so painful. Elaine Feeley, 58, says she felt so guilty that she and her husband Keef hadn't had sex in four years that she told him to sleep with someone else. Despite the couple always enjoying an active sex life, she says everything changed when she went through the menopause. Elaine Feeley says she felt so guilty that she and her husband Keef hadn't had sex in four years that she told him to sleep with someone else . She said: 'We've been together for 20 years and used to have a great sex life. When I first slept with Keef I'd never had an orgasm like it before. 'I used to say ""I feel this good I could die this minute"" - it couldn't feel better. It was like that for a long time. 'But after the menopause sex was, at first, uncomfortable. 'Then one night I just had the most horrendous pain, as if I'd been stabbed. I pushed my husband off, saying ""stop, go away - I can't enjoy sex any more"". 'My desire hasn't gone, but I'm fearful of the pain I want my sex life back. I've had 40 years of orgasms and now I've been robbed of them.' The couple share their story in a new documentary on More 4 called The Week The Women Came, which reveals that one in three women have sexual difficulties that rob them of ability to orgasm. Because they no longer had sex, intimacy between Elaine and Keef, 61, had plummeted to an all-time low - and she confesses in the programme they are more like brother and sister. She adds: 'We always swore we'd never have separate beds - but that's not what happens. Despite the couple always enjoying an active sex life, everything changed when she went through the menopause. Elaine suffers from vaginal atrophy, or dryness, which is very common after the menopause . 'We love each other dearly but the spiritual connection has vanished, that secret spark in the eye that you share. 'I'd like to get that sparkle back and not tears.' In the programme Elaine meets Trudy Hannigan, a psychosexual therapist who regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems at her clinic in Yorkshire. Trudy explains: 'Sex seems like a luxury, so if it goes wrong, it's the last thing that gets fixed. It's not considered important enough, but when something goes wrong it can be devastating for self-esteem and confidence.' Elaine is found to be suffering from vaginal atrophy, or dryness, which is very common after the menopause. Here, the vagina shrinks and dries out, the cervix lowers and some women experience a chafing, carpet-burn feeling during sex. In the programme Elaine meets Trudy Hannigan (left), a psychosexual therapist who regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems . A survey commissioned by the British Menopause . Society found that 45 per cent of women who have reached the menopause . had suffered from atrophy and 70 of those women said their sex life had suffered drastically as a result. Despite being offered oestrogen cream to restore the balance of the hormone that drops after the menopause, Elaine didn't want to pursue the HRT route. Although she and Keef tried numerous other lubricants, nothing helped. Over time, Elaine backed away from Keef, fearing any intimacy would be leading him on - and she wouldn't be able to satisfy him. 'If he got aroused I felt guilty, like I was teasing him. I know he is still a virile, active man and I told him to go out and have sex with someone else. She adds: 'But really, I know he wouldn't - his view is unselfish - he wants to give me pleasure.' Trudy's mission is to help inject some intimacy back into the couple's relationship. Now, they must kiss each other hello and goodbye, have date nights, give each other 10-minute massages and write notes to each other. Two months later, after slow and steady progress, Elaine and Keef have made it back to familiar ground for the first time in four years. While Elaine no longer feels she can have penetrative sex, she and Keef have found other ways of keeping each other satisfied. Elaine tells the camera that Keef has given her multiple orgasms that morning and they have 'big smiles' on their faces. She adds: 'Instead of thinking about my old sex like, I'm going to focus on my new one. I love this man.'

A man who helped publicize incriminating social media posts from high school football players ridiculing the Steubenville, Ohio, rape victim could face nine years more in jail than the convicted rapists if convicted of hacking-related crimes. Known as KYAnonymous, 26-year-old hacker and self-employed security consultant Deric Lostutter came forward this week in interviews with Gawker, Mother Jones and The Huffington Post, as the hacker responsible for publicizing social media screenshots and videos posted by Steubenville football players that made fun of the 16-year-old victim and documented her August 2012 rape. In March, football stars Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were convicted of the rape. They were sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with a maximum stay until they are 21. Hacktivist: Deric Lostutter, a 26-year-old hacker and security consultant, has come forward as the man, right, in a December video which threatened to publish personal information of those involved in the Steubenville rape case . Now it seems Lostutter could be charged for his role in the case as well. In mid-April, F.B.I. agents executed a search warrant on Lostutter's Winchester, Ky., home, the hacker wrote in a post Thursday on the 'hacktivist' group KnightSec's website. KnightSec, led by Lostutter and operating within the Anonymous collective, is known for sticking up for 'victims of rape, abuse, bullying, and more in the face of adversity'. According to the warrant published by Lostutter, the F.B.I. is investigating him for his role in the hacking of RollRedRoll.com, a fan site for the Steubenville football team. In December, hackers with Anonymous and KnightSec posted a video on the site threatening to release personal information of those involved in the Steubenville rape case if they did not come forward and apologize. Lostutter told multiple media outlets this week he is the person hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask in the video, which shows social media screenshots mentioning the rape and victim. He also said he was the man interviewed by CNN in January after Anonymous posted the names of those football players they believed witnessed the rape. Lostutter told The Huffington Post he didn't hack RolledRoll.com and noted a 22-year-old  known online as Batcat confessed the crime to the Herald Star in February. But he said the screenshots were obtained by him through online activists. 'The tweets, screenshots, Instagrams. ... Pretty much everything you've seen in the media, that came through me,' Lostutter told The Huffington Post. White Knight: Deric Lostutter, the leader of Anonymous group KnightSec, was the subject of an F.B.I. search in April for his role in the hacking of the Steubenville football team's website . Describing the search warrant, Lostutter said he originally thought the raid was a delivery. 'As I open the door to great the driver approximately 12 F.B.I. Swat Team agents jumped out of the truck screaming for me to ""Get The F*** Down"" with m-16 assault rifles and full riot gear armed safety off, pointed directly at my head.,' he wrote. 'I was handcuffed and detained outside while they cleared my house.' Lostutter wrote he was told not to speak about the raid if he wanted to avoid facing 'additional charges such as ""destroying/tampering with evidence"".' 'They stated they had been watching me for a long time, prior to Jim Parks, and that I was a good guy, and even joked around a bit about the good things I have done,' wrote Lostutter. 'none the less, sincere or not, They are the FBI and to them I am Anonymous, the embodiment of a dangerous threat according to their m16 assault rifles aimed at me for a computer.' 'They seized my laptop, my girlfriend's laptop, flash drives, music CDs, an external hard-drive, two cell phones and my brother's xbox 360 for some reason,' Lostutter told The Huffington Post. Publicity: Deric Lostutter, left, a 26-year-old hacker and security consultant, has come forward as the man in a December video which publicized social media screenshots, like this one right, ridiculing the Steubenville rape victim .

The first woman ever placed on the FBI’s list of top 10 most wanted terrorists is a convicted New Jersey cop killer who shot a state trooper execution-style in the head. Joanne Chesimard, AKA Assata Shakur, happens to also be the godmother and aunt of the late rapper Tupac . Shakur. She was an outspoken member of the radical Black Liberation Army when she shot and killed New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster. The FBI announced Chesimard's addition to the list today, recognizing the 40th anniversary of Foerster's slaying. ‘She is absolutely a threat to America,’ said Special Agent Aaron T. Ford from the FBI, at a press conference held for the announcement in Newark, New Jersey Thursday. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Seen here in an FBI handout photo, Joanne Chesimard AKA Assata Shakur became the first woman on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list May 2 . Family: Rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a shooting in September 1996 at the age of 25. Chesimard's brother was the stepfather of late American rapper . Prior to this announcements, the reward for Shakur’s capture was already a shocking $1 million. However, officials announced the bounty has now been increased to $2 million on the anniversary of Chesimard’s crimes. Slain: Chesimard was convicted of killing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in a 1973 shootout 40 years ago May 2 . While driving down the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973, an hour south of New York City, Chesimard and two men—James Coston and Clark Squire—were pulled over by state troopers James Harper and Werner Foerster. The 26-year-old Chesimard was already known to the FBI for her membership in the Black Panther movement. She was also wanted for several felonies, including bank robber counts in New York. From the passenger seat, Chesimard fired first with a semi-automatic pistol. Passenger James Coston fired as well and was shot and killed by Officer Harper. The . shootout continued until Chesimard, having shot and killed Werner . Foerster execution-style in the head, fled the scene with Squire. Both were apprehended by police shortly thereafter. Chesimard denied having shot anyone and pointed to her radical affiliations as the basis for her being singled out. Nonetheless, four years after the Jersey Turnpike shootout, Chesimard was convicted of first-degree murder, assault and battery of a police officer, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to kill, illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery. Chesimard was handed life behind bars. She began her sentence at a maximum security prison in West Virginia, . but was transferred to a minimum security prison in New Jersey. That’s where, in 1979, Chesimard escaped. Wanted: Chesimard, dubbed a domestic terrorist, became the first woman on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list and her previous bounty of $1M was increased to $2M . With the help of three people who were visiting her, security guards were held at gunpoint and forced to open prison gates. The group escaped in a prison vehicle and took Chesimard to a safe house in New Jersey, where she managed to stay hidden for years. Chesimard’s next whereabouts were in Cuba, where she was granted political asylum in 1984. She has lived there ever since, under the name Assata Shakur. Chesimard's brother was the stepfather of late American rapper Tupac Shakur. She had also reportedly served as the rapper's godmother. Tupac Shakur was a massively successful rapper, whose career was cut short when he died at the age of 25 in a Las Vegas shooting. His parents had been active in the Black Panther Party. Current superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, Col. Rick Fuentes, spoke alongside Ford.‘To this day, from her safe haven in Cuba, she been given the pulpit to preach and profess,’ Fuentes said, and ‘flaunts her freedom in the face of this horrific crime.’ Officials said they remain committed to holding Chesimard accountable for her crimes. Anyone with information can call 1-800-CALL-FBI. Elusive: Chesimard, seen here in an FBI photo, has eluded American authorities since her prison escape in 1979 .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:50 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:51 EST, 20 December 2013 . BlackBerry reported a massive $4.4 billion loss in the third quarter and a 56 percent drop in revenue in its first quarterly report under new chairman and chief executive John Chen. Despite the results, Chen said on a conference call with analysts that BlackBerry 'has a really good shot' of turning a profit in 2016 and management will try its best to achieve the goal. Chen later laughed when an analyst wished him the 'best of luck'. BlackBerry said it sold just 1.9 million smartphones in the quarter compared to 3.7 million in the previous . The former Sybase CEO is credited with turning around Sybase, a data company that was sold to SAP in 2010. Chen said reviving BlackBerry will be his most 'complicated' challenge but noted, however, that the company has $3.2 billion in cash, which will 'definitely allow us to engineer our turnaround.' Chen later told reporters he is dropping the interim label from his title and will stay CEO until BlackBerry is on a much firmer footing. BlackBerry also announced Friday that it's entering into a five-year partnership with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles products in vast factories in China. Foxconn, known for its manufacturing contract work on Apple's iPhones and iPads, will jointly design and manufacture some BlackBerry devices and manage inventory of the devices. 'I'm hoping we never have to have a conversation going forward about inventory write downs,' Chen said. He said Foxconn's BlackBerry phones will be released in March or April and will be built in Indonesia and Mexico. The BlackBerry campus in Ottawa, Canada is shown - the company is losing billions . BlackBerry reported revenue of $1.2 billion, down from $2.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Chen has said the company 'is very much alive' but is putting more emphasis on Blackberry's software business than its hardware business. 'I'll be happy to have a breakeven or a low margin device business and then have that help us to monetize software,' Chen said. Chen said the market has spoken. BlackBerry said it sold just 1.9 million smartphones in the quarter compared to 3.7 million in the previous quarter. Most of those were old BlackBerry 7 devices. This year's launch of BlackBerry 10, its revamped operating system, and fancier devices â€” the touchscreen Z10 and Q10 for keyboard loyalists â€” was supposed to rejuvenate the brand and lure customers. But the much-delayed phones failed to turn the company around and have led to a billion dollar loss last quarter and a multibillion loss in the third quarter. 'It was ugly,' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. The BlackBerry Z10 smartphone failed to be a success . Gillis initially said allowing BlackBerry devices to be made by Foxconn's operations in China could pose a problem for a company that relies on governments for a lot of its business because BlackBerry has long emphasized security. But Gillis later noted the devices will be made in Indonesia and Mexico and that BlackBerry will continue to make high end phones so that alleviates concerns. BlackBerry's net loss amounted to $8.37 per share in the latest quarter. Its adjusted loss from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring and other items, was $354 million, or 67 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, expect an adjusted loss of 43 cents per share on revenue of $1.66 billion. Shares of BlackBerry initially fell in premarket trading but jumped after Chen's conference call. The stock is up 13.6 percent, or 85 cents, to $7.10 in afternoon trading. Gillis explained that the stock had been trading at merely its cash value. So any 'heartbeat of hope can cause the market to add a dash of value to the actual company and its assets,' he said. Indeed, BlackBerry reported a strong cash position at the end of the quarter with $3.2 billion and no debt. The company's market capitalization is $3.2 billion. The BlackBerry smartphone, pioneered in 1999, had been the dominant mobile device for on-the-go business people and other consumers before Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Apple's device showed that phones could handle much more than email and calls. In the years since, BlackBerry Ltd. has been hammered by competition from the iPhone as well as Android-based rivals. Chen is putting more emphasis on BlackBerry's mobile device management business, a collection of software that allows IT departments to manage different devices connected to their corporate networks. He is also emphasizing BlackBerry's popular BlackBerry Messenger application that is now also available on Apple and Android devices. And he is also trying to highlight Blackberry's embedded QNX software systems, which are used in-vehicle infotainment systems and industrial machines. 'John articulates a reasonable strategy,' Gillis said. 'He's reached into his pockets and said 'What do I have left?' and said 'let's grow these things.''","BlackBerry sold just 1.9m smartphones in the quarter compared to 3.7m in the previous quarter .

Mix-up: Gates ordered this $9.99 T-shirt with the title of his SyFy show written across from Amazon, but instead got the earmuffs . Gates initially seemed bemused by the mix-up, but his tweets quickly became more comical as he realized that a set of hamburger earmuffs was something that he had been missing his entire life - even if he had never realized it before. Over the past week Gates has posted a series of hilarious photos of him wearing the earmuffs in a number of situations and even his girlfriend joined in the fun. He has documented his earmuff adventures on Twitter with the hashtag #HamburgerEarmuffs. ‘I was immediately confused because there were hamburger earmuffs looking back at me,’ Gates told GoodMorningAmerica.com about the moment that he opened the package. ‘I was then immediately amazed and overjoyed by it. They are just so hilarious. Of all the things that could accidentally have been shipped to you, hamburger earmuffs are probably the best thing.’ The publicity that Gates’ viral campaign has created is something most retailers can’t buy, but unfortunately so too are the earmuffs after the company selling them on Amazon sold out of their final few pairs.

The quads are thriving and full of smiles despite their early births at just 29 weeks in March this year and are set to have a magical Christmas surrounded by the family who wanted them so much. Each baby has their very own named stocking already waiting at the fireside waiting for Father Christmas to fill it with gifts. Although presents and a festive dinner will feature in the special day, they will take second place to the babies feeding and sleeping routines. 'It will be a very special first Christmas,' said proud mum Sharon. 'We will be having presents and will just about manage to fit in a Christmas lunch when they have their afternoon sleep. Emily (left) and Lauren snuggle up together earlier this year . 'But they are the first priority and the feeding and sleeping has to go on as usual. We just have to get on with it.'

The Christmas decorations have been put up but take second place to the enormous amount of equipment the family needs to deal with four completely dependent babies. And they know that it will be relatively quiet before next Christmas - when the four will all be crawling and walking.

The video is set at a 'combat school' where gangsters from the suburb of Satwa learn to use their clothing accessories as whips and are advised to throw sandals at their targets. After Cassim's arrest, he was moved to a maximum security prison in Ahu Dhabi in June and since then, comedians like Will Ferrell, Adam Mckay, and the rest of the team behind the website Funny or Die have been rallying for Cassim's release.

All that UEA officials have said is, 'Mr. Cassim was charged under the UAE's penal code. Anyone charged with a crime under the laws of the UAE is entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the UAE's constitution.' 'There was no indication in local law that making a comedy video, making fun of teenagers in the suburbs, was a threat to the UAE's national security,' said Shez's brother Chevron cassim. The 29-year-old, who has a degree in political science, moved from Minnesota to Dubai after graduating in 2006 and worked at .

Members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation, including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, have tried to intervene, pressing the United Arab Emirates’ U.S. ambassador for answers, according to the Star Tribune. Cassim's sentence is beyond American control. The case reflects a wider crackdown by Gulf Arab authorities on social media use.

A mother and father have been found dead in an apparent murder suicide after their 20-year-old daughter discovered their bodies in their Layton, Utah home. Bret Pepper, 39, is believed to have killed his wife, Jill Pepper, 37, while their other two children - aged 10 and 13 - were also in the house in Layton, Utah, US. Police responded to a 911 call to 580 North Franklin Drive from the couple's oldest daughter at around 1.30am on Sunday morning. Back in the day: Bret and Jill Pepper are pictured here with their three children in 2010 . Close knit: Bret Pepper (right) is believed to have shot his wife and then himself in their Utah house and their bodies were found by their 20-year-old daughter Aspen (left) She said she had gone to check on them after she heard fighting and loud bangs, and had found them both covered in blood and with gunshot wounds. Curtis Salvensen from Layton Police Department said: 'During the course of the argument she heard several loud noises that she described as gunshots. 'At this time it doesn't appear that any of the other family members knew what was going on or witnessed the incident.' Police said the couple had been fighting late into the night but that to those outside of the family, their lives looked anything but acrimonious. Unexpected: Though it does not come as a shock that they had guns in the home but the family appeared to be close and spent time together frequently . Aspen posted photos of family trips to national parks, funny dress up sessions where she tried on her mother's old dance costume, and back yard barbeques where she is taking care of her younger siblings. She is also seen shooting a gun under the watchful- but goofy- eye of her father who playfully put up 'bunny ears' while she smiled and held the handgun. Other family members are now looking after the children, police said. Family friend Jon Taylor told Fox 13 News: 'You would never suspect this of this house and this couple. Home: The couple's three children were in the house for Christmas at the time . Heartbreaking: Friends and neighbours said they would never have expected this to happen . 'You never heard of them fighting. They always spoke highly of each other. This is unbelievable.' Salvensen said police hadn't been called to the home before, and investigators were trying to determine what led to the argument and subsequent deaths. Salvensen said that stress around Christmas may have played a part, although this was not confirmed. He said: 'Sometimes people let that stress build up.'

Last week, residents of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham were treated to a card from their Council ordering them to pay their rent. An image of a pound coin fizzing in a glass was accompanied with a sprig of holly and the words: 'Don't overindulge this Christmas. Pay your rent!'

The network suspended patriarch Phil Robertson last week for telling GQ magazine that gays are sinners akin to adulterers and swindlers . Louisiana's lieutenant governor says the reality TV show Duck Dynasty is important to state tourism after patriarch Phil Robertson was suspended from the reality TV show for saying gays are sinners akin to adulterers and swindlers. Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne said he could help connect the Robertson family with new producers if they cannot reach agreement with the A&E network. 'I'm sure a lot of people found the comments offensive. There's no question about that,' he said. 'The point is he has an opinion and has a set of beliefs and is entitled to those without jeopardising what has become an extremely popular show across America.' Dardenne, who authored the state's film and TV tax credit program, said he wasn't talking about anything that would cost the state money or would require work by people in his office - just his own personal contacts with people in the industry. In a statement emailed on Saturday, he wrote: 'Regardless of one's views on Phil Robertson's statements, Duck Dynasty has been an important representation of the state of Louisiana, inspiring prospective visitors and investors since its debut.' The show is produced around the Robertson family's home base in Ouachita Parish. KNOE-TV of Monroe reported in February that the show was bringing people from around the country who wouldn't otherwise stop in northeast Louisiana. The Duck Commander warehouse has become a tourist attraction, said Alana Cooper, director of the Monroe-West Monroe Visitors and Convention Bureau. Dardenne, whose job includes running the Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, said the audience of tens of millions includes many people eager to visit Louisiana. Scroll down for video .

The pair were on a mission to Iran, heading for Saul's safe house, when they were apprehended by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and Brody's demise ensues. The controversial scene was one of a few that the production company filmed in Morocco rather than Israel amid fears it would not be safe so close to Syria as the US considers a strike on the Middle East nation. Disgusted viewers took to Twitter in rage, and critics blasted the episode as 'offensive', saying the show's creators should end the production.

After a bombing at the CIA's Langley . HQ, Brody fled the country, became a heroin addict while held in a . half-abandoned skyscraper in Venezuela and barely featured until the . last few episodes. His former lover Carrie, meanwhile, was forcibly detained in a psychiatric unit and discovered she was carrying Brody's baby.

After the public execution of Brody, Carrie no longer feels she can be a good mother to his child, which, to her family's horror, she wants to give up for adoption . Fans complained about a lengthy sub-plot featuring Brody's depressed daughter Dana - while he was nowhere to be seen. Producers were forced to defend their decision to include Brody's family prominently - while leaving viewers in the dark about the fate of Brody himself. Gansa said: 'There are all these families that are the victims of somebody in the family doing an act of violence. 'Whether it's Sandy Hook, whether it's Columbine, the Boston Marathon bombers, these people all have families who suffer the consequences of these psychopathic actions.

A mother whose 13-year-old daughter was declared brain dead after what should have been a routine tonsillectomy says she cannot bring herself to take her daughter off life support. Nailah Winkfield of Oakland, California, has pleaded for prayers and time to keep her daughter, Jahi McMath, on a ventilator past Monday, when a temporary restraining order barring a hospital from disconnecting life support expires. ‘They have been pressuring me to “pull the plug”,’ Winkfield wrote in an open letter released this weekend. ‘I can't. I won't. I can't let them kill my baby a second time.’ Loss: Jahi McMath, 13, suffered cardiac arrest after having her tonsils out and has been declared brain dead. A decision is expected on Monday regarding her future . ‘Despite what they say, she is alive. I can touch her, she is warm. She responds to my touch. Given time I know (God) will spark her brain awake.’ Children's Hospital of Oakland's responded in a statement that while it sympathizes with Winkfield's wishes, ‘it would be unfair to give false hope that Jahi will come back to life.’ Jahi was admitted to hospital on December 9 to undergoing a ‘simple procedure’ to remove her tonsil to help with her sleep apnea. But the girl suffered complications and began bleeding profusely from her nose and mouth for hours, Winkfield said. Devastated: Nailah Winkfield (center), mother of Jahi McMath pictured on Friday awaiting the verdict of a court decision about the future of her daughter . McMath then went into cardiac arrest, and was revived by doctors, only for them to declare that she was brain dead on December 12. The hospital statement contends the surgery was complicated, and that it was committed to fully investigating what caused ‘this catastrophic outcome.’ A judge ruled on Friday to keep Jahi on a ventilator and continue giving her intravenous fluids through to Monday, when a court-approved neurologist will examine the girl for any signs of brain activity. The family's attorney, Christopher Dolan, told Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo the family wanted independent tests because they do not believe the hospital's physicians are sufficiently independent. The hospital said in documents presented to the court on Friday that a staff neurologist and Jahi's attending physician conducted separated exams, both of which determined that Jahi's entire brain, including her brain stem, stopped functioning. Ruling: Nailah Winkfield's daughter will be evaluated by an independent doctor on Monday and then a decision on her future will be taken . ‘There is absolutely no medical possibility that (Jahi's) condition is reversible or that she will someday recover from death,’ declarations from the doctors said. ‘Thus, there is no medical justification to provide any further medical treatment whatsoever to (her).’ The family told ABC station KGO-TV in San Francisco they will hold a march and rally Monday at 9:30 a.m. PT outside the hospital. They said the rally will be peaceful and lawful. 'Jahi's favorite color is purple. So if you can come out wearing a purple shirt, it doesn't matter what shade it is. But if you have a purple shirt, please wear it and march with us Monday morning,' McMaths's uncle, Omari Sealey, said. Winkfield told KGO-TV on Friday she was grateful just to have three more days with her daughter. 'It is hard because I feel like I'm just on borrowed time with my daughter,' Winkfield said. 'I will fight for my daughter until I can't fight anymore and I don't know when a mother loses a fight for her children.' United front: Nailah Winkfield (center), Jahi's uncle, Omari Sealey (far left) and their attorney said they wanted to hospital to keep the girl on the ventilator indefinitely . After her daughter underwent a . supposedly routine tonsillectomy and was moved to a recovery room, . Nailah Winkfield began to fear something was going horribly wrong. Jahi was sitting up in bed, her hospital gown bloody, and holding a pink cup full of blood. 'Is this normal?' Winkfield repeatedly asked nurses. With . her family and hospital staff trying to help and comfort her, Jahi kept . bleeding profusely for the next few hours then went into cardiac . arrest, her mother said. In an interview at . Children's Hospital Oakland on Thursday night, Winkfield described the . nightmarish turn of events after her daughter underwent tonsil removal . surgery to help with her sleep apnea. She said that even before . the surgery, her daughter had expressed fears that she wouldn't wake up . after the operation. To everyone's relief, she appeared alert, was . talking and even ate a Popsicle afterward. Beloved: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield has said that she believes God will 'spark her brain awake' Apprehensive: Jahi was nervous about undergoing surgery but her mother assured her she'd be fine. As she was recovering, she was bleeding from the mouth and nose and suffered cardiac arrest . But about a half-hour . later, shortly after the girl was taken to the intensive care unit, she . began bleeding from her mouth and nose despite efforts by hospital staff . and her family. While the bleeding continued, Jahi wrote her . mother notes. In one, the girl asked to have her nose wiped because she . felt it running. Her mother said she didn't want to scare her daughter . by saying it was blood. 'My . daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a . cup and said, ""Here, catch them with the cup so we can measure them,""' Winkfield told ABC 7. Family members said there were containers . of Jahi's blood in the room, and hospital staff members were providing . transfusions to counteract the blood loss. 'I don't know what a . tonsillectomy is supposed to look like after you have it, but that blood . was un-normal for anything,' Winkfield said. The family said hospital officials told them in a meeting Thursday that they want to take the girl off life support quickly. 'I just looked at the doctor to his face and I told him you better not touch her,' Winkfield recalled. The . family filed a request Friday for a temporary restraining order . prohibiting the hospital from taking Jahi off life support or any of her . other current treatment. Speaking to CNN's Piers Morgan Tuesday night, Nailah Winkfield said she believed her daughter could still wake up. 'I . don't want to take my daughter off life support because I love my . child,' an emotional Winkfield said. 'When I walked her into that . hospital, she was perfectly fine, there was nothing wrong with her. She . had no health problems. 'As long as she has a pulse, we want her on life support,' Sealey said. 'We want her to come home for Christmas. We want to give her presents. We want a chance for a Christmas miracle.'

But one quadriplegic man has remarkably lived to tell the tale after getting trapped in his car on a snow-covered mountainside - then crawling for four hours through freezing conditions to safety. Wheelchair rugby player Matt Gypin, 32, had driven his jeep into Colorado's mountains to take a picture for a calendar he gives his mother each Christmas when he became stranded in a snow drift. 'Didn't think I was going to make it': Quadraplegic Matt Gypin re-enacts how he used his wheelchair as a walker to help him crawl to safety after getting trapped in his car on a snowy mountainside in Colorado . Stranded: Rescuers work to free Mr Gypin's Jeep which became stuck in a snow drift, forcing him to spend the night in the car while wearing only a beanie hat and sweatshirt to keep him warm . With the sun setting, no mobile phone signal and with only a beanie hat and sweatshirt for warmth, he had no option but to hunker down for the night in his car. The next morning, having failed to dig his vehicle out of the snow, he realised he had no option but to try to make it to the nearby Sylvan Lake State Park. Mr Gypin was left partially paralysed after breaking his neck when he fell from a third-floor balcony during a friend's graduation party ten years ago. But he still has some feeling in some of his limbs. Against the odds: Mr Gypin was left partially paralysed in all four limbs after breaking his neck when he fell from a third-floor balcony during a friend's graduation party ten years ago . Civilization, at last: Eventually, four hours later, Mr Gypin arrived at the park, where he had to throw a brick through the window of this building to get to a phone to dial 911 . Using his manual wheelchair as a walker, he painstakingly edged his way down the road. 'It wasn't easy,' he told Daily Camera. 'There were times that I didn't think I was going to make it.

An Iraq war vet with post traumatic stress disorder has gone on a deadly gun rampage in an apartment complex - killing one elderly neighbour and critically wounding the dead man's wife. The shooter - identified as Ricardo Javier Tapia, 32 - started spraying bullets around the residential complex while banging on doors and ranting about Barack Obama and Adolf Hitler, residents claim. Several of the rounds hit an elderly couple, fatally wounding a man in his 70s and his wife, according to Los Angeles Police. Arrest: Police wrestle a shirtless suspect to the ground after Tasering him during the struggle . The pensioner was declared dead at the scene while his wife was rushed to hospital where she remains in a critical condition. Police were called to the apartment at 6.40pm, on Friday, in the 7200 block of Canby Avenue in Reseda, Los Angeles. Tapia, who apparently lives in the apartment complex, was spotted shirtless and covered in blood when police arrived. He then charged at officers with his hands up, an eyewitness claims. Emergency: Officers were called to the apartment complex in Reseda, Los Angeles after reports of shots being fired . Bloodbath: A smashed glass window is evidence of the rampage around the apartment building which left one elderly resident dead and his wife critically wounded . Police eventually had to Tazer Tapia after failing to subdue him. 'I heard [the suspect] saying Hitler, Obama, and...terrorists and cops just got all over him. He was just fighting the whole way,' witness Erik Correa told ABC 7. 'I heard a gun shooting, and then I saw him - he was upstairs and he was just screaming and then he was all red and bloody,' said neighbor Amy Cobangbang. A neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, told ABC 7 news the suspect was in his apartment and allegedly heard a thump. She said: 'I guess that thump triggered everything else and he figured the house was under attack.' Detectives are still investigating what may have sparked the gun rampage and are examining claims the suspect was behaving erratically and shouting random comments before the incident. It is understood Tapia's wife is the manager of the apartment complex. She is pregnant with their second child. Tapia is being held on $1 million bail.","Ricardo Tapia went on the rampage in apartments in Reseda, Los Angeles .

Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said he will help Germany investigate NSA spying if Berlin grants him political asylum. Revelations about the National Security Agency's spy programs were first published in June, based on some of the thousands of documents Snowden handed over to the Brazil-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald and his reporting partner Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker. Snowden, who is living in Russia on a temporary one-year visa, has previously requested political asylum in Brazil and several other nations. Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said he will help Germany investigate NSA spying if Berlin grants him political asylum . But in a letter to the publication German Stern he wrote: 'I have a great respect for Germany.' He believes the U.S. will 'implement sanctions against Germany in response to criticism of illegal surveillance' because it will cause 'greater harm to the U.S. rather than Germany.' Snowden sent a similar open letter to Brazil last week but according to newspaper reports the government said it would not be granting him asylum. Snowden commended the Brazilian government for its strong stand against spying and wrote that he would aid them in investigating claims that Brazil is one of the victims of NSA - if they give him asylum. Glenn Greenwald, the American journalist who first published the documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden . Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) said operationally they are not working with Snowden while Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff (right) cancelled a state visit to America . However, several Brazilian politicians, mainly opponents of Rousseff's leftist government, said granting Snowden asylum would be counter-productive and would lead to further deterioration of ties with the United States, the country's largest trading partner after China. The documents revealed that Brazil is the top NSA target in Latin America, spying that has included the monitoring of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's cellphone and hacking into the internal network of state-run oil company Petrobras. The revelations enraged Rousseff, who in October cancelled an official visit to Washington that was to include a state dinner. More than 50 German public figures asked Berlin to grant Snowden asylum in November but the German government refused this request. According to RT, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: 'Operationally, we are not working with him and never have done, and are not asking him any questions about how his agency worked on Russia. 'I won't hide it, this person is not without interest for me.

A covert CIA program has helped Colombia's government kill at least two dozen leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the rebel insurgency also known as FARC. The National Security Agency has also provided 'substantial eavesdropping help' to the Colombian government, according to The Washington Post. And the U.S. provided Colombia with GPS equipment that can be used to transform regular munitions into 'smart bombs' that can accurately home in on specific targets, even if they are located in dense jungles. Blood bath: Policemen stand near the bodies of members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in Cucuta on October 11, 2011. Seven Colombian soldiers and 11 guerrillas were killed in two separate clashes between the military and FARC guerrillas . In March 2008, Colombian forces killed a top FARC commander, Raul Reyes, in one of several jungle camps the rebels operated in Ecuador, just across the border. The Post report said Colombia used U.S.-made smart bombs in the operation. The report is based on interviews with more than 30 former and current U.S. and Colombian officials, who the Post said spoke on condition of anonymity because the program is classified and ongoing. The CIA would not comment on the Post report. Without going into detail, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told the Post that the CIA has been 'of help', providing Colombian forces with 'better training and knowledge'.

It was authorized by President George W. Bush and has continued under President Barack Obama, the newspaper reported. Colombia's government and FARC have been engaged in peace talks in Havana since late 2012, but there has been no ceasefire between the two sides. Earlier this month Santos blamed the rebels for an attack on a police post that killed nine people, including civilians, military and a police officer. The FARC rebels took up arms in 1964.

The British White Widow is believed to be masterminding new terror atrocities from a training camp linked to Al Qaeda after she was seen fleeing on a camel into a snake-infested forest in Somalia. Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, is suspected of helping to co-ordinate the attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in September which resulted in the deaths of 67 people. It is believed the terror suspect was transported in a 4x4 over the Kenyan border into Somalia where she has since been spotted four times. The latest sighting was two weeks ago, when spies saw the mother-of-four riding a camel between training camps in Baidoa. Sightings: British-born Samantha Lewthwaite, known as the 'White Widow', has been spotted four times in Somalia since the September Nairobi shopping mall massacre . Lewthwaite, widow of one of the 7/7 London bombers, is now believed to be at a training camp hidden deep in the forest which is run by terror groups linked to Al Qaeda. Colonel Yasin Hiro of the Somali National Army told The Mirror: 'She has been moving by camel. We think she is in the camps. We hope the snakes and scorpions like her.' The Al Shabaab terror group leader, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, first fled to war-torn Somalia after the Nairobi shopping mall massacre. According to the newspaper, she was then taken by boat to a remote beach before moving on to a hideout in Raas Kaambooni. Lewthwaite was next spotted heading to Kismayo - a former terrorist stronghold - before moving on again to Barawe by speedboat. UN official Guled Mohamed told The Mirror: 'People in this very beautiful old ­Portuguese city are white skinned and blue eyed so she would blend well.' In hiding: Lewthwaite was last spotted fleeing on a camel into a snake-infested forest in Baidoa where there is believed to be a terrorist training camp . The final sighting of the Briton was as she moved by camel to Baidoa where the Somali National Army is fighting approximately 8,000 terrorists. It is feared the extremist is using the base to plot more terror attacks. Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Lewthwaite after she was named as one of the prime suspects behind the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in September. Lewthwaite is also wanted in Kenya for allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to Al Shabaab. Interpol issued this international arrest warrant for Lewthwaite after she was named as one of the prime suspects behind the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in September . East Kenya police commander Aggrey Adoli said: 'We believe Samantha Lewthwaite is behind these killings as well as a gang of others.

Once we apprehend Samantha Lewthwaite she'll have a lot of questions to answer. 'She is without a doubt an incredible threat to national and ­international security. We are working round the clock to bring her in to stop her causing more carnage.' The officer said she is wanted on charges of 'murder and inciting Muslim youths to violence'.

Uganda's parliament has passed a law that punishes 'aggrivated homosexuality' with life imprisonment despite Western opposition. First introduced in parliament in 2009 as a private member's bill, the law initially proposed the death penalty for some homosexual acts in the conservative east African country. It was later amended to remove the death penalty, but includes jail terms for anyone convicted, including life imprisonment for what it defines as 'aggravated' homosexual acts. Scroll down for video . Uganda has passed a law making 'aggravated homosexuality' punishable by life in prison but human rights organisations are calling on President Museveni (pictured) to reject the legislation . Countries including the United States previously criticised the bill when it came before parliament. Germany cut off aid to Uganda late last year citing the bill as one of its concerns. Widespread criticism of the law, and resistance from the executive which is wary of antagonising western donors, stalled its passage. But parliament has also been under pressure to push it through, especially from mainstream and evangelical churches. Homosexuality was already illegal in Uganda, but the new law prohibits the ""promotion"" of gay rights and punishes anyone who ""funds"", ""sponsors"" or ""abets"" homosexuality. Homosexuality is taboo in many African countries. It is illegal in 37 nations on the continent, and activists say few Africans are openly gay, fearing imprisonment, violence and losing their jobs. Frank Mugisha, executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), said he would try to rally rights activists to have the law blocked in the courts. 'We in the gay community are in a panic,' he told Reuters. 'People are afraid of walking in the streets, because they know how Ugandans like to take the law into their own hands.' The president must sign any bill passed in parliament before it becomes law. The deeply conservative nation has a long history of anti-gay campaigning, including this newspaper - unrelated to the American magazine - which printed the faces of men it claimed were gay . 'Clearly, President Museveni should reject the bill and send a clear message that Uganda doesn't stand for this type of intolerance and discrimination,' said Maria Burnett, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'The removal of the death penalty is a good thing, but life imprisonment and a raft of other alarming provisions remain, many of which are wholly unenforceable.' International rights groups have criticized Uganda for passing a series of laws they say have chipped away at civil liberties and created an oppressive environment. This week parliament passed an anti-pornography law that bans 'erotic behaviour intended to cause sexual excitement and any indecent act or behaviour tending to corrupt morals.' Local media critics responded with derision, dubbing it the 'anti-miniskirt' law because it prohibits wearing miniskirts. In August, Uganda also passed a public order management law that requires anyone planning to hold a political rally or demonstration to give notice to the police. The legislation gives authorities sweeping powers to stop such meetings if they have 'reasonable grounds' to do so.","Uganda has passed legislation banning 'promotion' of gay rights .

A picture of a nine-month-old baby splashing in a crocodile-infested river after being put there by his mother's partner has sparked outrage across Australia. Baby Dexter was too young to know that the waters hid lurking crocodiles which have a reputation for moving in silently on their prey - and striking in a flash. And while the picture, posted on Facebook, has outraged some people who have described allowing the baby to play there as being irresponsible, Dexter's mother, Haley Mackenzie, came out on the defensive. Fury: This shocking picture of little Dexter playing in a crocodile infested river which were posted on Facebook sparked outrage . 'I know how the photo looks,' she said. 'A couple of people have told me that looked a bit dangerous.' She added, however that 'at the time the river was completely down, he's at the edge of the water and there were heaps of people around him.' The photo was taken at Cahills Crossing, on the East Alligator River, some 150 miles east of Darwin. Cooling off: Baby Dexter is dunked into the river, which is home to killer saltwater crocodiles that measure up to 18ft lonf . Ms Mackenzie said she had complete trust in her partner, who had taken Dexter with him when he joined a group of friends on a fishing expedition in the river. Margot Marshall, from Parks Australia, which manages Cahills Crossing, told the Northern Territory News that there were visible warnings advising people not to swim. 'The warnings are also clear about where people should fish if they choose to,' she said. Cahills Crossing is notorious for its large number of crocodiles, where 'salties' are known to measure up to 18ft long. Danger: Experts warned against swimming in the waters which can be home to giant 18ft man-eating saltwater crocodiles. (Stock picture) In 1987, storeman Kerry McLoughlin, from the small community of Jabiru, was killed by a huge crocodile after he was knocked into the river by the incoming tide. A woman who knows the area said she was disturbed when she saw the photo of Dexter playing in the water because she knows of the large number of crocodiles that live there. 'You should never put a baby into those waters,' she said. 'As a kid I'd walk down the edge of the river and be told off.' Australians writing to the Northern Territory News expressed their horror at the photo. 'Look at the water depth sign and the current running past it,' wrote one. 'A croc could sneak down on the current and whamo, the child is gone in a flash.' Another writer wrote cynically: 'Oh look at little Dexter having fun! Chomp, Oh look, there goes little Dexter in the jaws of a croc...the kid has no say in being used as croc bait. Someone and give the parent..a punch in the head.

Vogue has broken the terms of its own health initiatives again, this time by publishing a fashion spread in Vogue Mexico’s November issue that features a 15-year-old model. Young Polish model Julie Borawska stars in the shoot looking every bit the Vogue model in the story’s mostly-blue clothes – but she does not fit the magazine’s self-imposed rule of using faces that are older than 16. Julie’s feature represents the third time that Vogue’s international editions have broken their health initiative by using young models. Too young: Julia Borawski (pictured on the cover of Barrel Fashion), is a 15-year-old Polish model who appeared in Vogue Mexico, despite the magazine's guideline not to use models under the age of 16 . The Vogue Health Initiative was established in 2012 to emulate similar guidelines that were being implemented across the global fashion industry – from Israel to the United States. But two months later, in Vogue China’s August 2012 issue, 15-year-old model Ondria Hardin appeared in a fashion spread. The following month, another 15-year-old, Sarah Kees, appeared in Vogue Italia’s September issue. A fourth violation almost occurred around the same time when 14-year-old Thairine Garcia was photographed for Vogue Japan. Her shoot, however, was never published. Regarding Borawska’s feature, Vogue . Mexico’s editor Kelly Talamas says that the magazine bought her spread . as syndicated content and that it was unaware of the model’s real age. She . told Fashionista that the publication ‘did not cast any models for this . shoot, and was not involved in any manner with the production.’ Syndicated content: Vogue Mexico's editor says that the magazine was not involved in the production of Borawski's shoot and that her photographs were purchased as syndicated content . Representatives for Vogue Mexico have since contacted the shoot’s photographer Kevin Sinclair ‘to clarify this issue and identify exactly where the protocol failed in order to avoid this from ever happening again.’ But as Mr Sinclair told the site: ‘I am aware of the age restrictions with Condé Nast. I was not aware the model was 15 years of age. When we communicated with her agency in Poland they never mentioned that she was so young. We were all under the impression that she was 18 years or older, not 15.’ Representatives for Julie's Polish agency Gaga Models told MailOnline that they took care to make Mr Sinclair aware of her age before she was hired. Julie’s birth year (1998) is clearly labeled on the agency’s website. Her Instagram bio also confirms her age, reading: ’15 yo polish model...[sic]’ At the time of Ondria Hardin’s feature in Vogue China, Condé . Nast International’s chairman and chief executive Jonathan Newhouse . said that the company was ‘very serious’ about its health initiative and . that it would do ‘everything possible to prevent future errors.’ Vogue Mexico's oversight does not correlate with his comments.","Polish model Julia Borawska appears in Vogue Mexico's November 2013 issue .

Glenn Hoddle wants to be back at Spurs even if it is only until the end of the season . Sherwood is expected to be offered the job until the end of the season but he wants it full time, leaving former manager Hoddle as Levy’s only interim option. But Van Gaal’s glittering CV - which includes league titles with Ajax, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar - has seduced Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Dutch national television NOS knocked on Van Gaal’s door at his home in Noordwijk on Sunday after reports that Levy met the fabled coach for talks. Van Gaal said: ‘I’ll never comment on offers. I’ve always said I want to work in the Premier League once, so there’s a chance. ‘There are times a deal is announced and there are times it’s in preparations. ‘Everyone who knows me knows I won’t do a job share.’ Tottenham’s interim manager Tim . Sherwood pressed his claims for the job on Sunday with a 3-2 victory at . Southampton in his first Premier League game in charge. But . Levy is wasting no time putting plans in place for his next manager and . remarkably Hoddle is expected to meet the chairman before Christmas. Hoddle . was sacked by Levy in September 2003 after a disastrous home defeat to . Southampton, but he claims he is ready to steady the ship. Van Gaal’s allure has put him in the frame and he is one of the most successful managers in the history of the game. Tricky: Van Gaal isn't allowed dual jobs by the Dutch FA, meaning he'd only be available in the summer . Dream: Van Gaal said he wants to manage in England when asked at home by Dutch television . No secret! Sherwood has always insisted that he wants, and is ready for, the job at White Hart Lane . Fit and firing: Sherwood has already brought out the best in the previously frozen out Emmanuel Adebayor . Dutch coach Louis van Gaal has managed Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Holland in an illustrious management career. The 62-year-old has 19 major honours as a boss, including the Champions League. Levy initially wanted Van Gaal, who is quitting Holland after next summer’s World Cup, as an interim manager until the end of the season. But the Dutch football association - . KNVB - will not allow Van Gaal to work in a dual role ahead of the most . important tournament in world football. Van Gaal, 62, is being replaced by Guus Hiddink next summer, but he does not want to leave his role early. His last club job was with Bayern Munich . and he was beaten in the Champions League final by Jose Mourinho’s . Inter Milan side in 2010 at the Bernabeu. Mourinho worked under Van Gaal during . the Dutchman’s spell in charge at Barcelona and is always incredibly . respectful of his achievements in the game. Van .

The engineer whose speeding commuter train ran off the rails along a curve, killing four people, experienced a hypnosis-like ‘daze’ and nodded at the controls just before the wreck, and by the time he caught himself it was too late, . Attorney Jeffrey Chartier accompanied engineer William Rockefeller to his interview with National Transportation Safety Board investigators and described the account Rockefeller gave. Chartier said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘a daze,’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis. He couldn't say how long it lasted. Under scrutiny: Rockefeller initially told investigators that the brakes didn't work but then he later said that he may have 'dozed off' behind the wheel on the Sunday morning shift . What Rockefeller remembers is . ‘operating the train, coming to a section where the track was still . clear - then, all of a sudden, feeling something was wrong and hitting . the brakes,’ Chartier said. ‘... He felt something was not right, and he . hit the brakes.’ He called Rockefeller ‘a guy with a stellar record who, I believe, did nothing wrong.’ ‘You've got a good guy and an accident,’ he said. ‘... A terrible accident is what it is.’ Rockefeller . ‘basically nodded,’ said Anthony Bottalico, leader of the rail . employees union, relating what he said the engineer told him. ‘He . had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car,’ Bottalico . said. ‘That is, you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that . might be.’ Getting answers: Federal investigators have determined that there was nothing technically wrong with the train's brakes before the Sunday morning crash but came short of fully blaming the conductor . Nodded: An attorney who accompanied Rockefeller to his meeting with the National Transportation Safety Board said the engineer has now revealed he nodded off just prior to the crash and awoke when it was too late to brake . Investigators have determined earlier that the . deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with . the train itself as the driver had originally claimed. The . National Transportation Safety Board said in a Tuesday press conference . that it hadn't found any evidence of brake or signal trouble during the . train's nine previous stops along New York's Hudson River on Sunday . morning. NTSB member Earl . Weener said Tuesday there were 'no anomalies' with the train but it was . too soon to formally say whether the excessive speed was the result of . human error- say, a sleepy or distracted operator- or a mechanical . problem. While investigators had yet to finish talking with engineer William Rockefeller, questions swirled around him because the train went into the curve at nearly three times the speed limit. Sources from the train crash investigation revealed that engineer William Rockefeller (pictured) admitted that he 'dozed off' seconds before the Metro-North train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in New York City . Dozens of people were injured and four people were killed. As . NTSB worked to determine what caused the Sunday morning wreck in the . Bronx, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Rockefeller should be disciplined for . 'unjustifiable' speed. Investigators began talking to the engineer Monday but didn't complete the interview. The . New York Police Department is conducting its own investigation, with . help from the Bronx district attorney's office, in the event the . derailment becomes a criminal case. Whatever the findings on the cause of the crash, Cuomo said Tuesday the engineer could be faulted for the train's speed alone. Recovery: Federal investigators wouldn't comment on Rockefeller's level of alertness around the time of the Sunday morning wreck, which killed 4. Shown are recovery operations in the Bronx on Monday . 'Certainly, we want to make sure that that operator is disciplined in an appropriate way. There's such a gross deviation from the norm,' the Governor said. An attorney for Rockefeller didn't immediately return calls Tuesday, but his union spoke up in his defense. 'This is a man who is totally distraught by the loss of life, and he's having a tough time dealing with that,' said Anthony Bottalico, his union leader. 'Once the NTSB is done with their investigation and Billy is finished with his interview, it will be quite evident that there was no criminal intent with the operation of his train,' Bottalico said. Rockefeller had an unblemished record prior to the accident but told investigators after the crash that he had 'zoned out'. The engineer, 46 and married with no children, has worked for the railroad for about 20 years and has been an engineer for 11, Bottalico said. Critical: Governor Cuomo, seen at the crash site on Sunday alongside NTSB's Weener, has now said that the engineer will undoubtedly be punished for the 'unjustifiable' speed as he was going 82mph in a 30mph zone . Rockefeller lives in a well-kept house on a modest rural road in Germantown, N.Y., about 40 miles south of Albany. He started as a custodian at Grand Central Terminal, then monitored the building's fire alarms and other systems, and ultimately became an engineer. Rockefeller's work routine had recently changed: he had begun running that route on November 17, two weeks before the wreck, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North's parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Bottalico said Rockefeller had changed work schedules- switching from afternoons to the day shift, which typically begins at 5am- but was familiar with the route and qualified to run it. 'He was a stellar employee. Unbelievable,' said his former supervisor, Michael McLendon, who retired from the railroad about a year ago. McLendon said he was stunned when he heard about the crash, shortly after opening his mail to find a Christmas card from Rockefeller and his wife. 'I said, ""Well, I can't imagine Billy making a mistake,""' McLendon said. 'Not intentionally, by any stretch of the imagination.'

A plasterer was kicked to death while shopping with his girlfriend's nephew in a row over 'petty name calling'. Jonathan Fitchett, 22, was chased across a car park outside a JD Sports store in Prescot, Merseyside, and then subjected to a 'barrage of punches and kicks' while shopping for a football. As he lay dying on the ground one of the killers boasted 'That’s how you knock someone out lad' and walked away, a court heard. Jonathan Fitchett, 22, was chased across a car park outside a JD Sports store and then subjected to a 'barrage of punches'  while shopping for a football in Prescot, Merseyside . Mr Fitchett was taken to hospital with bleeding on the brain and a fractured jaw but died the next day from a brain haemorrhage. Gerard Childs and Stephen Price, both 28, were jailed for life after being convicted of murder, at Liverpool Crown Court. The court heard the two men were locked in a trivial feud for years with Mr Fitchett calling Childs a ‘muppet.’ A jury was told that at lunchtime on July 11 the killers spotted Fitchett in the car park of JD Sports, where he had bought a McDonalds meal and a football so he could take his girlfriend’s nephew for a kickabout in a local park. But he bumped into Childs and a shirtless Price who chased him across the car park before flooring him. They then punched and kicked him to the head and body. Price then leaned over the unconscious Mr Fitchett, and said: 'You won’t do that again, will you?' He was then heard to say as he walked away: 'That’s how you knock someone out lad.' One shopper who had been on her way to the Pets at Home store saw one of the attackers 'throw a barrage of punches' in the victim’s face and described the blows as 'horrific.' She told the jury: ' I shouted ""stop it, stop it, don’t do that"". Another lad ran up and kicked the other lad. 'As the lad walked away he said ""that’s how you knock someone out"". Gerard Childs and Stephen Price, both 28, were jailed for life after being convicted of murder, at Liverpool Crown Court . 'I remember somebody saying ""you’re going to get nicked. It’s camera’d up"". They got in a car outside JD Sports and drove off.' Police arrived to find Mr Fitchett unconscious and motionless on his back and he died in Whiston Hospital. They arrested his two killers later after CCTV from the retail park showed the assault in detail. Childs, a roofer of Rainhill, Liverpool and Price, of Prescot denied murder claiming it was self defence. Price said: 'I didn’t want any of this to happen. We didn’t want anyone to die. It was just a big tragic accident. I’m f****** devastated you know.' Childs will serve a minimum of 10 years before he can be considered for release. Price must serve 11 years. The judge, Mrs Justice Laura Cox said: 'This is a tragic case which occurred in broad daylight on a busy retail park in the presence of shoppers and ordinary families going about their business. 'It involves the death of one young man whose loss has devastated his family and friends and the conviction for murder of two others who must now live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their lives. Police arrived to find Mr Fitchett unconscious and motionless on his back and he died in Whiston Hospital. They arrested his two killers later after CCTV from the retail park showed the assault in detail, Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) heard . 'They will know only too well the grave consequences of this tragedy for them and their own family and friends.' After the case Gary Simpson, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service Mersey-Cheshire, said: 'Jonathan Fitchett was subjected to a deadly and sustained attack by Childs and Price in a busy shopping centre. 'It happened during an extremely busy part of the day with lots of shoppers and pedestrians around who were undoubtedly horrified by the assault. 'Several witnesses confirmed that they had seen the men punching and kicking Jonathan who was unable to defend himself. 'The hard work of the Crown Prosecution Service and Merseyside Police has brought these two violent men to justice. They are now behind bars and Jonathan’s family must struggle to come to terms with their loss.' At the time of his death Fitchett’s sister Amy Hutkowski, 24, who works as a nanny in America said: 'Jonathan was a loving young gentleman, seconds away from starting his life. He was working hard getting things ready for his own business and wanted a house and a family in his future. 'He loved to keep active, playing football and enjoyed playing golf. Not a day went by where someone would not have the pleasure of seeing Jon with his cheeky smile and an ear to listen to or a hand to help. 'He was such a caring old soul, mature, strong-headed and willing.

A Government minister has spoken out against the 'disgraceful' treatment of Nigella Lawson during the recent fraud trial of two of her assistants. The celebrity chef has not been charged with any crime, but she was repeatedly accused of using illegal drugs in an attempt by lawyers for Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo to discredit her evidence. Her brother Dominic has written of his anger at how she was treated on the stand, and now a leading Conservative MP has joined the chorus of criticism. Anger: Nigella Lawson, left, was treated 'disgracefully' during her assistants' fraud trial, according to defence minister Anna Soubry, right . Cleared: Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo were accused of defrauding their former employers . Defence minister Anna Soubry told the BBC: 'It is almost like a traditional feeding frenzy and I just find it utterly appalling and I think that everybody should just shut up and leave them to it.' The trial, which concluded at Isleworth Crown Court last week with the acquittal of the Grillo sisters, has featured a string of lurid allegations about Ms Lawson's life with ex-husband Charles Saatchi. The defence barristers argued that the chef allowed her aides to spend thousands of pounds on her credit card in an attempt to buy their silence about her drug abuse. Ms Lawson admitted smoking cannabis and taking cocaine a handful of times, but denied being a regular or long-term user of illegal drugs. Defence: Ms Lawson's brother Dominic, pictured accompanying her to court, claims she was not allowed to defend herself against allegations of drug use . 'We are beginning to lose the plot in this country,' Ms Soubry said yesterday. 'It started with a photograph of her being assaulted by her husband. 'Out in public was played what should have been a very private and very distressing moment. 'These criminal proceeding had already begun in 2012, and now we have had this playing out of this court case where Nigella Lawson quite properly complains that she feels she is on trial.' Ms Soubry is not the first politician to express support for Ms Lawson - the Grillos' trial nearly collapsed after David Cameron said he was on 'team Nigella', describing her as 'very funny and warm'. Break-up: The trial came months after the end of Ms Lawson's marriage to Charles Saatchi . The minister's feelings were echoed by Dominic Lawson, the brother of the TV star and a Daily Mail columnist. He wrote today that his sister was wrongly portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics', and was not given an opportunity to defend herself against the allegations. Mr Lawson, son of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel, warned that the aggressive treatment meted out to his sister might dissuade others from coming forward as witnesses in future criminal trials. Ms Lawson was first accused of drug-taking by her ex-husband Mr Saatchi in an email read out in court which he later disavowed. The couple divorced earlier this year after the advertising mogul and art collector was pictured apparently throttling his wife during dinner at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair.","Celebrity chef 'felt she was on trial', says defence minister Anna Soubry .

A man and a woman were shot dead at a Paris bar on Sunday evening by a gunman who then fled on foot, it emerged this morning. Police have described the crime as 'mysterious' and admitted they do not yet any motive for the murders. The two were shot at point-blank range with one bullet each as they were in the outside terrace of the Cafe Chineur bar in a residential part of the French capital's southern 14th arrondissement, or district. 'Mysterious' shooting: A man and woman have been shot dead at blank point range outside Cage Chineur, pictured, in Paris's 14th residential district . They tried to take refuge inside the bar but the man died at the scene and the woman died as she was being taken to hospital, said police investigator Jean-Jacques Herlem. Herlem called the shooting 'mysterious' and said police did not yet know the motive. 'All hypotheses are obviously open. The investigation has just started,' said a source close to the probe. The identities of the victims were not immediately given. The police crimes squad is handling the investigation. There was a heavy police presence at the bar where the shooting took place.

A leading candidate for Paris mayor who lives nearby, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, went to the scene after learning of the shooting from friends. 'My children go to two schools in the neighbourhood. I'm shocked,' said Kosciusko-Morizet, who is running on the ticket of the UMP party in polls set for March. 'It's impossible not to make the connection with the growing concerns over security issues, even if we don't know anything at this stage,' she told AFP. France occasionally sees deadly score-settling by armed criminals in bars, most often in southern cities such as Marseille, but sometimes also in Paris, though in places well away from the heavily policed centre favoured by tourists. Deadly disputes sometimes also erupt between couples, though not often involving firearms.","Both were hit by one bullet outside the Cafe Chineur bar in Paris .

Vince Cable has savaged David Cameron for demanding tougher controls on immigration, accusing the Prime Minister of behaving like Enoch Powell. In an extraordinary attack, the Lib Dem Business Secretary claimed the Tories were speading ‘panic’ about immigration and compared their ‘populist policies’ to Mr Powell’s notorious ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech from the 1960s. And in a bizarre attack on the public, he suggested voters were ‘schizophrenic’ because they wanted curbs on migration despite enjoying holidays abroad. 'Panics': Vince Cable, pictured yesterday, attacked Tory demands for greater immigration controls . New laws: A ban on EU migrants claiming out-of-work benefits from the moment they arrive in the UK is being rushed through Parliament ahead of the January 1 lifting of access restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals . Mr Cable’s comments threatened to . reignite a major Coalition row over immigration ahead of an expected . influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are lifted on . January 1. One Tory . Cabinet minister said the Business Secretary was once again ‘spewing . bile’ and suggested Mr Cable should resign if he ‘hates us so much’. The . controversy erupted as a major new report warned that Bulgarian and . Romanian migrants could put  huge pressure on housing, schools and . hospitals in Britain. The . study by the centre-Left Institute for Public Policy Research says the . UK could see an increase in ‘anti-social behaviour’ such as ‘aggressive . begging, rough sleeping and even criminality’ as a result of the new . arrivals. And it warns that the Prime Minister’s much heralded changes to benefits rules will make little or no difference. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday said it was right to ban new arrivals from claiming benefits for three months when they come to the UK. Political: Mr Cable made the comments during an appearance on BBC1's Andrew Marr show . But the Lib Dem leader made clear his party would not sanction any further curbs on migrants, saying: ‘This is where we draw the line.’ Mr Cable went far further, rounding on his Coalition colleagues with a venom that took senior Tories aback. Accusing the Conservatives of inflaming public fear of foreigners, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that they were behaving like Mr Powell, who was sacked from the Tory frontbench in 1968 after warning that new arrivals would lead to social unrest. The Business Secretary said Tory Home Secretary Theresa May’s desire to cap EU migrants at 75,000 a year was ‘illegal and impossible to implement’ and claimed Tory interventions are doing ‘a great deal of damage’ to Britain. Dividing line: Nick Clegg, pictured left, has . pledged to block attempts to cap the number of EU migrants allowed into . the UK just days after David Cameron, pictured right, vowed to veto any . expansion of EU borders . He said: ‘What’s happening here is that the Conservatives are in a bit of panic because of UKIP. 'Reacting the way they are, it’s not going to help them politically but it’s doing a great deal of damage. ‘We periodically get these immigration panics, I remember going back to Enoch Powell and ‘‘rivers of blood’’ and all that, and if you go back a century there were panics over Jewish immigrants. ‘The responsibility of politicians in this situation when people are getting anxious is to try to reassure them and give them facts and not panic and resort to populist measures that do harm.’ Mr Cable also attacked the Tories over ‘very severe’ public spending cuts, warning that the ‘social fabric’ of Britain is at risk. 'We periodically get these panics on immigration, going back to Enoch Powell and rivers of blood' Vince Cable yesterday . Finally, he launched a bizarre attack on the public, saying their desire to block new arrivals contrasts with their own wish to travel abroad. He said: ‘It was summarised for me in a debate I had on the doorstep recently. Somebody said they are so absolutely fed up with all of these immigrants coming into Britain, they’re going to go away and live in Spain. ‘There’s a lot of sort of schizophrenia about it. What we’ve got to stop is damaging policies that actually do harm.’ In The Sunday Times, Mr Clegg said immigration was ‘the biggest dividing line in politics today’ and plans for a cap were ‘arbitrary, pointless and distracting’. He wrote: ‘Sticking a big no-entry sign on the cliffs of Dover may be politically popular, but at a huge economic cost. What would happen if tonight every European living in the UK boarded a ship or plane and went home? 'Are we really that keen to see the back of German lawyers, Dutch accountants or Finnish engineers? Do we want the NHS to fall over and the City of London to grind to a halt?’ Sources close to Mr Cameron sought to downplay the row, insisting it is right to ‘put in place more robust transitional controls’ on new arrivals and ‘to make sure people can come here to work but not just to claim benefits.’ Referring to Mr Cable’s Enoch Powell comments, the source added: ‘Vince is a member of the Government and supports government policy. The words he chooses to do that are up to him.’ But the Tory Cabinet minister told the Daily Mail: ‘Once again Vince Cable opens his mouth and spews bile. If he hates us so much, I don’t know why he doesn’t resign. We could then have a Business Secretary who has a clue how to help business.’ Seventy Tory MPs are threatening to rebel over a vote on whether transitional restrictions should be reintroduced in January. Mr Cameron has resisted calls to face down the EU and extend the controls, despite opinion polls showing public support for such a move. Tory minister Ken Clarke claimed fears that Britain will be inundated after restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian migration are lifted on January 1 are exaggerated.","Business Secretary said Tories were spreading 'panic' about immigration .

Greig Trout, a former crime scene investigator with the Metropolitan Police, decided he would to travel the world and follow his dreams after being given the all-clear a second time. His list of '101 things to do when you survive' is a take on the 21st century phenomenon of the bucket list - a fantasy wishlist of things to do and see, set up for those battling terminal illness before they 'kick the bucket'. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Police officer and cancer survivor Greig Trout has compiled an alternative 'bucket list' to help inspire others to beat the disease . Mr Trout is one of the survivors behind Cancer Research UK's Every Moment Counts campaign which highlights the special moments of those who have encountered the disease. He was first diagnosed with cancer aged seven and had to have a kidney removed. Since beating cancer again, the 34-year-old, originally from Dumfries in Scotland, has spent three months working with a remote community in Nicaragua, climbed a volcano in Costa Rica and went nature-watching on the Galapagos Islands. He is currently in Ecuador. Mr Trout, who lived in Newcastle and Bristol before moving to London to join the police, said: 'After my bowel operation and with chemotherapy looming, the worst-case scenario was death. Living the dream: Since beating cancer again, the 34-year-old has spent three months working with a remote community in Nicaragua, climbed a volcano in Costa Rica and went nature-watching on the Galapagos Islands . 'At that point, my thoughts were not . of all I had achieved at work as a crime scene examiner or the nice . apartment I lived in, they were of the places I had visited and of the . experiences I had had.

I got my two-year ""all clear"", I decided the time was right to follow . my dreams and travel the world with the aim of inspiring others affected . by cancer.' The idea for the anti-bucket list came to him when he was in a hospital waiting room. 'It's . exactly that ""every moment counts"" feeling,' he said. 'As I watched . people come and go, I knew some of them were not going to get good news. Schoolboy: Mr Trout was first diagnosed with cancer aged seven and had to have a kidney removed .

Trout has since created a website for his challenge which so far has 50 . ideas on the list, leaving a further 51 vacancies for other suggestions. He . said: 'I knew I wanted to create a website showing a double cancer . survivor who has one kidney, a missing piece of bowel and deep vein . thrombosis, living a full and happy life.' Mr Trout's ideas have also caught the eye of adventurer Bear Grylls, who said he had been inspired by the mission.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 06:46 EST, 23 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:23 EST, 23 December 2013 . The mother of a schoolboy who apparently killed himself after being falsely accused of rape has branded the justice system a 'joke' after one of his bullies walked free. Tom Acton, 16, is believed to have committed suicide following a hate campaign against him which started after he told police about drug dealers plaguing his neighbourhood. Thomas Greenwood, 18, admitted assaulting the teenager, but escaped jail as he was handed a 12-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work. Grief: Tom Acton, pictured left with his mother Gaynor, apparently killed himself after being bullied; Thomas Greenwood, right, one of his tormentors, has walked free from jail . After the victim reported drug dealers in his home town of Poynton, Cheshire to the police, false rumours spread that he had tied a girl to a tree and raped her. Tom was then targeted in the streets by angry mobs, while vigilantes turned up at his front door saying they wanted to 'get rid of the vermin' - but both his school and the police said they were unable to help him. He began self-harming and was found critically ill in his bedroom on October 31, just days before he was due to testify at Greenwood's trial, dying in hospital two days later. The teenager's death was not mentioned during Greenwood's sentencing at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court. After the thug  - who has not been linked to drug dealing - walked free from court, Tom's mother Gaynor described the punishment as 'bloody disgusting' and said the authorities had let her son down. Rumours: After Tom spoke out against drug dealers, he was falsely accused of raping a girl . 'This sentence is absolutely bloody disgusting but sadly I'm not surprised as I wasn't expecting much more,' said company director Mrs Acton, 45. 'The justice system in Britain is just a laugh and a joke. 'My son is dead because of these people and yet this guy is already back out on the streets walking scot-free. I don't even know how to feel about it. I just feel numb. 'In this world as it stands at the moment it seems it doesn't matter who you are or what you've done, you'll get away with it. It's people like my son, the victims, that end up suffering and paying the price. It's quite simply appalling, I'm lost for words.' The bereaved mother has previously denounced officials for failing to protect Tom from local thugs after he spoke out against the drug dealers and was then targeted by the false rape claims. 'The rumour went all over the place and on Facebook and Tom went to live with his gran in Wales for a bit,' Mrs Acton said. Wounded: Tom's injuries after he was attacked by a gang of bullies are pictured here, right . 'Straightaway I called the school and police but they said there was nothing they could do about it. They said it was just a rumour and that Facebook is their bane. 'Tom became a recluse in his own house. It was horrific. He was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it. 'We would have gangs of 30 coming to my door shouting abuse when me and my family were in the house at around 10pm at night. We didn't feel safe in our home, the kids said they had come ""to get rid of the vermin"". 'This was a kid being called a rapist and it wasn't true. Tom was never questioned as a rapist or charged, it was the bullies making it up. He couldn't even walk along the road because of the name-calling and violence.' In June Greenwood attacked Tom outside his home, and threatened him with what the victim believed was a knife. School: Officials at Poynton High School said they were unable to prevent Tom being bullied . In a statement given before his death, Tom said: 'He grabbed hold of my arms turning me towards him and pushed me into a bush. 'He said, ""Tell me tell me."" I didn't understand what he wanted me to tell him but he said: ""Apparently you strapped someone to a tree and raped them and took pictures."" I said, ""What are you on about?"" 'He threatened to break my nose and said: ""If I see you, you are dead."" I screamed for my life and I saw him just staring me out. I thought my life was going to end. 'As you can imagine I can no longer walk down the street as everyone calls me a rapist. I felt so scared for my life I wanted to break down and cry. I was scared to go out of the house. I wish I wasn't here.' In mitigation Greenwood's lawyer Anthony Derbyshire said: 'He did approach Thomas and confront him with regards to the issue as to whether he assaulted one of his friends. He is genuinely remorseful.' For confidential . support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local .

Cleared: Detective constable Gary Quigley was acquitted of administering a poison or noxious substance with intent at Southwark Crown Court . A policeman who filled a Powerade bottle with screenwash as a practical joke - only for it to be drunk by an unsuspecting colleague - has been cleared of poisoning him. Detective Constable Gary Quigley, who works in the Child Protection division of the Metropolitan Police, said he was 'fed up' with his drink getting stolen from a communal fridge. So, in what he later described as 'a poorly-planed practical joke', he filled up a 500ml bottle of the berry and tropical-flavoured drink with screenwash, hoping to identify the culprit and 'teach him a lesson'. But his colleague, DC Steve Halfhide, who also drank Powerade and stored it in the same fridge, accidentally drank from the bottle of screenwash. After swallowing two mouthfuls of the drink, he felt a burning pain in his throat and vomited several times. DC Halfhide was advised to go to hospital but luckily he was not seriously hurt after drinking the toxic liquid on 29 January last year. Quigley was arrested and charged for attempting to poison his colleague with intent. But he insisted that his sole intention was to catch the thief, and not to cause any harm, which led to him being cleared of the charge today at Southwark Crown Court. He had originally admitted the office, but changed his plea and managed to convince a jury of seven men and five women that he is an innocent man. Wearing a dark jacket over a white casual shirt, Quigley, smiled to relatives in the public gallery when the verdict was announced. The court heard that Quigley bought the Powerade while he was training for a half-marathon. The pair were based at police offices in Cam Road, Straford, but did not know each other, said prosecutor Joceyln Ledward. He said: ‘The defendant replaced the blue Powerade drink in a sports-style drinking bottle with screenwash and put it back in the communal fridge in the office he worked. ‘He says his motive in doing so was the belief the drink was his, and that the person who had been stealing his drinks would be taught a lesson. ‘In fact, his colleague, Steve Halfhide, had the misfortune also to be a drinker of Powerade, and to have stored his own Powerade drinks in the fridge. Victim: DC Steve Halfhide, left, was also a Powerade drinker who used the communal fridge, and accidentally drank from the screenwash bottle, which caused burning pain and vomiting . ‘When he drank from the Powerade in question, he swallowed a mouthful or two of screenwash before experienced the very unpleasant consequences.’ Ms Ledward added: ‘Whether this drink was in fact DC Halfhide’s, or whether he thought it was, or even if he was stealing DC Quigley’s drink is irrelevant. ‘This was a dangerous and completely disproportionate thing to do in the circumstances. ‘By deliberately disguising the blue screen wash in a Powerade bottle and placing it, unlabelled, in the communal fridge, the defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have forseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose.’ Quigley, from Colchester, Essex, claimed there was a ‘culture of humour’ at his office where officers would play pranks on each other. He said colleagues were aware of the Powerade being spiked with screen wash, and had suggested alternatives including Fairy Liquid and even urine. Ms Ledward said this was merely Quigley ‘trying to deflect attention from his own wrong doing.’ In a prepared statement he said: ‘I admit fully and accept all culpability for my actions. ‘I am extremely sorry and deeply remorseful for what has happened. It was never my intention to cause any injury to anyone. ‘However, I do accept that my actions were likely to cause grievance or annoyance.’","Detective Constable Gary Quigley was 'fed up' with people taking his drink .

A hospital chief who stole £43,548 from the NHS was caught out when police found a handwritten note which read, 'Total stolen from NHS- £33,750'. Dean Evans, 41, who stole £43,548 worth of money and electrical goods from University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and was jailed for 18 months after admitting theft. Evans, from who earned £35,000-a-year as a learning and technology manager with the trust, was arrested after police found a notebook in his home, where he had brazenly written a total of the amount he had stolen from the NHS. Dean Evans, 41, stole £43,548 worth of money and electrical goods from University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and was jailed for 18 months . Leicester Crown Court heard how Evans submitted false invoices to the hospital trust including £4,440 for two camera lenses and spent the money he stole on gambling trips to Las Vegas. Evans also stole an iPod, Ipads and Macbook, totalling £24,000 and sold some of it on eBay earning himself £10,000. Soon after starting his NHS job in 2010, Evans formed his own company, Promet Solutions Limited, which he registered as a supplier to the NHS - without indicating he was connected with it. Promet Solutions was supposedly supplying services to the trust, including arranging conferences and obtaining sources of goods to be supplied to the NHS but he instead used to company to obtain money. Evans even arranged for hospital library fines to be paid directly to his company, via credit cards, but never handed over the £182 obtained under the scheme to the trust. Evans also spent £600 on a Christmas party for his staff, telling his team he was personally paying for it as a thank you - but instead he invoiced the trust for it as a 'conference deposit'. Leicester's Glenfield Hospital (pictured) is run by the NHS Trust Evans stole from . Evans was sacked in October, 2011, following an investigation by the NHS Fraud Unit and has now been jailed for 18 months. Sentencing Evans, Recorder Marcus Tregilgas-Davey said: 'The loss to the trust will impact upon the people of this city. 'It will have had an effect on some of the health services that the trust offers. That means individuals who rely on the trust for their healthcare and wellbeing will have been affected because the trust will have had to cancel or cut back certain services to make up for the £43,548 you stole. 'You knew what you were doing and police found a notebook where you wrote ‘Total stolen from NHS £33,750’. 'I accept you were building up debts and some money was to assist with finances, but some was also used to assist with what could be called lavish living. 'There were expensive electrical items, meals out and trips abroad including Las Vegas, involving gambling, and money paid to your son.' Paul Tubb, mitigating, said Evans maintained there was an 'ingrained culture' of senior management putting on Christmas parties to boost staff morale, which was often funded by the NHS, by holding a conference followed by a party. He said: 'He was a middle manager responsible for an individual who had six people working below her.' Mr Tubb said Evans got into financial difficulty when his former partner left him 'out of the blue' and he struggled to meet his mortgage and credit card commitments. After the case, Andrew Seddon, director of finance at the trust, said: 'Mr Dean Evans worked for the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust as the learning and technology manager from April 12, 2010, until October 31, 2011. 'Following allegations and a subsequent investigation, he was dismissed for gross misconduct. 'We have worked closely with NHS Counter Fraud and the police since the allegations came to light. 'We have changed a number of procedures and protocols as a result of our investigations, to ensure that something similar cannot happen in future. 'We are satisfied that justice has been served and the custodial sentence is reflective of the severity of fraud of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.'","Dean Evans stole from University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust .

Chinese billionaire Lam Kok, 46, was surveying his newly-purchased vineyard in southwest France with his son Shun Yu Kok, his interpreter and advisor Peng Wang and winemaker James Gregoire when their aircraft crashed into the Dordogne river.

Vincent Corbel, of the regional gendarme service, said the reason for the Friday night crash is unclear. The wreckage of the helicopter will be examined for clues in the hope of shedding light on what happened. Corbel said the former owner of the Chateau de la Riviere vineyards, Mr Gregoire, owned the helicopter and appeared to have been piloting it.

All in the helicopter had been taking part in a celebratory press day, marking the sale of the historic estate.

The group, whose interests range from Pu'er - a dark fermented tea from China's Yunnan region - to top-end resorts, also planned to build a hotel near the château.

Marjorie Cartwright, 80, was walking her Yorkshire Terrier in Stoke-On-Trent when two dogs appeared . A great-grandmother was forced to fight off two raging dogs with her walking stick in a desperate bid to save herself after they savaged her pet Yorkshire terrier. Marjorie Cartwright, 80, had been walking her six-year-old dog Chucky down the street in Stoke-On-Trent when two Staffordshire bull terriers 'came out of nowhere'. With no owner in sight, the dogs charged at the pensioner before turning on Chucky and tearing at his throat. Mrs Cartwright tried to beat them off with her walking stick but could not rescue her beloved pet before one ran off with him hanging from its mouth 'like a rag doll'. The terrifying attack only ended when the owner drove past and the dogs jumped in the car. Hours from death, Chucky was rushed to the vets covered in blood and had an emergency operation which saved his life. Vets said he would have died if he hadn't been wearing a coat. Mrs Cartwright said: 'I was terrified the dog was going to rip Chucky's throat. 'I had a stroke three years ago and I thought I was going to have another one when I saw one of them drag him down the street. 'I can't walk very far because I have problems with my spine but I went as fast as I could - hitting the dogs with my walking stick. 'The biggest one grabbed Chucky by the neck and ran about a quarter of a mile with him in its mouth before the owner arrived in a white car. 'He is my life and I would have been devastated if they killed him.' Staffordshire Police are now hunting for the dogs' owner, who gave Mrs Cartwright a false address. Devastating: Six-year-old Chucky was taken by the neck like a rag doll as Mrs Cartwright ran after them . Mrs Cartwright added: 'She called them off and I pleaded with her to take Chucky to the vets because he was covered in blood but she refused. 'I asked for her address but when police visited the home, it turned out to be a false address. 'The vets have told me Chucky would have died if he hadn't been wearing his little coat as the bites would have punctured a main artery. 'I think these dogs are likely to attack again and it might be a child they go for next time.' Wounds: He was left with severe wounds all over, and would have died if he hadn't been wearing a coat . The owner of the dogs drove past and handed Mrs Cartwright a fake address before taking off with her pets . Staffordshire Police are now appealing for any witnesses to the incident, which happened at around 3pm on Thursday. A police spokesman said: 'The owner of the Yorkshire Terrier spoke to a lady at the scene who provided her with false details.

"By . Phil Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 17:46 EST, 22 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 22 December 2013 . What did you drink at the weekend? A pre-Christmas glass of mulled wine? A warming mug of eggnog? Over the next couple of days, perhaps you'll have a Buck's Fizz at breakfast and a cheeky pre-lunch sherry. Maybe there will even be a Baileys as you sink into the sofa after downing several glasses of wine with your turkey. After all, 'tis the season to be merry. Sober celebration: Phil, with his three sons, refuses to drink in front of them . But have you ever stopped to think about the effect all this conspicuous consumption of alcohol - inextricably linked, as it is, to both celebration and relaxation - has upon the children in your family? I was just ten when I stole my first drink at a family wedding in 1983, but even now I can remember how much I wanted to be a part of this grown-up, glamorous world - one that was accompanied by the clattering of ice and chinking of glasses. In a pattern that would continue for the next 20 years - a period in which I became dangerously and excessively reliant on alcohol - I wasn't able to stop at one drink. While the adults danced, I toured the room looking for more. The tables were groaning with glasses of all shapes and sizes. I picked up a goblet of Liebfraumilch, the then-ubiquitous sweet German wine. I took my first sip: it tasted like ice-cold apple juice. I glugged down the rest and wobbled around the table sipping rum and Cokes (more please), gin and tonics with a bitter tang (no thanks), and finished at least two glasses of sherry, which tasted like cough syrup. Nobody seemed to notice, and I wanted to try them all, every drink that I'd seen adults with, both in real life and the glamorous world of TV. It was only staring at the blurred landscape on the car ride home that I became aware of my altered reality and threw up. Mum blamed it on too much trifle. Alcohol is everywhere: Phil believes his entire generation is bringing up its children to see drink as a part of everyday life . Had my parents known what I had been up to, I'd have been severely punished. Even though I felt ill, I didn't associate this with alcohol - all I remembered was the buzz, the warm contentment. We were all a little naive about health in the Eighties - still smoking, drinking, and eating red meat most nights of the week. But in the health-conscious 21st century, with all we now know, you might assume society is more savvy, sensible and strict about children and alcohol. It seems not. In November this year, two shocking pieces of research were published. One study revealed that one in five 11 to 15-year-olds who had drunk alcohol in the previous month said it had been bought for them by their parents. Meanwhile, Britain's top liver disease expert, Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, reported a 'meteoric rise' in alcohol-related deaths as a result of young people drinking heavily in their teens. 'Liver specialists are seeing people as young as in their 20s dying due to alcohol,' he said. 'If the increase carries on at the same rate, we could see up to a quarter of a million preventable deaths from liver disease in the next 20 years.' Sadly, I wasn't surprised. My entire generation is bringing up its children to see drink as a part of everyday life - and at no time more so than at Christmas, when it's estimated that the average adult will spend £75 on drink. Alcohol is everywhere and TV advertising, filled with beautiful people happily quaffing drink, is the beating heart of our booze-worshipping culture. As a child, my brain was full of slogans: lager that stays sharp to the bottom of the glass, the amber nectar. The Webster's Yorkshire bitter whippet made me laugh, and I wanted to follow the Hoffmeister lager bear. The beer, wine and spirits industry and supermarkets spend £800 million a year on TV advertising, which generates a whopping £37.7 billion a year in revenue. Companies promote alcohol as the magic key to affluence, togetherness and fun; the natural accompaniment for every imaginable family occasion. The truth is that alcohol all too easily becomes the enemy of easy socialising. It exacerbates depression and having too much causes you to become withdrawn to the point where you can only socialise comfortably by being drunk. But children bombarded by advertising images get only one side of the story. The problem took off in my parents' generation. Raised in the Fifties, where the only alcohol in the house was a bottle of Advocaat that lived in a cupboard until Christmas, they regarded drinking as a treat. Wine was too expensive and the cheap stuff was unpalatable. During the Eighties boom, however, much of the country - my parents included - experienced a boost in household income. They could now afford to drink regularly, and with this new affluence came what seemed like a more glamorous lifestyle. Indoctrinating: Alcohol is promoted as a reward that will make grumpy people happy and sad people laugh . My favourite childhood memories were watching Mum, a teacher, and Dad, a director at an engineering firm, spending Friday night with our neighbours, mostly professionals and small business owners. I remember them laughing as they drank to wind down at the end of the week. To a child, the message that alcohol was a reward was clear: it made grumpy people happy, sad people laugh. It was a  powerful, wordless form of indoctrination. I kept drinking sneakily at every family occasion. And by the age of 14, I was adept at helping myself at parties while the adults weren't looking. I can't remember a time that my school friends or I couldn't get our hands on alcohol. There was so much booze sloshing around our parents' homes that no one needed to set foot in an off-licence. Our parents knew nothing. While we were allowed a small beer or shandy on a special occasion, they would never have expected we would take such liberties with their trust. And no one warned us about the perils of alcohol. We were lectured on the deadly threat of heroin, but never about the nation's fix of choice: a drug that kills 10,000 people a year and is responsible for one-third of all hospital admissions. By the time I went to college I had no boundaries around alcohol. A group of us who drank with equal ferocity would head out for a fry-up on a Saturday morning to mop up our hangovers and then wait for the pubs to open again at 11 am. It seemed normal. Of my close-knit circle of five friends, three of us went on to develop alcohol and substance abuse issues in our 20s. After college, I continued to drink heavily through the first half of my 20s until I found myself in a doctor's surgery in 1998 in the grip of a nervous breakdown. Booze-worshipping culture: The beer, wine and spirits industry and supermarkets spend £800 million a year on TV advertising . My doctor asked how many drinks are too many and I replied: 'Eight?' He said: 'One is too many - if you are an alcoholic.' Of course, I was not a full-blown alcoholic, but did I have a problem with alcohol? You bet! So I quit drinking for the next ten years, determined to clean my life up. I believe quitting alcohol remains the most important move anyone can make to resurrect their mental and physical well-being. The process of recovery means rejecting old habits, staying away from pubs and nightclubs. You feel lost and lonely, often. The upside is that you see your old self with some clarity. I also watched the drinking of my friends sky-rocket. Drink is everywhere. I remember attending the Christmas play at my three-year-old son's nursery and being offered mulled wine. Dangerous: There has been a 'meteoric rise' in alcohol-related deaths as a result of young people drinking heavily in their teens . Take your children to a toddler's party and there's a good chance adults will be offered a glass of wine or a bottle of beer. This makes me despair. Today's children rarely see adults socialising without a drink. We are teaching our children that booze belongs everywhere. My wife never saw her parents drink when she was growing up, as they were both teetotal. As a result, she has no impulse to do so herself. Dinner is complete without a bottle of red. No birthday party requires champagne. After a decade without alcohol, I started drinking again a year ago because I felt healthy enough to do so. These days I drink (and even get drunk) occasionally with friends, but rarely at home in front of my three sons, aged seven, nine and 11. If I want a drink, I have to make a conscious effort to go to the pub. Buying wine and beer at the supermarket and putting it in the fridge next to the orange juice normalises an addictive drug. It is the surest route to developing a family habit. Instead, I am a happy, occasional drinker. I don't preach abstinence to my sons, but I do think they need to know the dangers. If they ask me about alcohol, I share some of the details that the supermarkets and brewing giants don't care to mention. That alcohol is habit forming; that it makes you look ropey and old; and causes physical diseases and mental illnesses in otherwise healthy people. The message is this: do as I do - not as I did. Needless to say, when we sit down to the turkey, they will only see me raising a small glass of wine.","Phil doesn't drink in front of his sons because of alcohol's harmful effects .

As David Coleman takes his seat in the celestial commentary-box, alongside John Arlott, Ron Pickering, Peter Jones, Reg Gutteridge and so many other wonderful broadcasters who became as synonymous with the sports on which they commentated as any actual participant, it is impossible not to reflect on the jabbering inanities that pass for so much television sports coverage today. Coleman was the absolute antithesis of all the modern-day female sports reporters manifestly chosen for their looks rather than their depth of knowledge. He must have wondered what had happened to the legacy handed down by him and those other great pioneers of television sport when he watched those touchline dollies who sometimes graduate to presenting jobs, but might as well be fronting programmes about gardening or property make-overs for all the sporting passion they exude. Sporting giant: David Coleman with Bill Beaumont (left) and cricket legend Ian Botham (right) He was the antithesis, too, of all the ex-footballers who appear to think that playing the game to a high level entitles them to pass off rank platitudes as keen insight. It must be said that there are some shining exceptions, among them Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Martin Keown. But from too many of the others, we get banter when we crave analysis, words when we crave silence. Coleman, who died on Saturday aged 87, would never have tolerated that. His priority was his audience, and it showed. Yet he was also respected, even venerated, both by his colleagues and those whose deeds he described. The former athlete-turned commentator Steve Cram has admitted, with obvious sincerity, that when Coleman praised him for running well, it meant more to him than anything even his own coach might say. And many broadcasters who are now veterans themselves ascribe their success to watching the way Coleman did it. All those who were lucky enough to work alongside him remember his volcanic eruptions of temper when his own high standards were not met. BBC sports commentator David Coleman at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground in 1971 . He suffered fools notoriously badly, and there is a great YouTube clip of him ferociously haranguing a BBC cameraman who fluffed an opening link. He had spent his National Service as an army PE instructor, and one can only imagine what he said to those who shirked their squat thrusts. But he was hugely generous to those he admired, or in whom he saw promise, dispensing advice intended to propel them up the career ladder. The former BBC athletics commentator Stuart Storey once told me what Coleman said to him, very succinctly and very firmly, at the beginning of his broadcasting career: 'This is television. The commentator should only say what the picture does not say.' As a guiding principle, that should be branded in the mind, if not on the forehead, of every TV sports commentator. Instead, it is treated these days as just another dusty, irrelevant maxim, like Lord Reith's original remit for the BBC to 'inform, educate and entertain'. Sports commentator David Coleman's priority was his audience, and it showed . Listening to one of Coleman's football commentaries now is indeed a kind of re-education. No banalities, no wasted words, and yet all the more potent for it. 'Porterfield ... one-nil,' was how he greeted one of the most dramatic of all FA Cup final goals, for under-dog Sunderland against the then mighty Leeds United in 1973. It was all that was required. He didn't go on to tell us that Ian Porterfield shared a birthday with King Farouk of Egypt, or whatever inconsequential fact might be trotted out today, because we didn't need to know. Storey also told me: 'I also used to listen to the way in which he used intonation. In his athletics commentaries you could tell the difference between a heat, a semi-final and a final just by the way he used his voice. 'Before a final he would be silent, and then he would simply say: ""The Olympic men's 100 metres final"" and the hairs would stand up on the back of your neck.' But such economy of style didn't mean a lack of preparation. On the contrary, nobody prepared more thoroughly than Coleman, as I once heard from another of his proteges, the football commentator John Motson. 'He told me to immerse myself in the game I was covering and I'm still following that advice today,' said Motson. 'That's the way he brought me up.' What Coleman brought both to the commentary-box and the presenter's chair were iron-clad journalistic virtues. Born in 1926 in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, he had been a reporter on the Stockport Express and briefly edited another newspaper before joining the BBC in 1954, so he knew how to tell a story concisely. That background in news was never more evident than in 1972, when he reported live and unscripted, with utterly unruffled and eloquent solemnity, from the Olympic Village in Munich, where 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and then murdered by Black September terrorists. He would eventually cover 16 summer and winter Olympic Games and six World Cups, as well as presenting Grandstand and Sportsnight With Coleman for many years, but that broadcast from Munich was his finest hour. It proved the value of giving presenting jobs in television sport to trained journalists, another tradition that has evaporated in recent years, as our broadcasting companies fall over each other in the rush to hire former sportsmen and women, giving precious little thought, it sometimes seems, to whether they actually have the right qualities. True, Gary Lineker and Sue Barker were bright and diligent enough to acquire them, but it's still worth wondering whether a David Coleman or a Desmond Lynam would reach the front of the career race today. They would have to wrestle past an awfully crowded field of ex-players to get there. And if they didn't get there, think what we would lose. What, in fact, we might already have lost. Crucially, Coleman did have some sporting pedigree of his own. As a fine middle-distance runner he had been an Olympic hopeful in 1952 until injury denied him the chance of a trial, so he understood athletics from both sides of the track. An understanding and love of sport informed every one of his broadcasts, from that tour de force in Munich in 1972 to hundreds of episodes as quizmaster on A Question Of Sport from 1979 to 1997. But it was underpinned by a newsman's instincts, and of course it is ironic — and not a little unfair — that a man who put in so many hours of homework should have given his name to the on-air gaffe, thanks to the Private Eye column Colemanballs. Frankly, when you're performing live under the kind of pressure Coleman faced every day of his TV career, the occasional fluff is inevitable. Another irony is that such a consummate professional should have inspired one of the most bumbling comic creations of recent times, in the hapless form of the Steve Coogan character Alan Partridge. Long before he wound up on North Norfolk Digital, Partridge was a BBC sports reporter, whose mannerisms (and diamond-patterned pullovers) were plainly influenced by Coleman. And before that, Coleman was lampooned in latex by the satirical show Spitting Image, excitably crying 'quite remarkable!' Well, 'quite remarkable' is as good an epitaph as any for David Coleman. He was a true giant of broadcasting, and his passing offers a reminder that television sport now is populated by far too many who really don't deserve a place in his long shadow.","David Coleman was 'the antithesis of modern-day female sports reporters'

An airline pilot intentionally crashed a plane that killed 33 people in Africa, air officials have said. Herminio dos Santos Fernandes sent the Mozambican Airlines plane in a rapid descent from 38,000 feet while his co-pilot was in the toilet. Repeated banging on the cockpit door can be heard on recordings from the recovered black box. It isn’t known if the banging was from the co-pilot or passengers. All 27 passengers and six crew members were on board when the plane crashed in the Bwabwata National Park in Namibia . The plane was bound for Angola with six crew members and 27 passengers when it went down on November 29 in a Namibian national park. 'There was an intention to crash the plane,' Joao Abreu, chairman of the Mozambican Civil Aviation Institute said after analysing cockpit recordings. The pilot’s motives are not known, and investigations will continue, he said. Radar data showed that, at an obligatory reporting position over northern Botswana, the plane suddenly started to slow downwards rapidly. The plane’s movements were normal before that, with no mechanical functions, he said. The altitude selector was then manually altered three times, bringing the plane’s altitude down from 38,000 feet to 592 feet, Abreu said, reading the preliminary report to reporters. Low and high intensity alarm signals can be heard on recovered recordings from the plane, along with the sounds of repeated banging on the cockpit door, he said. The investigation report does not say who was banging, but Abreu said that the co-pilot was not in the cockpit at the time of the crash and not responsible for the crash. The 'black box' flight recorders were recovered intact and sent to the United States National Transport Safety Board in Washington to be decoded and transcribed. Other indicators show manual operations were used, he said, adding that 'all these operations required detailed knowledge of the plane’s controls, and showed a clear intention to crash the aircraft.' The control tower had lost voice and radar contact and set search operations in motion. The wreckage of the plane was found in the following days.","Herminio dos Santos Fernandes sent plane into descent when co-pilot was in the toilet .

For the same price - around Â£80,000 - car enthusiasts could pick up a sleek brand new sports car like the British Aston Martin V8 Vantage. But one buyer was more than happy to break the record for the highest amount of money ever paid for a Toyota as this left-hand drive 2000GT was dubbed Japan's first ever supercar in the 1960s. And, unlike the company's famous advertising slogan, it's unlikely you will spot one of these in front of you as only 62 were ever built and only a handful were ever exported out of Japan. The world's most expensive Toyota: This rare yellow 2000GT sports car  sold for $1.2 million in California . In top condition: The interior of the 45-year-old 2000GT, which has just 62,000 on the clock, has been restored to high standards . Unique: The two seat hardtop coupe was first displayed to the public at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1965 . The sale of the sports car which boasts a top speed of 135mph was handled by Canadian-based RM Auctions. An RM auctions spokesperson Megan McGrail explained why this six-cylinder car fetched such a high price. Ms McGrail said: 'The 2000GT was the Japanese E-Type, a car that could run against the best that Europe had to offer. 'This car is without a doubt the finest and most authentic 2000GT to come to market in recent years.

'As its wonders have begun to achieve recognition in recent years, surviving examples have become highly sought-after. 'Today, the 2000GT is universally described as the most collectible, desirable, and valuable Japanese automobile ever produced.' The Toyota was sold by the Texas-based Don Davis Collection, who bought the car from another Texas car collector. Ms McGrail added: 'The car had been previously restored to high standards. One of a few: Only 62 left-hand drive 2000GT Toyota cars were ever built and only a handful were ever exported out of Japan. Packing quite a kick: With a 2.0litre engine, the 2000GT can reach top speeds of 135mph . 'But during its time in the Davis Collection it has undergone significant work to improve the restoration's authenticity. 'This includes painting the inside of the headlamp buckets black, applying the correct grey finish around the side window surrounds, finishing the wheels the correct colour. 'The Toyota was taken down to bare metal and re-spraying the body its original Bendix Yellow. 'The reading of 62,000 miles is believed original, as demonstrated by the excellent condition of the unrestored gauges, dash, console, and seats, which are all in highly original condition.'

Sarah's Law: The rule was brought in after the murder of Sarah Payne, pictured, who went missing when she was eight years old . Around five families a week are being told by police about a paedophile who has contact with their children. More than 700 child sex attackers have been unmasked using Sarah’s Law – which was brought in after the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne by Roy Whiting. The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. Since the law came into force in April 2011, police in England, Scotland and Wales have received some 4,754 applications from anxious parents and grandparents. Of those, a total of 708 - around one in seven - resulted in disclosures. Applications have fallen since the scheme was launched, from 1,944 in 2011/2012 to 1,106 so far this year. Disclosures have also declined from 281 in the first year to 122 in the year to April 2013. Donald Findlater, director of research and development at Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a charity which works with sexual abusers as well as victims, said: ‘While the number of applications being made is small, at 4,754 over two and half years, the conversion rate of one in seven applications resulting in a disclosure is encouraging. ‘It shows that adults can and do notice worrying behaviour in others around them - a key factor in keeping children safe. ‘Our concern here would be the other six out of seven people who made an application but did not get a disclosure. ‘The police know of only a proportion of offenders - many have not been caught and are not on any police database. 'For members of the public to make an application to police they must have had some concerns in the first place.’ Since the scheme began, Avon and . Somerset Police have revealed the highest number of paedophiles at 42, . followed by Devon and Cornwall with 39, Thames Valley with 36 and . Norfolk with 33. A total of 49 identities have been released in . Scotland. It was . introduced after a campaign by Sarah Payne’s mother, Sara. Her . daughter’s body was found in a field near Pulborough, West Sussex in . July 2000. Campaign: Sarah Payne's mother, called Sara, fought hard to have the new law introduced . The scheme is a watered-down version of similar laws in the US under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised. Last year, doubts on the future effectiveness of the scheme were raised after a High Court ruling said sex offenders’ human rights to privacy should be considered when dealing with applications. In a judgement that lawyers said risked ‘watering down’ the law, the court ruled in October 2012 that offenders should be given a say before their presence is disclosed. Jon Brown, NSPCC lead for tackling sexual abuse, said: ‘Sarah’s Law is not a silver bullet to end child abuse and giving the public information about where sex offenders live is just one part of the jigsaw. ‘It’s vital sex offenders serve long prison sentences, and like parents, we of course believe prison is the best place for those who harm children. ‘But all prisoners are released eventually so sex offenders must be thoroughly risk assessed and given therapy so they understand what they have done is wrong before they are released. And then they must be monitored closely by the authorities for a long time.’","Rule allows parents to check backgrounds of men with access to children .

Groups of excited families flocked to see the 12 homes in Hedge End, Hampshire, and the surrounding streets decked out like a winter wonderland. However, many were left disappointed after a neighbour alerted police - who installed a roadblock an forced homeowners to switch off the lights. Festive: Scores of people visited the cul-de-sac in Hedge End, Hampshire, which had been lit up for charity . 'Traffic chaos': One neighbour called police due to the number of visitors. Police enforced a roadblock and ordered homeowners to turn the lights off until observers had dispersed . Cars were said to be blocking roads, which raised concerns of crashes and emergency services not being able to get through. The lights were switched off until traffic dispersed and residents were only allowed to turn them back on once the roads were clear. Hampshire Constabulary even issued an online warning urging people to stay away from the area. Participants have raised £25,000 for a children’s hospice by lighting up their homes from December 1 to January 1 for the last 10 years. Many reacted angrily to the intervention and branded the shutdown ‘disgusting’. Hanna Robinson wrote on Facebook: 'I think this is a disgusting and disrespectful status from Hampshire constabulary. 'The residents in this road have come together as a community to raise money for charity, and all you can do is worry about a bit of congestion for a few nights. 'You should be spending more time fighting real crime than to be writing statuses like this...

'Punished for a good deed': One visitor hit out at the police action, saying officers were 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' for shutting it down . Another, Gemma Burgess, said the families should be rewarded for putting the lights up and footing steep electricity bills for a good cause. She wrote: 'They do this not only for charity that they do every year but also to see the smiles on the kids’ faces. 'A lot of people can’t afford to take their kids for Christmas days out so they take them there to see the lights. 'My kids love it and look forward to it. Yes tonight it was busy but more people means more donations and how can anyone moan about that!! Bah humbug!!' And Andy Grant-West added: 'This is a charity and community thing. Our money goes regularly on police having to be at events like football that a lot of people have no interest in, but we are forced to live with it and put up with it. 'Christmas is once a year and the lights are for a charity. Can the police not extend their services and be charitable at this time of year?' Intervention: Police even issued an online warning, saying visitors must stay away from the area . A resident, who asked not to be named, said the fundraisers were due to meet with police over the future of the lights. The retired man said: 'There were hundreds and hundreds of people here and with cars parked on verges and blocking access there were fears about public safety and crashes. 'The police said it was a public order issue because of all the congestion. 'It’s a shame because at the end of the day we’re doing this for charity. 'Some people come back every night because their children love the lights so much - the reward is seeing the delighted look on their little faces. Congestion: Hampshire police said that some were 'concerned about congestion around the Christmas lights . 'When the congestion had eased, there was an outcry to be allowed to turn the lights back on. The officers on the ground got the go-ahead from their superiors and eventually we could.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is calling for schools to be given more control on workday and term lengths . Schools could open until 6pm for up to 51 weeks a year under controversial government proposals to create more flexible days, it was revealed today. Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to give schools more powers over the working hours available to teachers as well as holidays and pay. Schools already have the freedom to set their own term dates and vary the length of days, which could signal the end of the long summer holidays for thousands of children. However, in a submission to the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB), an independent panel that vets teachers’ pay, Mr Gove is pushing for an overhaul of teachers’ working conditions. He said that many schools are unable to take advantage of current government reforms ‘because of the restrictive terms under which they currently employ teachers’. Teachers’ contracts stipulate that they should work 1,265 hours over 195 days a year, of which five days a year are out of the classroom for duties other than direct teaching. Mr Gove wants this ‘central specification of teachers’ working days and hours’ removed from the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) and for teachers to cover for absent colleagues more regularly. He is also targeting a list of 21 tasks including photocopying and collecting money from pupils that teachers are currently prevented from carrying out under existing deals. In his submission to the STRB, Mr Gove said that current provisions are ‘overly prescriptive’. He pointed to evidence from the United States, that ‘extended school hours that provide opportunities for additional high-quality activities can have real benefits for children’s education’. He said: ‘Children in the Far East are also often learning for many more hours than their peers in England, giving them a critical edge when they leave school. ‘We want schools in this country to learn from these examples, and some of them already do. ‘The David Young Community Academy in Leeds operates a seven-term year starting in June, with a maximum of six weeks at school followed by a maximum of four weeks’ holiday. ‘All ARK schools operate a longer school day: at secondary level, ARK schools are open from 8.30am-4.30pm Monday to Thursday and 8.30am-3pm on Fridays, providing 31 hours teaching per week.’ Mr Gove praised the Free School Norwich, pictured, which is open 51 weeks a year . Mr Gove also praised the Free School Norwich which is open 51 weeks a year and is ‘proving very popular with parents struggling with childcare costs’. It provides an extended school service from 8.15am to 5.45pm during term time and throughout holidays, with one week off at Christmas. Mr Gove said there was a ‘strong case for a reform of the current working time provisions’. He insisted this was ‘not about making teachers work longer hours without some form of compensation’, pointing to ARK Schools’ contracts that enable them to operate between 8am and 5pm. ‘Teachers are expected to be available in the school and to cover most of their work within this longer school day, but no teacher would teach continuously throughout the day,’ Mr Gove said. General Secretary of the NUT, Christine Blower, said the move would be a mistake on teachers' conditions of service . ‘The expectation is that in most cases the teaching load would be no greater than at other schools.’ However, the proposed overhaul will be fiercely opposed by teaching unions, which are already threatening further strike action in the New Year. The National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT launched a rolling programme of industrial action across the country earlier this year over pensions, workload and the introduction of performance-related pay. Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said yesterday: ‘We have a ballot, which means we can take strike action before the middle of February. ‘From the government’s moves on pay, we know that ministers are enthusiastic about deregulation. ‘I think it is a mistake on pay and it would be even more of a mistake on teachers’ conditions of service.’ In a recent interview, Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, said the six-week school holiday was ‘too long’. The STRB is due to report back by January 14, after which the government will decide whether to accept its recommendations. A DfE spokesman said: ‘We are giving all schools the freedom to set the length of the school day and term to meet the needs of their parents and pupils. ‘Many free schools and academies are already using these freedoms, for example the David Young Community Academy which runs a seven term year and Ark Schools which have lengthened the day in all their primary and secondary schools. ‘We have also cut red tape to make it easier for schools to open longer and offer on-site childcare and in April we asked the STRB to look at whether heads should have more flexibility over staff conditions, so it is easier to extend the school day, without it being centrally prescribed from Whitehall.’","Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to give schools the freedom to set workday and term lengths .

A gang of people-smugglers charging illegal migrants up to £4,000 for 'guaranteed arrival' in the UK has been arrested, it has emerged. The organised network, which operates from ferry points in Calais, Dunkirk and Belgium, charges between £800 and £1,000 to sneak people into lorry trailers. For a premium rate, at around four times more, immigrants can travel in specially-built compartments in commercial trucks. The gang managed to sneak people past border controls in specially-built compartments in trucks and vans . French police today arrested eight suspects connected to the unit, the ninth people-smuggling network to be disbanded this year. During a raid on a flat in Calais, police found the gang of eight, 21,000 euros, £5,000, a machete and a shotgun. Under questioning, the suspects, aged between 18 and 37, refused to admit responsibility, blaming each other, police revealed. If found guilty of possessing firearms and aiding illegal immigrants, they face ten years in jail and fines of up to £650,000. For £800-£1,000, immigrants could chance their luck hiding in the back of a lorry (file picture) Most of them had Italian passports and were living in France legally. Earlier this week, 10 desperate migrants who were trying to get into Britain illegally were rescued from the back of a refrigerated lorry in northern France. The six women and four men, who claimed to be from war-torn Eritrea, locked themselves into the truck, where temperatures dropped to –4C. They were only found because one managed to get a call out to police on his mobile phone and mumble: ‘Help!’ French police managed to track them using a GPS tracking system in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Scathing: Calais deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet blasted the UK for being a 'magnet' for illegal immigrants . Six Eritreans were rescued from a similar refrigerated truck last August, and in June 2000, the bodies of 58 illegal immigrants were found in the back of lorry in Dover. The latest bout of arrests comes just days after French officials blasted Britain for fuelling people-smuggling, estimating 15,000 people - up to 40 a day - sneak into the UK undetected. In a blistering attack on the UK, Philippe Mignonet, deputy mayor of Calais, said the country remains ‘a magnet for illegal immigrants’ and does very little to stop them. He added hundreds of foreigners were sleeping rough in Calais before stowing away aboard lorries and ferries. ‘According to our estimations, depending on the night, between 10, 20, even 40 are getting through,’ said Mr Mignonet.","People paid £800-£1,000 to sneak from Calais, Dunkirk or Belgium in the back of a lorry, and £4,000 to travel in specially-built compartment .

Casey Kasem's wife and one of his daughters have reached a settlement that ends a bid to place the ailing radio personality in a conservatorship. Details of the agreement between Kasem's wife, Jean, and his daughter Julie Kasem were not divulged in a Los Angeles court where the settlement was announced today. Julie Kasem had been seeking a conservatorship and has said she and her siblings have been blocked from seeing their father, who is suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease. Breakthrough: Casey Kasem's (second from right) wife and his daughter Julie Kasem (right) have reached a settlement. Kasem is also pictured with his son Mike Casem and . daughter Kerri Kasem (second from left) Her attorney Andrew Katzenstein says the terms of the settlement are confidential. Another of Kasem's daughters, Kerri, has not reached an agreement. Her attorney Troy Martin says she may have to file a petition to see her 81-year-old father without certain restrictions. Martin says Casey Kasem is currently hospitalized but wouldn't provide more details. A Los Angeles judge last month has rejected a bid by Casey Kasem's daughter to establish a conservatorship. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lesley Green however urged lawyers to reach an agreement that would allow three of Kasem's adult children to visit their father. Jean Kasem has hit back at her husband's children from his first marriage and claims she and Casey, pictured here in 2007, have been helping to fund their lifestyles for many years . Jean Kasem's representative announced on October 19 that Casey will die in the next few months . The . 81-year-old gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American . Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, and was also the voice of Shaggy in the . cartoon Scooby Doo. His . children Kerri, Julie and Mike Kasem staged a very public protest . outside their father’s home in October to publicize their concerns for . his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of . blocking them from seeing their father. Julie . Kasem then filed a petition for a temporary conservatorship, to have . someone placed in charge of the legendary radio host's affairs who would . give regular updates to a judge. She and her siblings said the legal action wasn't about money – as they've already been cut out of his will - and is purely about concern for his well-being. But that story was contradicted by legal documents filed by their stepmom who insists she is taking great care of her ailing husband and continues to give him manicures and pedicures, reports TMZ. The legal documents also reveal that she and Casey have loaned his children approximately $100,000-$150,000 per year for many years to pay for their school, housing, cars, parking tickets, travel, etc. She also cited an example of a $50,000 loan that she claims was given to Julie back in 2000 and which has never been repaid. Lawyers for Jean Kasem also argued that if there is a need for a conservator, it should be his wife. In October, court-appointed Attorney Samuel Ingham told Judge Roy Paul that he had visited Kasem and did not see an immediate need for a conservatorship, although he did admit that he still lacked information about Kasem's doctors and treatments. Kasem, who lives with his wife of 33 years, Jean, and their adult daughter, was checked out by police detectives and social services workers, said Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Mrs Kasem. Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo' Casey Kasem and wife Jean have been married for 33 years . Grossman urged Paul to reject Julie Kasem's petition, saying the effort was detrimental to his client and the radio host. A . 2007 document that appointed Julie Kasem as an overseer of her father's . medical care had been superseded by 2011 estate planning documents, . said Grossman, who filed the records in court in October. Grossman called the new documents . ‘bulletproof’ and in a court filing wrote that the radio host's . intention was to receive medical care in his home. In a sworn declaration, Jean Kasem wrote that the actions of her step-children, including press conferences, accusations she is holding her husband hostage, and the filing of the conservatorship case, have been a ‘living nightmare.’ She wrote that her husband was bedridden and receives around-the-clock care from medical professionals. ‘It is my sincere hope that Casey's physical surroundings coupled with the attentiveness of the medical providers and the love of his own home and wife and child are comforting to him,’ Jean Kasem wrote. Paul refused to dismiss the case, noting that Ingham had requested additional information about medical care. The judge noted, however, that it did not appear that any court intervention was necessary to ensure Kasem was receiving proper care. In October Kasem's children and other friends staged a very public protest outside his home to publicize their concerns for his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of blocking them from seeing him .","The ailing radio star's wife Jean Kasem, 59, and his daughter Julie Kasem reached the agreement today .

A dinner of roadkill, a full Christmas spread salvaged from dustbins, and a side order of sprouts that are a year old - some people will go to no limits to cut Christmas costs, it seems. Hampshire student Libby Russell rooted around supermarket skips and rubbish dumps to find all the components of a heaving Christmas spread - from duck and roast potatoes, carrots and parsnips, to the cheese course and mulled wine and beer. If you think that's extreme, try Jonathan McGowan, the 46-year-old from Bournemouth, Dorset, who has dined exclusively on roadkill for the past 30 years, and has a trio of fox, pheasant and venison planned for his table on Christmas day. Scroll down for video . From this... Libby Russell sees potential in a dumpster full of rejected food . To this: Miss Russell, with housemates Louiza Hamidi and Sam Coggins, shows off her dumpster haul, which has gone towards a festive spread and presents for friends and family . Even those who profess to love the much-maligned Brussels sprout might find they balk at Roz Morrison's way of serving them - last year's dish of sprouts, apparently perfectly preserved in their dish. And for a different type of 'foraged food' - and those who can't face the faff of cooking at Christmas - a takeaway service is offering a range of festive dinners, including a mince pie pizza, 'Christmas' sushi and a kebab served with lashings of bread sauce. Art student Libby Russell has been living as a 'freegan' for a year - someone who gets all their food and household items from dustbins. Miss Russell said: 'Last Christmas, I wasn't ""bin-diving"" and I must have paid over Â£100 on presents and other . things. 'This year, I've only spent Â£20 altogether because I've been able . to get so much from bins. 'I . don't spend a penny on food either. My whole Christmas dinner has come . from a skip. Even the microwave we use was discovered in a bin.' Reject roast: Mini quiches, pork pies, fruit salad and cheese were just some of the things that went into Miss Russell's freegan meal - along with beer that was literally bin-end . Dumpster dive: Miss Russell and her friends scavenge in a skip for more Christmas goodies . Waste: Brits throw away 249, 650 tonnes over the Christmas season . Miss Russell has already served up a freegan feast for her housemates Sam Coggins, 25, and Louiza Hamidi, 23. Along . with her duck dinner plus trimmings, she was able to give offer them . mince pies, mini quiches, trifle, pork pies and fruit salad. The . house was decorated with a rubbish bin Christmas tree, lights and . baubles - all of them sourced from high street and charity shop skips, . as were her Christmas presents, which she wrapped in dustbin wrapping . paper. Every year, British people throw out 249,650 tonnes of waste over Christmas. Miss Russell said, 'I go binning for the obvious . reason of not paying for stuff but mostly, I just hate seeing food and . other things wasted. 'The waste during the holidays is terrible. It's senseless throwing Christmas cards and food away before the day even arrives.' Tuck in: Libby is proud of her freegan lifestyle, which she says she has followed for about a year . Share and enjoy: The art student managed to dig out so many Christmas goodies that she was able to set up a Facebook website to donate them to friends . Jonathan McGowan shares Miss Russell's horror at Christmas waste, and it's what he says led him to his penchant for roadkill. The taxidermist and wildlife consultant says that packing his car boot full of squashed animals he finds on country lanes has saved him thousands of pounds, and that his Christmas dinner will cost around 50p a portion. He said: 'The meat is rarely dry and there's no wastage - I eat what I can.' Street food: Jonathan McGowan picks up, skins, prepares... and eats his own roadkill . Hunter's appetite: Mr McGowan takes a bite from the freshly-run-over meat (with veg on the side) Write caption here . He described fox as tasting 'a bit . porky', the un-hung venison as 'fresh' and the pheasant as 'very fresh . too, which tastes a bit like turkey anyway. His unusual meat dish will be served along with vegetables including mushrooms he picked himself. Mr McGowan's freezer is jam packed with a variety of critters yet to be skinned and filleted. He said: 'I think more people should eat roadkill - obviously it's not something that's sustainable for everyone to do and I know most people might not want to do it. 'But I would seriously encourage more people to pick up dead animals off the road rather than see them wasted, or at least throw them off the road so other animals or people can pick them up.' And if all that meat is a little too much, never fear - there's a leftover veg option too, courtesy of Roz Morrison from Torrance near Glasgow. Preserved: Roz Morrison offers up a dish of last-year's sprouts . Ms Torrance found a dish of last year's Brussels sprouts as she prepared for Christmas and discovered they were perfectly preserved - though only after some struggle to pen the lid, which had been sealed shut by the gases emitted by the vegetables inside. It turned out that her father had washed up on Christmas Day and assumed he had already cleaned the dish, so put it back in the cupboard - complete with its contents. Jeweller Ms Torrance said she and her father thought they still looked good enough to eat - but didn't test them just to be on the safe side. But if the thought of sourcing your own food from the side of the road, a bin or the back of a cupboard is just too much, one takeaway service is offering festive versions of classic fast food to order on 25 December.

"PUBLISHED: . 11:28 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:57 EST, 29 May 2013 . A heavily pregnant nurse lost her baby when she went to hospital with an agonising infection – but was sent home with painkillers. Lekha James says she knew she had a urinary tract infection but a doctor and midwives refused to listen. Instead of giving her antibiotics that could have dealt with the problem, they prescribed the painkiller cocodamol. Three days later the 34-year-old nurse was rushed back with life-threatening septicaemia and medical staff could not  find a heartbeat for her baby son.He was stillborn after labour was induced. 'Incredibly stressful and sad': Nurse Lekha James, 34, pictured with her husband Santhosh Mathew, 39, says she knew she had a urinary tract infection but claims staff at St Mary's Hospital 'wouldn't listen' Last night Mrs James and her husband Santhosh Mathew condemned St Mary’s Hospital, Manchester, which has admitted negligence in failing to diagnose and treat the infection that led to the death of baby Aidan. An investigation has also exposed a  ‘staff attitude problem’ and inadequate clinical assessment. Mrs James, who lives with her husband in Manchester with their daughter Tia, six, and new baby son Aiden, said she ‘instinctively’ knew something was wrong when she went to hospital with pain in her stomach, abdomen and hips. ‘I thought that I had a urinary tract infection but no one was listening to me,’ she said. ‘I did not want to leave the hospital but I felt I was not being given a choice. ‘When I returned to the hospital a second time, I was seriously ill and I now know that I almost died because the infection had become so severe. ‘We then discovered that our baby’s heart had stopped beating as a consequence of the infection.’ Compensation: The couple, from Gorton, are pursuing a compensation claim against Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs St Mary's . Mrs James, a cardiac nurse at the Manchester Royal Infirmary – adjacent to St Mary’s – added: ‘As a nurse myself, I would never ignore what a patient tells me. ‘I knew I had a urinary tract infection but they weren’t listening, talking over us as if we were illiterate people. ‘I wasn’t happy to be sent home and the pain was so bad I needed a wheelchair. It was only when I was semi-conscious in labour I realised what had happened – it has been incredibly stressful and sad. ‘We had been trying for a baby for some time when I became pregnant, and our precious baby son was much longed for. ‘We now have another son, who we have called Aiden, but nothing can replace our baby who died.’ Mrs James, who is also a qualified midwife, hopes others will be prevented from going through the same trouble they experienced in March last year. ‘We will never fully get over our loss, but we are desperate to try to ensure that lessons are learned from our case so that hopefully we can prevent other parents from going through the same ordeal,’ she said. Her husband, a catering supervisor who also works at the Royal Infirmary, added: ‘I don’t know how I managed to control myself when the doctor told me our baby had died. ‘We cannot describe the pain we have been through, we just want to make sure this never happens to anyone else.’ The couple are now pursuing a claim for compensation against the NHS foundation trust that runs St Mary’s and have also submitted a formal complaint to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Their solicitor Beth Reay, who is pursuing the legal claim for the couple, said health staff had made ‘catastrophic failures’ that led to the baby’s death. The care team, including an agency doctor, failed to spot that the infection posed a significant risk to the unborn child, which was almost full-term, she said. ‘There appeared to be a culture amongst staff that allowed them to ignore some quite basic clinical factors which has led to the death of their son,’ she added. ‘A urinary tract infection is not uncommon for women to get, especially in the later stages of  pregnancy. Warning signs were there but further tests on Lekha were not carried out before she was discharged.’ The solicitor said the trust had accepted that a course of antibiotics would have avoided the death of the baby and had written a letter of apology. ‘While I am pleased to secure this admission of negligence, Mr and Mrs James need assurances that every possible step will be taken to ensure no other parents have to live through the same distressing ordeal,’ she added. Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has launched an internal investigation into the complaint surrounding the treatment at St Mary’s and has published a 17-page report. However, Mrs James and her husband claim they were not told about its release. The report states there were ‘staff attitude problems’ as well as  ‘inadequate clinical assessment by the doctor, highlighting learning needs’. ‘Staff need to be aware of how their behaviour is perceived by patients,’ it adds. ‘Lack of thought was given to the quality of care and patient experience.’ A trust spokesman said:  ‘Unfortunately as this is an ongoing legal case we are unable to confirm any details.’","Lekha James, 34, claims she knew she had a urinary tract infection .

Australia have pledged to attack Monty Panesar after batsman Steve Smith insisted their decision to attack Graeme Swann had contributed to the England spinner’s mid-series retirement. Panesar is poised to take Swann’s place in the fourth Ashes Test, starting at Melbourne on Boxing Day, and Smith said he could expect more of the same after Swann was carted for almost four runs an over in the first three Tests. ‘The best way we play spin as a batting unit is playing quite positively, so I’m sure when Monty comes on to bowl we’re going to look to keep scoring runs and put the pressure back on him,’ said Smith. On stand by: Monty Panesar is likely to replaced retired spinner Graeme Swann in England's bowling attack in the fourth Test against Australia at the MCG in Melbourne . On the attack: Steve Smith says Australia's batsmen will go after Panesar . Asked whether he felt Australia’s . policy of getting after Swann had played a part in his decision to quit . the international game, Smith said: ‘We’ve played him very well this . series, that’s for sure. If we could attack him, that was our mindset . from the start, and make their quicks come back sooner than they’d have . liked to. Yeah, we’ve probably played a big part. ‘Hopefully we can have another big week here and then in Sydney and clean-sweep these guys.’ Panesar, . whose own Test career was in jeopardy during the  summer, found himself . having to defend Swann at the MCG after the retired spinner’s . ambiguous  parting shot led to a storm which clouded his retirement. Swann . said in an unprompted aside during a press conference solely for . English newspaper cricket writers that some players he is  leaving . behind ‘love themselves too much’ and ‘are up their own backsides’. Controversial exit: Graeme Swann delivered what some considered to be a parting shot at his team-mates as he announced his immediate retirement on Sunday . It . was delivered with his trademark cheeky grin, he would not name any . names and, as one of the seven journalists present, I can confirm that . it was impossible to know for sure whether he was talking about his own . team-mates. We know that . Swann has never been close to Kevin Pietersen and that the two were on . different sides during the text scandal that almost caused Pietersen’s . demise as an England player last year. Yet on this tour they are said to have been  getting along fine. And . we also know that England have been angry at some of the more extreme . sledging from  Australia during this series, in  particular from David . Warner, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson. Swann later used Twitter to deny . he was talking about England. It . was into this storm that  Panesar emerged, with the air of a man who . was not quite sure what was going on. So Monty, do you all take playing . for England for granted? ‘Absolutely not,’ he said. ‘We have a hungry . and very determined dressing room that wants to do really well in these . last two Tests. Playing for England is the pinnacle for every sportsman. In no way do we take it for granted.’ Determined: Panesar has had to overcome his own troubles to re-emerge as an England Test player . But . what about what Swann said? ‘It’s the first I’ve heard about it. Swanny . knows who he’s referring to but in terms of the dressing room and his . team-mates we are right behind him. We loved him to bits when he played . with us and we all back him as a team. He’s an iconic cricketer, a . match-winner and one of the best spin bowlers in the  modern game.’ How . about the timing of his retirement mid-series? ‘It’s his decision. He . knew when he wanted to go and when was the right time. When you lose . your own hunger for bowling or your passion you know your time is up. We . are all right behind his  decision. He’s done wonderful things for . England. If I can achieve half of what he’s done I’ll be ecstatic.’ What . of Michael Vaughan, an Ashes- winning England captain, saying this tour . has become a joke? ‘I don’t think that,’ said Panesar. ‘We’ve still got . two Tests to show our hunger and determination.’ But could Swann’s . comments  tarnish his legacy? ‘He’s done  unbelievable things in the . last few years for England and he’ll be remembered as one of the . greats.’ Aussies rule: Peter Siddle, flanked by Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson, warm up for the fourth Test in Melbourne knowing that they have already won the five-match series . It must have come . as a relief to Panesar when he was asked about his own cricket. He has, . of course, been England’s top spinner before and, at 31, has the time to . be so again — particularly as the cupboard is not exactly bursting with . young spin-bowling prospects. ‘This . is a really good opportunity,’ said Panesar. ‘I’ve been there in the . past where I’ve looked too far ahead and suddenly you’re not focused. I . don’t see myself as the No 1  spinner. I just want to get my  bowling in . good rhythm — better than at Adelaide.’ Panesar . said he thought his  England days were numbered when he was cautioned . by police over a nightclub incident that led to  accusations he had . urinated over bouncers. ‘I thought my chance had gone,’ he said. ‘I’m . lucky to be out here. I want to grab this chance. Last summer’s problems . are behind me. It’s time to move on and play with a smile on my face.’ Just as Swann used to.

Sean Penn is now believed to have played a leading role in the mysterious escape of a New York businessman from Bolivian house arrest. The current location of Jacob Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn who went to Bolivia to salvage a rice-growing business, is being kept a closely-guarded secret. But he is with the Oscar-winning actor, who says he is receiving medical attention. The Bolivian government now regards Jacob Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn who went to Bolivia to salvage a rice growing business, as a fugitive. The Oscar-winning actor has been involved in Mr Ostreicher's plight ever since he was arrested in 2011 as part of a money laundering probe and even met with the President of Bolivia last year in an effort to get Mr Ostreicher moved from prison to house arrest. Star power: Sean Penn made a personal plea to the President of Bolivia to have Jacob Ostreicher (right) moved from a violent prison to house arrest, given his innocence and increasingly frequent Parkinson's tremors . On Monday, Penn confirmed that Mr Ostreicher was freed as a result of a 'humanitarian operation' to free him 'from the corrupt prosecution and imprisonment he was suffering in Bolivia'. In the email to the AP, Penn said only that Ostreicher was safe, doing well and receiving medical attention in the actor's company at an undisclosed location. With U.S.-Bolivia relations strained since Morales expelled the American ambassador in 2008, Penn was one of the few people Ostreicher could turn to. The actor was a frequent guest of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and a sharp critic of U.S. foreign policy - two qualities that endear him to Morales and other leftist leaders in Latin America. After Penn intervened, Morales ordered a high-powered investigation that exposed an extortion ring that preyed on people accused of drug-related crimes. It led to the arrests of 15 people, including several prosecutors and the top legal adviser at the Interior Ministry, who had repeatedly flown from the capital to the eastern city of Santa Cruz for court hearings to ensure Ostreicher was not freed from prison. Center of a scandal: Now Ostreicher has escaped from Bolivia and Penn confirmed that he was with him- without revealing his location- and that the Brooklyn-native was receiving medical treatment . Ostreicher was housed at a prison, Palmasola, whose interior was controlled by violent inmates. In August, 31 prisoners died in a battle between rival factions. Adding to his troubles were the increasing tremors he was dealing with as his Parkinson’s disease worsened with poor treatment. He had been freed from jail in December 2012 at a hearing attended by Penn but barred from leaving Bolivia. A frustrated Penn vowed he wouldn't abandon him. ‘If it weren't for Sean Penn I would be another statistic in Bolivia and I would die in prison,’ Ostreicher told the AP a year ago. Previous efforts on his behalf by U.S. diplomats and lawmakers had proved fruitless. Ostreicher was released from prison a year ago . and put under house arrest after actor Sean Penn (left), along with . several U.S. lawmakers, appealed to President Evo Morales (right) to . free him . The New York Times reports that once he was moved to house arrest, it was one of the most loosely-guarded situations imaginable, with no guards watching him. Officially, he only had to be in the home between the hours of 9pm and  6am, and was told to check in with authorities every 15 days. Now that word of his escape is causing political optics issues, Bolivian officials are floating the theory that he could have been kidnapped or even travelled to Peru on his own during the day when he was not confined to the house in Santa Cruz. Mr Ostreicher's relatives are understandably keeping his whereabouts under wraps, though one of the Brooklyn native's children confirmed that they had heard he had arrived in America but had yet to speak to him directly. ‘You'll never find out,’ Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said Tuesday. If the U.S. was involved, ‘it was done through layers and layers of cover,’ he said. Mr Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew who has a flooring business in Brooklyn, complained from the time he was jailed in June 2011 that he was being fleeced by corrupt officials. Transition: Ostreicher leaves a court in a helmet and bulletproof vest after being released from a violent prison in favor of house arrest in Santa Cruz, on December 18, 2012 . His case came to notice when he accused the struggling rice venture's original manager, a Colombian woman who also was jailed, of defrauding investors and falling in with a Brazilian drug trafficker. Ostreicher charged later that prosecutors and other government employees had illegally sold 18,000 metric tons of the venture's rice and stole equipment as well as demanded a $50,000 payoff to get him out of jail. 'They robbed me of close to $50 million worth of assets,' Ostreicher told the AP in an interview a year ago. He said that in addition to the rice, about 900 cattle disappeared along with 37 tractors and harvesting equipment. Bolivian authorities have said since that 15 people had been arrested in the alleged extortion ring, including an assistant to the judicial director of the Interior Ministry. Last June, prosecutors said two low-ranking officials among those arrested had pleaded guilty and were cooperating in hopes of serving less jail time. The case has resulted in Bolivian authorities implicating a judge, the initial prosecutors and lower-level officials in an alleged scheme to shake down Ostreicher and other people deemed to have deep pockets.","State Department official confirms Jacob Ostreicher has left Bolivia .

Researchers believe they have taught a border collie to respond to words in the same way that a human child does . Border collies are known for their high level of intelligence. But Chaser has proved herself as the undoubted top dog after learning to understand 1,000 words - plus a smattering of English grammar. Researchers believe the nine-year-old has learned to respond to words in the same way that a human child does. They say Chaser was able to demonstrate understanding of nouns and verbs. One of the team said: 'Our findings showed that Chaser was successful in demonstrating syntax and semantic understanding on 75 per cent of the trials.' The study, involving more than seven years of teaching and research on the border collie, was published in the journal Learning and Motivation. The dog, born in 2004, lived in the home of the researchers, primarily as a member of the family, but also as a subject for research. In the first three years, she learned and remembered 1,022 proper nouns. The objects included more than 800 cloth animals, 116 balls, and 100 plastic toys. There were no duplicates, and each had unique features so it could be identified. Each was also given a distinctive name, like 'elephant' or 'Santa Claus'. The dog built up and maintained knowledge of the nouns over a 32-month period. Each month, she was tested on the entire vocabulary, and each time she was able to identify correctly more than 95 per cent of the objects. The researchers say Chaser's ability to learn and remember so many words, involving discrimination, memory, and other skills, revealed clear evidence of the potential for learning to understand human language. The researchers then tried to teach Chaser some grammar and investigated her ability to understand the syntax and semantics of sentences consisting of three elements of grammar - a prepositional object, a verb, and a direct object - such as 'To ball take Frisbee', and the opposite, 'To Frisbee take ball'. Not only did it require the dog to recognise the 100 toys chosen for the experiment, but she also had to take the right ones to the correct destination. Researchers from Wofford College in North Carolina, in the US, concluded that Chaser was successful in demonstrating syntax and semantic understanding on 18 of the 24 trials, or 75 per cent of the time . Findings showed that Chaser was successful in demonstrating syntax and semantic understanding on 18 of the 24 trials, or 75 per cent of the time. She could also respond to novel objects. Researchers from Wofford College in North Carolina, in the US, concluded: 'After learning the name of the objects, she was able, as are children, to understand the meaning of the sentences even though the objects had never been used in the syntax sentence. 'The combined findings of the three studies support the conclusion that Chaser did, indeed, process and retain memories of prepositional and direct objects. 'The findings closely match the data obtained in dolphin studies involving sentences consisting of three elements of grammar.' They said that the experiments revealed that the dog's understanding of words was not simply confined to memorising strings of words by rote. 'Rather, in some way, her brain is partially constructed like that of humans,' the researchers said.","Chaser the dog now able to understand nouns and verbs, researchers say .

Two women who slashed a man's throat and stabbed him to death before claiming they had been raped have been found guilty of murder. Alicia Davis and Charlotte Coulson were travelling in the car of Michael Kerr when they stabbed him in the neck and chest repeatedly before leaving him to die in Satmar Lane, Caple-le-Ferne near Folkestone. Davis was jailed for a minimum of 25 years and Coulson for a minimum of 20 years today by a judge who said they had taken 'perverse pleasure' in killing the 30-year-old. Charlotte Coulson (left) and Alicia Davis (right) were jailed for the murder of Michael Kerr who they stabbed repeatedly then claimed had raped them . The Old Bailey heard how the women threw the victim's mobile phone away and burned their clothing after returning to the home of Coulson, 22, in an attempt to destroy evidence. But police found Mr Kerr had been in extensive phone and text message contact with the pair in the hours leading up to his death. Coulson had contacted Mr Kerr on April 9 claiming Davis was prepared to have sex with him for cash as the pair tried to make money to buy alcohol, according to the police spokesman. Mr Kerr picked Davis up in his yellow Renault Clio at 8pm and drove to Satmar Lane before dropping her at Coulson's home, police said. Just after midnight on April 10, Coulson and Mr Kerr had a heated conversation through text messages and decided to meet up again, the spokesman continued. Evidence gathered by officers found a text message from Coulson to Davis, sent during the journey which said: 'Start now', to which Davis replied: 'Ur gonna have to do it first'. In her last text Coulson said to Davis: 'Shut up n hurry up let’s party.’ Mr Kerr was left lying dead next to his car as the two women walked home. Michael Kerr was stabbed repeatedly in the neck and chest by the women who were travelling in his car . Coulson is pictured after the attack on CCTV buying alcohol . Davis messaged Coulson after the murder saying: ‘I feel so sick, I love you.’ The women then attacked Mr Kerr inside his car with at least one knife before walking back to Dover and leaving him to die in the country lane, the court heard. A post-mortem examination found he died from multiple stab wounds to his neck and chest, and had also sustained injuries consistent with self-defence. Coulson then sent Mr Kerr several text messages asking why he had not been in contact despite having killed him, the spokesman said. The two women were arrested after confiding in other friends. Coulson claimed she was asleep in the back of the car when she had awoken to find him attacking Davis, while Davis told detectives he had attacked her and she stabbed him in self-defence. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'This was a violent and vicious attack in which Michael didn't stand a chance. Davis (left) and Coulson (right) told police the man had sexually attacked them and that they were acting in self defence . The man's body was found near his car on the country lane where Davis and Coulson also discarded the murder weapon and the victim's mobile phone . 'He was used to giving his friends a lift to places - he was a nice person and loved driving his car. 'But what he didn't know that night was Coulson and Davis were luring him to his death. 'Text messages show they were planning their sustained attack right up until they arrived in Satmar Lane.' A family statement said: 'Michael was the innocent victim of a ruthless and brutal, unprovoked attack which has resulted in him being taken from his family and friends. 'The pain we have experienced and are still suffering from cannot be expressed in words. Michael was a loving and caring son, brother and grandson who we miss terribly every day. 'Today's verdict, whilst not bringing him back has provided us with some comfort knowing that those responsible for his death will serve a number of years in prison, however no sentence can ever come close to the pain that Michael has endured.'","Alicia Davis and Charlotte Coulson repeatedly stabbed man in neck .

Guilty: Millionaire playboy Jason Moore is facing jail after he was convicted of murdering Robert Darby in a row over a woman . A professional gambler who stabbed his jealous 'stalker' through the heart in a dispute over a woman before fleeing the country has been convicted of murder. Millionaire playboy Jason Moore, 43, attacked Robert Darby outside a pub in 2005 and then went on the run until last year when he gave himself in to police. In a prepared statement given to officers Moore described 42-year-old Mr Darby as a ‘telephone terrorist’ and a Jekyll-and-Hyde character. Moore, who was living in a £1.4m apartment in Canary Wharf at the time of the killing, claimed the victim had threatened to chop his toes off. He said he recruited friend Martin Power, 47, to help resolve the dispute over Mr Darby’s ex-girlfriend Adele Raynor and did not plan to use any violence. However, Moore was unanimously convicted of murdering Mr Darby outside the Valentine pub in Gants Hill, east London, in August 2005. He was led screaming to the cells, violently kicking the dock and threatening a police officer. Moore’s family shouted insults at the same officer, ignoring warning from the Common Serjeant of London, Judge Nicholas Hilliard, to remain silent. Power was acquitted of murder by the jury. Mr Darby was described as an ‘intimidating individual’ who was obsessively stalking Moore and Ms Raynor. Ms Raynor, 35, who had had an on-off relationship with Mr Darby had earlier told the Old Bailey he had a ‘very explosive’ temper and his use of cocaine made him ‘erratic’. The pair met in the 1990s  when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s and had an on-and-off relationship that lasted until 2004. ‘There were quite a lot of arguments, his temper was very explosive,' said Ms Rayner. ‘He was just all over the place, very kind of not stable sometimes. Focus: Adele Raynor had an on-off relationship with Mr Darby, before she started seeing Moore . ‘He was just always on the go, very much up and down.’ Ms Rayner said she ended things between them because he was controlling and domineering. ‘All the time he had mood swings, one minute he was laughing and joking and the next minute he was punching someone’s lights out,’ she said. ‘He never actually hit me but there was some violent incidents. ‘I had had enough, he didn’t take it very well. Victim: Robert Darby, 42, was stabbed in the chest with such force that the knifed passed straight through a rib and into his heart . ‘He was quite controlling and if he wasn’t in control there was a problem and he started to lose control of the situation because I didn’t want to be with him any more.’ She said she met Moore the following year and starting seeing him while Mr Darby was travelling in Australia. She had called police after Mr Darby threatened her on the morning of August 24, 2005, just hours before the fatal confrontation outside the Valentine pub in Gants Hill. Mr Darby, from Poplar, London, was stabbed in the chest with such force that the knifed passed straight through a rib and into his heart. He collapsed within a few minutes and died in hospital the following day from the injury. Moore said the dispute started after he began a short relationship with Adele, who he met in Bar 38 underneath his apartment. ‘He phoned me and for the first time threatened me. he was saying things like ‘I have got no family I can do what I like. I’m going to chop your toes off and if you go anywhere near Adele again I am going to kill you,’ he said. ‘His behaviour was irrational. He was a nuisance but at the same time I took seriously the threats he was making. I chose to ignore him as best as I could.’ Moore added: ‘In my view Robert Darby was a complete Jekyll and Hyde character. You couldn’t predict how he was going to behave.’ Power told the court he had been knocked senseless after the victim ‘clumped’ him over the head with a Stanley knife. Scene: Moore was convicted of murdering Mr Darby outside the Valentine pub in Gants Hill, east London, in August 2005 . ‘I didn’t see any knife, he was screaming at me and I said ‘just calm yourself down,’ he said. ‘As I was going towards him the next thing I knew I got a clump on the head which I now know was with a Stanley knife. ‘I was knocked senseless, I had a golf ball on my head and a big graze.’ Power was arrested in Malaga, Spain, in April and extradited to stand trial in the UK while Moore turned himself in late last year. Moore, of no fixed address will be sentenced on Monday 23 December.","Jason Moore, 43, attacked Robert Darby, 42, outside an east London pub .

The Post Office made regular deliveries of herrings from the Norfolk seaside town, with a huge surge in orders during the 'harvest of herrings' from October to December. It required the postal service to deploy special collection vans to pick up the vast number of boxes of fish being send as gifts across the country.

During the height of the fish harvest, the Royal Mail would see a fourfold increase in telegrams and mail sent and received by the temporary workers harvesting the fish increased the workload for postal workers. Similarly the flower industry had a profound impact on the postal service, reaching a peak in early Spring, notably on the Isles of Sciliy. A postman is seen delivering to hop-pickers in Kent .

When animal welfare workers found two Pit Bull pups roaming the streets of Philadelphia two months ago, they quickly realized there was no splitting them up. Jermaine acts as a guide dog for his blind brother Jeffrey, gently nudging him in the right direction. Now the eight-month-old orphans have a new home with a Springfield, Pennsylvania couple who say they're overwhelmed by the brothers' love. Scroll down for video . Love is blind: Jermaine and Jeffrey are now living with their new owner Victoria McKee . Love is blind: This adorable picture of Jeffrey and Jermaine entwined on a bolster dog bed at the animal shelter went viral . The dogs became social media darlings last month when an adorable photo of them entwined while sleeping at a rescue shelter was shared around the world. 'When they walk, even on separate leashes, they are always bumping into each other to check that the other one is there,' new owner Victoria McKee told Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 'If Jermaine is off leash, he will run around and come back to check in with Jeffrey to make sure he's OK. If they're both off leash, they stay very close and Jermaine kind of herds Jeffrey around. 'It's remarkable how deep their bond really is.' McKee and her husband Jonathan Hochman were selected to adopt the brothers from a pool of hopeful applicants, taking them home on November 25. Although the gorgeous canines have recovered from the malnourishment, scrapes and upper respiratory ailments they gained while living on the streets, McKee said caring for a handicapped pup can be tough. Jeffrey is blind in his left eye and sees only shadows with his right. But McKee said the pups are easy to get along with and love spending time with the family cat, Blabbus. Back in the game: The gorgeous Pit Bulls were malnourished, injured and suffering from respiratory ailments when they were found, but have now recovered . Inseparable: When Jermaine and Jeffrey were found wandering the streets of Philadelphia, their carers knew the pups couldn't be separated . 'We didn't just have to puppy proof, we had to blind puppy proof,' McKee said. 'As we continue to introduce them to new spaces, Jermaine always falls back to the role of caregiver and seeing-eye dog.' The pups were put up for adoption by Operation Ava, a no-kill . animal shelter that seeks to find forever homes for abandoned animals. Operation Ava CEO Claudia Gutierrez said the shelter received thousands of applications after the cute picture of the dogs embracing went viral. But she said McKee and Hochman seemed like the perfect fit. 'They were looking for a pair of dogs to adopt together. They don’t have any children and decided that their pets are their children. They’re a really close couple,' she told Mainline Media News. News to me! Victoria McKee said she and her husband had no idea Jeffrey and Jermaine were famous when they initially looked at adopted them . A Facebook page set up to keep people updated on Jermaine and Jeffrey's adventures has more than 37,000 likes.

The criminals have used a human rights ruling to remove themselves from the list, arguing that they no longer pose a threat to the public. The 108 convicts who have successfully used the argument, include one offender convicted of . rape of a female under 13, another of burglary with intent to rape and . one sentenced for buggery. More than 100 of the country's most dangerous sex attackers - including paedophiles and violent rapists - have had their names secretly removed from the Sex Offenders' Register, it has been revealed (stock image) One police force removed a criminal convicted on seven counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16 from the register. The figures were obtained under the Freedom of Information act, and asked for details of the number of . convicted sex offenders who had their names removed from the register . since the law was passed in September last year. Nearly half of those who applied were successful, at rate of nearly four a week. Those whose names have been removed from the list were once placed on it for life, but now no longer now no longer need to tell the police where they are . living, or if they move near a school or young family. It comes following a human rights ruling last year, which decided offenders who have been . monitored by officers for 15 years are now free to apply to have their . details taken off the register. Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said: 'It's downright dangerous that so many sex offenders are effectively able to remove themselves from the Register. Mr Saunders, who was abused as a child abuse himself, said: 'The victims and survivors of sexual abuse suffer a life sentence at the hands of these people, coping with the miserable consequences. 'It seems inordinately unfair that so many could be removed from something which simply keeps them on the police radar. 'I can't think of anyone who would challenge that apart from the perpetrators themselves. 'Everything we know about sex offenders leads us to believe firmly that they will probably always be a threat to children and to others.' In London, the Metropolitan Police struck 19 offenders from the register, 17 of whom were convicted rapists. Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said it was 'downright dangerous' that so many sex offenders are effectively able to remove themselves from the Register . South Yorkshire Police removed 12 convicts, Greater Manchester Police deleted 10 and Cambridgeshire Constabulary took six off the register, including one who was convicted on seven  counts of indecent assault on a male under 16. In Suffolk someone convicted of incest was allowed off the register. West Yorkshire Police rejected the application saying they did not consider the 71-year-old to be safe and wanted him to remain under supervision. But District Judge Christopher Darnton overturned the ruling, saying he couldn't see any benefit in St Angell staying on the register. Judge Darnton said: 'The order has now served its purpose. I cannot see any benefit in it remaining.""Assistant Chief Constable Michelle Skeer, of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), said:'It is recognised that the legislation under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the multi-agency public protection arrangements provide some of the most effective tools in the world to manage registered sex offenders. 'Protecting the public from harm is a fundamental role for the police service but we recognise that this must be balanced with the rights of individuals, as highlighted by the Supreme Court judgement. 'We have worked closely with the Home Office and other key partners to develop a robust review process that ensures a full assessment of the risks posed before an offender is removed from the notification requirements. 'The reality is that the risks posed by some offenders can never be completely eliminated, but we will continue to do all in our power to keep them to a minimum and believe that the proposed review process strikes the right balance between individual rights and public safety.'","Criminals have used a human rights ruling to remove themselves from list .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . PUBLISHED: . 02:27 EST, 22 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:25 EST, 23 December 2013 . Engineers in Japan have invented a robot that can scale walls, inspect aging bridges, and do the crab-walk. The multifaceted magnetic bridge bots can scurry faster than you can say their name, Bridge Inspection Robot Equipping Magnets(BIREM), at a rapid pace of 7.8 inches per second. The robots were developed by engineers at the Osaka City University in Japan and the team is led by engineering professor Yogo Takada. The robots will improve the method of bridge inspection with advanced technology and create less margin for human error. This robot uses magnets to grip onto bridges and moves at super fast speed as it inspects bridges for damage . CNET reports that the robots are operated by remote control. They move on four wheels each of which have eight spokes with extremely powerful magnets that can tightly grip surfaces. Engadget reports that the robots have a flexible mid section which allows them to move over uneven structures with ease. Wall climbing robots are not a new invention, but the previous prototypes used suction cups as oppose to magnets. Not only do the robots have magnets, they have sensors and cameras that they can use to gather information about their environment. CNET reports that the robots can locate cracks on bridges and other steel structures. Takada along with his team will work more on the robot and Japanese manufacturers will probably manufacture it in three years. The trend has already caught on in the United States. Carnegie Mellon News reported that Obama launched the National Robotics Initiative this November and that he donated $7 million dollars to Carnegie Mellon researchers so that they could create robots to help humans do their jobs better. CNET reports that a similar robot to BIREM, named the Skysweeper, was created in San Diego to inspect power lines. The Skysweeper costs $1,000 and is inexpensive compared to older, larger robots and was created via 3D printing. As technology advances, helper robots, once seen as a caricature of the future, may become more and more a part of everyday life.

The 70s legends were two songs into their homecoming set at Birmingham Town Hall when a staff member told Daz Bishop, 52, to 'stop dancing like a ****'. The building firm manager was thrown out after a heated dispute and is now considering legal action against the venue. Chiefs refused Mr Bishop's requests for a refund, saying he had blocked fans' view and caused a safety risk.

'I wasn't drunk, I had two pints. 'I wasn't causing trouble, I wasn't aggressive and there were loads of people dancing and taking pictures. 'Nothing was said to them. 'I'm furious. I've told them I'll contact my MP and go legal.' Slade, most famous for their song . Merry Xmas Everybody, starred at the town hall last week alongside . spandex-clad 70s rockers Sweet.

He added: 'I asked to speak to a manager, someone told me we couldn't dance due to health and safety. 'I have never heard anything so stupid. We've been to loads of Sweet and Slade gigs and that's what you do - dance. 'You go to these gigs to have fun, enjoy yourself and dance.

French police have stepped up their search for a Chinese billionaire and two others feared dead after their helicopter crashed. Lam Kok, a 46-year-old Chinese businessman, was surveying a newly-purchased vineyard in southwest France with his interpreter and advisor Peng Wang and or winemaker James Gregoire when their aircraft crashed into the Dordogne river. Officer last night recovered the body of Lam's 12-year-old son, Shun Yu Kok, from the back of the wrecked helicopter, which was lying in 23ft of water in the Dordogne river. Rescue: French police scour the Dordogne river in search of Lam Kok and his fellow passengers . Efforts: More than 100 police are involved in the search after the helicopter crash on Friday . Desperation: A relative of Mr Kok's shouts his name from the riverbank . The four had boarded the helicopter, piloted by Mr Gregoire, on Friday to make a celebratory tour of a Bordeaux chateau and wine-growing estate that Lam had just bought from him. After pausing the search on Saturday night, divers resumed scouring the cold waters of the Dordogne around 9.00am today. 'We are meticulously combing the area, with practically no visibility, almost by hand,' local gendarmerie commander Ghislain Rety said. Police said strong currents were hampering the search. Hunt: Police sources said that the search was difficult because of very poor visibility . Helicopters with infra-red cameras . were flying over the river and a special sonar designed for finding . bodies had arrived from the French city of Strasbourg, Mr Rety said. Some 100 police were searching along the riverbanks and reinforcements were expected. Officials were expected to carry out an autopsy on Mr Kok's son today, but officials said there was little hope the reasons for the crash would be identified quickly. 'The causes of the accident have not been determined at this stage and most likely will not be for several weeks,' local prosecutor Christopher Auger said.

Mr Kok's wife pulled out at the last minute saying she was 'scared of helicopters', an AFP photographer at the scene said. Mr Gregoire had bought the land and its 8th Century chateau in 2003 after Jean Leprince, the previous owner, died when his aircraft also crashed nearby. All in the helicopter had been taking part in a celebratory press day, marking the sale of the historic estate. They were planning to take a short tour of the vineyard and the grounds of the Château de la Riviere, and when they did not return after 20 minutes, those who had stayed behind contacted emergency services. Desperate: Inflatable boats were deployed after . police received a call from a member of the public indicated the . helicopter may have fallen into a nearby river, but no trace of the . helicopter has yet been found .

In a bizarre twist of fate, a previous owner of the Château de la Riviere -- one of the region's oldest estates -- was killed in a helicopter crash in 2002.

Back pain: Rhys Owen, 21, was hired as a Christmas temp by Amazon but claimed the chronic pain started almost immediately . An Amazon worker hired for the Christmas period is suing the internet giant after 11-hour shifts in one of its warehouses left him with agonising back pain. Rhys Owen, 21, from Bedford, earned £7 an hour at the sprawling Milton Keynes base, where employees walk several miles every day, lifting products from shelves. The football fan was one of 15,000 temporary workers hired across Britain by the internet giant to deal with the Christmas rush, but claimed the shifts left him 'middle-aged' before his time. He claimed his target was to pick 1,100 items a day, about 1.8 per minute. Mr Owen, who left university after his first year and has worked for BMW, an insurance broker and an IT firm, said: ‘They gave us no health and safety training after I started work and we just had an induction by Amazon at the warehouse, where they checked my literacy and numeracy. 'Many of my co-workers did not speak English, but we were shown a video which demonstrated the picking process, how to use the scanners correctly and handle orders. It was four hours worth of training with them talking for most of it.' When he experienced stabbing pains in his back and took a few days off, he was moved onto slightly lighter duties but was told by his temp agency that his contract would be terminated if he did not return to work, he said. 'At the end of my second week I got a bad back and went up to one of the managers to tell him it was really hurting as I went to reach for things,' he said. 'Everyone is rushing round and rushing . harder just to reach their targets. There were people there with . blisters on their feet and there was a woman of 45 I was working with . and her feet were bleeding. 'As far as I could see loads of people were being pushed too hard. I've done a few jobs, but never a job like this. 'You get 15 minute breaks and the canteen is a five minute walk from the warehouse, so that's no real break at all. Pain: Mr Owen said the shifts at the warehouse in Staffordshire left him feeling middle-aged before his time . Stress: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos said: 'Our culture is friendly and intense, but if push comes to shove, we¿ll settle for intense.' Pictured: An Amazon centre in Germany, where workers have gone on strike . Targets: Amazon has hired 15,000 temp workers in Britain in the run-up to Christmas, working long shifts . Fast-paced: Amazon's 'fulfilment centres' are vast, with workers collecting a package every 33 seconds . Demand: Thousands of people have ordered from Amazon as Christmas shopping drifts from the high street . Amazon's eight giant warehouses in Britain cover five million square feet and employ more than 4,800 permanent staff. The orange-vested employees are tracked by GPS, walk up to 11 miles on a shift and must pass through airport-style security scanners to prove they are not stealing anything. Targets are set astronomically high and as chief executive Jeff Bezos has said: 'Our culture is friendly and intense, but if push comes to shove, we’ll settle for intense.' One agency worker in New Jersey died after being crushed by equipment at an Amazon sorting centre. In Germany, meanwhile, several hundred warehouse workers staged a one day strike this month in a protest over their wages. 'Virtually everyone there is a temp and they can fire people at will if they are not reaching their targets.' Mr Owen clamed he is taking three to five doses of painkillers a day, adding: 'My back is in agony in the morning when it stiffens up. I've not played football since and even find tying my laces agony, so I just slip my trainers on and leave the laces.' His solicitor Andrew Lilley, of JMW Solicitors based in Manchester, said the working conditions were ‘a great cause for concern’ and that the formerly fit 21-year-old had an injury usually seen in ‘someone approaching middle age’. 'The conditions that our client has described to us are a great cause for concern', he said. 'As well as affecting an individual's immediate well-being, if such conditions are proven to exist at Amazon's fulfilment centres, they could lead to longer term physical problems and greater injuries. 'It appears from what we have been told that the working conditions Rhys faced during his brief time at Amazon's fulfilment centre have caused him the sort of repetitive strain-related back injury we'd expect to see in someone approaching middle age, which does send the signal that something isn't right with the working environment.' A spokesman for Amazon said: 'We wouldn't wish to comment on individual members of our workforce.'","Rhys Owen, 21, from Bedford, was one of 15,000 Christmas temps this year .

Britain's borders are ‘like a sieve’, a senior judge declared yesterday as he warned Romanian criminals not to come to Britain on January 1. The Recorder of Lincoln, Judge Sean Morris, raised the prospect that the courts could face a surge of foreign offenders when controls on Romania and Bulgaria are abandoned 13 days from now. He expressed frustration at delays of six months and longer to obtain criminal records from the Romanian authorities and called on ministers to do something about it. His comments came as he delayed sentencing of a Romanian woman who was part of a gang which targeted elderly men using cash machines. He delayed sentencing Romanian thief Nicoleta Bala - who was part of a gang targeting elderly men - at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) until he had received her criminal record from her native country . He said he would not sentence Nicoleta Bala – who now has a child born in Britain – until he received her criminal history from her home country. He said any Romanian criminals would ‘languish’ in prison awaiting sentence until he knew what their criminal past was. ‘You can get in and out of this country. The borders are like a sieve,’ he told Lincoln Crown Court. ‘I do not deal with foreign criminals without knowing whether  they have been in trouble in their own country. ‘If the fact is that people come over here from Romania to commit crime they cannot complain. ‘The message can go out that I will not deal with these people until I have full knowledge about their background. The lesson is – don’t come here and commit crime.’ On the delays in obtaining records he added: ‘It really is in the political sphere. Something has to be done. ‘I don’t know if we are going to have a lot of new customers. This is  something that the police at a senior level, the Home Office and the  Ministry of Justice are going to have to take up.’ Bala, 28, who lives in Leicester, was in a gang which stole PINs and bank cards from elderly men using cash machines in the Midlands. She admitted two distraction thefts . in Grantham and Stoke on Trent in November 2008, only months after . entering Britain using a Romanian ID card. After committing the crimes . she left the country but was arrested on her return at Folkestone. Police . requested her past convictions in September but do not expect a . response until the New Year, the court heard. Both of Bala’s theft . victims have since died, prosecutor Andrew Scott said. He . told the court: ‘Unlike the East European Baltic states, Romania is not . one of the most efficient member states in relation to bilateral . co-operation.’ Judge said British borders were like a 'sieve' and said something has to be done at a 'senior level' (file picture) This week . it emerged that British police travelled to Romania to discourage young . men from coming to this country to commit crime. Even those who arrive intending to work can find themselves drawn in to petty crimes such as begging and pick-pocketing. Last . week it emerged that Romanians are seven times more likely to be . arrested in London in Britons. They account for more than 11 per cent of . all foreign offenders, despite making up just a tiny proportion of . residents. Last year, Romanians accounted for 49 per cent of all arrests . for begging and for 34 per cent of arrests for pickpocketing in the . capital. The Recorder of Lincoln, His Honour . Judge Sean Morris, was widely applauded in 2011 after handing a violent . burglar a 15-year sentence. He . tore up the normal sentencing guidelines for professional criminal and . heroin addict Leonard Johnston for three serious break-ins and assaults . on two of his victims. One of the victims died two months later. The . judge told Johnston that short prison and community sentences had . failed and he would be ‘out of circulation for a long, long time in . order to protect people’. Elderly people should, he said, be able to live in ‘safety and dignity’. The judge who is 55, was born in Bingley, West Yorkshire. He attended Benton Park Grammar School and Leeds Polytechnic then specialised as a criminal barrister. He has been a judge since 2003 and Recorder of Lincoln since 2011. In Who’s Who he lists his hobbies as ‘beer and curry’.","Judge Sean Morris warned 'don't come here and commit crime'

He said the Curia had its 'saints' but warned staff to be more professional to avoid 'a slow drift downwards toward mediocrity'.

He skipped the 2012 contest entirely - 'All the factors say go, but my hearts say no' was how he described his decision back then. And now, with 2016 in the distance, might he make another go of it? Here's what he told Fox News Sunday when asked whether he's open to the possibility of running: 'The honest answer is yes.' Former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Sunday there's about a 50-50 chance he'll run for president again in 2016 and that he will make a final decision after next year's midterm elections . 'It would be, frankly, dishonest to say no,' Huckabee said. He says the party has 'a strong stable' of potential candidates and he'll make a decision after the 2014 election. And how does he give the odds now? 'Maybe at this point it is 50-50,' he said. And we've heard this before - 'It would be a decision of the heart.' Addressing other issues, Huckabee suggested that Americans tend to show less regard for a single, working mother than a member of the ruling class.

Americans have indeed embraced populist Democratic candidates over the past several months, including New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, whose campaign focusing on perceived income inequality resonated with New York residents. However, Huckabee made clear, 'I don’t want big government to determine what income equality looks like'. Huckabee decided in 2011 not to enter the most recent presidential election campaign, saying: “All of the factors say go, but my heart says no.” Huckabee also said his final decision to run for presdient would still come from the heart.","Former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Sunday there's about a 50-50 chance he'll run for president again in 2016 .

Mighty Wings will be returning to a McDonald's near you - though not necessarily due to popular demand. McDonald's began stockpiling chicken wings earlier this year for its Mighty Wings promotion which debuted on September 9. But the spicy wings didn't fly out of stores, and now the company has 10 million pounds of Mighty Wings in cold storage. In a flap: McDonald's franchisees must participate in another Mighty Wings promotion after the first failed to offload the stockpile of chicken wings . McDonald's media relations executive Lisa McComb said in a statement: 'We're bringing back Mighty Wings - stay tuned.' Before the wings were launched in September, the company released a statement explaining: 'With the introduction of Mighty Wings, McDonaldâ€™s is bringing the popularity and fun of chicken wings to customers seeking any time and any reason to enjoy them.' Customers, however, did not take to the Mighty Wings, and the company still has 20 per cent of its original supply of chicken wings left. According to the Wall Street Journal, McDonald's franchisees have been told they must participate in another Mighty Wings promotion or pay for the excess inventory. Fowl play: Many customers felt the wings were priced too highly at $1 per wing . McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has acknowledged that one reason the wings didn't sell well was that the price was 'not the most competitive.' The wings were priced at $2.99 for three - well above competitor KFC's pricing of five wings for $3.99. Many customers baulked at paying a dollar per wing at the fast food chain, where they can purchase a whole burger for the same price. The Wall Street Journal reports that franchisees commented on the problem in a survey in October while the promotion was running. Winging it: The company will roll out the promotion around the country soon . 'Mighty Wings are proving once again that we canâ€™t sell premium items in large numbers because we still have the Dollar Menu,' one franchisee said in the anonymous survey. The higher prices came after McDonald's began buying up big in the chicken wing market, driving prices up and necessitating a higher price point for the company to make its margin. Critics have also noted that the breaded and fried wings were too spicy to appeal to the McDonald's customer. When Mighty Wings land at McDonald's outlets again soon, they will be priced more competitively.","McDonald's still have 10 million pounds of chicken wings leftover from its Mighty Wings promotion .

Police are to investigate Nigella Lawson over her admission that she took cocaine and smoked cannabis in front of her children. In an extraordinary turnaround, the celebrity cook could now face the prospect of being formally interviewed by officers over her evidence. Last week, when her former assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo were acquitted of defrauding her and ex-husband Charles Saatchi, Scotland Yard appeared reluctant to act. Facing probe: Nigella Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in London where she gave evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and Charles Saatchi . In a statement, it said: 'At this stage the Metropolitan Police will not be investigating these allegations.' But in the wake of stinging criticism, a senior commander at the Metropolitan Police gave an interview in which he suggested police would pursue the matter with fresh vigour. Commander Stephen Watson said officers would be working with prosecutors to examine the 'implications' of what Miss Lawson and her aides said under oath. He promised the Yard would devote 'specialist resources' to examine all the evidence in what could be a protracted review. Dismissing the earlier statement, he said: 'Frankly, I don't think the full colour of the  Metropolitan Police Service's position was conveyed in that statement. We will use specialist resources from within the Metropolitan Police Service to examine all the evidence which emerged as part of a review into this matter. 'At some point, once that review is concluded, presumably in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, we will determine a way forward. 'Part and parcel of that review we will undertake will be to look at all aspects of the testimony that was given in the trial, which is now public knowledge, and will reveal itself in the transcripts of the trial. Sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo, the two former personal assistants cleared of defrauding Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi . 'There are implications in terms of what has been said during the course of that trial and all those implications will be taken into account in determining an appropriate way forward.' The significant development comes as a damning statement emerged yesterday from Kay Saatchi, Charles's second wife, suggesting that Miss Lawson tried to involve his 18-year-old daughter Phoebe in drug taking. Mrs Saatchi said: 'I am furious that my daughter, Phoebe, was put into a dangerous environment with the heavy drug use of Nigella.' The revelations could prompt social services to intervene amid claims that Miss Lawson habitually used drugs in front of her own children aged 17 and 19 and may have involved them and step-daughter Phoebe in 'a druggy world'. Social services may want to consider whether the allegations raise child protection issues. When she took the stand at Isleworth Crown Court to give evidence against her two former aides, the TV cook admitted taking cocaine on six occasions with John Diamond, her first husband, when he found out he had terminal cancer. She also said she took the class-A drug in July 2010 when she was subjected to 'intimate terrorism' by Mr Saatchi. Miss Lawson admitted smoking cannabis in the last year of her marriage to the multi-millionaire art gallery owner. However her two assistants told the court she repeatedly used the class-A drug and Elisabetta Grillo said the chef 'lets the children smoke weed'. Police will now consider whether to bring drug possession charges and could interview her under caution in a bid to identify her suppliers. They may also want to question Victoria Coren, who wrote in a national newspaper that she had taken cocaine with Mr Diamond before his death in 2001. Yesterday a spokesman stressed there was no 'imminent prospect of a prosecution', but a full review of the case will take place. Like his predecessors, Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be particularly sensitive to any notion that police give celebrities special treatment. But without physical evidence of possession of the class-A drug, it may be difficult to bring any charges. Former Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair famously vowed to crack down on middle-class cocaine users. But the following year, a cocaine probe into Kate Moss ended in farce. The supermodel was cleared despite being pictured apparently snorting 'line after line' at a recording studio. A minor legal loophole meant police could not prove which type of drug was involved. A spokesman for Westminster City Council refused to comment on the Miss Lawson case yesterday. She said: 'We do not comment on the specifics of protecting children.'","TV cook could face prospect of being formally interviewed by officers .

Millions of parents whose young children have a child trust fund will be allowed to transfer the money into a junior Isa, the Daily Mail can reveal. It is a landmark victory for this newspaper’s Money Mail section which has campaigned for more than two years for the absurd rule, which currently bans the transfer, to be scrapped. George Osborne, the Chancellor, said the decision ‘supports hard-working families who want to save for their children.’ Move: Chancellor George Osborne (pictured with a young girl at a Downing Street tea party in May) said the decision 'supports hard-working families who want to save for their children' Child Trust Funds were launched by the Labour government more than a decade ago, with an average voucher of £250 given to babies born between September 1, 2002 and 2 January 2011. Around 6.3million children have a Child Trust Fund with a total of £5billion invested in these nest eggs, with extra money contributed by relatives and friends. When the Coalition came to power, they were scrapped and replaced by the Junior Isas. But, to the fury of millions of parents, children with a Child Trust Fund were not allowed to open a Junior Isa and were not allowed to move money from a Child Trust Fund into a Junior Isa. As a result, the money was left locked in Child Trust Fund accounts paying dire rates, while Junior Isas were paying far more generous rates. The best rate for a Junior cash Isa is currently six per cent, but the best rate for a child trust fund is half this amount. If a parent put £300 a month into their child’s account from birth until his or her 18th birthday, it would total £118,800 in the Junior cash Isa. But the child with the Child Trust Fund paying a rate of only three per cent would get £86,000 despite their parents’ making exactly the same contribution, a difference of nearly £33,000. To make matters worse, some Child Trust Fund providers imposed rip-off charges. For example, Britain’s oldest investment company, Foreign & Colonial, hit its savers with a £30 annual fee, which would decimate a £250 savings pot in just eight years. Doing the maths: CTFs were launched by the Labour government more than a decade ago, with an average voucher of £250 given to babies born between September 1, 2002 and 2 January 2011 (file picture) Mr Osborne told the Daily Mail: ‘This Government supports hard-working families who want to save for their children. ‘So I’m delighted that, as a result of these changes, over six million children who currently have savings in a Child Trust Fund will be able to benefit from better returns and lower charges on those savings.’ The Government hopes to make the transfers legal ‘as soon as possible’, with the change expected to take place in April 2015. The move is a relief for families, many . of whom worried that the unfair transfer ban was creating an unfair . divide between their offspring, where the eldest might have a Child . Trust Fund but a younger sibling has a junior Isa. 'Over six million children who currently have savings in a Child Trust Fund will be able to benefit from better returns and lower charges on those savings' Chancellor George Osborne . For the last two years, the Treasury has insisted there is no difference between the two types of accounts. But the announcement, which is expected today, endorses the Mail’s campaign, which has been supported by major banks, investment firms and financial advisers. Parents were penalised, not just by lower rates and rip-off charges on child trust funds, but also a chronic lack of choice. A dwindling number of banks and building societies offer Child Trust Funds, while Junior Isa savers can choose from a huge number of options. Around £550million is currently held in Junior Isas by around 300,000 children. When they reach 18, Junior Isa savers can move their money directly into a tax-efficient adult Isa, but a quirk in the legislation meant that those with Child Trust Funds were only able to move their money into taxable accounts. Parents were not given a £250 voucher to put into their child’s Junior Isa, but they can invest up to £3,720 every tax year into their child’s nest egg. The same amount can also be invested into a Child Trust Fund every year. Saving up: Helen and Gareth Driver with Chester (left) and Charlie . Helen and Gareth Driver are relieved they will now be able to treat their children in the same way. The couple have two boys. The eldest, Charlie, who is three, has a Child Trust Fund, but the younger, Chester, who is one, has a Junior Isa. Both are held with the Skipton Building Society, but they pay different rates. Mrs Driver, 32, who works as a team manager for Co-op supermarkets, said the administration of two different accounts has been annoying. The fact that one of her sons gets a better deal than her other child is also something that bothers her because it seems unfair. Charlie’s account pays 2.65 per cent, but this is trumped by his younger brother, who gets 3.02 per cent. If the children are given money at Christmas or for their birthdays, it is put into the accounts to give them a helping hand when they reach 18. Mrs Driver, from Malton, North Yorkshire, said: ‘We are delighted that Charlie can switch. He will earn a better rate and he will avoid having his money taxed when he reaches 18. ‘It will also be much easier for us to keep track of just one account.’","He says it 'supports hard-working families who want to save for children'

Astronauts removed an old space station pump Saturday, sailing through the first of a series of urgent repair spacewalks to revive a crippled cooling line. The two Americans on the crew, Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins, successfully pulled out the ammonia pump with a bad valve well ahead of schedule. That task had been planned for the next spacewalk, originally scheduled for Monday but now delayed until Tuesday, Christmas Eve, because of the need for a suit swap. 'An early Christmas,' observed Mission Control as Mastracchio tugged the refrigerator-size pump away from its nesting spot. Faulty: Aging spacesuits have proven to be a challenge for astronauts attempting to fix the International Space Station . Space walk: Astronauts Rick Mastraccho and Michael Hopkins embark on a risky space walk to fix a cooling pipe . Drowning: Astronauts risked drowning while fixing the ISS because of aging spacesuits . If Mastracchio and Hopkins keep up the quick work, two spacewalks may be enough to complete the installation of a spare pump and a third spacewalk will not be needed as originally anticipated. Several hours after Saturday's spacewalk ended, Mission Control bumped spacewalk 2 to Tuesday to give Mastracchio enough time to prepare a spare suit. His original suit was compromised when he inadvertently turned on a water switch in the air lock at the end of Saturday's excursion. NASA officials said Saturday night that it's unclear whether a third spacewalk will be needed and when it might occur, if required. A third spacewalk had been slated for Christmas Day before the latest turn of events. NASA requires a day off between spacewalks for astronaut rest. The space station breakdown 10 days earlier left one of two identical cooling loops too cold and forced the astronauts to turn off all nonessential equipment inside the orbiting lab, bringing scientific research to a near-halt and leaving the station in a vulnerable state. Mission Control wanted to keep the spacewalkers out even longer Saturday to get even further ahead, but a cold and uncomfortable Mastracchio requested to go back. The spacewalk ended after 5Â½ hours, an hour short on time but satisfyingly long on content. Risk: The suits used by the astronauts have a history of leaking liquid into the helmet from an internal cooling system . Earlier, Mastracchio managed to unhook all the ammonia fluid and electrical lines on the pump with relative ease, occasionally releasing a flurry of frozen ammonia flakes that brushed against his suit. A small O-ring floated away, but he managed to retrieve it. 'I got it, I got it, I got it. Barely,' Mastracchio said as he stretched out his hand. 'Don't let that go, that's a stocking stuffer,' Mission Control replied. 'Don't tell my wife,' Mastracchio said, chuckling, as he put it in a small pouch for trash. Mastracchio, a seven-time spacewalker, and Hopkins, making his first, wore extra safety gear as they worked outside. NASA wanted to prevent a recurrence of the helmet flooding that nearly drowned an Italian astronaut last summer, so Saturday's spacewalkers had snorkels in their suits and water-absorbent pads in their helmets. To everyone's relief, the spacewalkers remained dry while outside. But midway through the excursion, Mastracchio's toes were so cold that he had to crank up the heat in his boots. Mission Control worried aloud whether it was wise to extend the spacewalk to get ahead, given Mastracchio's discomfort. Not quite two hours later, Mastracchio had enough as he clutched the old pump. When Mission Control suggested even more get-ahead chores, he replied, 'I'd like to stow this old module and kind of clean up and call it a day.' He said a couple of things were bothering him, not just temperature, and declined to elaborate when asked by Mission Control what was wrong. System down: The cooling system in the ISS needs to be repaired in order for the astronauts to complete their mission . Flight controllers obliged him. Once the old pump was secured to a temporary location, the spacewalkers started gathering up their tools to go in. Adding to the excitement 260 miles (418 kilometers) up, a smoke alarm went off in the space station as the astronauts toiled outside. It was quickly found to be a false alarm. The pump replacement is a huge undertaking attempted only once before, back in 2010 on this very unit. The two astronauts who tackled the job three years ago were in Mission Control, offering guidance. Mastracchio promised to bring back a wire tie installed on the pump by the previous spacewalkers. 'Oh, awesome, thanks Rick,' replied the astronaut in Mission Control who put it on. The 780-pound (354-kilogram) pump is about the size of a double-door refrigerator and extremely cumbersome to handle, with plumbing full of toxic ammonia. Any traces of ammonia on the spacesuits were dissipated before the astronauts went back inside, to avoid further contamination. NASA's plan initially called for the pump to be disconnected in the first spacewalk, pulled out on the second spacewalk and a fresh spare put in, and then all the hookups of the new pump completed in the third outing. Urgent: The broken cooling equipment on the ISS has required three, risky space walks . In the days following the Dec. 11 breakdown, flight controllers attempted in vain to fix the bad valve through remote commanding. Then they tried using a different valve to regulate the temperature of the overly cold loop, with some success. But last Tuesday, NASA decided the situation was severe enough to press ahead with the spacewalks. Although the astronauts were safe and comfortable, NASA did not want to risk another failure and a potential loss of the entire cooling system, needed to radiate the heat generated by on-board equipment. NASA delayed a delivery mission from Wallops Island, Virginia, to accommodate the spacewalks. That flight by the private firm Orbital Sciences Corp., which should have occurred this past week, is now targeted for Jan. 7. Until Saturday, U.S. spacewalks had been on hold since July, when an Italian astronaut's helmet was flooded with water from the cooling system of his suit. Luca Parmitano barely got back inside alive. Engineers traced the problem to a device in the suit that turned out to be contaminated â€” how and why, no one yet knows. For Saturday's spacewalk, Hopkins wore Parmitano's suit, albeit with newly installed and thoroughly tested components. Just in case, NASA had Mastracchio and Hopkins build snorkels out of plastic tubing from their suits, before going out. The snorkels will be used in case water starts building up in their helmets. They also put absorbent pads in their helmets; the pads were launched from Earth following the July scare. None of the precautions were needed, in the end. Besides the two Americans, three Russian and one Japanese astronaut are living on the space station, all men.","Astronauts Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins, successfully pulled out the ammonia pump on the ISS after two risky space walks .

A leading vet wants horse to be served up in restaurants to help save Exmoor’s ponies. Ponies have grazed the moor since prehistoric times but equine expert Peter Green says in a report they are fast being outnumbered by unwanted horses dumped on the moor by hard-up owners. Claiming the abandoned ponies are endangering the pure-bred wild ponies by cross-breeding with the natives, he says the answer is to shoot them and sell them as horse meat. A leading vet has said some of the free-living ponies within the Exmoor National Park should be promoted as 'food animals' His 72-page report, ‘The free-living ponies within the Exmoor National Park: their status, welfare and future’, comes weeks after Princess Anne said Britain ought to become a nation of horseflesh eaters. In it he admits some landowners are appalled by the idea of putting pony on the dinner table but others back him. 'As there is so limited a market for ridden ponies, show ponies and conservation grazers, why not promote the free-living Exmoor ponies as a food animal as much as an amenity or aesthetic resource?' ‘Several contributors expressed the view . that the British aversion to eating horse meat was both illogical and . unhelpful to the free-living Exmoor ponies,’ he says. But experts agree something needs to be done to protect the remaining 500 or so. Under Mr Green’s plan the ‘excess’ ponies would be processed at EU-approved abattoirs. The report was commissioned by conservation groups including the Exmoor National Park Authority and the Exmoor Pony Society. Under Mr Green's plan the 'excess' ponies would be processed at EU-approved abattoirs . Under his plan the 'excess' ponies would be slaughtered, processed and inspected at EU-approved abattoirs in line with red meat regulations before entering the food chain. Some EPS committee members are understood to support the plan but others have warned it could put off tourists who like to visit Exmoor to stroke and ride the famous animals. Earlier this year it was revealed that Dartmoor ponies were being fed to zoo lions and tigers. And the Mail on Sunday reported that their hides were being crafted into drums used in Druid-style retreats to capture the rhythms of ‘life and the moon’. A spokesman for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said culling was ‘a cruel and ineffective way to manage pony numbers when chemical sterilisers are available’.","Expert claims ponies are endangering pure-bred animals by cross-breeding .

He says if the money is returned, he plans to give it all to Ms Knight, who is currently several months pregnant. What a tip!

Mark Burrows (pictured) has been left in need of round-the-clock care after being paralysed by Joshua Corker . A judge has allowed a drunken thug who paralysed a stranger with a single punch to walk free from court. Mark Burrows, 35, was left with devastating brain injuries after the assault by Joshua Corker, and needs 24-hour care. He is unable to move his limbs or talk and his family are said to be suffering a ‘living nightmare’. The victim’s father wept in court as Corker, 23, was released with a two-year suspended prison sentence on Friday. Mr Burrows, a scaffolder from Wigan, was enjoying a night out with a friend in Sheffield in April last year when he passed a group of men singing football songs and is believed to have commented on Sheffield United losing a match. Corker, who was among the group and drunk at the time, floored him with a single punch to the face. Mr Burrows suffered head injuries and a fractured neck and underwent complex surgery before being connected to a life support machine. The victim was moved to a high-dependency . unit, where he remains, but has suffered life-changing and permanent . disabilities that mean he will require round-the-clock care for the rest . of his life. The victim’s family have been trying to . raise money for equipment to care for him at home, while Corker is now . on course for a successful career, having completed a degree in . construction management and been promoted by employer Barratt Homes. Corker, of Sheffield, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm. Despite the devastating consequences of the assault, the judge allowed the young graduate to escape custody. Judge Simon Lawler, who described the case told him: ‘This is a tragic case for all involved. 'While Mr Burrows’ family are understandably devastated, you are too. Tragic: The life of Mark Burrows, pictured before the attack, has been 'transformed' said his mother . 'You . are of positive, very good character. I suspect you were . uncharacteristically inhibited by drink. ‘No sentence can bring back what has come to pass. 'I cannot say the public interest of the family demands I sentence you to immediate custody.’ Corker must complete 270 hours of unpaid work and a six-month curfew order imposed on him. After the case Detective constable Joanne . de la Torre of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This is a particularly . tragic case. 'The life of a young man and his family have been changed . forever due to what was a single punch, thrown in an alcohol-fuelled fit . of anger. ‘He can no longer move or talk and it is unclear as to . whether he will any be any better than he is today.’ In a family . statement, the victim’s mother Mrs Burrows said their ‘hearts have been . ripped out.’ She said: ‘My son has been through a hellish time. He has . fought for his life on many occasions and has been at the brink of . death. ‘He was looking forward to settling down in the future with a . family of his own.

Romanian and Bulgarian migrants coming to Britain in the New Year could put huge pressure on housing, schools and hospitals, a major report warns today. The study by the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research says most of the new arrivals will settle in London and the South East – meaning public services in these areas will be most affected. It warns that Britain could see an increase in anti-social behaviour, aggressive begging, rough sleeping and criminality from next week. Under fire: The report from the Institute for Public Policy Research said that David Cameron's changes to benefit rules - designed to discourage migrants - are 'largely symbolic' And it says David Cameron’s much heralded changes to benefits rules are ‘largely symbolic’ and will make little or no difference. The report will ratchet up the pressure on ministers ahead of January 1, when the remaining controls on working rights for nationals of the two countries will expire. Mr Cameron has resisted calls to face down the EU and extend the controls, despite opinion polls showing huge public support for such a move. The report calls for ‘urgent action’ to deal with the wider housing crisis. It states: ‘Future migration to the UK from Bulgaria and Romania is likely to place added pressure on the lower-end of the private rented sector, particularly in the areas of London and the South East where most Romanian and Bulgarian migrants currently live and where housing is already in high demand.’ The report warns schools – which are already facing huge pressure due to existing population growth – and hospitals will also bear the brunt of a surge in numbers. ‘In the short term, the need for extra school places and additional usage of NHS services in some areas are likely to be the main consequences,’ it says. It concludes that crime could increase because Romanians are ‘disproportionately reflected’ in the crime statistics. Crime: The report says lawbreaking could increase as Romanians are 'disproportionately reflected' in crime statistics. Pictured are two Romanian travellers with a policeman in London's Park Lane . They are second only to Poles in terms of foreign national arrests since 2008 – despite being far fewer in number. The report warns of potential problems with ‘anti-social behaviour (including aggressive begging), rough sleeping and even criminality’. It is scathing about the changes to benefit rules, which were much heralded by Downing Street. They will mean EU migrants cannot claim out-of-work benefits for three months after arriving. The political response, it says, has been ‘more symbolic than substantive’ – and it accuses ministers of ‘rushing through last minute measures limiting access to entitlements’. Ministers should set up a dedicated fund of millions of pounds and use it to help communities where pressure on public services is particularly acute, the report says. It is published as Mr Cameron faces criticism from the president of Bulgaria over efforts to restrict future EU migration. Rosen Plevneliev accused the PM of trying to build an ‘iron curtain’ in Europe and pandering to nationalist sentiment. In an interview with the Observer newspaper, he called on Britain to stay true to its legacy as ‘a great global power that pioneered integration’. Mr Plevneliev added: ‘Isolating Great Britain and damaging Britain’s reputation is not the right history to write.’ A third of Big Issue sellers are from Eastern Europe, the magazine’s founder has revealed. John Bird, 67, said of that group, more than half are originally from Roma communities. He said there had been a rise in the number of immigrant vendors in recent years as more migrants came from Eastern Europe. Many Roma turned to selling The Big Issue to escape lives of ‘feral poverty’ he added. Controversially, he also said their reasons for choosing Britain were ‘made up maybe of [claiming] social security, maybe the ability to beg, maybe the ability to thieve’. One in three of the babies born in England and Wales last year had at least one parent who was born overseas. In London, almost seven in ten babies had at least one non-British-born parent, and in parts of the capital it was nearly 90 per cent. The Office for National Statistics figures show the stark changes in the number of migrants having children in  this country over the past decade. Since 2000, the proportion of babies with foreign-born parents has increased by half. Then, 21.2 babies had at least one, but by last year that figure stood at 31.4 per cent.","Major report by the Institute for Public Policy Research gave a warning .

Binmen could refuse to empty rubbish bins if their lids aren't fully closed under a city's controversial new regulations. Residents could also be hit with £100 fines if they don't take their bins back to their home by the end of collection day, tough policy rules state. Critics have slammed the strict new waste management regulations from Labour council chiefs at Southampton City Council, Hampshire, as 'farcical'. Binmen in Southampton can refuse empty a bin if the lid won't close under new Labour proposals . Binmen will pick up any rubbish left next to the bin, but only to put it in the bin for collection a week later. Any bin containing incorrect items will be left on the street until the offending waste is removed. And repeat offenders could be fined or receive an 'education visit' from council officials to help them follow the rules. Labour bosses have signed off a draft of the stringent terms, due to come into force next year. But opposition councillors have hit out at the regulations and branded the scheme 'a load of rubbish'. Conservative opposition deputy leader Councillor Jeremy Moulton disapproves of rules on rubbish that won't fit in the bin. Known as 'side waste', it covers any rubbish not contained in the bin with the lid closed. Cllr Moulton said: 'I think it's ridiculous. If people have more rubbish than they can fit in the bin, then it should be picked up if it's bagged up properly. That's what people pay taxes for.' And Councillor Don Thomas, from Labour Councillors Against the Cuts, said: 'What a load of rubbish. 'You really could not make this sort of stuff up. It is farcical, it's more time-wasting and putting yet more work load on our bin men.' Workers can pick up extra rubbish, but only to put it into the empty bin for collection the next week . But environment chief Councillor Jacqui Rayment, who is set to sign off the directives in the spring, says sanctions would be imposed as a 'last resort'. Cllr Rayment said: 'We only want to enforce as a last resort. We want to educate so that people use their bins properly.' The council says its binmen would 'operate flexibly' to take circumstances such as Christmas and New Year into account. A council spokesman said: 'The council has targets to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill and to increase recycling. 'Disposing of additional side waste that is not recycleable costs the city more money.' Crews will collect bins with lids that are not fully closed but in some cases it may not be 'possible or safe' to do so, he added. Residents criticised the plans, which include bins containing garden waste being left uncollected. Pearl Fletcher, a 58-year-old nurse from Southampton, Hants, said: 'I think this is ridiculous. If the binmen are going to take the rubbish away, they might as well take it all if it's there.'","Binmen in Southampton will be able to leave bins if the lid won't close .

Passengers raised the alarm as the woman floundered in the water and alert ferry crew members launched a fast rescue dinghy from the stern of the roll on roll off vessel. Bernard Barron, lifeboat chief at Calais paid tribute to the rapid reaction of P&O seamen saying it probably saved the distressed woman's life. She was recovered from the water in less than six minutes, he said. 'She could have easily have fallen victim to icy water with a temperature of only eight celsius. 'If they had not been as alert as they were she probably would not have survived.' A P&O spokesman added: 'Yesterday lunchtime, a young lady jumped from a ferry.

The extent to which junk mail and nuisance phone calls had taken over my life became clear during one hellish day when I felt as though I was under siege in my own home. On this day, my letterbox seemed to open and snap shut every 15 minutes with some leaflet or other offering a service I didn’t need. When the junk mail wasn’t disturbing the peace, my mobile and landline were ringing with calls claiming I was due a small fortune in PPI and accident compensation or from call centres asking me to take part in endless surveys. Deck the hall with junk: Claudia with her stacks of unwanted mail . It all added up to an incredibly stressful day when I was unable to get any work done. Certainly it’s a problem that has become part and parcel of modern life, but what made it all the more frustrating was that I take every step I can to ensure I’m not targeted. I refuse to join mailing lists, I untick boxes asking if I’d like to be sent special offers, my phone number is ex-directory and I’m registered with the TPS (telephone preference service). Clearly, though, these weren’t working. So, with a mixture of sheer frustration and morbid curiosity, I decided on that day in November last year to keep a running total of all my junk mail and nuisance calls for 12 months. My experiment came to an end at the beginning of this month and the outcome is staggering. Over the past year I have experienced 4,481 unwelcome intrusions into my life in the form of unsolicited post, spam emails, phone calls and texts. Of all these intrusions, it’s the junk mail that I find the most infuriating. Deluge: 17.5billion pieces of junk mail are distributed in Britain every year . On a bad day, leaflets start dropping through my letterbox as early as 6am and can continue until as late as 10pm. Sometimes, I’ll come home after a day out to find a dozen pieces of paper strewn across my floor. Every year around 17.5 billion pieces of junk mail, addressed and unaddressed, are distributed across the country. The average householder receives 453 of them. On Tuesday, the Mail ran the story of Rebecca George, 44, a graphic designer from Hackney, East London, who collected 1,027 pieces of junk mail in a year. Well,  guess what? I can do better than that. I received nearly treble the national average. This year, 1,147 items of junk were delivered to me. My house is in a part of South London known for its young families and high-earning professionals. And even though I don’t slot into either category, it means that if I look out of my window I rarely have to wait more than a few minutes before I see a leaflet distributor. My tally included 91 cards from taxi firms, 76 freesheets and newspapers and 42 envelopes and bags from charities. There were also 159 takeaway menus - a third from Pizza Hut and Dominos, who rarely went a week without reminding me of their latest offers. Endless: Spam email traffic is never-ending, and practically impossible to stem . As the value of properties in my area has risen by 25 per cent in the past year, estate agents are keen to make their presence known. There have been 123 communications, including 30 addressed to me by name from agents who, presumably, had identified me on the electoral roll. I also received 309 flyers from companies offering every kind of service you can imagine from cleaning and gardening to baby-sitting and dog walking. Religious groups including the Church of Scientology and Jehovah’s Witnesses left their calling cards, as did one gentleman calling himself ‘Mr Mahuba the Witchdoctor’ who, for a small fee, would place lifelong curses on my enemies. On more than one occasion I wondered how much he’d charge for performing a little voodoo on Pizza Hut or Foxtons estate agents. My local authority, Lambeth, has failed to see the irony of leafleting me on 24 occasions about my duty to recycle and dispose of my mail responsibly. Of the half a million tonnes of junk mail generated in Britain every year, around a fifth ends up going to landfill sites at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £50 million. Then there is the damage to the environment. It takes 17 trees to produce each tonne of junk mail. In the past year, there were only eight blissful days out of 365 when I didn’t receive a single flyer. At the beginning of this year, I stuck a ‘no junk mail please’ sticker to my letterbox. A fortnight later I removed it when I realised it was making things worse. Hefty load: Half of a postman's bag will be made up of junk, which is worth £1.1billion a year to the Royal Mail . Some mischievous distributors were taking it as a sign to dump a handful of flyers on me in one go. When I pointed out the sticker to one young man who was about to deliver literature from a removal company, he just shrugged and said ‘no understand English’. Increasingly, it isn’t just the door-to-door leaflet-droppers responsible for junk mail. A vast amount is delivered by Royal Mail. In the past 12 months it delivered 226 letters and promotional mail items from companies trying to sell me everything from wine, holidays to insurance, clothes and furniture. Ludicrously, the companies who harassed me the most were the ones whose services I already used. So much for their expensive consumer research departments! Sky Television wrote to me 26 times trying to sell me more expensive packages or get me to switch phone provider. BT also wrote to me 16 times about their broadband or new TV sports channels. But as any Sky or BT customer knows, when you have a problem with their products and really need to make contact, you’ve got more chance of getting through to the Prime Minister than you have of speaking to someone who can help. I also received 63 letters from energy companies wanting me to switch my supply to them or simply justifying why they are sticking up their prices yet again. Thirty-three banks and credit companies wrote offering loans and balance transfers. Not surprisingly, half a postman’s sack will be made up of junk post - with the Royal Mail delivering  3.3 billion items a year. Though it offers households the chance to opt out of receiving unaddressed junk mail, since it depends on £1.1 billion a year of such business, it doesn’t make it well known. No wonder less than 1 per cent of homes have joined the scheme. I did, however, think that registering my mobile and home phones with the Telephone Preference Service would stop nuisance calls - and until about two years ago, it did. The service is free and it means that your number is put on a national register that marketing and telesales companies are meant to check and not contact anyone whose name appears on it. While reputable companies abide by the rules, a growing number of rogue ones do not. Unstoppable: Claudia was bombarded with more than triple the average amount of junk mail . It is for that reason, I assume, that over the past year I received 137 nuisance calls and 72 texts. Some of the phone calls, particularly those from Indian-based call centres, came as early as 5am, while texts pinged up any time of the day or night. The vast majority were from companies wrongly claiming I was owed PPI compensation or a pay-out after an accident. I also received 40 ‘silent calls’. These are from companies using ACS (Automated Calling Systems). Targeted phone numbers are randomly chosen and automatically dialled. If you answer and an agent is available you’ll be connected. But if you answer and no agent is free, the line just goes dead. A rather intimidating thing at 2am. During September, a company calling itself UK Lifestyle, but using Indian call centre staff, called me 14 times asking me to take part in pointless surveys. I’d refuse, ask them not to call again and an hour later they’d ring back as if they’d never spoken to me before. When it comes to text messages, texting ‘STOP’ to one of the PPI companies is the worst thing you can do. It simply informs them your number is in use and leads to a flurry of additional messages. The problem of nuisance calls and texts has become so huge, with seven out of ten people receiving them, that consumer watchdog Which? has launched a ‘Calling Time’ campaign asking the Government to get tough on organisations that harass people in their homes. Richard Lloyd of Which? says: ‘Unwanted calls or texts are not just a nuisance, they can be intrusive and distressing. 'Many of us have been bombarded with spurious claims of PPI or injury compensation, and people are fed up with this nuisance and want to see action. ‘We want regulators to work together to police and punish those responsible. If they are unwilling or unable to enforce the rules, the Government should step in.’ But the award for the biggest pest of all goes to the email spammers. In the past year, I have received 3,125 junk emails - that’s despite using the highest possible security filters. From the Nigerian scammers telling me I’ve inherited millions to Canadian pharmacies wanting to sell me Viagra, the emails arrived at a rate of nine a day. What I can do to reduce the spam? Apparently, not a lot. Internet security expert Sam Maccherola says: ‘Once your email address is publicly available online or on an illegal list, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle.’ And as with the junk text messages, opting to unsubscribe will only alert spammers to the fact your email address is active, and you’ll be targeted even more. With my own Project Junk at an end, I will shortly be taking my ten giant bin bags full of leaflets and letters to the recycling centre - and, sadly, bracing myself for the even bigger deluge that 2014 is bound to bring.","Claudia tries to avoid spam, but still had 4,481 junk messages in 2013 .

The fiancée of Lee Rigby condemned the BBC yesterday for giving a notorious hate preacher a platform to praise his killers. Aimee West, 23, said it was wrong for the corporation to invite Anjem Choudary on to Radio 4’s Today programme to give his views on the soldier’s murder. Choudary was given 12 minutes of airtime on the programme, during which he repeatedly refused to condemn the savage killing. Miss West said: ‘I’m all for free speech, but the BBC is wrong to give such a big platform to hate preachers who are brainwashing young people and inciting such acts of horrific violence.’ She added that killers Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are ‘not representative of Islam’. Their Old Bailey trial was told that they believed they were avenging the deaths of Muslims in war zones including Afghanistan and Iraq. But Miss West, a former Royal Military Policewoman, said: ‘They are cowards, not soldiers. They used a car as a weapon to attack my Lee from behind and when he was unarmed. This was the most cowardly act. They can’t possibly compare themselves to Lee or any other British soldier.’ Platform: Anjem Choudary (centre) is a former leading member of the banned extremist organisation Al-Muhajiroun and is credited with helping to convert Michael Adebolajo (left) to Islam . Adebolajo and Adebowale face dying behind bars for butchering Fusilier Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich, South-East London, in May. Last Thursday they were convicted of his murder and are due to be sentenced next month. Yesterday Muslim organisations joined the growing backlash against the BBC’s decision to give Choudary the most high-profile slot on Today – shortly after the 8am news – on Friday. They are planning to demand a meeting with director general Lord Hall to discuss the BBC’s editorial policies. Scores of listeners contacted the corporation to complain about the interview. Many more expressed their anger on Twitter and other internet forums. Choudary is a former leading member of the banned extremist organisation Al-Muhajiroun and is credited with helping to convert Adebolajo to Islam. Jailed: Miss West said that killers Michael Adebolajo (left), 29, and Michael Adebowale (right), 22, are 'not representative of Islam'. The two men face dying behind bars for butchering Fusilier Rigby outside his barracks . During his interview, Choudary . repeatedly refused to condemn the killing, insisting David Cameron and . British foreign policy were to blame for the soldier’s death. A young mother told yesterday how Michael Adebolajo raped her when she was only 14. The victim, now in her 20s, said he encouraged her to smoke super-strength cannabis, which made her pass out. When she came round, Adebolajo was raping her as a friend watched. She got away after pleading with him to let her go. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not tell the police or her parents at the time because she felt too ashamed. The attack took place in Romford, Essex, in 2001, when Adebolajo was 16. They lived near each other. Describing the attack, she told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I have looked in his eyes and seen the evil inside him. ‘I opened my eyes and his face was less than an inch from mine. His teeth were discoloured and wonky. His eyes seemed to be burning. 'He smirked and his breath smelt foul and was hot on my face.’ He added that he was ‘very proud’ of . Adebolajo as ‘a practising Muslim and a family man’, but ‘differed’ with . him about the interpretation of Islam which he used to justify the . murder. Julie Siddiqi, executive director of the Islamic Society of Britain, said: ‘It [the Today appearance] was a massive error of judgment and it does so much damage. Why him? He has no legitimacy in the Muslim community. ‘We need to understand how this was . allowed to happen. We need to articulate to the BBC the anger and . disappointment that he was given this platform.’ Choudary pulled out of an interview with the BBC’s Panorama programme, which had gathered evidence of his close and recent links Adebolajo. But he was not asked about this on Today. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We carried a wide range of views from across the political and religious spectrums [following the Woolwich murder]. ‘We believe it is important to reflect the fact that such opinions exist and feel that Choudary’s comments may offer some insight into how this crime came about. ‘His views were robustly challenged by both the presenter, John Humphrys, and by Lord Carlile, the Government’s former anti-terrorism adviser.’","Aimee West says Choudary should not have been invited on to Today .

A Republican candidate for Congress from Illinois says ‘Duck Dynasty’ patriarch Phil Robertson is the ‘Rosa Parks of our generation.’ Ian Bayne, 39, and running for the House of Representatives seat for the 11th District of Illinois, made the comparison to Ms Parks in an official statement released Friday on his website. Mr Bayne, from the Chicago suburb of Aurora, is running against a handful of other candidates in the 2014, according to the Daily Herald, which first flagged the remarks. ‘In December 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand against an unjust societal persecution of black people, and in December 2013, Robertson took a stand against persecution of Christians,’ Mr Bayne said. ‘What Parks did was courageous,’ he added. ‘What Mr. Robertson did was courageous too.’ The GOP candidate’s comparison of the reality star to the famous civil rights activist came under immediate criticism. ' after the he came under fire for his racially charged remarks to GQ. ‘I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,’ he told the magazine. ‘Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers.’ ‘They’re singing and happy,’ he continued. ‘I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word.’ Mr Robertson was immediately suspended from ‘Duck Dynasty’ as several conservative politicians came to his defense. Outspoken: 'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson has ignited a firestorm with his comments to GQ . ‘Phil Robertson and his family are great citizens of the State of Louisiana,’ Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said in a statement. ‘The politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints, except those they disagree with - I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment.’ Even more damning footage emerged Thursday of an anti-gay sermon given by the 67-year-old born-again Christian. ‘They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents and they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.' Though he never directly calls out homosexuals, the implications are obvious. Fans of the show have completely bought out Walmart’s stock of ‘Duck Dynasty’ merchandise, showing that not everyone is upset with his controversial comments.

But for Victoria Harris, 33, from Jersey, December 25th is loaded with bittersweet memories. For three years in a row, the festive season brought heartbreak as she suffered one miscarriage after another. But this year, things will be different as she, and her boyfriend James Cornick, 27, now have a son, Jack, to share the big day with. Relief: Victoria with her son Jack who was born on 17th December 2010 following three miscarriages . Miss Harris, who has chosen to share her story three years after her final miscarriage, said her experiences have left her a stronger person and a loving mother, and she hopes to offer encouragement and comfort to women in similar situations. 'Throughout everything, I have stayed positive, but Christmas is still a difficult time of year for me and James,' she said. 'We have sad thoughts every now again. 'We do our best to keep that feeling away from Jack. While I was growing up, Christmas was the most magical time of the year for me, and I want my son to have that feeling too.' Miss Harris, a former sales advisor, and Mr Cornick, an electrician, celebrated Jack's third birthday on December 17th. For Miss Harris, a former sales advisor, the date was a significant milestone on the long and difficult journey she has taken to have children. Happy ending: Victoria's longed-for son Jack (pictured as a newborn, left) is now a healthy three-year-old . 'I had half my cervix removed when I was 18, and tried getting pregnant for three years with no luck, so when the doctor said it was unlikely I would conceive I wasn't surprised,' she revealed. 'When I fell pregnant for the first time I was shocked but really pleased.' Sadly, she lost the baby boy on November 22nd 2007. 'My body had been trying to expel blood clots, but the amniotic sac was expelled too, which meant I lost the baby,' she remembers. 'Going through the miscarriage was terrible, but I was determined not to let the experience defeat me, so we started trying again fairly quickly.' Six months later, Miss Harris discovered she was pregnant again. 'This time, the pregnancy was perfect - there was no bleeding,' she recalls. 'But the week before Christmas, I started leaking fluids. The doctor tried to reassure me that my bladder was leaking, but I wasn't convinced. 'They kept me in hospital overnight and sent me home the next day. Then, on Christmas morning, I started to experience leaking and pain and went to hospital again. Heartbreaking: A scan taken in 2007 of Victoria's first baby at 12 weeks. She miscarried soon after . 'Everyone expected the baby's heartbeat to be strong, but the senior doctors couldn't find it at all. 'There was no water left inside me - it had all leaked out. All the doctor could say was, ""I'm sorry, you've lost the baby"". Then, everything became a blur.' Miss Harris delivered her stillborn daughter, Harriet, on Christmas Day 2008. She said: 'James and I had Harriet with us in the hospital family room for two days and nights. Eventually the nurses said, ""it's time to go"". Then it was time to say goodbye. It was like a bad dream. 'It was heartbreaking, leaving her there. I'd arrived at hospital half-expecting to leave with Harriet. But instead, I left with nothing. I'm still grieving for her today.' The following December, when she was six weeks pregnant, Miss Harris endured yet another miscarriage, this time requiring a surgical procedure. Tragic: Victoria when she was 32 weeks pregnant with Harriet, the baby girl she lost on Christmas Day . Memories: The grave of baby Harriet who was born and died on Christmas Day 2008 . But finally, in the spring of 2010, she discovered she was pregnant once again. 'I felt like I knew something bad would happen,' she explains, adding: 'I didn't dare look ahead - I took one day at a time. I would only believe it once the baby was in my arms, crying.' There were nervous moments when she experienced bleeding in the early stages of the pregnancy and again when her cervix began to open at 25 weeks. 'After two days in hospital, my cervix closed again,' she adds. 'Everyone was amazed. They let me go home, but under strict orders to relax and avoid physical exertion.' Their son's due date was December 30th 2010, but in order to prevent the baby arriving on Christmas Day, Miss Harris chose to be induced on December 17th. Thrilled: Despite some scary moments, Victoria and James were delighted when their son Jack finally arrived . Magical: Victoria hopes to make Christmas a wonderful of year for her much-loved son Jack . She said: 'Christmas Day is Harriet's . day - a day to remember her. We didn't want to celebrate a birthday and . an anniversary on the same day.' A . week before the birth, Miss Harris's grandmother, Barbara, passed away. But finally, after weeks of a mixture of anxiety, grief and growing . expectation, the fateful day arrived. 'Jack didn't cry when he was first born and the cord was wrapped around his neck three times, which meant the nurses had to ring the emergency bell. But eventually I heard him cry and it was an enormous relief.' Her son Jack is now a cheeky, adventurous three-year-old and his parents are looking forward to celebrating Christmas with him. 'He's coming through his terrible twos and is tall for his age,' said Miss Harris. 'Me and James are so protective of him. 'There are lots of fears which have been left over from our experiences - I'm sure most parents would understand what I mean.' Miss Harris says she hopes to offer comfort to women who are going through the heartbreak of unsuccessful pregnancy. 'My advice would be to stay strong and stay positive - don't despair,' she says. 'It was terrible after the losses, but there was joy at the end. Don't give up.'","Victoria Harris, 33, from Jersey, suffered three miscarriages in a row .

It was written by geologist Paul T. Walker on July 10, 1959, The Los Angeles Times reports. Walker asked that anyone who found his note would measure the distance between the cairn and a nearby glacier. He requested that the data be sent to either his Columbus, Ohio address of that of his colleague, Albert Crary in Massachusetts, The Chronicle Herald reports. Walker's 1959 note asks that the reader measure the distance between a cairn and a glacier on Ward Hunt Island. Walker died one month after writing the note after suffering a massive brain stroke, never discovering any updates . Walker never heard from anyone regarding the distance - exactly one month after he wrote the note, he became paralyzed by a brain seizure, CBC News reports.

Her sitcom is a massive hit  adored by millions, but Miranda Hart has revealed she has been so crippled by self-doubt that she turned to the late Eric Morecambe for inspiration. ‘I got to a point a year ago possibly when it was all a bit too much,’  the 41-year-old admits on today’s edition of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. ‘It was quite lonely and I  was struggling. ‘I thought is it worth it? Because you are not doing it for yourself. You are doing it for an audience. Miranda Hart has told how her hero Eric Morecambe helped her get through difficult times in her life . And are they out there laughing? And is comedy a noble, worthwhile career? ‘That was the key question I would have asked Eric and I hope he would have said, “Yes, it’s worth it.” ’ She adds: ‘Then you find ways to manage your life that means you are not in that place – which I am not now. I feel a lot happier, and more confident and celebratory of what I have achieved.’ Eric Morecambe, who died in 1984, is best known as one half of legendary comedy duo Morecambe and Wise . Morecambe, who died in 1984, was the subject of a documentary made by Hart that was screened on BBC1 earlier this year, and she describes the late star as ‘simply my hero’. She added: ‘If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have launched into getting into comedy. He gave me the licence to be silly and think grown-ups can do that.’ Hart also says she is far more introverted in real life than her persona in her sitcom. She says: ‘She is my clown .  .  . my on-stage licence to be silly and enjoy life and admit where life  is awkward and the real me is  an introvert really.’ She also says she finds it difficult to cope with the public’s affection for her alter ego. She says ‘I think they think she is their best friend, which is lovely and that is what I wanted to do with the character. 'But I never expected the sitcom to be a success so I didn’t expect that I would have to deal with the fact that I have got that expectation to meet.’ Hart, whose song selections for Desert Island Discs include the Morecambe And Wise theme Bring Me Sunshine, also reveals she was thrilled to be offered the part of Chummy in the drama Call The Midwife. She returns to play the role in the Christmas Day edition  of the show. Miranda will reprise her role as Chummy in a Christmas Day episode of Call The Midwife . ‘It didn’t feel like a risk,’ she says. ‘It felt like just the most wonderful opportunity. Jennifer Worth, who wrote the Call The Midwife books, sent me a copy of it and said, “You remind me of my friend Chummy. I’d love you to play her.” ‘I read it and I thought I have to play this character. It wasn’t too much of a leap .  .  . Sitcom Miranda  is Chummy now – admitting and showing vulnerability. If someone says how are you and you say “I’ve had an awful day” .  .  . the relief on people’s faces because we are all keeping up a pretence. ‘The minute you get a character like Chummy who shows her vulnerability, everyone identifies with her and wants her to win.’ Earlier this year, Miranda made a documentary about Eric Morecambe, and says that learning about him helped her learn how to manage her life better . Hart’s father, a former Royal Navy commander, was aboard the destroyer HMS Coventry when it was sunk during the 1982 Falklands War. And she tells Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young that she was in her 20s when she finally realised how close he had come to death. She says: ‘He didn’t speak at all when he got back. He put everything on tape and then when I was in my early 20s he allowed me to type them all up, which was amazing and quite emotional listening to his voice going through it so close to the event.’","Miranda admits that she felt overwhelmed by her massive success .

A mother-of-one has made a landmark vow on her 40th birthday to not undergo any more surgery, after 82 operations to correct a rare facial deformity. Born with a condition that causes large masses of swollen blood vessels to grow under her skin, Fiona Grigg, 40, has endured over 80 major operations to re-build her face. But Fiona, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, has determinedly led as normal a life as possible, finding love and giving birth to a beautiful daughter . Finally this year, after a lifetime of juggling everyday life with hospital appointments, Fiona is celebrating the end of her surgery as she turns 40. Born with a rare facial deformity, Fiona Grigg, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed just days after birth with cavernous haemangioma . Finally this year, after a lifetime of juggling everyday life with hospital appointments, Fiona is celebrating the end of her surgery as she turns 40 . Fiona was born with china doll features and perfectly clear skin until a tiny pink mark appeared on her cheek a few hours later. Doctors discovered she had a rare condition called cavernous haemangioma which causes blood vessels under the skin to swell. Within weeks the small mark had swollen into a huge, hard red mass filled with blood that distorted Fiona’s face. Her lips burst open, she couldn’t open her right eye and she could barely breathe as the mass spread across her face, around her head and down into her throat. Her condition meant that she suffered severe headaches and struggled to eat. Even a slight knock to her face would cause it to haemorrhage . Going through puberty was particularly hard and Fiona (pictured centre) was bullied at school: some children even refused to speak to her, believing she was contagious . Doctors feared Fiona wouldn't survive and at six weeks old her parents chose to have her christened and read her last rights. However she defied the odds and after 14 months in hospital Fiona was sent home. Her condition meant that she suffered severe headaches and struggled to eat. Even a slight knock to her face would cause it to haemorrhage. People would stop and stare and when she joined a playgroup parents complained she looked too frightening. At aged four Fiona began having the first of 82 major operations to remove the mass but it had distorted the underlying bone structure, pushing Fiona’s face to one side. 'One of my earliest memories is sitting in my bedroom and licking my baby photos and scratching the face off them. Mum found them all cut up in the fireplace in my room and was devastated.' Fiona on her wedding day with husband Alister who she met in a nightclub . Going through puberty was particularly hard and Fiona was bullied at school. Some children even refused to speak to her, believing she was contagious. As she grew older, Fiona realised she had a choice - she could either hide away, or she could make the best of things. Fiona made the decision not to let her health problems hold her back. She decided to train to be a nurse. Now working as a senior health care assistant Fiona says: 'The patients were too wrapped up in their own problems to bother about me. At least I was doing something worthwhile.' As well as her job, Fiona enjoyed an active social life, often going out with friends. 'Being born with a facial deformity has taught me things in life that I would never have known otherwise. No . matter what anyone else thinks I know I’ve been very lucky.’ One night when out at a nightclub with her cousin she met her future husband Alastair, now 41. 'He recognised me from the local paper and said he thought I was very brave. 'We got on really well but I assumed he was doing it to be kind. After all he could have any girl.' As their relationship developed Alastair told her: ‘You’re strong, caring and better than any of them. Despite what you’ve been through you’re happy and kind.' A fairy tale wedding followed and afterwards they tried for a baby. When nothing happened they turned to IVF which failed. 'We decided to book a holiday in Florida and planned to undergo a second round when we returned. But while swimming with dolphins one kept nudging Fiona’s stomach - and on her return she discovered she was already pregnant. When Evie-May was born (on New Year's Eve) the couple were thrilled. As Evie-May got older she knew Fiona looked different. Fiona would just tell her: 'It's cool to have a mum that's unique,' and Evie would tell her friends the same. Meanwhile after not having surgery for a few years Fiona began suffering from eye infections and cellulitis. Fiona told daughter Evie-May (pictured left)  'It's cool to have a mum that's unique,' and Evie would tell her friends the same . She began undergoing more major surgery during which doctors removed the old silicone prosthesis from her right cheek and rebuilt the area with a rod and soft mesh, in a bid to help reconstruct the area where the tumours had been, leaving a large concave area at the side of her face. In all she had eight more excruciating procedures. '""You look beautiful"" Evie-May would smile when she saw me, even though I was bruised and bandaged.' But finally after a lifetime of surgery and, as she recently celebrated her 40th birthday, she has now vowed enough is enough. ‘A major chapter has come to an end and I’m finally free. I feel fabulous the way I am. ‘There have been incredible highs and lows because of my deformity. Among other things I was presented with a Champion Child Award for triumph over adversity by Princess Di - which I'd never have experienced otherwise. 'Being born with a facial deformity has taught me things in life that I would never have known otherwise. ‘I’ve got a wonderful job, a husband who loves me and a gorgeous daughter. No matter what anyone else thinks I know I’ve been very lucky.’","Fiona Grigg has called an end to a lifetime of surgery on her 40th birthday .

While most soldiers in Afghanistan will spend Christmas Day missing their loved ones, one mother and son will be spending it just a stone's throw from each other in Helmand province. Lance Corporal Sonia Doddrell, 40, and son Mark, who is a private, are not only both serving the same tour in Afghanistan, but work in the same logistics squadron in Camp Bastion. To make matters worse for Private Doddrell, who turns 23 today, his mother was recently promoted so now outranks him. Family: Lance Corporal Sonia Doddrell, 40, with her son Private Mark Doddrell, 23, in Camp Bastion . The pair, from Lancaster, do not work together on a day-to-day basis but are both members of the General Support Squadron, which is part of the Theatre Logistic Group based at Camp Bastion. And despite working at different parts of the huge camp - the UK's main base in Afghanistan - the mother and son will get to wish each other a Merry Christmas in person. Reservist L/Cpl Doddrell, who works for Royal Mail, joined the Territorial Army two-and-a-half years ago, while her son Mark has been a member of the regular army for five years. And they are hoping to meet up, at least briefly, on Wednesday, as all troops in Afghanistan take part in Christmas celebrations. Another bonus for Pte Doddrell is a birthday surprise from his mother, who is delivering a banner, balloons and a birthday cake to him today. Boss: Unfortunately for Private Doddrell, his mother outranks him and can discipline him at home and at work . Fighting family: Private Doddrell was first to join the army while his mother signed up to the TA two years ago . 'I have got a happy birthday banner, . birthday balloons and - if his brother has sent it out on time - a . birthday cake,' she said. 'He's going to kill me, but that's what mothers are for!' The . treat is likely to embarrass the soldier, who is teased for the fact . his mother is in the same squadron, even more than usual. Pte Doddrell, who served in a previous tour in Afghanistan, said his reaction when his mother first told him she was joining up was: 'Is this a joke?' The 23-year-old, who distributes equipment to units in Camp Bastion, added: 'I get a bit of stick but everyone is used to it now - I thought I'd get a bit more stick than I got. His mother, whose job is issuing and bringing ammunition back in to Camp Bastion, said she had wanted to join the forces when she was younger but was not allowed, so when she saw an advertisement for reservists, decided to join up. 'My gran was chuffed for me, so was my grandad. My dad just thought it was a phase I was going through, my two boys just thought I was mad.' Dangerous: The mother and son are based in the UK's Camp Bastion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province . L/Cpl Doddrell, who has not served in Afghanistan before but worked at last year's London 2012 Olympics as part of her work with the TA said it was nice to be able to see her son fairly regularly. 'We meet up in the evenings and have a coffee. I still end up buying the KFC though.' Unusual though the arrangement is. Captain Rhydian Jones, second-in-command of the squadron, said it isn't the first time they had seen relatives working together, but it was his first experience in Afghanistan. The 31-year-old, from York, said: 'We've had it before domestically - in the UK we had a husband and wife in the same squadron, but this is my first experience of it in theatre. 'It's just about being aware of it. I knew with Mark and Sonia it was more that Mark was concerned that the guys would give him stick for it. 'They are in the same squadron, they do similar jobs, but in completely different parts of Bastion. I'm led to believe there's frequent meet-ups though.' He added: 'I think he is a bit more worried now because she can subject him to military discipline as well as domestic discipline.'","Lance Corporal Sonia Doddrell, 40, joined the TA two years ago .

Some 87 per cent of gum-chewing teenagers who suffer regular headaches can cure themselves by giving up chewing gum, new research suggests. Scientists at the Tel Aviv University-affiliated Meir Medical Centre, in Israel, found that most adolescents who give up the habit experience significant relief. The scientists, led by Dr Nathan Watemberg, believe the finding could allow doctors to cure thousands of patients of migraines and tension headaches without the need for additional tests or medication. Up to 87 per cent of teenagers who chew gum and suffer regular headaches could cure themselves by giving up chewing gum, new research suggests . ‘Out of our 30 patients, 26 reported significant improvement and 19 had complete headache resolution,’ said Dr Watemberg. ‘20 of the improved patients later agreed to go back to chewing gum, and all of them reported an immediate relapse of symptoms.’ Headaches are common in childhood and become more common and frequent during adolescence, particularly among girls. Typical triggers are stress, tiredness, lack of sleep, heat, video games, noise, sunlight, smoking, missed meals, and menstruation. But until now there has been little medical research on the relationship between gum chewing and headaches. At Meir Medical Centre's Child Neurology Unit and Child Development Centre, Dr Watemberg noticed that many patients who reported headaches were daily gum chewers. The finding could offer relief to thousands without the need for further tests or medication . Dr Watemberg found that in many cases, when patients stopped chewing gum at his suggestion, they got substantially better. Taking a more statistical approach, he asked 30 patients between six and 19 years old, who had chronic migraine or tension headaches and chewed gum daily, to quit chewing gum for one month. They had chewed gum for at least an hour a day and some had chewed for more than six hours a day. After a month without gum, 19 of the 30 patients reported that their headaches went away entirely and seven reported a decrease in the frequency and intensity of headaches. To test the results, 20 of them agreed to resume gum chewing for two weeks. All of them reported a return of their symptoms within days. Two previous studies linked gum chewing to headaches, but offered different explanations. One study suggested that gum chewing causes stress to the temporomandibular joint, or TMJ - the place where the jaw meets the skull. The other study blamed aspartame, the artificial sweetener used in most popular chewing gums. TMJ dysfunction has been shown to cause headaches, while the evidence is mixed on aspartame. Dr Watemberg favours the TMJ explanation. Gum only has a flavour for a short period of time, suggesting it does not contain much aspartame, he says. If aspartame caused headaches, he reasons, there would be a lot more headaches from diet drinks and artificially sweetened products which also contain it. On the other hand, people chew gum well after the taste is gone, putting a significant burden on the TMJ, which is already the most used joint in the body, he says. ‘Every doctor knows that overuse of the TMJ will cause headaches,’ said Dr Watemberg. ‘I believe this is what's happening when children and teenagers chew gum excessively.’","87% of gum-chewing teenagers who suffer regular headaches could cure themselves by giving up chewing gum, researchers have discovered .

Thousands of Christmas carolers gathered Saturday evening too sing outside the home of a terminally ill Pennsylvania girl. The singers are fulfilling one of 8-year-old Delaney Brown's wishes: a huge holiday sing-along outside her West Reading home. Delaney was diagnosed with a rare of leukaemia in May and given just days to live on Wednesday. Last wish: Thousands gathered Saturday evening outside the West Reading, Pennsylvania home of 8-year-old Delaney Brown, who is dying from a rare form of cancer . 'I can hear you now!!! Love you!': Delaney showed her appreciation for the throng of Christmas well-wishers in a Facebook post on Saturday night as she lay stuck in her bed . Touching: Over 4,000 people said they'd attend Delaney's sing-along and photos show a huge crowd outside the ailing 8-year-old's Pennsylvania home . Saturday’s Christmas miracle came just one day after her eighth birthday, when Delaney fulfilled another wish by speaking with pop superstar Taylor Swift via video chat. On her Team Laney Facebook page, a picture of Delaney giving two thumbs up was accompanied by the text, ‘I can hear you now!!! Love you!’ The heart-warming event was born after Delaney’s family heard her grim prognosis last week, which her mother shared via Facebook. ‘Today we were told the worst news of our lives,’ wrote Delaney’s mom Jennifer Brown. ‘Laney has 70% cancer cells in her blood. If they would treat the cancer the virus that she has would kill her. And if they treat the virus the cancer will kill her.’ Rare: Delaney has a serious and very rare form of childhood leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monosomy 7 . Bucket list: Another wish on Delaney's bucket list was to be a baby sitter, which she got to fulfill last week when a friend of the family brought over their 7-week-old baby for her to watch over, though it left her weak . Brave: The brave little girl has remained upbeat, her parents say, and was even courageous enough to mark off another wish from her list--to pet an alligator . Delaney suffers from a rare form of childhood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7, ‘making her quite rare,’ according to the Facebook page. Just 10 children a year are diagnosed with the illness in America. The sweet but tough little girl, who loves fashion and swimming in the ocean, has now been through five rounds of radiation and a stem cell transplant. Photos of the beautiful gathering, which over 4,000 people indicated on Facebook they’d attend, show throngs of supporters outside Delaney’s home—many in Santa hats and holding candles as they gave the brave girl her Christmas wish. Delaney was diagnosed with leukemia in May and has since undergone five rounds of radiation and a stem cell transplant . Thousands have started to follow Delaney's Facebook page Team Delaney since her diagnosis and her family used it to bring a crowd of carolers to their home on Saturday night . Singer Taylor Swift, who grew up in the neighboring town of  Wyomissing, also helped Delaney knock an item off her bucket list. The Make-A-Wish Foundation helped connect Swift with the Brown family last week when it became clear that Delaney has very little time left. ‘Laney was so nervous to talk to her because she is such a ‘famous celebrity,’ Jennifer Brown wrote on Facebook. ‘I was actually worried that when Taylor Facetimed her that she would be to scared to talk but Taylor was fabulous!! She really engaged Laney in conversation. Laney lit up and had a huge smile on her face. I can't thank Taylor enough.’ 'Prior to her cancer she was a normal kid,' writes Delaney's mother. 'Spent as much time as possible at the pool or in the ocean. She also loved to dance in ballet. She loves animal prints, hot pink, and she has a special eye for fashion!'","Delaney Brown suffers from a rare form of childhood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7 .

Lung cancer cases are on the rise among women, despite a sharp drop for men over the past two decades. One woman was diagnosed for every three men back in 1990. But this has now doubled to two women for every three male cases, the latest figures from the National Cancer Intelligence Network show. Specialists say this reflects the fact many men quit smoking from the 1950s onwards. Lung cancer cases are on the rise among women, despite a sharp drop for men over the past two years . But at the same time, women started to take up the habit in large numbers, often as a way to lose weight, after being targeted by tobacco industry marketing. This means the true lung cancer toll for older women has taken longer to emerge. Despite the rising number of female cases, more people are surviving the disease, particularly women. In 1990, just 17 per cent of patients of both sexes lived for a year after diagnosis. By 2010, this had risen to 29 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women. Although lung cancer is known as a ‘smoker’s disease’, up to one in eight sufferers has never smoked. In the UK, lung cancer is the biggest . cause of cancer death in women claiming around 16,000 lives a year . compared with 12,000 from breast cancer. Dr Mick Peake of the National Cancer Intelligence Network said: ‘This report shows that we are gradually making inroads into improving the survival from this common cancer. The drop in male lung cancer reflects the numbers who quit smoking from the 1950s onwards . 'The improvement in survival in lung . cancer has been dramatic over the last 20 years with almost twice as . many patients alive a year after diagnosis now as was the case in 1990. 'I . think this reflects a combination of the better organisation of cancer . services, the availability of better treatments and earlier diagnosis. 'Our . one-year survival figures show that we are now approaching the outcomes . those of other countries where the survival has historically been . significantly better than in England. 'However, there is much more to be done for lung cancer patients with the majority still dying within a year of diagnosis.' Paula Chadwick, chief executive of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, added: ‘It is vitally important that women become just as aware of the symptoms of lung cancer as they are of breast cancer, as the earlier they are diagnosed the more chance they have of surviving. ‘So, we would urge anyone with a persistent cough or who is feeling tired and breathless to see their GP as it could just save their life.’ Nick Ormiston-Smith, Cancer Research UK's head of statistics, said 'It's great news that lung cancer in men has fallen by more than a third since the early 1990s. 'Trends in lung cancer incidence rates reflect past trends in cigarette smoking - many men quit smoking from the 1950s onwards, so we are now seeing the positive impact of that. 'Unfortunately this smoking fall didn't occur for women until later - after they had become the core targets of the tobacco industry's marketing strategy, so their lung cancer rates are still increasing.' Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England said 'Smoking is one of the main causes of lung cancer, and survival, whilst improving, is very poor. This report shows that less than a third (30 per cent) of people diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 will survive the first year, and whilst we do not know yet how many of these will still be alive at 5 years, it is not likely to be greater than 10 or 11 per cent.'","In 1990, one woman was diagnosed with disease for every three men .

A 77-year-old woman died after doctors misdiagnosed her blood clot as norovirus and sent her home twice, according to her partner. George Andrews, 69, claimed his partner Jean Graham died the night after Glasgow Royal Infirmary sent after she had been admitted for the second time. He said that doctors failed to recognise the clot in her bowel, and said she had nothing but the winter vomiting bug. Misdiagnosed: Jean Graham, who died in January from a blood clot, with her partner George Andrews . The father-of-two said he is seeking compensation for medical negligence after NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde apologised for the incident, which took place in January. On two consecutive weekends, Ms Graham was taken into the hospital's A&E from their home in Dennistoun, Glasgow. Mr Andrews said: 'We put our trust in the NHS and they let us down. No one should go through what happened to Jean. Ms Graham, who had a heart condition, started feeling unwell on the evening of January 5. Delay: Ms Graham had to wait for several hours to be seen each time she was admitted to hospital, her partner said . Mr Andrews, a former engineer, said his partner's condition deteriorated, and when she began to have severe diarrhoea, he had called for an ambulance. Mr Andrews said his partner waited for five hours before seeing a doctor, and says that she was kept on a trolley for all that time. After she was eventually seen, doctors sent her home, but over the next 18 hours her condition continued to worsen. On Sunday afternoon, Mr Andrews said, he phoned NHS 24. He said a GP was sent to their home who insisted that Ms Graham was sent back to hospital after he spotted that she was passing bood. But Mr Andrews claims that she still waited five hours on a trolley to be seen - before being sent home again after a doctor told her to 'go home and take fluids'. The next day, Mr Andrews said, his partner started screaming that she had lost the use of her legs and he had to carry her up to the bathroom. Again they phoned an ambulance, Mr Andrews said. He said: 'This time they agreed it was serious and kept her in - but she was still not put in a ward and ended up in a trolley. 'By the next morning she was scanned and diagnosed with a blood clot on her bowel. By that stage she was too weak to even sign the consent form. 'She never made it out of surgery and died on Tuesday morning. 'They should never have sent her home. We both felt utterly abandoned. 'Now I want justice for Jean. A dog wouldn't have been treated so badly.' Margaret Watt of Scotland's Patient Association said: 'This horrific case shows the dire consequences when our patients are ignored and A&E is stretched to its limit at weekends and Christmas time. Mr Andrews's lawyer Cameron Fyfe said . that Mr Graham was pursuing a claim against the health board and said: . 'There may have been negligence on the part of the hospital in . discharging Jean on the Sunday when it seemed clear to George that she . was seriously ill.' A . spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'We'd like to once . again express our sincere condolences to Mr Andrews for his loss. 'We met with Mr Andrews early this year to discuss his concerns about the care his partner received. Compensation: Mr Andrews said he felt failed by medical services . 'We fully accept that there were lessons to be learned, in particular, the need to improve communication between clinicians in relation to the issue of the patient's previous presentations.' Last Friday new figures showed Scottish hospital staffing levels plunged dramatically at the weekend, prompting calls from Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont for a full-scale review of the numbers of doctors and nurses on call at weekend. The figures showed staffing levels at three of Scotland's 14 health boards drop from 18,000 to just over 5,000 at weekends. Fife had only seven consultants on duty at the weekend compared with 210 from Monday to Friday. Forth Valley had 3,398 staff on weekdays and 1,256 at weekends, and Lothian's weekend workforce was 3,063 compared with 11,200 during the week.","George Andrews said Glasgow Royal Infirmary failed to spot his partner's illness .

Thousands of adults may be needlessly taking tablets for high blood pressure, doctors say. A panel of experts in the U.S. has recommended that adults over 60 should only be prescribed medicine when their blood pressure levels reach 150 over 90 or higher. This is due to the side effects that blood pressure tablets can cause, such as fainting and falls in older people and interaction with other medicines they are taking. Overmedicated? New guidelines suggest that people over 60 should only take blood pressure tablets when their reading is 150/90 . The new guidance was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In it, the doctors stress they are not changing the definition of high blood pressure: 140/90. And people with heart disease, diabetes or chronic kidney disease should aim for a reading of 130/80 or lower. But they do recommend that adults aged 60 and older are given a higher treatment threshold - and only take medicine when their blood pressure levels reach 150 over 90 or higher. Too aggressive blood pressure treatment can cause fainting and falls in older patients, or bad interactions with drugs they're already taking for other illnesses, panel members said. However much of the existing guidance does remain - such as giving younger adults with a reading of 140/90 medication and also those with diabetes or kidney disease. A third of people in the UK and U.S. have high blood pressure - and a third do not realise. It is a major . risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. A high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury (mm Hg).The first figure, the systolic pressure, corresponds to the â€˜surgeâ€™ that occurs with each heart beat. The condition typically has no symptoms, so it goes undetected or untreated in many people. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure . In . developed countries like the UK, the lifetime risk of developing high . blood pressure is now 90 per cent and six million Britons take drugs to . control it - usually for life. People . with hypertension - the medical term - are routinely advised to change . their lifestyle and eat less salt, lose weight, drink less alcohol, eat . more fruit and vegetables and exercise more. The new guidelines were based on a review of the most rigorous kind of medical research - studies in which patients are randomly prescribed drugs or dummy pills - published since the last update in 2003. The research suggests older patients can avoid major health problems like heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease even when their blood pressure is above the current recommended level, the panel said. For many patients, two or three drugs - or more - are needed to bring their blood pressure down. Many older adults could probably reduce their doses, or take fewer drugs, to reach the new, less strict target, said Dr. Paul James, a panel member and family medicine specialist-researcher at the University of Iowa. While the guidelines were updated by a government-appointed panel, they don't yet have the government's endorsement like previous versions. And some doctors fear the experts didn't take into account the effects of under treating high blood pressure in older people. Dr. Curtis Rimmerman, a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, called the guidelines 'exceedingly important' given the prevalence of high blood pressure. The panel added that the guidelines are simply recommendations, and that doctors should make treatment decisions based on patients' individual circumstances.","U.S. experts have recommended that adults over 60 should only be prescribed medicine when .

She has now created a bucket list of all the things she wants to do before she dies - including driving a tractor and trying on a wedding dress . Ms Easton, a hairdresser, went to her doctor after suffering from migraines, which became increasingly severe in February. But it took a few months for doctors to diagnose her condition because it is so rare. They initially thought that Ms Easton had sinus problems but she began to suffer from double vision and started being sick at work. When she was sent to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in July, a scan revealed that she has glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain tumour. She said: 'The doctor told me I had a brain tumour. I actually laughed and said, 'what, you're telling me you've found a brain?"",' said Ms Easton, of Premnay, near Insch, in Aberdeenshire. A week later she underwent nine hours of surgery.

As well as undergoing headshaves to raise money for charity, her friends redecorated Ms Easton’s home while she was in hospital getting treatment. So far she has enjoyed a trip to Liverpool to see Mrs Brown's Boys, the Blackpool illuminations and has had an exclusive behind the scenes tour of Murrayfield stadium. She still wants to drive a tractor, go sledging behind a quad bike and take a trip to County Durham to visit the Beamish Museum, which was one of her favourite childhood attractions.

Shoppers hankering after the latest smartphones, tablets and televisions touting super-sharp displays might want to think about twice before buying into the high resolution trend, after experts said humans are paying for more pixels than they can see. New ‘Ultra HD’ or 4K televisions have four times as many pixels and a higher price tag than an ordinary HD TV, but in many cases, the human eye cannot notice the difference, they said. As manufacturers compete to create products with the highest number of pixels per inch (PPI) they are creating densities that surpass the limits of the human eye. The 'world's first' 84 inch Ultra HD TV, on sale at Peter Jones department store, London. Sych televisions have four times as many pixels than an ordinary HD TV, but in many cases, the human eye cannot notice the difference, experts have said . Raymond Soneira, head of display-testing firm DisplayMate, told NBC News that when it comes to Ultra HD technology ‘a regular human isn’t going to see a difference’. The TVs by Sony and Samsung have a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 – four times that of a standard HD or ‘retina’ television and cost between £1,840 ($3,000) and £15,320 ($25,000), with both companies claiming the sets offer a superior viewing experience. As manufacturers compete to provide the highest number of pixels per inch they are often creating densities that surpass the limits of the human eye . Similarly, the PPIs for some smartphones have also jumped and the HTC One and LG G2, for example, have screens with over 400 PPI. However, Don Hood, a professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University, said: ‘There's going to be some density beyond which you can't do any better because of the limits of your eye.’ He explained that a person’s field of vision usually covers 200 degrees - a little bit more than a semicircle – and if you hold your arm away from your body, your fingernail measures roughly one of those degrees. Now if you imagine your fingernail is covered with 120 alternating stripes, being able to see them is around the limit of the human eye working at its very best. He said that the perceived quality of a screen depends on how far away it is positioned from a viewer, so a difference in resolution for a TV set is not usually noticeable unless it is incredibly large or close to people. Dr Bryan Jones of the University of Utah said he does not see the point of technology with incredible resolutions, while Mr Soneira said there is a bigger case for working on 3D technology than 4K. The new Ultra HD screens have a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 - four times that of a standard HD television and cost between $3,000 and $25,000.

The mobile communications technology race has taken an interesting turn with the release of plans for a smartphone with a dual display. Tech giant Samsung has filed a patent for a phone with two interconnected touchscreens that can display two independent applications, or work together to give the user an enhanced experience in gaming, reading e-books, conference calls, web browsing and multi-tasking. Pictures of the device have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office and show the potential benefits of the technology. Seeing double: Samsung has filed a patent for a phone with dual displays . Samsung's filing contained more than a hundred patent figures broken into distinct categories such as calendars, photo cataloging and many more, reports Patentbolt. The dual displays are connected by a hinge, which allows the as-yet-unnamed device to stand freely, similar to the rigid covers used by tablet owners. This provides exciting gaming opportunities, as users can sit around a table with one screen visible to them and one on display to their opponents. Let's play: The phone offers innovative gaming opportunities as one screen is seen only by the player, while the other is visible to all . In terms of photos, the phone can display an image on one screen and photomanipulation tools on the other, allowing easy retouching. The two screens could also display images and video across both screens for a more immersive experience. The images in the patent filing also show an enhanced conference call function, where the participants' faces are shown at the top of the screen, while other data, such as a business presentation or scientific data, is displayed along the bottom. It also acts as an e-reader, where the user can hold the two screens with text on both displays, a experience more akin to reading an actual book than usually afforded by conventional e-readers . Last month Samsung promised to introduce devices with fully folding displays to the general market in 2015. 1. Front and back touch screen technology . Earlier this month Samsung filed a patent for a phone with a transparent screen with touch screen technology on both the front and back have been revealed in what could be the next step forward in smartphone technology. The plans for the future transparent display that can be controlled by fingertip from both sides of the phone. Pictures of the device have been filed with the U.S. show the potential benefits of the technology, such as the user's finger not obscuring the screen when tapping on apps or dragging items around the screen. 2. Curved screen . The latest version of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone could have a three-sided display, rumours suggest. The new smartphone, which is tipped to launch next year, might sport a wrap-around display so that content on the curved screen can be read from extreme angles. The display is likely to feature on Samsung’s Galaxy S or Note luxury handsets, but it could even be the first of a new line of curvier handsets, according to recent rumours. 3. The budget option . This week Samsung announced yet another handset in its Galaxy range of smartphones aimed at buyers on a budget. The Galaxy Core Advance is a marginally improved version of the Galaxy Core, which the Korean firm launched in June, and the Galaxy Core Plus that launched in Taiwan in October. It has the same 8GB basic storage as the Core, as well as the same camera, but comes with a slightly larger 4.7-inch screen.

In the middle of the Salisbury Plain lies a ghost town, which is out of bounds to the public for most of the year. But at Christmas, St Giles church in the village of Imber opens its doors for a rare Church service, allowing people the chance to access the town that has been Ministry of Defence property for 70 years. On December 21, churchgoers were allowed to see the houses that are now used exclusively for military training during the fifth annual carol service in the 13th-century church. Scroll down for video . Come All Ye Faithful: Some 250 people attended the service at St Giles church on Saturday, taking advantage of the short period that the MoD had declared the village open . Restricted: St Giles in Imber is normally barred from the public for all but a maximum of 50 days a year - and otherwise plays host to Army guns and training exercises . Open days: Members of the public are allowed access to Imber between December 20 and January 6, when Christmas services at St Giles church are held . Some 250 people turned up to the sell-out carol service on Saturday. The Bishop of Salisbury also attended the service in the village, which was chosen as a training ground for its remote location. One week before Christmas 1943, villagers were evacuated and their Wiltshire was requisitioned by the War Office. They were given just under two months to clear out - but were told that they would be allowed to return, amid praise from the Government for the sacrifice they were making. But the war finished and all of the land and property in the village remained in War Office hands. In the 1950s, the War Office - which was to become the Ministry of Defence - took on responsibility for the upkeep and repair of the church itself. Haven: The village is in an explosive 'high impact' area, but that didn't dampen the festive cheer in the church, which included music from the Bratton Silver Band . Merry Christmas: Despite the stark, military location, churchgoers and carol singers at the sold-out service were all smiles outside the 13th-century building . It held that responsibility until 2002, when it was turned over to the Diocese of Salisbury. But . the Army remains in control of the site and restricts access to it, . meaning it is only open for up to 50 days every year for church services . - many around the Christmas period. The entire village is a designated high explosive 'impact area' in the Salisbury Plain military training zone, and the village sits in the middle of it. It is surrounded by a 10ft chain fence, locked gate and 'out of bounds' and 'danger' notices. Pubs and a manor house in the village stand empty and derelict, many of them reduced to concrete shells. Ghost town: Purpose-build MoD houses for training exercises stand alongside the shells of former Imber buildings, and form what has been a ghost town for 70 years . Guns: Old tanks are dotted across the Salisbury Plain and are used as part of the 'scenery' for military exercises around Imber . Drive by: During the rare opening periods, visitors are allowed a glimpse of both a wartime town and given an insight into MoD training in this haunting location, which was originally requisitioned for D-Day landings training . Purpose-built MoD buildings have since been added to the village for training. The . Grade II* listed church with its 15th-century murals is the only . building to have escaped the fate of Imber's other buildings. Imber opens for several services over Christmas, with roads to Imber open between 4pm on December 20 and 8am on January 6 - subject, of course, to 'urgent operational need'. Tickets were required for the carol service due to overwhelming popularity, although the village is still open to other visitors during this period. Tradition: Carols were accompanied by the brass band and by hand-bell ringers as people sang in the centuries-old, unheated church . Cut off: Normal military operations will resume on January 6 and Imber will be closed again - and in the meantime, drivers and churchgoers are warned to stay on the paths for fear of discarded explosives . Historic: The 13th-century church is adorned on the inside with beautiful 15th-century murals and is the only building in the village to be undamaged by guns and time . Sneak peek: The manor house is gated off and abandoned, but can be seen by peering through the bolted metal barriers and gates that surround Imber and many of its buildings . The guns in Imber also fall silent on the feast of St Giles in September every year. The . December 21 service included performances by the Bratton Silver Band . and the Salisbury St Thomas Hand-bell Ringers - and churchgoers were all . given a glass of mulled wine and a mince pie.

The president, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia landed in Honolulu shortly before midnight local time. Their two dogs, Sunny and Bo, joined them aboard Air Force One. Obama has no public events scheduled while he's in Hawaii. On previous trips, he's enjoyed regular rounds of golf, visits to restaurants and family trips to get shave ice, a Hawaiian version of a snow cone. Last year, gridlock in Congress forced Obama to return to Washington the day after Christmas. This year the Obamas are hoping their vacation will go uninterrupted. The president, who was born in Hawaii, is scheduled to be in Honolulu through Jan. 5. Scroll down for video .

'You know, the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Mr Obama told reporters. 'That's how I intend to approach it. I am sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.' This . will be the first family's sixth Christmas in Hawaii since he was . elected president, and in keeping with tradition they are expected to . spend their 17-day vacation in the Oahu neighborhood of Kailua. The . White House announced last week that the Obamas would depart  on December 21, since it was expected to be a light work schedule for the president in . Washington. The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000 . The president and his family traditionally spend their Christmas break in a rented private beach front residence with spectacular ocean views. The Obamas cover the cost of the accommodation that typically costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill which costs in the region of $1 million. For his first three years in office, the Obamas rented a $24,500-per-week gated Plantation Estate, which offered security and privacy on the white sand beach of Kailua Bay. Since then the Obamas have rented a few different houses on Kailuana Place, which has provoked different opinions from those who live in the area. Christmas traditions: The Obama will surely stop by Island Snow in Kailua for some shaved ice, as they did in 2010 (pictured) The Obama's will cover the cost of their accommodation, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill . 'It's exciting. It's really an honor to have him here, and when he's around – actually the place is super safe because we have all this security around,’ Lanette Hayashi, who lives locally, told Hawaii News Now. 'We go through two security points and so the second one, we have to get out of our car.  We have to be searched ourselves, plus our car has to be completely searched,' said a woman called Madeline, who has lived on the street for more than four decades. When the President visits, the canal running through the Kailuana Street neighborhood is off limits and is patrolled by Navy seals and a Coast Guard cutter is positioned in the bay. It is one of the many security measures put in place, including military blockades on the beach and security checkpoints along the street where he stays. Island time: President Obama is pictured with his daughters and other kids as they head down to the beach during their vacation last year . 'I understand he's the President and so he needs his security, but I'd like for him to pick next year another spot. This would be really nice,' said Madeline. 'At first it was exciting, but now it's no longer exciting.  It's maddening.' Last year, Obama was forced to cut short his vacation and fly back to Washington on the day after Christmas to resume negotiations on an emergency budget deal with Congress. This year, Congress is on track to approve a two-year budget deal before the Christmas holiday and so he isn't scheduled to return to Washington D.C. until January 5.","The first family left Washington Friday for their annual Christmas trip to Hawaii .

Former basketball star Dennis Rodman has appealed to fellow veterans to play a match in North Korea for dictator Kim Jong Un saying: 'Don’t be afraid, it’s all love here.' The flamboyant Rodman has admitted struggling to convince former NBA players to travel to Pyongyang to take part in the exhibition match to celebrate Kim’s birthday next month. It comes after the unpredictable dictator executed his once powerful uncle this month. At trials for North Korean players yesterday at the Pyongyang Indoor Gymnasium Rodman said: 'You know, they’re still afraid to come here, but I’m just telling them, you know, don’t be afraid man, it’s all love, it’s all love here.' Scroll down for video . Former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman, seen here returning from his trip to North Korea at Beijing airport today, says he is struggling to bring fellow veterans to the dictatorship for a game . Rodman poses for pictures with North Korean basketball players and government officials during a practice session in Pyongyang. He has tried to reassure other ex-NBA stars . 'I understand what’s going on with the political stuff, and I say, I don’t go into that venture, I’m just doing one thing for these kids here, and for this country, and for my country, and for the world pretty much.' Rodman, who returned from the four-day trip on Monday, said he expects to announce the roster soon. He also said he is planning another game in June. Wearing a pink button-down shirt and puffing on a cigar he watched as a couple dozen local players took to the basketball court for the tryouts. After the session, he told the players that each of the 12 he chooses will get two new pairs of tennis shoes. When asked why he liked basketball, North Korean player Kim Un Chol told Rodman he started playing the game because he was impressed by it on TV, and said he also wants to be good at the sport because it is a favourite of leader Kim and his late father, Kim Jong Il. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hugs former NBA player Dennis Rodman following a basketball game featuring the Harlem Globetrotters . Pressure: Rodman has been told he should ask Kim Jong Un about human rights abuses in North Korea . Rodman asked all the players if they felt the same way. They nodded in unison. 'I want you guys to do one thing for your leader,' Rodman then told them. 'It’s his birthday. It’s a very special, special day for the country.' Rodman and Kim have struck up an unlikely friendship since he travelled to the secretive state for the first time in February with the Harlem Globetrotters for an American television show. He remains the highest-profile American to meet Kim since the leader inherited power from his father in 2011. Known as much for his piercings, tattoos and bad behavior as he was for basketball, Rodman has mostly avoided politics in his dealings with the North and has avoided commenting on the North’s human rights record or its continued detainment of American Kenneth Bae for allegedly committing anti-state crimes. Rodman selected the members of the North Korean team who will play in Pyongyang against visiting NBA stars on January 8 . Rodman stressed that he hopes the game will be friendly, without political or nationalistic overtones. He said the former NBA players will take on the North Koreans in the first half, but the teams will be mixed for the second half. 'It’s not about win or loss. It’s about one thing - unite two countries,' Rodman said. This was Rodman's third trip to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Previously, he spent time dining as a guest of Kim, with whom he says he has a genuine friendship. An entourage of burly men pushed their way through a scrum of journalists waiting for Rodman at Beijing airport today. Rodman answered only a few of the questions thrown at him on the run. Asked whether he was disappointed not to see Kim this time around, Rodman said: 'Nope, I don't worry about it, I will see him again.' Rodman said before leaving he was going to provide North Korea's national basketball team with four days of training during the trip. 'It was awesome, man,' he said of the training he conducted. Rodman's latest visit follows the rare public purge of Kim's powerful uncle Jang Song Thaek, who was executed this month. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has described recent events as a 'reign of terror'. The purging of Jang, considered the second most powerful man in the North, indicated factionalism within the secretive government. Ahead of the trip, Seoul-based North Korean human rights activist Shin Dong-hyuk said in an open letter in the Washington Post that Rodman should talk to Kim about human rights abuses in North Korea. Rodman's latest visit follows the rare public purge of Kim's powerful uncle Jang Song Thaek, who was executed this month . Rodman told Reuters last week it was not his place to talk about such issues. Rodman's first visit in February came shortly after North Korea conducted its third nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions. Rodman said upon his return from that trip that Kim wanted to receive a call from President Barack Obama, an avid basketball fan. The White House has said the United States has direct channels of communication with North Korea and declined to directly respond to Rodman's message that Kim hoped to hear from Obama after his previous visit.","The former basketball star is holding game for Kim Jong Un's birthday .

Nigella Lawson was effectively put on trial without a lawyer, her furious brother claims today. The TV cook was falsely portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics', Dominic Lawson says. The court did not let her present evidence to defend herself, treating her instead as an 'object to be paraded and tormented during ten hours of cross-examination as a key prosecution witness. Bond: Nigella Lawson and brother Dominic Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court, west London . Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Lawson likens her treatment to the burning of heretics in the Spanish Inquisition and warns that the 'vicious' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to British justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence. He says his sister was 'heroic' in the face of such treatment but that the circus surrounding the fraud trial of her former aides has left the public under the impression she was the defendant. Yesterday defence minister Anna Soubry told the BBC it was 'disgraceful' that the allegations and the collapse of Miss Lawson's marriage to advertising guru Charles Saatchi were played out in a courtroom. 'Nigella Lawson quite properly complains that she feels that she's on trial,' said the Tory MP. 'I just find it utterly appalling.' Lawyers for Miss Lawson's former housekeepers Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo questioned the 53-year-old about her drug use in an attempt to show she sanctioned the sisters' £685,000 spending in return for their silence. Miss Lawson admitted taking cocaine seven times. She admitted she had also smoked cannabis during the collapse of her 'doomed' marriage but insisted she was not a long-term or habitual user. She said she had been drug free since leaving the relationship. Sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo, the two former personal assistants cleared of defrauding Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi . Giving evidence at Isleworth Crown Court in West London, Miss Lawson said she had faced 'a long summer of bullying and abuse' which she said had been 'dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi's reputation and savaging mine'. As her two former housekeepers were acquitted of a £685,000 card fraud, Miss Lawson said she had been 'vilified' by the court process despite having done all she could to alert the Crown Prosecution Service to a 'sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation'. She said she had been made to feel she was on trial without any legal protection or representation, adding: 'I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.' 'On trial': Nigella Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in London where she gave evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and Charles Saatchi . Charles Saatchi being protected by security at Isleworth Crown Court . Her brother says she was given no advice or support by the CPS and – as a witness and not a defendant – was not entitled to a lawyer to represent her. Mr Lawson writes: 'I would say that her conduct in the witness box was heroic. It was especially heroic given the way what was meant to be a formal examination of transactions by two employees had turned into a media circus – or rather an auto da fe – with this prosecution witness as the object to be paraded and tormented.' He adds: 'The process of justice is seriously damaged if the system makes testifying intolerable for prosecution witnesses.' Mr Lawson's warning follows several high-profile trials which have raised questions about the treatment of prosecution witnesses, including violinist Frances Andrade who committed suicide after giving evidence against a teacher who sexually abused her as a child. The parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler also faced detailed questions about their private lives from a lawyer representing her killer Levi Bellfield during his trial. Miss Soubry said it was 'disgraceful' that the collapse of a marriage should have played out in a courtroom and took aim at Charles Saatchi, saying the saga began with the 'Throttlegate' photographs of him grabbing Miss Lawson by the throat at a Mayfair restaurant. 'The whole thing is disgraceful. I think we're beginning to lose the plot in this country,' she said. 'This started with an unfortunate divorce. It started with a photograph of her being assaulted by her husband. So out in public was played what should have been a very private and very distressing moment. 'As a result of that they became divorced. These criminal proceedings had already begun, back in 2012.'","Lawson says TV cook was falsely portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed'
