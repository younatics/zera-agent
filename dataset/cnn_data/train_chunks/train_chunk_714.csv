Drunken scenes on the streets of British towns may seem like a distinctly modern phenomenon, but in fact binge-drinking has been a problem for centuries. A new book reveals the extraordinary drinking habits of the Tudor period, when people drank beer for breakfast because it was thought to be healthier than water. Alcohol abuse was so widespread that it prompted the personal intervention of Elizabeth I herself, who issued a ban on a super-strength drink known as 'double double beer'. However, this did not stop her courtiers guzzling an extraordinary amount of ale - in 1593, the royal household got through 600,000 gallons. Binge drinking: A scene from a Tudor tavern, when alcohol abuse was as much of a problem as it is now . Smoking: The introduction of tobacco to England led some to call for a ban on smoking in alehouses . The extraordinary details of how Britain's binge culture has a 500-year pedigree are revealed in Ye Olde Good Inn Guide, which claims to 'contain all the information a Tudor traveller would need to negotiate a 16th-century pub crawl'. The average person seems to have drunk around 17 pints each week - many preferred it to water because it was less likely to carry diseases. In 1552, during the short-lived reign of Edward VI, alehouses were required to have a licence for the first time, owing to 'intolerable hurts and troubles to the common wealth of this realm' which resulted from overconsumption. Drunkards were forced to undergo humiliating punishments such as sitting in the stocks or even wearing a hollowed-out beer barrel. Concerns: Elizabeth I warned against the dangers of super-strength 'double double beer' Ale, made from malted barley and water, was the traditional English drink which had been enjoyed for centuries. However, after fermenting it had to be drunk quickly to stop it going off. Beer was a more recent arrival, having been imported from the continent. The main difference was that it was made with hops, which allowed it to be kept for weeks rather than days. Strong beer was, like now, popular among those who wanted to feel the effects of the alcohol quicker. It was given evocative nicknames such as 'mad dog', 'dagger ale' and 'dragon's milk'. Wine from England was notorious for its poor quality, so those who could afford it drank imported wines from France and Germany. It was often spiced to disguise the fact that it might have gone off. Cider and perry were popular in the West Country, while the Scots enjoyed a dram of whisky. Other spirits such as gin were known but were not generally drunk in Britain. Local officials would keep a keen eye . out for signs of drunkenness - some revellers were punished just for . wetting the bed, on the assumption that they must have been . overindulging. It was not just the lowest social . classes who suffered from the embarrassing fate of being placed in the . stocks for excessive drinking. Thomas . Wolsey, the future Lord Chancellor, was found to be drunk while he was a . junior priest, and was duly punished by the sheriff - though the . powerful cardinal had his revenge years later when he sentenced the same . sheriff to six years in prison. As today, a heavy drinking culture brought a host of other problems in its wake. Gambling was rife in England's pubs - and professional hustlers would swindle tipsy merry-makers by using loaded dice to rig the games. The alehouses of London were frequented by 'great swarms' of prostitutes, according to one Swiss visitor to the city. And Tudor publicans had to wrestle . with an early version of the smoking ban following the introduction of . tobacco, which playwright Ben Jonson said was 'good for nothing but to . choke a man'. Iconic: Shakespeare's Falstaff, shown being played by Kevin Kline, was a notorious drunkard . The reputation of the English for . drinking vast amounts of beer was legendary - an army commander leading . his troops through France noted with astonishment that his men had 'no . beer these last 10 days', which was 'strange for English men to do, with so little grudging'. The alcohol industry created a number . of now obsolete jobs - such as ale-conner, a position held in Stratford . by Shakespeare's father John. The . ale-conner's job was supposedly to test the quality of beer by pouring . it over a bench then sitting in it while wearing leather trousers - if . the trousers stuck, the drink was off. The Bard himself was also a keen toper, according to some stories, and once took part in a drinking contest which was so onerous that he fell asleep under an apple tree. While beer was loved by Elizabethans of all backgrounds, there was a strict social segregation when it came to drinking, with each class having its own preferred haunt. 'Taverns' were more upmarket establishments where the middle class would enjoy bottles of wine, while poorer people were restricted to cheap 'alehouses'. 'Inns' were similar to modern hotels. Ye Olde Good Inn Guide, by James Moore and Paul Nero, is published by The History Press and is out now.

The mother of a man who died in a prison fire after being sent back to Honduras despite receiving a stay of deportation is suing the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for his death. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez, 20, arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum in 2008 to escape gang members who were trying to recruit him. He was ordered deported when he missed a hearing in Immigration Court, but his attorney Joseph Huprich filed an emergency motion and Avila-Lopez was granted an emergency stay of deportation. Happier time: Nelson Avila-Lopez (left) poses with his family in Los Angeles . Two weeks later, Avila-Lopez was in ICE shackles and on his way back to Honduras, where he was arrested without charge and taken to the notorious Comayagua prison, his mother Ana Lopez says. The Courthouse News Service reports that Ana Lopez claims her son was 'thrown, without formal charges, into the notorious Comayagua prison ... where he suffered unspeakable torture for nearly four months alongside the sadistic criminals that he sought to escape.' Avila-Lopez, who was gay, fled to the United States when he was 17 after seeing the Mara 13 gang kill his friend and another man, his mother said. Gang members told authorities Nelson Avila-Lopez was responsible for one of the killings and he feared for his life. The country's intolerance of gay people was another reason Avila-Lopez sought asylum. His mother said Avila-Lopez missed his court hearing because his attorney did not tell him he was due in court. Stay granted: Avila-Lopez was granted this stay of deportation but sent back to Honduras in shackles anyway . After he failed to appear, a judge ordered him deported in March 2010. He was arrested by ICE and put in deportation proceedings, reports the Courthouse News Service. A new attorney applied for the stay of deportation, which was granted. Ana Lopez says ICE knew of the stay of deportation, but on October 2011, her son was deported anyway. 'In the last four months of Nelson's life in this prison, Nelson was brutally tortured, including being held down to be tattooed on each arm - one by the Maras and the other by a rival gang - forever marking him as a traitor for all inmates to see,' Ana Lopez said . 'Nelson, as young but brave as he was, refused to tell his mother the horrible conditions he encountered, but asking for money from her so that he could pay off the gangs so that he could use the prison bathroom.' Horrific death: Family members stand outside Comayagua prison after a massive fire swept through and killed more than 350 inmates including Nelson Avila-Lopez, with many trapped screaming inside their cells . Nelson Avila-Lopez died in the deadliest fire ever to occur in Central America at the Comayagua prison along with 359 others on Valentine's Day 2012. He was just shy of his 21st birthday. His body was so badly burnt that he could only be identified by DNA testing. According to the Courthouse News Service, Ana Lopez is seeking damages for negligence, wrongful death and due process violations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice told the Los Angeles Times in March 2012 that the agency did not receive notice of the court’s stay of deportation until October 20, hours after Avila-Lopez was put on a plane to Honduras. The agency, she said, 'goes to great lengths' to ensure there are no pending court actions a before someone is deported.","Nelson Avila-Lopez, 20, died in a prison fire in Honduras in February 2012 .

The Colorado school that suspended a six-year-old boy after kissing a fellow pupil has decided to allow the youngster back into the classroom. The story of first-grader Hunter Yelton spurred outrage after word spread that his school near Colorado Springs suspended him for the kiss and then proceeded to accuse him of sexually harassing the girl. Canon City Schools Superintendent Robin Gooldy met with Hunter's parents. The superintendent then changed Hunter's disciplinary offense from 'sexual harassment' to 'misconduct.' The little boy has also returned to school at the Lincoln School of Science & Technology. However, the mother of the girl he kissed has said was fully in favor of Hunter being suspended and having 'sexual harassment' listed on his record . Jade Masters-Ownbey said the school district had done a 'great job' protecting her daughter from repeated harassment from Hunter Yelton. She added that Hunter had repeatedly been warned by his teachers before being suspended for two days. Hunter's mother, Jennifer Saunders, had insisted the punishment was too harsh. 'He is six years old, and that is absolutely ridiculous for him to have 'sexual harassment' on his record, even it is [only on the district's] record,' she said. She explained the whole episode stemmed from an innocent crush Hunter had on a girl in the class. He kissed her on the hand during reading group. That landed him a two-day suspension from school and an entry of sexual harassment in his school files. But Ms Masters-Ownbey said the kissing had been 'over and over' and added that she hoped people would not 'start bashing the school that is doing a great job protecting my child from what is sexual harassment'. 'I've had to coach her about what to do when you don't want someone touching you, but they won't stop,' Masters-Ownbey said. School officials had insisted that Hunter had been warned repeatedly and that the punishment was warranted. Lincoln Elementary School Principal Tammy DeWolfe said the school would 'never suspend a student for one minor little violation'. Ms Saunders admitted Hunter had problems at school before, getting suspended for rough-housing and for kissing the same girl on the cheek. No criminal charges have been brought against the boy. Ms Saunders told KRDO earlier that there was nothing unwanted about her son’s playful kiss. Suspended: Six-year-old Hunter Yelton was sent home from school for two days after kissing a girl . ‘She . was fine with it, they are 'boyfriend and girlfriend', she said. 'The . other children saw it and went to the music teacher.' But Ms Masters-Ownbey disagreed and said her son felt like he needed to protect his little sister when they were at school. 'In elementary school, when a boy kisses a girl, the usual response of their peers is 'ewww', she said. 'So . why do the other kids rush to tell? Because they've seen it over and . over, they've seen him repeatedly get in trouble for it, they've seen . the girl repeatedly tell him to stop, they know it's wrong.' Scroll down for video . Over the top: Jennifer Saunders says it is ridiculous that her son has 'sexual harassment' on his school record . School policy: Hunter was suspended for breaking guidelines to prevent harassment . She . told the Canon City Daily Record originally two boys had been harassing . her daughter but when a teacher intervened the other child stopped. Mr .

Clive Goodman told Andy Coulson (pictured today outside court) how the Queen was 'upset' about officers eating the nuts in an email in 2005 . The Queen was 'upset' about police officers eating nuts left out for guests before the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, the trial into alleged phone hacking at the News of the World has heard. She was so 'irritated' by officers eating the snacks she started marking the bowls to see when levels dropped, according to an email sent by Clive Goodman, former royal editor at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid newspaper. A memo was sent to palace officers, telling them to 'keep their sticky fingers out', the Old Bailey heard. In the email to former NotW editor Andy Coulson, which Mr Goodman had copied himself in, he wrote: 'The Queen is furious about police stealing bowls of nuts and nibbles left out for her in the apartments in the BP Queen's corridor. 'She has a very savoury tooth and staff leave out cashews, Bombay mix, almonds, etc. Prob is that police on patrol eat the lot. 'Queen is so narked she started marking the bowls to see when the levels dipped.' He added: 'Memo now gone around to all Palace cops telling them to keep their sticky fingers out.' Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the jury that the Queen was 'upset' about the behaviour of the officers, according to Goodman’s email. 'Apparently they were helping themselves to nuts,' the barrister said. 'They were all being scoffed by police. That irritated Her Majesty apparently.' In the email sent in March 2005, Goodman claimed he knew the printer doing the order of service for the Prince of Wales’s wedding to the Duchess of Cornwall and had a man checking out the wedding invitations, the jury was told. 'Only person to accept so far is Tony Blair,' he wrote. In a separate message in March 2005, Goodman allegedly asked for payment for a phone book from Coulson. The Queen (pictured in October 2013) was 'irritated' by officers eating the snacks, according to an email sent by Clive Goodman, former royal editor at the News of the World . 'One of our Palace police is about to get his hands on the two Royal phone books', he said. 'They are enormously useful, we usually pay £1,000 each for them. They are very rare items.' Rebekah Brooks (pictured today outside court) denies one count of conspiracy to intercept communications, two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office . Goodman then emailed Coulson on May 14, 2005, allegedly telling him the books were now available to be bought, the court heard. 'Very risky document for him to nick', said Goodman. 'Ok to put the credit through?' Mr Edis said: 'Mr Goodman appears to send it again on June 1, 2005, forwarded with a reminder. 'This does get a reply, half an hour later a single word ""fine"".' Coulson is also on trial with news editor Ian Edmondson, 44, former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 45, and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, for phone hacking. Brooks is also accused of corrupt payments to public officials, and then engineering a cover-up with her husband Charlie, 50, former PA Cheryl Carter, 49, and News International head of security Mark Hanna when she was about to be arrested. Brooks, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, Coulson, of Charing, Kent, Edmondson, of Raynes Park, south London, and Kuttner, of Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications. Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Coulson, with Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office. Carter, of Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, and Charles Brooks, of Churchill, Chipping Norton, all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The trial continues.

Edmondson, 44, was accused of conspiring to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 while working at the former tabloid. Mr Justice Saunders told the jury at the Old Bailey today: 'The consensus of opinion of doctors instructed both by the defence and the prosecution is that he is currently unfit.'

He added: 'It is not anticipated that it will be long before he is fit to continue but it will be several weeks and there can be no guarantee that at the end of that period of time he will be fit. 'Bearing in mind the current estimate of the length of this trial, I do not think it is appropriate to adjourn to wait for his recovery and accordingly I shall discharge you from giving a verdict in his case.

Prince Harry has said Walking With The Wounded adventurers trekking to the South Pole 'can’t wait to get to the end' of their challenge. But the 29-year-old, who is taking part in the gruelling charity expedition, described how spirits were really high following the decision to suspend the competitive element of the trek. The Prince was part of a British group racing to the South Pole against teams from the Commonwealth and the US. Trek: Walking with the Wounded will see the participants trek to the South Pole. All 12 injured service personnel from Britain, America, Canada and Australia have overcome life-changing injuries and undertaken challenging training programmes to prepare themselves for the conditions they will face in Antarctica . But the competition was stopped over the weekend after some of the adventurers, who include injured servicemen and women, became very tired after encountering difficult terrain. The three teams have now banded together and Harry said they were now just over three days from their goal. In a voice blog recorded in the frozen waste, he said: 'We are three and a half days from the South Pole. I think it is going to come all pretty quickly to us. We’ve been out here now for about three and half weeks. 'Everyone is in really high spirits. The race obviously got cancelled a couple of days ago - a really good thing that has happened. 'It is nice to see everybody intermingling with each other, not only every night because we camp together, but also during the day.' Looking ahead to reaching their goal, Harry highlighted fellow adventurer Duncan Slater, who lost both his legs when an improvised explosive device blew up in his vehicle in Afghanistan in 2009. 'Easy': Duncan Slater who lost both his legs when an improvised explosive device blew up in his vehicle in Afghanistan in 2009. Prince Harry said he was finding the trek 'a big enough challenge' Preparation: Prince Harry making final preparations ahead of the start of the trek. Prince Harry is part of the British team for the South Pole expedition . He said: 'Everyone just can’t wait to get to the end. I think mixed emotions probably, I think some people, for instance Duncan, double amputee, simply doesn’t find walking to the South Pole a big enough challenge, which is why he really enjoyed the race. 'I think everyone back home will appreciate the fact that just being able to walk 100km (62 miles) in these conditions with no legs is a pretty amazing feat in itself.' In total, 12 injured service personnel who have overcome life-changing injuries are taking part in the expedition organised by the charity Walking With The Wounded. Trekking around nine to 12 miles (15km to 20km) a day, the group have been pulling their 154lb (70kg) sleds, known as pulks, towards the southernmost point on the globe. Speaking about the conditions, Harry said: 'The weather is still holding off, which is really nice - it’s about minus 35C (minus 31F) now and 24-hour sunlight, which is nice in these tents to keep us warm at night.” Difficult conditions but spirits are high: Harry said in video blog 'everyone's spirits are really high' Prince Harry backed organisers who called off the race element of the trek for safety reasons. Harry and his fellow Walking With The Wounded expedition competitors began the race in temperatures of -27:C, with a wind chill dropping it to -35:C - and those conditions have continued. But with the fear that competitors were pushing themselves too hard in the harsh conditions the race element was called off at the weekend. Harry’s team were leading the event which began last Sunday - after it had been shortened by 37 miles because of the weather-inflicted delays. But on the fifth day of the challenge, as the teams arrived at their first checkpoint, it became 'obvious that underneath the concrete determination of all the team members, the harsh reality of the Antarctic was starting to take its toll,' said the organisers in a statement.","Prince Harry said Walking With The Wounded trekkers can't wait to finish .

Cul-de-sacs may not be quite as popular as they once were but people lucky enough to live on one are the happiest people in Britain, a survey has revealed. Neighbours on the dead-end streets are more likely to know eachother's names, enjoy cups of coffee together and lend tools when compared to any other community. The good life found on a cul-de-sac, long considered the epitome of middle class suburban Britain, is so sought after by homebuyers that people will pay up to 20 per cent more just to secure a property, experts say. The good life: Four out of five people living on British cul-de-sacs say they are happy, more than any other type of street . Friendly: Householders living on streets like this one, in Becontree, east London, are more likely to pop next door for a coffee and lend tools, a survey found . A poll by conducted by online community organisation Streetclub and . B&Q found four out of five . people with a house or flat on one say they are happy to . be living there, making them more cheery than people on any other type . of street. That is, of course, as long as they . don't live somewhere like TV's Brookside Close in Liverpool, where . character Trevor Jordache was murdered and buried under the family . home's patio. Despite their high happiness rating in . the survey, the dead-end streets have suffered from negative perceptions because of problems with crime and anti-social behaviour. Yet eighty-eight per cent of people identified homes in such streets as a joyous place to live. Living on a main road scored the lowest happiness rating, of 73 per cent, followed by those around a communal green on 74 per cent. Culture: The cul-de-sac is so entrenched in Britain that life in one was depicted in Brookside, which ran for 21 years until it was axed in 2003 . Versions of the cul-de-sac were first used in ancient Egypt, as archaeologists found up to 15 dead-end streets built for workers constructing the Pyramid of Senusret II at El-Lahun, which went up in 1878BC. The first cul-de-sacs were actually built by the ancient Egyptians, who created rows of the closed-off streets to house workers building the pyramids in around 1900BC. They were also used by the Greeks and Romans, who created them as a way to defend their towns and cities from attack. Thousands of years later the cul-de-sac, which is French for bottom of the bag, became commonplace in Britain. They were banned in the UK until 1875, but a change in the law meant that they became a favoured design for urban planners. Cul-de-sacs became central to the garden city movement in the early 20th century, with the small closed-off streets used across new towns like Welwyn Garden City because it maximised the use of land. The idea spread and they were also built widely across the United States, Canada and Australia. Experts at the time believed they would protect residents from the motor car and also make them happier and healthier because they were away from main roads. They had a cultural impact on Britain shown in AA Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh, which was set on one, and became a symbol of middle class suburbia. After a boom in the inter-war years and then in the 1960s and 1970s, they have become less prevalent in modern developments. Police had admitted they had become hotspots for crime and anti-social behaviour. Despite this a new survey has found that people living on one are happier than any other community, because the small dead-end streets encourage residents to get to know eachother better. They also appeared in Greek and Roman communities, but these were not to foster friendly neighbourhoods, the closed off roads would help form a defence during an invasion. In the modern era, the cul-de-sac was actually banned in Britain until 1875 and first used with regularity in the early twentieth century. Planning pioneers Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker successfully argued that new homes should be built away from the main road on separate small streets, to make life more pleasant for people and also safer for pedestrians. Their idea was included in the Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906, and led to the creation of towns like Welwyn Garden City, which was filled with them because planners said it made the best use of land. After blossoming in the inter-war years and in the 1960s and 1970s, cul-de-sacs suffered a decline in popularity and were identified as hotspots for crime by police and councils. Scientists have also said that people in cul-de-sacs cycle and walk less than those in other streets, as their location, generally away from a main road, encourages people to drive shorter distances. But the survey found that potential homeowners would today still pay a premium of up to 20 per cent to buy a home in a cul-de-sac. Lawrence Hall, of Zoopla.co.uk, said: ‘Many aspirational homeowners have been drawn to the cul-de-sac as these streets often denote exclusivity and provide the opportunity to purchase bigger plots.’ Britain’s most famous cul-de-sac, meaning ‘bottom of a sack’ in French, is Downing Street. Author AA Milne penned children’s classic Winnie-the-Pooh while living in a Chelsea cul-de-sac, while Harry Potter author JK Rowling owns a home on one in Edinburgh. Fictional Cul-de-sacs include Wisteria Lane, home of the Desperate Housewives, Bag End, Bilbo Baggins’ home in the Hobbit and Brookside Close, setting for the discontinued Liverpool soap opera. Celebrities such as Vanessa Feltz have described their liking for the streets, with the presenter once describing their ‘womb-like shape in which all life flourishes’. Peter Frankum, director of master planning and urban design at Savills, said: ‘The cul-de-sac is not dead. ‘There are still some being created. It is just you won’t find a development led by the idea of creating dead-end streets any more.’ Traditional: This cul-de-sac in Reading is one of many built in the past century because urban planners believed they were healthier and safer for residents . Vision: This estate in Nottingham shows how planners wanted safe streets running off main roads, but cul-de-sacs later became problematic for anti-social behaviour and crime . Friendly: Neighbours on cul-de-sacs know each other's names, enjoy cups of coffee together and are more likely to lend tools . The survey found that while cul-de-sacs were the happiest places to live, they were not considered the nicest. The . most popular location for housing was on a country lane, achieving a . rating of 93 per cent.","Survey finds neighbours are more likely to invite you for tea and lend tools .

Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting . 'Our family does not believe the . officer’s report ... For him to confront a police officer would be completely out of his character', parents Mickey and Valerie Redus said yesterday. In the statement, reported in KVUE, the family said: 'We are grieved by the tragic and unnecessary death of our son Cameron.' The Incarnate Word student was in his final year at the San Antonio university and had been celebrating the end of the fall semester with friends when he was shot outside his apartment. Friends and professors of Cameron told his parents 'just how much they admired and respected Cameron and expected him to be a success in life'. Mr and Mrs Redus added: 'We expect all official reports to confirm that Cameron’s death was unnecessary and unjustified.' The family said they knew their son would have been unarmed and added that the police had searched his apartment and cleaned up the scene before they arrived. Investigation: Police say Cameron Redus, 23, was charging at a campus police officer when he was shot . Scuffle: Witnesses heard a short exchange between Cameron and the officer before shots were fired . Police have started an investigation into the shooting but Cameron's family said they questioned the campus officer's decision to follow an unknown person to an off-campus apartment. 'Even if Cameron was driving erratically, . he presented no threat to the campus police officer or anyone else once . he parked his truck,' they said in the statement. In a press conference on Monday, Chief Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department said Cameron had wrestled Captain Carter's baton from him and hit the policeman in the head and arm with it. Captain Carter eventually got the baton back and told Cameron four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot. That's when the student allegedly turned around and charged at Captain Carter with his arm raised to strike, and Captain Carter fired six shots, hitting Cameron five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh. While the camera on the police cruiser . was out, audio was still working which captured Captain Carter warning the student 56 . times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his back and three times that he was under arrest, the police claimed. Alamo Heights Police Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt told KSAT . that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Treehouse apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where . Cameron was a resident. It . is not clear where Captain Carter first tried to pull Cameron over, but both . vehicles pulled into the parking lot . of the Treehouse Apartments where the struggle ensued. Lieutenant Pruitt told My San Antonio that Captain Carter radioed for help shortly before Cameron was shot. Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot . Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer . A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings. 'I . didn't hear him say anything like, ""Get down on your hands and knees,"" you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the . man told KSAT. 'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.' Mohammad Haidarasl lived directly below Cameron at the Treehouse Apartments. He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between the student and Captain Carter. 'I heard [a man] say, ""Oh, you're gonna shoot me?"" like sarcastic almost,' he said. Less . than a minute later, Mr Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only . realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Mr Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.' The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background' according to the university. However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News. Devastated: One of Cameron's brothers, and his father Mickey, at the vigil . Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture . A vigil was held inside the Academic Convocation Center. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color. Redus' brother is seen here . 'He was just not that type of person,' Cameron's friend, 20-year-old Miriam Thomas, told My San Antonio. 'Everyone has been completely heartbroken over this.' More than 200 people - including the student's . mother and father - attended a vigil on Sunday to mourn the UIW student . and remember his short life. Captain Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career. He . rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and . seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his . career. KVUE-TV reports that Captain Carter has told investigators he feared for his life. Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Cameron for three years. 'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said. 'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, another friend, told KENS 5. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr Lou Agnese said. Big turnout: Family and friends of University of the Incarnate Word student Robert Cameron Redus gather for a candlelight vigil and tribute . Moving on: Cameron was due to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May . Old high school friends were also shocked to hear about the shooting. 'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.' Cameron had moved to San Antonio from . Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated . as co-valedictorian. His academic success continued at . UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time . anchor for the school's student newscast. 'I . grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they . are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones.","Mickey and Valerie Redus say inquiry will show shooting was unjustified .

The fired chief of staff for Senator Lamar Alexander has made his first court appearance after being arrested for possession and distribution of child pornography. Ryan Loskarn was in a D.C. court on Thursday and answered softly, 'Yes, sir,' when he was asked whether or not he understood that he was charged with serious offenses. The prosecution argued that the 35-year-old Senate aide was a flight risk and the judge agreed to have him held until his preliminary hearing on Monday. Walking out: Ryan Loskam was arrested for possession of child porn at his Washington, DC home on Wednesday and made his first court appearance on Thursday . Loskarn faces up to 10 years on the possession charge, with no minimum, and five to 25 years on the distribution charge. According to a filing with the U.S. District Court on Thursday, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the day before, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a window. It turned out to a portable hard drive with videos depicting child pornography, according to the filing. Close to his boss: Loskarn has worked as the chief of staff to Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for the past two years (seen together in January) The filing states that in 2010, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company, a majority of whose films feature young nude boys, and found that Loskarn had made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011. Then in October of this year, the filing said, federal investigators identified Loskarn's residential IP address on a peer-to-peer network offering files 'with names that are consistent with child pornography broadcasting as a download candidate.' Loskarn was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander . from Tennessee said in a news release Wednesday he was 'stunned, . surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly . departed staffer. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, another Tennessee Republican for whom Loskarn had . worked as communications director, said she was 'shocked, saddened and . stunned.' Several messages left for Loskarn were not returned. Video . taken by WJLA-TV showed Loskarn being led Wednesday from his southeast . D.C. home by U.S. Postal Inspector police, who put him in a black SUV. Loskarn . appeared to be in handcuffs, although a coat was draped over his arms. A . spokeswoman for the agency said she could not comment on the arrest. Alexander initially placed Loskarn on unpaid leave Wednesday morning, but before the end of the day, he had replaced Loskarn with David Cleary, the senator's legislative director. Under scrutiny: The home, in the Southeast neighborhood of Barney Circle, was swarmed by investigators and police had to use a barreling ram to get in . Alexander said in a statement that it will be up to the courts to judge Loskarn, but 'under these circumstances, he cannot continue to fulfill his duties as chief of staff.' Alexander is a former Tennessee governor who also served education secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. Loskarn had served as Alexander's chief of staff for the past two years. He was first elected to the Senate in 2002. He said his office was fully cooperating with the investigation. Loskarn had a wide range of media . contacts both in Tennessee and Washington dating back to his days as a . spokesman for Blackburn. Stunned and saddened: U.S. Sen.

"PUBLISHED: . 17:09 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 12 December 2013 . Southern California - particularly Los Angeles - is not ready for a major earthquake, which could devastate as many as 10 million people, an expert has warned. Speaking at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, Dr Lucy Jones said when the 'Big One' hits the southern part of state, the damage could be much worse and could endure for much longer than we've previously imagined. Dr Jones, an adviser for risk reduction at the U.S. Geological Survey, warned that electrical fibers and gas pipes cross the San Andreas fault line, while old water pipes would not withstand the impact. Warning: Dr Lucy Jones, speaking at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, warned that Los Angeles is not prepared for a massive earthquake due to its reliance on technology and old water pipes . The sort of earthquake she was referencing only hits once every 150 to 200 years, CBS Los Angeles warned, but it could leave southern California cut off from the rest of the country. In her lecture, entitled 'Imagine America without Los Angeles', she said that when a high-magnitude earthquake rocks . the San Andreas fault, the damage will be much worse than the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which saw collapsed buildings. Whereas that earthquake affected about a half a million people, today, a huge earthquake on the San Andreas fault could affect 10 million . Californians, she said. 'Loss of shelter, loss of schools, loss of jobs and emotional hardship. We are risking the ends of our cities,' she said. Her report pointed out that Los Angeles area supermarkets depend on Internet systems for warehousing and shipping food to stores - but that the food is on the other side of the fault line. Destruction: A freeway shows damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which affected half a million people. Experts said that a massive earthwuake would now affect up to 10 million people . Impact: Experts worry that a major earthquake along the San Andreas fault line sould cut off Los Angeles and much of Southern California from the rest of the country . 'With the development of the Internet and the new just-in-time economy, none of them store food on the Los Angeles side of the San Andreas anymore,' Jones said. 'So this is one more place where the development of the complexity of our modern society is creating new vulnerabilities as we face the big earthquakes.' Similarly, two thirds of the connectivity between L.A. and other cities travels through fiber-optic cables that cross the fault line, meaning that data capacity would be cut off. Damage to technology could put back the recovery effort months after the earthquake, she said. 'The World Wide Web wasn’t in existence at the time of the Northridge earthquake,' she said. 'Right now think of how much both your personal life, but also our economic system, depends on having cell phone communications and internet connectivity.' Cut off: The San Andreas fault line can be seen in relation to San Francisco. Experts said that our reliance on the internet and technology - which would be wiped out - could hinder recovery . Likewise, natural gas pipelines would also be hit, reducing heat and cooking capabilities. The USGS' 'Shakeout Report' predicts that it could take six months for the broken water pipes to be replaced across Southern California following a quake. In the Northridge Earthquake in January 1994, 57 people died and more than 8,700 were injured. Property damage was estimated to reach $20 billion, making it one of the most expensive in history. Its epicenter was the north-central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.

A man was sliced in half by a passing freight train in Des Moines, Iowa, after stabbing the owner of a home he had broken into just minutes earlier. Police say 32-year-old Lopez Christian Webster died a gruesome death Tuesday night after trying to climb between freight cars of a moving train. Des Moines Sgt. Richard Wallace says a witness told officers the man appeared to be running to beat the Union Pacific train before it crossed the 1900 block of East Grand Avenue. Just minutes before the train ran over Webster, someone matching his description entered a nearby home, ordered a man inside to his knees and stabbed him in the arms and neck with a small knife. The intruder then threatened to kill the victim if he moved, snatched something from the home and fled towards the railroad crossing. The train engineer didn't notice Webster. It wasn’t until the locomotive reached Ankeny some 12 miles away that authorities stopped it. Scroll down for video . Fatal decision: Webster attempted to jump between . two cars of a Union Pacific train, similar to the one pictured, and was . sliced in half . Karma: Tragedy struck at the East Grand Avenue railroad crossing in Des Moines just minutes after Webster stabbed a man . According to investigators, at around 9pm Tuesday, Webster, who had had several run-ins with the law in the past, barged into the home of Timothy Kingery on East Walnut Avenue and stabbed him three times before taking off. Two other occupants of the residents told police they ran to another room and locked the door when they heard fighting, according to Des Moines Register. College student Ivan Nery, 18, told WOI-TV that he was sitting in his car near the East Grand Avenue railroad crossing when he spotted a man running beside a Union Pacific train. ‘As soon as it gets faster, this guy suddenly jumped between two cars there,’ Nery said.

Nery witnessed the horrific aftermath, describing how Webster was sliced in half. ‘His body was torn apart,’ a visibly shaken Nery said. Police are not sure whether Webster intended to hitch a ride aboard the train, or simply reach the other side of the tracks. Webster's rap sheet dates back to 2000. His latest arrest took place November 29 on a first-degree theft charge, which was later dismissed.

Most people would probably pay money to keep a pair of old shoes that at one point may have been covered in flu germs as far from them as possible. But if the shoes once belonged to Michael Jordan - and were worn during one of his more legendary games - people are willing to cough up quite a bit of cash to get their hands on a piece of sports history. So is the case  with the shoes Jordan wore during his famous 'Flu Game,' which sold at auction Thursday morning for a record-shattering $104,765. Pricey pair: The shoes Michael Jordan wore during the legendary 'Flu Game' sold at auction for more than $100,000 . Tough: Despite feeling ill, Jordan scored 38 points in the Bulls' Game 5 victory over the Utah Jazz . The pricey kicks were worn by Jordan during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals when the Chicago Bulls took on the Utah Jazz. Despite displaying flu-like symptoms before, throughout and after the game, number 23 scored 38 points in the game. The media later dubbed Jordan's performance as the 'Flu Game.' The shoes were later secured by the Jazz's longtime ball-boy Preston Truman, ESPN.com reports, after Truman and Jordan developed a relationship that began when Truman brought Jordan his traditional pre-game applesauce during the 1996-97 season. Authentic: Jordan signs the shoes for Jazz ball-boy Preston Truman, who brought the shoes to auction . Truman brought the shoes to auction, where an unknown collector made the record-setting purchase. The previous record auction price for a pair of shoes happened last month, when a collector paid $31,070 for another pair of Jordan's shoes. That pair was worn during his rookie season with the Bulls. Before the 'Flue Game,' Truman brought Jordan his traditional applesauce. When the game was over, and Jordan's performance had helped give the Bulls a 3-2 lead over the Jazz, Jordan gave Truman the shoes. In addition to the shoes, Truman got a photo of Jordan signing the shoes for him the night of the game, which helped authenticate the shoes as actually being the ones that Jordan wore. Champs: The Bulls went on to win the 1997 NBA Finals 4 games to 2 against the Utah Jazz . 'I think my photo that Jordan's bodyguard took with me standing there . drove up the price because buyers didn't have to worry if they were . real,' Truman told ESPN.com. Bidding for the shoes started at $5,000 last month. It took only 15 bids to get the price over the $100,000 mark. The identity of the winning bidder currently is unknown.","The shoes were given to the ball-boy after the famous game .

The wife and daughter of a Chicago lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide after winning $425,000 in Illinois have settled his estate.. Urooj Khan, 46, died in July 2012, days before he was to collect his in winnings. His brother raised suspicions that prompted authorities to exhume Khan's body to gather evidence in case prosecutors decide to file charges. Khan died without a will, leading to a court battle - his widow, Shabana Ansari, 32, hired an attorney and will receive one-third of the winnings, their house and business. Urooj Khan, 46, posed with a winning $1 million instant lottery ticket just one day before he died in July 2012 . Urooj Khan's widow Shabana Ansari (pictured) will receive one-third of the $425,000 and his daughter from another marriage will receive two-thirdsUrooj Khan's wife, Shabana Ansari . Khan's daughter from another marriage, Jasmeen, 17, will get two-thirds the lottery proceeds and some investments. The . settlement approved yesterday also prevents either party from filing a . wrongful death lawsuit against the other unless new evidence surfaces in . a criminal investigation. In March 2013 the coroner investigating the cyanide death revealed he couldn't say if his final meal killed him. Stephen . Cina, the chief medical examiner of Cook County in Chicago, said that . an autopsy revealed no trace of the poison whatsoever in the body of . Urooj Khan, including his stomach. Dr Cina said that too much time had passed and the body was so decomposed that any cyanide would have evaporated by now. At a press conference Dr Cina also revealed that Urooj had a blockage in one of his arteries that ‘wouldn’t have helped’ but said that it was the poison that ultimately killed him. Family: Mr Khan's sister won custody of Urooj's 17-year-old daughter Jasmeen, center, even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, left, most of her life . Testing: The body of Urooj Khan is seen carried to a hearse for a forensic autopsy on January 18, 2012 . Urooj’s widow is said to have served . Urooj his last meal of a traditional Indian Kofta curry just hours . before he collapsed at their Chicago home. He would have died an agonising, horrific death as the cyanide suffocated him cell by cell. Urooj, who ran a successful dry cleaning . business, died on July 20 last year, the day after he collected the . oversized cheque from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven . where he bought the winning scratchcard. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum. His initial toxicology tests did not find anything suspicious and it was not until a relative asked the Cook County Medical Examiner to take another look that the cyanide was found and the death was ruled a homicide. His body was exhumed but in a press conference Dr Cina said that the results were not conclusive. He said that a ‘lethal’ level of cyanide was detected in a sample taken from Urooj’s body on July 21, the day after his death. However, when tests were carried out on the body which was exhumed in January, ‘no cyanide was detected in the tissues or the small amount of gastric contents’. Wife: The wife of Mr Khan, Shabana Ansari seen here, tried to cash the winning lottery check in the immediate days following his unexpected death according to family . Tragic end: The family lived in this Chicago-area home where he painfully died hours after taking his last meal . This is because cyanide has a short half-life and would naturally have evaporated out of the body, he said. Dr Cina said: We couldn’t detect cyanide. That doesn’t mean that it wasn’t present at some point.’ He added that ‘the route of administration could not be confirmed’, which means that it will likely never be known whether Urooj ingested or inhaled the poison or if it was injected into him. There was also ‘severe, about 75 per cent blockage of one of the major coronary arteries’ which made Urooj ‘particularly susceptible to this type of toxin’. The cause of death however was still cyanide poisoning and it is still being treated as a homicide, he added. Urooj’s death has united his family against Shabana, who they make no secret of blaming for his untimely demise. His brother ImTiaz Khan has alleged in probate documents that Shabana attempted to claim the windfall ‘shortly’ after he died but for some reason was unable to. His sister Meraj Khan successfully won custody of Urooj’s 17-year-old daughter Jasmeen even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, her stepmother, most of her life. In another twist, the Chicago Tribune has reported that Fareedun owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes because of a small business he owned that appears to have failed.","Urooj Khan's widow Shabana Ansari will receive one third of the lottery winnings, their house and business .

A teacher jailed for two years for having sex with a student, 16, has been granted permission to spend Christmas with her daughter before starting her sentence. Julie Hautzenroeder, 37, of Loveland had been a Colerain High science teacher for 10 years. She was sentenced on Wednesday, but will not start her sentence until January 13th. Earlier this year she admitted to exchanging . inappropriate texts with a teen. But a police investigation revealed . that she had one of her friends drive two 16-year-old Colerain sophomore . boys to her home. The teens testified she gave them alcohol and . marijuana and had sex with them. A jury last month convicted . Hautzenroeder of one count of sexual battery but ruled she was not . guilty on the other. She faced a maximum prison sentence of five years. 'She is in a position of authority and trust, which was violated,' Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Norbert Nadel said. 'Parents do not send their kids to school to engage in this type of behavior with the teachers,' he said reported USA Today. Hautzenroeder, a single parent, had begged the judge not to send her to prison because it would hurt her daughter. 'I ask you, not for me but for my daughter who I have been the only parent to for her entire life, please please ... I can't stand her not to be able to have the Christmas she's relied on her entire life.' WPCO reported that in closing arguments, prosecutor Josh Burkowitz said Hautzenroeder’s alleged sex acts with the two teens were intentional and not some accident. He said text messages between her and one student that referred to a sex act were incredibly incriminating. But the biology teacher's lawyer, Stewart Mathews, argued Hautzenroeder had made serious lapses in judgment by inviting the teens to her Loveland condo, but claimed the teenagers were drug users and liars. Hautzenroeder said she 'never had sex with teens' and told them to sleep on the couch. She claimed that one of them climbed on top of her during the night. She also denied giving alcohol and claimed they brought the marijuana. Hautzenroeder will also have to register as a sex offender for life - that means she will have to report to the sheriff's office every 90 days.","Julie Hautzenroeder, 37, of Loveland had been teacher for 10 years .

The success of Taco Bell's Dorito Loco taco shell has the snack food's owner Pepsico scrambling to find new ways to use its cheese dust. PepsiCo, which owns Cheetos, Fritos, Tostitos and other snacks, found huge success last year after teaming up with Taco Bell to create Dorito-flavored taco shells, sales of which topped $1 billion in October. Since the enormous boon, Pepsico has been eager to dream up other restaurant dishes featuring the popular snack. The new salt? The unparalleled success of the Taco Bell/Doritos mash-up has Doritos parent company Pepsico scrambling to figure out how to get the addicting flavor dust onto more and more new products . The company announced Thursday that it struck a deal to serve its drinks at Buffalo Wild Wings, snatching a significant client from beverage rival Coca-Cola Co. PepsiCo also said it would work with the sports-centric chain to create 'unique menu offerings.' During a trip to PepsiCo's food innovation lab, Buffalo Wild Wings CEO Sally Smith said in an interview that she was shown several dishes that might be a hit with the chain's customers. The company envisions Doritos as a cheesy topping for deep fried, saucy wings or tenders or even on a side of fried potatoes. Irresistible: Customers lined up in droves for the cheesy-shelled taco. Sales of the Doritos Locos tacos topped a previously unimaginable $1 billion . Smith said she was shown ideas for salad dressings and sandwich and chicken wing sauces that incorporate PepsiCo's colas, including Mountain Dew. 'I don't think it will be in the next 12 months, but we'll possibly start testing after a year or 18 months,' she said, noting that considerable research and planning would be needed to bring the offerings to the company's more than 975 U.S. locations. PepsiCo clearly sees the idea of incorporating its snacks into menus as a major opportunity. Pizza Hut, for instance, has also looked at ways to team up with Frito-Lay snacks, according to a representative. Pizza Hut is owned by Yum Brands, which is also the parent company of Taco Bell and KFC. Countless possibilities: Pepsico announced Thursday a partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant will now serve Pepsi beverages and says there are other Doritos-based down the pipeline, such as buffalo chicken wings topped with Doritos chips .

The FDNY has sent a demand for payment to an 'unknown Asian' for $784 after taking a young woman to hospital in an ambulance. The bill arrived on Tuesday at The New School building in Manhattan with the title 'Unknown Asian' based on patient information filled out by a responding EMS team. The official bill from the FDNY - who charge for ambulances - lists a female patient being taken from a supermarket in the West Village to Beth Israel Medical Center on November 1. The FDNY sent a bill for $784 to an 'Unknown Asian' after they took a female student to hospital in an ambulance last month in Manhattan after finding her 'intoxicated' Christine Ahn, 29, associate director of academic communications, who looked over the bill at the dean’s office in Parsons The New School for Design, told the New York Post: 'I hesitated to open it but then I was like, ''Well, I could be an unknown Asian.''' Dean's assistant Chris Rivera said that he thought the official letter was racist. He added: 'There must be ''unknown Hispanic'' or ''unknown African-American'' bills out there.' The bill was issued after an EMS team picked up a young woman around 3am last month for a 'drug or intoxication' issue. The person who accompanied the patient said that she lived in the New School dorm but could not provide a name. FDNY spokesman Jim Long told MailOnline today that when EMTs deal with patients in the field who have no identification, they often have to use basic descriptions to fill out paperwork. In this case, the emergency workers filled out the name as 'unknown' and the identifying characteristics as 'Asian' and 'female'. The form was the basis for a computer-generated FDNY bill. Mr Long said: 'Unfortunately it didn't translate well from the EMT report on to paperwork. At no time was there any discrimination against any ethnic group.' The FDNY spokesman also said that The New School may want to look at its policy for dealing with students in its care. The fire department has spoken to the vending company which processes the bills so that paperwork will no longer be sent out when a name box contains 'unknown'. Staff at The New School were baffled as to how they should contact the 'Unknown Asian' listed as the recipient of the FDNY bill .","Bill arrived on Tuesday at The New .

A San Diego lawyer representing a second city employee to come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against former Mayor Bob Filner has released an unsettling computer animation showing the politician putting the woman in a headlock. Attorney Daniel Gilleon said he plans to introduce the two-minute computer-generated clip as evidence in a lawsuit filed by his client Stacey McKenzie. According to Gilleon, the cartoon accurately depicts his client's bizarre encounter with then-Mayor Filner at the Clairmont Day as the Bay event April 21. Scroll down for video . Cartoon: Attorney Daniel Gilleon produced this 2-minute computer-generated clip reenacting an encounter that took place between his client Stacey McKenzie (left) and former San Diego Mayor Bob Filner (right) Hands-on mayor: In the clip, Filner's character asks McKenzie if she has a significant other, and upon learning that she's single, he asks her out on a lunch date and grabs her wrists . The news comes a day after Filner was sentenced to home confinement for the unwanted groping of women. The animation begins with Miss McKenzie, 50, a long-time manager in the Park and Recreation Department, introducing herself to Filner. After thanking her for her 32 years of service, the 71-year-old mayor asks McKenzie her if she has a husband or boyfriend. The woman indicates that she is not in a relationship. In response, the mayor asks McKenzie for her business card, saying that he would like to take her out to lunch. ‘Just to make this clear, this is not a business lunch. This is a date. I’m asking you out on a date,’ the animated Filner says with a smile as he grabs McKenzie’s wrists. Beeline: This graphic in the video shows Filner following McKenzie across the park after their conversation .

The 6-year-old boy at the center of an international custody battle may soon be on his way back to the United States to live with his mother. Jack Redmond, 6, went to live with his father Derek Redmond in Ireland nearly a year and a half ago after a court there ordered that his parents split custody in the country. But mother Mary Redmond was forced to stay behind in the States since she violated the Irish courts original order to bring the child to Ireland and faced jail time for being in contempt of court. At first, the U.S. court system ruled that Miss Redmond abide by the Irish decision, but on Wednesday overruled that and ordered Jack back to the states to live with his mother - for the time being. Homeward bound: Jack Redmond, 6, may soon be on his way back to the United States after a federal judge ruled that he should live with his mother in Illinois, instead of his father in Ireland . Joint custody: Jack's parents were never married, but his father Derek Redmond (left) filed for joint custody after they split. A court in Ireland originally ruled that the two should split custody there . Miss Redmond told the Chicago Tribune she cannot wait to get Jack 'back in my arms again' after their year and a half apart. Miss . Redmond, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Orland Park, was told by . U.S. State Department officials that the judge's order would be . 'immediately enforceable' and that they are working to expedite a U.S. passport for Jack. She spoke to her son on Wednesday, the day the decision was made public, but hasn't told him about the good news yet. 'I wanted to say something, but he's only 6,' she said. 'A few days feels like an eternity to him.' Forced to stay behind: Mary Redmond wasn't able to join her son in Ireland, since she would have been arrested for being in contempt of court . Jack was born in Illinois, but moved with his parents to Ireland when he was just 11 days old - making him a dual citizen and subject to Irish laws. Though his parents never married, Derek Redmond filed for joint custody after their split. Jack boarded a flight form O'Hare Airport to Ireland on July 10, after spending the day saying good bye to his mother - neither knowing when they were going to see each other again. Up until then, Jack had spent most of his life living with his mother in the United States. 'I'm shattered. I'm shattered. This is our home, and I don't want him to go,' Miss Redmond told CBS Chicago. Leaving home: Jack had spent most of his life living with his mother in Orland Park, Chicago, but was forced to board a plane to Ireland to live with his father in July 2012 . Miss Redmond became embroiled in the legal battle when she decided to leave her boyfriend, whom she described as mentally and physically abusive. When Derek Redmond filed for joint custody of his son, Miss Redmond had initially accepted the Irish’s court ruling, but instead brought her son back to the U.S. However, the judge’s order was for Mary Redmond to settle her affairs in Illinois and return to Ireland to live in the tiny village of Ballymurphy, and have her son attend a two-room schoolhouse. Under the ruling, the custodial parent would change nightly. In other words, Jack was supposed to live with his mother one night, his father the next. Because Miss Redmond defied the judge’s order by refusing to return to Ireland with her son, she was held in contempt, which means that Miss Redmond can be arrested the moment she sets foot on Irish soil. Heartbreaking: Jack's grandmother, Peggy Redmond (right), accompanied Jack to Ireland instead of her daughter, who would have been arrested for being in contempt of court . That is why Jack’s grandmother, Peggy Redmond, accompanied him to Ireland instead. Mary Redmond tearfully said she told her son, ‘He has to go to Ireland for a while. Grandma will be with him, and I told him if things don’t work out, I’m just going to have to go over there. I can’t be away from him.’ Derek Redmond’s attorney, David Schaffer, said that Mary Redmond brought this on herself by unlawfully keeping the child in the U.S. ‘He is so loved and so taken care of, and he belongs home in America, and I don't know why America isn't keeping him home,’ Peggy Redmond told NBC Chicago, before taking Jack - dressed in an American flag t-shirt and hat - through security.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for December 20. If convicted, the 27-year-old Hatboro resident could face up to 40 years in prison. It has taken prosecutors more than two months to charge Stevenson because they were waiting for autopsy and toxicology results, which determined that Cron died from 'an adverse reaction to heroin.' Philly.com reported that on the afternoon of September 29, Miss Stevenson called 911 to report that her boyfriend was 'blue in the lips, cold to the touch and not breathing,' according to the District Attorney's Office. Paramedics who arrived on the scene in the 100 block of North York Road just after 12pm pronounced 19-year-old Brandon Cron dead. Officers then discovered a pair of syringes and wax paper bags often used to package heroin stamped with 'I'ma Boss' and 'Primetime' in a trash can outside Stevenson's apartment. An investigation has revealed that Stevenson allegedly gave her boyfriend heroin on the eve of his passing, and then tried to get rid of the evidence before police arrived. During questioning, Stevenson told . detectives that Cron had last used heroin September 27 and that she last . saw him alive on the night of September 28. When . she discovered the following morning that he was unresponsive, . according to Montgomery News, the 27-year-old attempted to revive him by performing . CPR and placed a wet towel on his face. Futile efforts: Stevenson told police that when she discovered Cron unresponsive, she attempted to perform CPR on him a placed a wet towel on his face before calling 911 . The woman said she was a heroin addict, but told police that she had been clean for six months.

Suspect: Justin DeRyke, 22, was arrested after the body of his niece, Willow Long, was found near a river bed in Watson, Illinois . An Illinois man charged with murder in the death of his 7-year-old niece has told police that the girl impaled herself on a brush stick and he slit her throat to end her suffering. Justin DeRyke, 22, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the slaying of Willow Long in Watson Saturday night. When questioned by police, Mr DeRyke detailed how he had spent most of the evening Saturday  playing video games while babysitting Willow and her 3-year-old brother. The children’s mother was at a local bar, while their grandparents were at work at the time. At around 10.30pm, the 22-year-old . caretaker went into his bedroom to watch a pornographic video, the station Fox4KC reported. When he came out . of the bathroom half an hour later, DeRyke said Willow approached him and grabbed his hand to get him to watch a movie, inadvertently scratching him. The uncle grew mad and yelled at his niece, who ran out of the house, and according to DeRyke, tripped and fell on a pile of sharp brush sticks, one of which stabbed her in the neck. DeRyke told investigators that he saw his niece twitching and did not want her to suffer, so he grabbed a knife from his room, slit the child's throat and then stabbed her in the heart about five times to 'put her out of her misery.' According to court documents, DeRyke packaged Willow's body in several plastic bags secured with duct tape, and then disposed of her in a rural area south of Watson. The remains were discovered by volunteers Monday. However, an autopsy showed that besides injuries to her throat, collarbone and chest, Willow also suffered defensive wounds to her hands, suggesting that she had fought for her life.

Innocent: According to DeRyke, he became angry with Willow and yelled at her after she had scratched him while tugging on his hand . The 22-year-old murder suspect remains jailed on $5million bail. He is due back in court September 19. On Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Service took Willow's 3-year-old brother into protective custody. Funeral services for Willow will be held at 11am next Monday at First Baptist Church in Effingham, followed by private burial. The little girl attended Southside Grade School in Effingham, where she had just begun her second grade year. Willow's grandfather, Dale DeRyke, who is also the father of the alleged killer, said his son panicked after what he claimed was an accident. Dale DeRyke told Fox2Now Justin was babysitting the little girl on Saturday night. He said the two were playing when Willow ran outside, where a pile of sticks was scattered over the floor. 'A stick went through her and through her head,' he said. Heartbreak: The search for Willow Long ended in agony when her body was found on Monday evening . Search: A volunteer speaks to residents as she passes out fliers with the photo of 7-year-old Willow Long . 'She was laying there twitching and dying.' Mr DeRyke then claimed his son got scared and hid the body. Now he says his son has 'nothing but remorse,' for what he has done. ‘He's . thinking, “Oh my God, I killed her or she's died. They are going to . blame me,""’ Dale DeRyke, a truck driver, told St. Louis' KSDK-TV. ‘He's . not thinking correctly ... He tries to hide her. He's scared.’ Four . of the hundreds of searchers who scoured farm fields, sheds and other . rural structures in the area over a 30-hour span discovered Willow's . body Monday night. They . found it a few miles from her family's home, wrapped in several garbage . bags and sealed with duct tape. DeRyke was arrested the next morning. Effingham . County State's Attorney Bryan Kibler said in court Wednesday that . Justin DeRyke drew suspicion during questioning by Illinois State . Police. The prosecutor also . pointed out that DeRyke went to his restaurant job Sunday in Effingham . instead of helping search for his niece. A neighbor told the station KMOV that he saw DeRyke drinking beer instead of joining the search party looking for his niece.

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 12 December 2013 . A former New Jersey Transit police officer who retired five years ago on a $2 million disability pension after accidentally firing a staple in his finger has been filmed using a gun at a shooting range. Christoper Onesti, 34, admits that the state's retirement system is 'absurd' but claims the video does not show his claim was fraudulent as he was using the hand that was not injured. Despite his apparent good health, he collects $45,936.24 a year tax-free from an accidental-disability pension. If he lives to 80, this will total at a $2 million cost to the taxpayer. In 2006, he was stapling a target during a training session and accidentally shot the ring finger on his left hand, which is not the hand he shoots with. Caught: Chris Onesti is pictured shooting at a driving range five years after he started receiving disability pension. He accidentally shot his hand with a staple gun and doctors said he was unable to return to work . Having fun: Onesti, who said the video only shows him shooting with his strong hand, said he knows it looks ridiculous but that he has done everything within New Jersey's law . He removed the staple, put on a bandage and continued the practice - but the following day he woke up with a swollen finger and filed an accident report. Doctors concluded that he would not be able to apprehend or arrest a suspect or reliably shoot a weapon with the damaged hand, and recommended he be paid a disability pension. Onesti, who was just 29 at the time, claims he asked to be switched to a desk job but he said officials told him he was not allowed to work with the police at all. 'My career was taken away from me without any choice on my part,' he told the New Jersey Star-Ledger. 'I was an unwilling participant in all this drama.' Onesti . said he was initially approved for an ordinary pension, but in the wake . of a Supreme Court ruling, his lawyer told him he was eligible for accidental lifetime pension. 'I wasn’t the person who pushed the envelope,' he said. 'The only decision I made was to say, ""Okay, I will take that"".' NJ . Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder would not comment on Onesti's claim that he was told he could not work in any department. She . told the Star-Ledger that 'our outside insurance doctors reviewed and processed Mr. Onesti's . workman's comp claim,' but the decision was 'made . exclusively' by the pension board. Despite the ruling, Onesti, who has now moved states to near Philadelphia, continues to shoot and visits ranges a few times a year - and he said he understands why that would annoy people. 'It absolutely looks absurd,' Onesti said. 'But it's because the system is absurd.' His hobby emerged when the website New . Jersey Watchdog and NBC4 ran reports about a video Onesti had posted on . his Facebook page showing him firing the Austrian sniper rifle. Battle: Onesti says he told the New Jersey Transit that he wanted to work a desk job but they refused . Disabled: He accidentally shot a staple into his left hand's ring finger in 2006 and it became swollen. He said he does not think he'd be able to shoot with it - although he would shoot with his right hand anyway . He is seen gripping the gun and using his right hand - the stronger one. He then grins at the camera. His . left hand shows no visible signs of damage but he said it is weaker and that . he does not believe he could put handcuffs on someone. Onesti, who now works for a loss-management company, pointed out that he does not use his weakened hand at all in the video. 'I can honestly tell you: I followed the law,' he said. 'If people are upset about it, hang out outside the New Jersey Supreme Court. Don’t hang out outside my house.' John Sierchio, a member of the New Jersey Police and Firemen's Retirement System pension board, agreed that Onesti had done nothing wrong and was simply playing with the system. Following the rules: Members of the pension board for the New Jersey Transit Police (file pictured) said that more claims have been granted since they were told to consider injuries from slips and falls . He added that New Jersey has seen a increase in the number of accidental pensions after the state Supreme Court in 2007 and 2008 expanded the types of injuries that qualify. It now includes mental illness to injuries sustained from slips and falls. 'This has to be the most expensive staple in the history of New Jersey,' Mark Lagerkvist from New Jersey Watchdog told NBC 4 . 'The . problem with the system is that it doesn't differentiate between the . guy who puts a staple in this hand and an officer who was shot in the . line of duty and is in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.'","Christopher Onesti, now 34, admits that the 'system is absurd'

A Massachusetts woman is in trouble after she allegedly tried to stop hunting near her house with an air horn. Julie Carreiro lives near a pond where she says hunters have been trying to shoot local water fowl at early hours in the morning. Her family were aggravated about being woken up by the sound of gunshot blasts from duck hunters at a nearby pond. Hunted: Julie Carreiro is in trouble after she allegedly tried to stop hunting with an air horn. The gunshots were so loud they scared so used an air horn to scare the ducks away . She said the gunshots were so loud they scared her, that’s when hunters say she got the air horn to try and scare off the birds so there would be nothing to shoot. Ms. Carreiro, who has lived in a house in Marshfield,  since 1964, told The Boston Globe that hunting had never been a problem at the Hoyt Hall Preserve until a year ago. Hunting is not permitted on the area's pond and marshland, but there were never any tree postings warning hunters about the rule. 'The noise just wouldn't end,' Carreiro told The Globe. 'At one point, they weren't hunting, they were just shooting for no reason except to make noise and make it clear they weren’t leaving.' Clearly signed: Julie Carreiro lives near a pond where she says hunters have been trying to shoot local water fowl at early hours in the morning . Last year, Carreiro said her family was woken up by the sound of gun blasts and yelled to the hunters to find a new pond. 'There were some threats that were made and it’s alleged that the family had used an air horn potentially to scare off some of the water fowl that were in the area,' Marshfield Police Chief Phil Tavares said. Carreiro said she didn’t use the air horn, but that she didn’t want the hunters in the area. She said her family is not opposed to hunting, but they are opposed to 'being woken up with gunfire raining down on us.' Bang bang! The Carreiro family were aggravated about being woken up by the sound of gunshot blasts from duck hunters at a nearby pond . A state official said an individual could be charged with hunter harassment if they interfere with someone’s legal right to hunt and police are now investigating whether there is probable cause to charge her. The hunters are also being looked at. They could be charged with disturbing the peace for hunting too early and in an area where they technically weren’t allowed to hunt. 'There’s a little bit of a loophole with the law that it’s not posted no hunting. So if it’s not posted no hunting it’s not enforceable,' Tavares said. Police are also considering charges against the hunters for disturbing the peace. Signs have since been posted around the pond and the hunter said he will not be returning there to hunt. Duck hunt: The ducks are welcome now that there's no hunting in Mrs Carreiro's neighborhood, at least they'll be safe .","Carreiro family were woken up by the sound of gun shots from duck hunters .

A 50-year-old father who let his son's friends party at their Connecticut property has been charged with reckless endangerment after a teenager died in a car crash as she made her way home. Paige Houston, 17, died after the pick up truck she was a passenger in crashed as a group of teenagers left a party on August 6. Paul Sibiga appeared in court today after police claimed he had let minors gather in woodland at his home and drink alcohol. Court date: Paul Sibiga, right, has been charged with 28 counts of reckless endangerment and 28 counts of letting minors drink . Teenagers regularly gathered in the family's woodland, where they would have a campfire and drink, it has been claimed. According to an arrest warrant, seen by the Hartford Courant, those who attended the parties had to leave their car keys at Mr Sibiga's house and stay over if they planned to drink. 'Anyone who was . drinking at the property was not allowed to drive home and either camped . out at the White House or in the basement of the Sibiga house,' the warrant said. However, on August 6 a 17-year-old, who was over the drink-drive limit, lost control of his pick up truck and hit a tree. Paige, a cheerleader and honors student, was thrown from the backseat and died of her injuries. Two other teenagers in the car fled the scene and were later found by police in the Sibiga woodland. Loss: Paul Sibiga is facing charges after Paige Houston, right, died in a car crash as she left his son's party . Fatal: Paige died after the 17-year-old driver of the pick up truck she was in crashed into a tree . When police questioned the driver, who has not been named, he told them he had been at a party at the Sibiga property, and had consumed one and a half beers. A blood test revealed his blood alcohol content was .11 per cent. The legal limit for under 21s is .02 per cent. He was charged on Thursday with first-degree manslaughter, drink driving, three counts of reckless endangerment and making a false statement to police. When police went to Mr Sibiga's property they found at least 10 cars in the drive, but when they knocked on the door he said no one else was in the house. He admitted his son had been having a party and later led police to the 34-acre woodland, across the road from the house. Police identified and interviewed 28 teenagers who were at the party. One of the teenagers claimed to have been told by Mr Sibiga's son that 'keys had to be left at the house and 'It is a rule at these parties that if you are . drinking, you have to stay over'. Rural: The road outside the Sibiga property. The teenagers were having a party in 34 acres of woodland across the road from the family home . None of the teenagers said they had seen Mr Sibiga at the woodland party area until he arrived with police in the early hours of August 6, after the crash. Mr Sibiga was charged on Thursday with 28 counts of reckless endangerment and 28 counts of permitting minors to possess alcohol. His attorney, Paul Melocowski, . told FoxCT: 'Something happens in your own property, that’s one thing, . but if something’s alleged to have happened deep in the woods somewhere, . it goes to what you were able to see, not see, what you have knowledge . of.'

Missouri executed Allen Nicklasson on Wednesday night for killing a Good Samaritan who stopped to help him and his friends after their car stalled on Interstate 70 in 1994. It was the state's second execution in three weeks. Nicklasson, 41, was pronounced dead at 10:52 p.m. on Wednesday, eight minutes after the process began. His eyes remained closed throughout and he showed little reaction to the drug, only briefly breathing heavily about two minutes into the process. He offered no final words. Allen Nicklasson, 41, was executed on Wednesday night for killing a good Samaritan who stopped to help him and his friends after their car stalled on Interstate 70 in 1994 . Missouri Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike O'Connell said Nicklasson prayed briefly with the prison chaplain about 20 minutes before the execution. No one from his family or the victim's family attended. His last meal was meat pizza, orange juice, gummy bears and M&Ms. An appeals court panel had granted a stay of execution for Nicklasson on Monday, citing concerns about his counsel at trial and sentencing in 1996. That stay was taken up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which did not return its 5-4 decision to vacate the stay until late Wednesday night. Gov. Jay Nixon refused to grant clemency, and Nicklasson was executed nearly 23 hours after he was originally scheduled to die. Nicklasson declined interview requests this week. But in a 2009 interview he spoke of a childhood scarred by abuse and mental illness. He recalled watching his mother shoot up heroin. She fed him Alpo dog food for dinner, he said, and once made him fight a Doberman for money. Nicklasson was often removed from . home and spent part of his childhood in mental institutions and homes . for boys. He became addicted to drugs. He . met convicted killer Dennis Skillicorn in 1994 at a drug rehab center . in Kansas City. The men, along with Tim DeGraffenreid, drove to St. Louis to buy drugs in August that year. Nicklasson, 41, was pronounced dead at 10:52 p.m. on Wednesday, eight minutes after the execution process began . On the way back, their 1983 Chevrolet Caprice broke down near Kingdom City, Mo. They dropped the car off with a mechanic and burglarized a home, stealing money and drugs. The next day, despite mechanics' warnings that the car wouldn't last, they got back on I-70 where it broke down again. Drummond, 47, who was a technical support supervisor for AT&T, spotted the stranded motorists and stopped to help. The men put a gun to his head and ordered him to drive his Dodge Intrepid west. About 60 miles later, in Lafayette County, the men ordered Drummond off the road to a secluded area. Nicklasson recalled that he left Skillicorn and DeGraffenreid behind and walked Drummond to a field. He said he had intended to tie Drummond up to buy time for the trio to get away. Instead, he ordered Drummond to kneel and cross his legs. He shot him twice in the head. Drummond's remains were found eight days later. ‘I'm laughing, pacing,’ Nicklasson said, recalling the moment. ‘I started losing it. I wouldn't want this out, but I felt a euphoria. I finally got back for all the beatings I took’ as a child. Nicklasson and Skillicorn drove Drummond's car to Arizona. When the vehicle broke down in the desert, they approached the home of Joseph and Charlene Babcock. Nicklasson said he was often removed from home and spent part of his childhood in mental institutions and homes for boys before becoming a drug addict . Nicklasson killed Joseph Babcock after the man drove them back to their vehicle. Charlene Babcock was killed at the couple's home. Nicklasson and Skillicorn were sentenced to life in prison for the Arizona killings and also sentenced to death in Missouri for Drummond's death. Skillicorn was executed in 2009. DeGraffenreid pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and did not receive a death sentence. Nikklasson's execution was the state's second to use a single drug, pentobarbital. Missouri previously used a three-drug method for executions but changed protocols after drugmakers stopped selling the lethal drugs to prisons and corrections departments. The pentobarbital used in Missouri executions comes from an undisclosed compounding pharmacy - the Missouri Department of Corrections declines to say who makes the drug, or where. Racist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin was executed Nov. 20. Before that, Missouri had not performed an execution in nearly three years.","Allen Nicklasson killed a man in 1994 who stopped to help him and his friends after .

The American relatives of Elian Gonzalez have claimed that he was taught the pro-Cuban line he adopted in interviews this week by Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. Elian was six when he found himself at the center of an international custody battle between the US and Cuba fourteen years ago and was seized at gunpoint by American police and sent back to the Communist country. Now aged 20, Elian left Cuba for the first time this week as part of a 200-strong Cuban delegation at a youth conference in Ecuador, describing his life back in his homeland as 'magnificent'. But his great uncle Delfin Gonzalez told CNN: 'He understands and says what they have taught him, he cannot understand anything else.' All grown up: Elian Gonzalez, the little boy who was the focus of a bitter international custody dispute after he was rescued at sea as a child, left Cuba on Friday for the first time since 2000 . Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez: Gonzalez is now studying to become a military officer. He turned into an international child celebrity after he was found floating off the Florida coast when he was five-years-old in November 1999 . Connections: Cuba's President Raul Castro (L) talks to Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez. He quickly became caught up in the political rip-tide of Havana-Miami politics (file photo from 2010) But Mr Gonzalez recalls that his nephew had a different perception of the island when he lived in Miami. He said that he believes that Elian's life would've been better had he been allowed to stay in the US. He said: 'This is a free and democratic country where you can study what you want and you have free movement. 'For us, the only satisfaction that we are left with is that he is alive.' Gonzalez recently said in an interview published in Cuba's state-run media that his fame continues to follow him in Cuba. 'Wherever I go there's always a child, an old woman that comes to me and wants to meet me,' he said. 'Not because I am famous but because they suffered with my family.' When he was young: Elian Gonzalez (R), the young castaway at the center of a dramatic custody battle across the Florida Straits in 2000 was given personal treatment by Cuban President Fidel Castro . Loyalty: 'The right to be with my father, the right to maintain my nationality and remain in my cultural context' were violated in the United States . 'Fidel Castro for me is like a . father,' Gonzalez said in the recent interview. 'I don't profess to have . any religion but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a . ship that knew to take his crew on the right path.' In . an interview with the Cuban weekly Girón published on the cubadebate.cu . website, Elian, said his experience in Miami when he was six 'charged . me for life.' Speaking . in his native Spanish, he said his basic rights as a child — 'the right . to be with my father, the right to maintain my nationality and remain . in my cultural context' — were violated in the United States. 'Those days were very sad for me, which marked me for life', González said Monday. 'It never gave me the chance to think of my mother, who died at sea as a result of the Cuban Adjustment Act,' he said, referring to the 1966 U.S. law that allows any Cuban who reaches the U. S. by any means to be paroled and given residency. Havana has called the law 'murderous' and blamed it for encouraging Cubans to board rickety boats to cross the Florida Straits in the hopes of reaching the U.S. González said he “suffered the consequences of the act.' But he emphasized that “our struggle is not against the American people; it is against their government.' He said. 'From the moment Americans knew of my case, they took to the streets to call for me to be sent back to my country.' Now a military cadet studying industrial engineering, Gonzalez said he would have suffered had he stayed in the United States. Fondness: Fidel Castro for me is like a father,'Gonzalez said in the recent interview. 'I don't profess to have any religion but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path' The moment: Elian Gonzalez, held by Donato Dalrymple, is taken by U.S. federal agents from his Miami relatives April 22, 2000. U.S. federal authorities stormed the Miami house where Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez was sleeping . He was shy of his sixth birthday on Thanksgiving Day 1999 when a fisherman found him off the coast of Florida, clinging to an inner tube after his mother and nine others fleeing Cuba drowned trying to reach American soil. He was taken to live with relatives in Miami but his father, Juan Miguel, who was separated from his mother and had remained on the island, demanded that the boy be sent back, saying Elian was taken without his consent. The dispute turned into a headline-grabbing international custody battle that weighed heavy on the 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Fidel Castro threw the weight of the Cuban government behind the case, mobilizing seven months of massive demonstrations calling for Gonzalez's repatriation. As the two sides fought out the high-profile case in court, U.S. immigration officials decided to put Gonzalez in the custody of his father, who had come to the United States to argue for Elian's return. His relatives in Miami refused to go along, and armed federal agents then raided the home of Gonzalez's uncle and seized the boy. It was one of the few moments since 1959 when the Cold War rivals agreed on something: The U.S. legal system ruled that Gonzalez should be returned to his father.A state celebration was held on the 10th anniversary of his return to Cuba.

Apology: Tech entrepreneur Greg Gopman posted a rant hitting out at San Francisco's homeless community on his Facebook page . The chief executive of a technology start up company has apologized after describing homeless people in an area of San Francisco as 'trash'. In an astonishing Facebook post, Greg Gopman, CEO of start up 'hackathon' organizer AngelHack, ranted that underprivileged residents of the city should 'keep to themselves' on the outskirts of the city and 'beg coyly'. In a lengthy diatribe prompted by a walk through the Market Street area of the city, Mr Gopman wrote: 'I’ve traveled around the world and I gotta say there is nothing more grotesque than walking down market st in San Francisco. 'Why the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy, homeless, drug dealers, dropouts, and trash I have no clue. 'Each time I pass it my love affair with SF dies a little.' But Gopman, who reportedly moved to the city from suburban Florida, wasn't finished. In a separate callous post, the entrepreneur went on to suggest moving the underprivileged and institutions put in place to try and help them to nearby Daly City. He added: 'The difference is in other cosmopolitan cities, the lower part of society keep to themselves. 'They sell small trinkets, beg coyly, stay quiet, and generally stay out of your way. Rant: Gopman posted his controversial thoughts about the city's homeless community after a walk through the Market Street area . 'They realize it’s a privilege to be in the civilized part of town and view themselves as guests. And that’s okay. He added: 'In downtown SF the degenerates gather like hyenas, spit, urinate, taunt you, sell drugs, get rowdy, they act like they own the center of the city. 'Like it’s their place of leisure… In actuality it’s the business district for one of the wealthiest cities in the USA. It a disgrace. I don’t even feel safe walking down the sidewalk without planning out my walking path. 'You can preach compassion, equality, and be the biggest lover in the world, but there is an area of town for degenerates and an area of town for the working class. Large audience: Gopman's Facebook posted his thoughts to his near 3,300 followers . 'There is nothing positive gained from having them so close to us. It’s a burden and a liability having them so close to us. 'Believe me, if they added the smallest iota of value I’d consider thinking different, but the crazy toothless lady who kicks everyone that gets too close to her cardboard box hasn’t made anyone’s life better in a while.' Although Gopman later removed the post so that it could no longer be seen by his near 3,300 Facebook friends, screen grabs of his views soon appeared elsewhere on the internet. 'In downtown SF the degenerates gather . like hyenas, spit, urinate, taunt you, sell drugs, get rowdy, they act . like they own the center of the city.' Greg Gopman . His company's Twitter feed was bombarded with messages from people keen to share their view and tell Gopman exactly what they think of his controversial views. Unfortunately for AngelHack, the firm's Twitter feed was reportedly set up to automatically retweet messages every time the company got a mention. AngelHack's Twitter feed since appears to have been taken down from the site. Mr Gopman issued an apology for his 'inappropriate' comments via his Facebook page last night. He said: 'I'm really sorry for my comments. I trivialized the plight of those struggling to get by and I shouldn't have. 'I hope this thread can help start an open discussion on what changes we can make to fix these serious problems.'

Charter boat captain Jim Sharpe was on his dock in Summerland Key, Florida. last Friday when he noticed a brown pelican with its throat slit, making it almost impossible for it to swallow fish. Each time the pelican tried to swallow, the ballyhoo would fall out of its large pouch and onto the ground. 'It looked like the pelican’s throat had been cut with a knife,' he told the Miami Herald.

Cruel cut: Veterinarian Don Harris, head of the Avian and Exotic Animal Medical Center in Miami, performs surgery to repair a brown pelican's pouch that appears to have a chunk of it intentionally cut out . Depraved behavior: A brown pelican was found in the lower Florida Keys with a chunk of its pouch intentionally cut out . Cruelty: Each time the pelican tried to swallow, the ballyhoo would fall out of its large pouch and onto the ground. After about the seventh attempt, Sharpe said, he put a cast net over the water bird and made a gruesome discovery . A 10-inch clean slit reached from the point of the bird’s beak, all the way back to the glottis. 'The windpipe was dangling from the bird’s neck, almost like it was breathing out of a snorkel,' Veterinarian Don Harris, director of the Avian & Exotic Animal Medical Center in Miami, told the Herald. Several more brown pelicans have been turning up in the area with the same injury, and Maya Totman, director of the Florida Keys Wildlife Rescue, said she fears there’s a person or group of people out there doing this to innocent animals. 'We’ve seen a lot of ripped pouches, but never anything like this,' she said. Clean cut: 'It looked like the pelican's throat had been cut with a knife' Sharpe said. And it was not just one clean slice, but two cuts about six inches apart, creating a large hole in the pouch . Rescuer: Captain Jim Sharpe of Sea Boots Charters on Summerland Key found this brown pelican on the dock with a large chunk of its pouch cut out, which prevents it from eating . It's not clear how the bird was maimed but it is possible that the bird was slashed from the inside. Harris agreed that the cuts on the pelican brought in by Sharpe appeared to be intentional. 'I firmly believe it to be malicious,” he told the paper, even likening the lacerations to 'a Colombian necktie' — in reference to a method of murder that began during the Colombian civil war. Totman said she found one dead pelican and four others with their throats slit on Cudjoe Key on Sunday. 'If we don’t catch them soon they are going to die from starvation a terrible death,' she said. 'This is so sad. So sad.' Multiple occurrences: Several more brown pelicans have been seen in the Lower Keys with the same injury.

'They can be aggravating and try to grab your fish if you are fishing out of a boat,' he said. 'But I can’t imagine anybody deliberately maiming them, even though they can be a nuisance.' On Sunday, a fisherman reported seeing several live brown pelicans with their pouches cut near Venture Out resort on Cudjoe Key. It’s separated from Summerland Key by a bridge. The brown pelican is federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. It’s also on Florida’s protected list as a species of special concern, the Herald reported. 'They can be aggravating and try to grab your fish if you are fishing out of a boat,' Harris said. 'But I can’t imagine anybody deliberately maiming them, even though they can be a nuisance.'

Jen Arnold, the star of reality TV show Little Couple, has revealed that her cancer of the uterus was caused by a non-viable pregnancy - and now the aggressive disease has spread to her lungs. The Houston neonatologist broke the news about her diagnosis last week after she and husband Bill Klein, who both have dwarfism caused by a genetic condition, brought their second adopted child home to Texas. Arnold, who now wears a wig, has now detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong - and how doctors have struggled to know what treatment is best due to her size. 'There are moments I feel just . terrible,' she told People magazine. 'I can't believe it is happening. Other times, I . feel like this is just a bump in the road.' The couple, both 39, have one adopted son, Will, from China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey, 2, in October when Arnold began bleeding. Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home. Once back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered. Her fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat. Scroll down for video . Struggle: Jen and husband Bill have had a challenging few years as they tried to start a family . Family: Jen and Bill hold their son Will's hands as they walk to lunch. The couple adopted him from China last year . 'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she told People magazine. The embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband was still in India. But the mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four times its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs. 'Sometimes I think, ""Seriously? Really? How can this be happening?""' she told People. Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of Arnold's small ariway. 'We wanted to avoid surgery in her case because of her shortened airway and the difficulties she has had in the past with surgeries,' said Dr. Concepcion R. Diaz-Arrastia from Baylor College of Medicine. Struggles: In her efforts to start a family Jen went through multiple grueling rounds of IVF egg retrieval and tried surrogacy. The couple's surrogate miscarried and they turned to adoption . 'But we felt we had no choice. The disease was not responding to chemotherapy. We had to do this in order to save her life.' Choriocarcinoma is a fast-growing form of cancer in the uterus that develops in women who are pregnant. It can occur after a normal pregnancy and it is possible for a healthy baby to grow at the same time. The cancer is most often caused by a hydatidiform mole, which is a tumor resulting from over-production of the tissue that is supposed to develop into the placenta - the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the fetus. Even after the mass is removed from the uterus, the abnormal cells can continue to grow and turn into cancer - as it did in Arnold's case. Choriocarcinoma is an uncommon, but very often curable. Most women whose cancer has not spread can be cured and will still be able to have children. One symptom is vaginal bleeding in a woman who recently had a hydatidiform mole or pregnancy, and chemotherapy is the main type of treatment. A hysterectomy and radiation therapy are rarely needed. Source . Doctors were also faced with the issue of her size because they were unaware of how much chemotherapy to give her. 'I called oncologists in Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York, Houston,' Dr. Arrastia said, 'and no one had experience with treating this type of cancer in a person with skeletal dysplasia. It was a very rare cancer, rare that it was found in a little person … a very rare situation.' Now doctors have upped her dosage and hope she will not suffer an infection that will set her back. If this is the case, doctor say her prognosis looks good. 'The treatment is rough,' Arnold said. 'But I have a chance of being cured. I just have to push through it.' Although she said she was ready to . battle through the cancer treatments, a tweet from Ms Arnold's husband . last week suggested she was feeling frail. Mr . Klein tweeted: 'My darling wife released today that she is currently . battling a form of cancer. Prayers are welcome, hugs are not due to her . weakened state.'

Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy drove him ‘nuts’ with a barrage of calls and texts while he was at Sandhurst, the phone hacking trial heard yesterday. The jury at the Old Bailey was told that the Royal Family liked the Zimbabwe-born socialite but feared privately she was ‘needy’ and would distract Harry during his army officer training in August 2005. The claims were made in an email from Clive Goodman, the News of the World’s royal editor, to Andy Coulson, the newspaper’s editor, which was shown to the jury yesterday. Goodman sent the email in 2005, when the couple had been together for about a year. Claims: Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson (right, pictured today outside court) allegedly received an email in 2005 saying Chelsy Davy was blitzing her boyfriend Prince Harry (both left, in 2010) with calls . Message: The royal editor of the now-defunct tabloid, Clive Goodman (pictured), said Harry could only field the calls when he had finished his training duties at 10pm . He . wrote: ‘Chelsy is driving Harry nuts, she won’t leave him alone. 'He’s . not allowed to use his mobile at Sandhurst until he’s off duty. But . she’s blitzing him with dozens of calls and texts when he should be . concentrating on training. ‘Family . likes her well enough but they’re worried she’s incredibly needy just . at the time when Harry needs to be concentrating on himself. ‘We’ve . been having a very quiet look at this independently and it works. 'She’s blitzing him with dozens of calls and texts when he should be concentrating on his training' Clive Goodman, former News of the World royal editor . 'In . just over one month, she has put in nearly 60 calls to his mobile. That’s on top of texts. ‘Harry . can only field these after he’s finished his training duties, sometime . after 10pm. He keeps the phone on, but on silent. It buzzes and vibrates . also frequently with new m [the message cuts off].’ The . couple remained together until 2010 when Miss Davy ended the . relationship, reportedly because she did not want a royal life. Goodman, . who was convicted of phone hacking in 2007, is said to have told his . boss he was having  an ‘independent look’ at Miss Davy’s phone activity. Goodman . is on trial in relation to alleged corrupt payments to public officials . while he was working for the now defunct News of the World. Dinner party: Tabloid editors Rebekah Brooks (left, pictured yesterday) and Piers Morgan (right) exchanged banter at a dinner party about phone hacking, a media lawyer told the trial . Allegation: The court has heard claims that the newspaper used phone hacking to get stories on the royals, including a claim that Harry broke rules at Sandhurst by asking an aide for help with an essay . Piers Morgan bragged to Rebekah Brooks that he knew what her front page would be because he had been ‘listening to her messages’,  the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Brooks, who was then the editor of the Sun, is alleged to have challenged her rival, then editor of the Daily Mirror, asking him: ‘Been hacking into my phone again have you Piers?’ Media lawyer Ambi Sitham described the exchange,  which allegedly took place at Andy Coulson’s birthday dinner in January 2003. Miss Sitham, who was sitting next to Brooks at the event, described it as an ‘odd conversation’. She added: ‘There was a pointedness to it… it was entirely serious. I remember being uncomfortable.’ Coulson, 45, and Brooks,  45, deny conspiring with others to hack phones. Brooks also denies conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The . jury heard that, in a separate email, he asked Coulson for permission . to pay a royal policeman £1,000 for a phone book with a direct line to . the Queen. Goodman warned . him: ‘These people will not be paid in anything other than cash because . if they’re discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal . charges, as could we. ‘One . of royal policemen (St James’s Palace) has obtained the brand new Green . Book, the telephone directory with all the home numbers of the royal . family and their household staff. The standard price is £1,000.’ The email went on: ‘Incredibly useful and he’ll be extremely handy in the Peat affair tale.’ The . ‘tale’ was said to concern a false allegation that a former aide to the . Prince of Wales, Sir Michael Peat, was having an affair. Coulson and . Goodman are accused of corruptly paying a royal policeman for three . internal royal phone directories. The . jury heard Goodman was paying Glenn Mulcaire, who led phone hacking at . the paper, an extra retainer to work on royal stories.

The outbreak of bubonic plague has been confirmed in a Madagascan village after at least 20 people died in a week. The deaths occurred in a village near the north-western town of Mandritsara, and today medical experts on the island confirmed the outbreak. Last year, 60 people in Madagascar died from bubonic plague, more than in any other country in the world. Disease: Bubonic plague, carried by fleas like this one, is sweeping through Madagascar . While the disease has been almost entirely eradicated from Europe, there were 256 cases of bubonic plague recorded in Madagascar last year. Public Health officials had warned of the risk of an outbreak in October - the month is the start of the danger period for the disease as fleas which spread the plague thrive in the humid weather. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Pasteur Institute are now working in the country to prevent bubonic plague from becoming even more common, according to the BBC. Idyllic: But Madagascar, pictured, is now the plague capital of the world with 256 cases last year . Experts are particularly concerned . about the prospect of an epidemic started in Madagascar's crowded and . filthy prisons and then spreading when inmates are released or receive . visitors. Rats living in the prisons often carry fleas which transmit bubonic plague to humans by biting them. The disease can then escape to the outside world via staff, visitors, freed inmates or the rats themselves. 'If the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town,' Christophe Rogier of the Pasteur Institute told the BBC. 'The prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town.' The ICRC is working to eradicate the disease, but this is particularly difficult as it is necessary not only to kill the rats themselves but also to destroy the fleas living on them. Although the disease can be cured by antibiotics, rural residents often do not have access to even basic healthcare and can be ashamed to seek treatment. One farmer told the BBC he had not been allowed to bury his daughter after she died of plague, as officials took her body into quarantine and buried it themselves. Devastation: The Black Death saw bodies piled up on carts dragged through the streets of Europe . Bubonic plague is one of the most . devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people . in the 'Black Death' which hit Europe in the 14th century. It . is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea . as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats. The . disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance . of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'.

This is the emotional moment a British soldier who survived the worst ever battlefield injuries while serving in Afghanistan collected his MBE from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson lost both legs and suffered more than 40 . injuries, including brain damage which affected his memory and speech, . in a bomb attack in 2006. The paratrooper has since defied medical opinion by teaching himself to walk again for short distances using crutches. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Ben Parkinson stands to receive his MBE from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace . Brave: Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson proudly holds his MBE alongside members of the Yeoman Guard . Inspiration: Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson lost both legs and suffered more than 40 injuries in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006 . And his determination was exemplified today as was he able to proudly stand to receive his honour. In a poignant moment, the Prince of Wales touched his shoulder as he leaned towards L/Bdr Parkinson and told him he was an 'inspiration'. Speaking moments afterwards, L/Bdr Parkinson said: 'I was surprised at how much Prince Charles knew about me. 'He said I was an inspiration. It made me feel so proud.' When he took a turn in carrying the Olympic flame through his hometown of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, last July, the sight of the determined soldier on his prosthetic legs moved many to tears and was declared one of the most emotional scenes of the relay. L/Bdr Parkinson was unconscious in a military hospital for three months before he came round following the Taliban attack seven years ago. Since then he has had to learn to walk again on prosthetic legs, undergo major surgery to fix his shattered spine and teach himself to talk once more. Not content with battling back from his horrific injuries, L/Bdr Parkinson was one of a group of injured veterans who took part in a gruelling trek in Norway earlier this year. The expedition, organised by the charity Pilgrim Bandits, retraced the footsteps of the Second World War heroes of Telemark to mark the 70th anniversary of the mission. Battling: Ben Parkinson has confounded medical expectations by learning to walk again following his horrific injuries . Along with other amputees and severely . injured servicemen, L/Bdr Parkinson travelled 65 miles (105km) across . the Hardangervidda in winds of up to 80mph (129kph) and temperatures of . minus 30C (minus 22F). L/Bdr Parkinson suffered a brain injury, fractures to his skull, . cheek, nose, jaw and pelvis, fractured vertebrae, and serious damage to . his spleen and chest when his Land Rover was hit. His mother Diane Parkinson . successfully fought the MoD to have his original compensation of . £152,150 - just over half the maximum £285,000 - increased to £540,000. Also recognised for bravery today was Royal Navy pilot Lieutenant Commander Craig Sweeney, who received the Air Force Cross for leading the rescue of a climber in Argyll in blizzard conditions, plummeting temperatures and pitch darkness. He described the mission to uplift Gareth Bradley on 3,074ft (937m) Beinn Sgulaird near Oban as one of the most challenging rescues he has ever undertaken. 'We didn’t have any time to reflect on what we were doing at the time. I was completely in focus, just concentrating on the job in hand,' he said. 'I find this more nerve-wracking,' he joked. The crew from HMS Gannet in Prestwick, Ayrshire, flew their Sea King helicopter to the aid of Mr Bradley, who had a broken ankle and might not have survived the elements were it not for their rescue mission on December 18 2011. Lt Cmdr Sweeney, 38, joined HMS Gannet in December 2010 and lives close to the unit in Alloway with his wife and three children. Speaking of being honoured, he said: 'This is completely overwhelming. 'It’s very humbling, really. I didn’t expect to receive it and there were three other crew members involved, I hasten to add. 'Prince Charles said he was astounded by the bravery we’d shown and he said he was going to ask his eldest son if he knew about the rescue but said he hadn’t managed to yet.' Former world number one golfer Luke Donald said it was an 'amazing experience' to be made an MBE for services to the sport. 'Everyone wants to go through that,' he said. Heroes: Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson celebrates with wheelchair athlete Hannah Cockroft who also received an MBE after winning two gold medals in last summer's Paralympics . Life-changing: L/Bdr pictured before and after the injuries he suffered in the bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006 . 'It’s a great honour to be recognised. It means a lot, I always try my hardest and to be the best I can and it’s great to get that recognised.' Donald, who said his next goal was to win one of the majors, said of meeting Charles: 'He was surprised that I got the time off to practise and he said he thought it was amazing that us golfers practise and play in all sorts of tough conditions. 'He said he hoped the medal would inspire me as I compete in the future.' Donald is from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, but lives in the US where he splits his time between Chicago and Florida with his wife Diane and their two young daughters. He flew over yesterday and said it was 'great' to be back in the UK where he will also compete at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in Surrey next week.

The aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is frequently on duty in far-off climes, but yesterday she could be spotted closer to home as she travelled up the Thames through London. The ship is taking part in a series of events to mark the 70th anniversary of the climax of the Battle of the Atlantic, which ensured that essential supplies could reach Britain throughout the Second World War. She is now visiting the capital for the final time before being decommissioned next year, in a move which will leave the UK without any active aircraft carriers for several years. Passing through: HMS Illustrious as she goes through the Thames Barrier in Woolwich on the way to join the commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic . Final visit: Illustrious is making her last trip to London before being decommissioned next year, leaving the UK without an aircraft carrier . Illustrious was pictured going through the Thames Barrier and passing Canary Wharf before docking at Greenwich, the historical home of the British fleet. The 22,000-tonne Royal Navy carrier, known as 'Lusty' by her crew, will be moored there until next week and will be open to visitors this weekend. This month sees the 70th anniversary of 'Black May', the month which saw the heaviest fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic when the Allies took decisive control of crucial shipping routes. The battle, which lasted for nearly the whole of the war, started with the Allies' naval blockade of Germany, which was met with a reaction from Nazi forces. Seeing the sights: Illustrious sails past Canary Wharf on the way to Greenwich, where she is moored until next week . Event: The ship will be open to visitors over the weekend as the Royal Navy celebrates the 70th anniversary of the six-year-long battle . History: Illustrious has been in use since 1982, and will be decommissioned next year to be replaced eventually by HMS Queen Elizabeth . Winston Churchill described the Battle of the Atlantic as 'the dominating factor all through the war', as control of Atlantic shipping routes was central to the British war effort. The naval blockade of Germany started the day after war was declared in September 1939, and did not officially end until VE Day in May 1945, after 35,000 Allied troops had been killed in the battle. It saw the Royal Navy and the RAF, allied with U.S. forces, contend against German U-boats and the Luftwaffe to allow supplies and materials to reach Britain. Fighting reached a peak in the spring of 1943, as the Allies took the upper hand thanks to new technology such as radar and longer-range aircraft. Between March and May 1943, new . technology allowed the British and American navies to turn the tide and . they started destroying German U-boats in large numbers. It gave the Allies the upper hand in . the war as a whole, as Britain now had unfettered access to the . materials needed for civilian and military industry. The Royal Navy's anniversary celebrations are being held this month in Liverpool, London and Derry. As well as visits from boats old and . new, the cities will be hosting aircraft fly-pasts, while an academic . conference and commemorative parade are being held in Liverpool. Yesterday a service of commemoration for the 35,000 Allied troops killed in the Battle was held at St Paul's Cathedral. HMS Illustrious was commissioned in 1982, and is now the Navy's only aircraft carrier in active service. The ship first saw action in the South Atlantic in the aftermath of the Falklands War, and has since served in regions such as the Balkans and the Middle East. After she is taken out of use in 2014, she will be preserved for the nation rather than being sold for scrap like her predecessors Invincible and Ark Royal. The UK will then have no aircraft carriers at all until HMS Queen Elizabeth joins the fleet, probably in 2016. Festivities: As well as the aircraft carrier's visit, a number of celebratory events are being held in London, Liverpool and Derry . Poignant: The Battle of the Atlantic lasted for nearly as long as the Second World War itself and saw a total of 35,000 Allied troops killed .","Britain's only aircraft carrier passed Thames Barrier and Canary on final visit to London before decommissioning .

The Gaul sank in 1974 during a fierce storm off the coast of Norway with the loss of her 36-man crew – but only four bodies were ever found. Investigation: Tests are being carried out to discover whether human remains found in Russia are those of missing sailors from a trawler which sank in 1974 .

Bitter winds, sub-zero temperatures and even snow are predicted for this Bank Holiday weekend - in marked contrast to last year's sunny scenes. And for those longing for a dose of summer, there's even more bad news: the unseasonably bad weather could last until June. Last year's May Bank Holiday saw temperatures up to 77F (25c), but barbecues and beach trips will be off the agenda this year after the mercury plummeted to minus 4C in Scotland overnight, with the rest of the UK experiencing lower than average readings until Monday. Enjoying the weather? Steven Hulston catching some rays - or is that rain?- at Bournemouth beach in Dorset . Desolate: Just one walker and a flock of gulls on the beach for the start of this bank holiday - in stark contrast to last year's hot and busy holiday weekend . Flashback: Bournemouth beach for last year's May Bank Holiday, which saw huge crowds flocking to the beach to enjoy temperatures in the high 70s . Some forecasters predicted this was set to be the coldest start to May for more than 70 years, with cloud is set to hang over the southern parts of Britain over the course of this weekend with wintry snow and sleet showers falling in the North.  The Met Office said the mercury fell early this morning to -7.4C at Cairngorm, Highland, -6.2C at Saughall, Ayrshire, and -4.4C at Shap, Cumbria. May lowest temperature records were broken by at least four stations: Saughall, Carterhouse, Roxburghshire, Drumalbin, South Lanarkshire, and Spadeadam Cumbria. Records began in 1995 or earlier. Seaside resorts including Bournemouth were deserted in bitter lunchtime temperatures in the south of 6-8C - up to 10C colder than normal. Today: Patchy rain in the far south and southeast clearing by early afternoon. Sunny spells elsewhere with scattered showers. Maximum 12C (54F). Tomorrow: Bright and chilly with scattered showers. Cloudier again in the Southeast. Maximum 12C (54F). Monday: Slightly milder but low pressure forecast to bring rain from the West. Highs of 13C (55F). And the Met Office's long-range forecast . warns of unsettled weather to the middle of May, with showers, a risk . of snow in higher ground in the north and risks of gales, adding: . 'Temperatures will initially be largely below the seasonal average . across the UK at first, so still a risk of grass frost in any clearer . interludes overnight.' Later in the month, the experts predict rain and cloud are predicted to be 'more likely to be above average than below average, whilst mean temperatures are more likely to be below average than above average.' The dismal outlook for the long weekend follows weeks of wet weather that brought floods to widespread areas of Britain, and saw this April crowned the wettest since records began by the Met Office. Officials at the Environment Agency have warned that many roads and fields are still under water. A spokesman said: 'We continuing to keep a close watch on river levels as well as checking defences and clearing any potential blockages to reduce the risk of flooding. Making the best of it: Olivia Hulston, 9, having fun at Bournemouth beach, Dorset, despite the windy weather, left, while spectators were left glum at Sussex Cricket Club's washed-out game at Hove, right . 'There is still a lot of flood water around and the Environment Agency is urging people to keep away from swollen rivers, and not attempt to walk or drive through them.' Tourist resorts said they did not have high hopes for takings over the weekend, while the AA predicted many would stay at home due to the recent 'foul' weather. That's not a parasol: Wendy Hayter, left, and Val Davies brave the elements at Bournemouth seafront for a nine-mile charity walk for Breast Cancer Care . Claire Smith, president of Stay Blackpool, said: 'It's not looking like a fab Bank Holiday. People only have so much money to spend and it's not that long since Easter. I also think people are making plans for the Jubilee weekend. 'The weather's very random at the moment so this is perhaps not going to be our best.' And a Bournemouth seafront spokesperson said: 'It's cold, horrible, windy and very quiet. The few people that are here are wearing coats, hats and scarves - quite a contrast to a sunny Bank Holiday weekend.' Bournemouth area hospitality association chairman Andrew Woodland said: 'Visitor spend will be way down, with a fall of around £1million compared to a good weather weekend.' An AA spokesman said: 'We don't think there will be significant getaways of traffic. A lot of people will be staying at home and doing their own thing. 'The weather's been so foul over the last month, I doubt many people have made plans to head off. 'It discourages people from going out and if people are staying at home it's going to be more of a DIY weekend than a travelling to the seaside one. 'People aren't going to be travelling long distances.' Gardeners have been advised to either take vulnerable plants indoors or wrap them with horticultural fleece because of the threat of frost. Richard Willford, horticultural manager at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, told the Daily Telegraph: 'If they are in beds there is not a lot you can do other than put horticultural fleece over them, held down with stones ... And cross your fingers.' The RSPB said bird populations would fall after thousands of nests were destroyed by floods in Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, West Sussex and West Yorkshire. Spokesman Jon Reeves said: 'It’s devastating.' MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, predicted a chilly holiday. Forecaster Billy Payne said: 'Temperatures are quite a few degrees down on what they should be for this time of year so it doesn't look like it's going to be beach weather. 'This morning will get off to a cold start with quite a lot of cloud bubbling up mixed with showers and some bright and sunny spells. 'A front will be lingering over the South so it will be mostly cloudy with patchy rain and drizzle there. 'There will also be some wintry showers in Scotland and northern England with snow falling over higher ground.' Mr Payne said the mercury will be dipping close to, or just below, zero tonight in most parts of the UK, with a widespread frost setting in during the early hours of tomorrow morning. Making the most of the recent flooding: A wakeboarder skims across a submerged green in Raynes Park, south-west London - in a new sport they have dubbed 'puddle-winching' Daytime temperatures are expected to climb no higher than 12C over the next two days, with areas in the North East dropping to 5C. Monday is expected to be slightly milder but low pressure is forecast to bring rain from the West.

Kenneth Hicks has been forced from his home by an EU law which protects endangered birds . Having lovingly worked the land on their farm for more than 30 years, Kenneth Hicks was looking forward to passing the estate to his sons when the time came for him to retire. But the former Army officer told last night how that dream has been shattered after he was forced from his home by EU laws that put the ‘rights of birds above humans’. Mr Hicks, 79, said he and his wife  Deidre, 78, had to leave their farm of 30 years with ‘a gun to their heads’ because of European regulations that allow the RSPB to flood the land to encourage breeding of endangered birds. He said they were ‘devastated’ at having to leave 60-acre Harbour Farm in Bembridge, on the Isle of Wight, and being denied the chance to pass it on to their three sons. Taxpayers are also understood to have been left with a seven-figure bill as part of a deal to rehome the couple. ‘We didn’t want to go but we had no hope of defeating European law. Neither did the British government,’ Mr Hicks said. ‘I am not a political person, but this is a worrying example of how European law affects ordinary people.’ Under the plan, raised water levels will flood the farm and surrounding land to create breeding grounds for wildfowl including brent geese, widgeons, shovellers, lapwings and redshanks. ‘It has forced us out of our home because it effectively values the rights of birds above the rights of human beings,’ Mr Hicks said. ‘We are broken-hearted.’ The couple’s ordeal began when the RSPB asked the Environment Agency (EA), which manages Britain’s waterways, to allow increased flooding from the nearby Eastern Yar river to encourage more breeding sites for rare species. Mr Hicks worked the land at Harbour Farm on the Isle of Wight for more than 30 years. He was looking forward to handing it down to his sons but told how his dreams have been shattered . Mr Hicks said that would have rendered his land unusable but, because the land is within an EU Special Protection Area, he was told that if he fought the decision the RSPB could take him to the European courts. The EU has strict legislation aimed at protecting wild birds and attempting to halt their decline. As part of this, it designates  Special Protection Areas (SPAs) around Europe to encourage endangered species. Harbour Farm on the Isle of Wight became part of an SPA that incorporates the Solent and Southampton Water in 1998. SPAs . are covered by the EU’s Habitats Directive, which aims to provide ‘a . strict system of species protection’ for birds. This includes . regulations that nations must ‘maintain or restore natural habitats of . Community interest’. The RSPB . had already bought 420 acres from Harbour Farm – which is on land . reclaimed from the sea – and allowed it to flood to create habitats for . wildfowl. But the  charity now wants to raise water levels further, . which will affect the adjacent farm. Mr . Hicks was given legal advice that he would have no chance of . overturning the decision because of the strict EU laws covering SPAs. He was left to reluctantly accept what he called a ‘fair offer’ for the land from the EA. He said: ‘We do not blame the Environment Agency. Their hands were also tied by Brussels and they have done everything they can for us in the circumstances. ‘But it is a very sad situation. We have been forced into this agreement with a gun to our heads because it was made abundantly clear to us that under European law there was no other option. ‘It was excellent land which we used to grow hay for our horses and for around 100 sheep to graze. ‘When the river level rises the land is expected to be at the very least waterlogged and unusable.’ But he said the their ‘greatest . sadness’ was not being able to pass on the estate to their three sons, . who work as a psychologist, a doctor and a lawyer. ‘That has always been . the plan,’ he said. Mr . Hicks, whose grandfather was born nearby, bought the farm after a . 27-year Army career during which he served in the Suez crisis. At . the time it was within a Site of Special Scientific Interest – which is . designated by Natural England – and Mr Hicks said there was no . suggestion water levels would be raised to protect birds. An EU regulation means the farm can be flooded by the RSPB to encourage breeding for endangered birds. Mr Hicks said the law puts the 'rights of birds above humans' But in October 1998 the land was designated part of an EU Special Protection Area. Soon afterwards the family sold 420 acres of the farm to the RSPB to help comply with EU regulations, so Mr Hicks was surprised about the new plan that will flood their remaining land. The RSPB said the SPA was operating ‘far below optimum’ and raising water levels on its land – thereby flooding the adjacent farm – was the ‘final piece in the jigsaw’. A spokesman for the charity denied there had been any threat of legal action, saying: ‘The RSPB’s role is the management and restoration of our own part of this potentially exceptional wildlife site.’","Kenneth and Deidre Hicks left their home 'with a gun to their heads'

The sons of an English expatriate who left his £389,000 fortune to the  British National Party are fighting to claw back the money at the High Court. Joseph Robson, 81, died in Alicante having bequeathed his entire estate outside Spain to the far-Right BNP. This left his two sons, Jeremy and Simon, with just £135 between them. They launched a legal challenge, insisting that their father was barred from giving money to a British political party under rules designed to prevent donations from ‘foreigners’. Family row: Joseph Robson left his £389,000 estate to the BNP and his sons are fighting to have it for themselves claiming he lost his voting rights, making the donation illegal, the High Court heard . But the BNP is now challenging the sons’ claims in court. Arguments: Judge Richard Sheldon heard Mr Robson left his sons just £135 . Judge . Richard Sheldon QC heard that Mr Robson – who was born in Ashington, . Northumberland – moved to Alicante after retiring in 1992. Four . years later he made a will leaving the BNP all his worldly goods except . a Spanish bank account containing just £135, which he bequeathed to . Jeremy. But the BNP ran into . trouble when it tried to lay its hands on the gift, after Mr Robson’s . sons claimed he was not legally allowed to make the donation. They . argued that the expatriate – who divorced their mother in the 1970s – . failed to register on the UK electoral roll in the five years before his . death in 2010, the judge heard. That . meant he was barred from making the gift under rules introduced in 2000 . to curb foreign donations to British political parties. Phillip . Capon, for the sons, told the judge that Mr Robson effectively died . intestate and that his whole fortune ought to be handed to them, despite . his wishes. But Robert . Grierson, representing BNP treasurer Clive Jefferson, argued that the . party had overcome the problem by executing a deed of variation to the . will. This meant the money would paid into a specially set-up charitable . trust, rather than directly to the party. The . charity’s trustees are Mr Jefferson, former leading National Front . member Patrick Harrington and Jennifer Matthys, the daughter of BNP . leader Nick Griffin. New life: Mr Robson moved to Alicante (pictured) on his retirement in 1992 after divorcing his sons' mother . Mr . Capon insisted, however, that moving the cash into the trust would make . no difference and could not legitimise an ‘illegal’ political donation. He said the party was obliged to pay the money back under the Political . Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The BNP, represented by party Treasurer, Clive Jefferson (pictured), says the idea their father became a 'foreigner' in the eyes of the law by the time he died is inconceivable . ‘The . BNP is not entitled to the gift under this will,’ he said. ‘It does not . have the lawful capacity under the Act to accept this gift. The gift . fails and there is an intestacy.’ Mr . Capon told the court that as the party’s treasurer, Mr Jefferson could . theoretically face prosecution if it was found to have accepted the . payment illegally. Addressing . the judge in person, the BNP’s Mr Harrington argued that it would be . ‘utterly unjust’ for the party to be stripped of the money bequeathed to . it. ‘One son was given nothing and the other was given less than £150,’ he said. ‘It seems pretty . clear that the father didn’t want the bulk of his estate to go to his . two sons – he wanted it to go to a political party. ‘Mr . Robson had every right to be on the electoral register but, for . whatever reason, he was unaware of the provision that he had to be. The . pathway can never lead to the sons. That can never happen.’ Denying . that the party is fighting the case as it is badly in need of  funds, . he added: ‘The BNP has received sizeable legacies as its support base . tends to be amongst older people. It is not desperate for money.’ Giving . his preliminary views on the dispute, Judge Sheldon said: ‘If the BNP . had investigated whether or not Mr Robson was a permitted donor there . would be no need for this hearing.’ He reserved his decision until a . later date. Neither of Mr . Robson’s sons attended the hearing. Their barrister was unable to . comment on why their father had decided to effectively write them out of . his will.","Joseph Robson moved to Alicante in 1992 and in 2010 estate left to BNP .

Alec Munday was alleged to have used inappropriate sexual language and had inappropriate conversations with pupils while working as a teacher in north Wales . A teacher accused of singing Let's Talk About Sex to a 12-year-old girl and pretending to have been in a relationship with Cheryl Cole has been banned from the classroom. Former Army radar technician Alec Munday was also alleged to have used inappropriate sexual language, causing distress to a child, and had inappropriate conversations with pupils while working as a teacher in north Wales. The General Teaching Council for Wales heard Mr Munday was said to have sung from Jessie J’s hit Domino while supervising a lunchtime ICT session. He said he only knew the line 'take me down like (I’m) a domino.' Presenting officer Lousha Bryl told the professional conduct committee: 'The lyrics contain sexual language and the song is about a sexual encounter. There was a mixed range of ages that attended this lunchtime club.' Mr Munday, 47, faced four allegations, all found to be proved, and the committee said they amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. Imposing a prohibition order, committee chairman Steve Powell said Mr Munday had expressed genuine regret and apologised. He said: 'Although his actions were inappropriate there was no sexual or ulterior motive.' In May 2012 the temporary teacher at a school in Llangefni, Anglesey, was alleged to have used inappropriate sexual language causing distress to a girl, and to have sung an inappropriate song containing sexual language in the presence of pupils. Married Mr Munday told the GTCW at Ewloe he was listening to the radio and singing along to tunes at Ysgol Gyfun, Llangefni. He said he sang lyrics from the Jessie J hit Domino during a lunchtime ICT session but only knew the line 'Take me down like (I’m) a domino'. He said: 'I didn’t sing the whole song. I only knew the closing line of the chorus. 'I wouldn’t consider it to be inappropriate, just a pop song.' While a supply teacher at Darland High School (pictured), in January 2012, Mr Munday had also allegedly remarked 'oh that's beautiful' and 'don't stop' while a girl was drawing a camel . He said it was during his lunch break. He said: 'I wasn’t in a formal teaching mode. I didn’t say ""come into my class and listen to my singing"".' Mr Munday accepted singing Carly Rae Jepsen’s hit Call Me Maybe but disputed singing Let’s Talk About Sex by Salt-n-Pepa and could not remember if he sang Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears. He said: 'It was whatever came on the radio basically.' Miss Bryl said 'Pupil A', 12, felt the words of the Salt-n-Pepa song Let's Talk About Sex were directed at her. But Mr Munday said what happened had been misinterpreted and came about because of another girl’s 'email signature' which stated: 'I want your body.' The teacher had told this pupil she could not put that and in a raised voice said: 'It's like me ending emails with ""yours sincerely Mr Munday, I want to have sex with you"".' Representing himself, Mr Munday said to the GTCW panel: 'I felt I needed to make a shocking response. I used a shocking analogy.' Mr Munday said he was not 'trying to be sexual' when he made the remarks about the drawing at Darland High School . Mr Powell said: 'Mr Munday said he used the language he did to shock the pupil to make her appreciate the inappropriateness of the words. He acknowledges his words may have been overheard by a pupil and, if misinterpreted, may have caused her distress. 'We are satisfied Mr Munday's language was inappropriate and unprofessional even though we accept his intention wasn't to cause distress.' Deputy headmaster Alwyn Pritchard said Pupil A’s mother rang and said her daughter had returned home upset by what the teacher allegedly said to her. Mr Munday resigned a few days later. The previous January, while a supply teacher at Darland High School, Rossett, Wrexham, Mr Munday was accused of inappropriate conversations with pupils. Mr Munday accepted singing Carly Rae Jepsen's hit Call Me Maybe but disputed singing Let's Talk About Sex by Salt-n-Pepa and could not remember if he sang Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears . Two Year 10  'model pupils', had claimed he discussed his first sexual encounter and sang I'm Sexy And I Know. He was also said to have talked about X Factor judge Cheryl Cole. Head Peter Agnew said: 'They both knew what Alec Munday had said was wrong.' He had also allegedly praised a girl’s drawing of a camel by stating 'oh that's beautiful' and 'don't stop'. Pupils took it as sexual innuendo and burst into laughter. Mr Munday said: 'I heard the laughter and realised it was about what I said. 'I wasn’t trying to be sexual, I was trying to talk about the drawing. It all came out wrong.' Mr Munday told the committee that two girls had asked him about the X Factor judge and he was at first 'taken aback'. He said: 'I remembered I must have been to this school and mentioned I previously knew a girl called Cheryl Tweedy who had gone off to be a singer and what happened to her, which was greeted with laughter at the time. The two girls wanted to know more details.' He denied saying he had been in a sexual relationship with her. Mr Munday told the committee: 'I wish to express my regret these incidents occurred.' He added: 'I left teaching because it was far too stressful in the supply role, for the state of my mental health. 'I have no intention of returning to teaching. Miss Bryl said he qualified in 2010 after a post-graduate course at Bangor University. She suggested he had 'an inability to learn from his mistakes'. Mr Powell said without retraining 'there would be a significant risk of repetition of the behaviours'. The fourth allegation was that he 'lost it' when he grabbed a child by the wrist and removed her from his class while a supply teacher at Wood Memorial primary school at Saltney, near Chester, in March 2011. Headmistress Ceri Williams said: 'The class was quite a challenging year four class.' Teaching assistant Cheryl Evans said: 'I thought his actions were inappropriate. The force used was definitely excessive.' Mr Munday said a disruptive girl had refused to leave the class and he 'assisted her to her feet' and escorted her across the room. 'I felt I had no choice at the time.' He accepted this amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.

"By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 19:07 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:12 EST, 12 December 2013 . Romanians are being arrested in London at seven times the rate of Britons, it was revealed yesterday. Around 800 people from the Eastern European state were arrested in the capital last month, according to official figures. Many of them are linked to a wave of cashpoint fraud which cost an estimated £40million in the first six months of this year alone. Homeless Romanians congregate on Park Lane in London: The police has been told to investigate why the latest arrest figures are so disproportionate . Police say that for every 1,000 Romanians in London, 183 are arrested. This compares to 26 Britons per 1,000. Police chiefs have been told to investigate the reasons behind the hugely disproportionate figures. They are concerned that they could rise even higher when restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians living in Britain are lifted on January 1. The Government is preparing for a ‘comprehensive’ review of how foreign national offenders are treated in the criminal justice system. There are concerns that gaps in cross-border intelligence checks are allowing prolific and dangerous offenders to slip through the net. The latest figures emerged at a summit about the threat posed by foreign criminals held at City Hall, in Central London. Romanian gypsies congregating in Marble Arch, London: For every 1,000 Romanians in London, 183 are arrested . Stephen Greenhalgh, the capital’s deputy mayor for policing, was told the Met has undertaken an in-depth study of overseas offenders. It found that Romanians account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders, despite making up just a tiny proportion of residents. This placed the Eastern European nation at the top of a ‘league table’ of foreign suspects, followed by people from Poland, Lithuania, India and Nigeria. The other five countries in the top 10 were Ireland, Portugal, Pakistan, Jamaica and Somalia. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, of the Met, admitted there is a ‘capability gap’ when it comes to tackling overseas offenders. He said that ‘historically’ there has not been a ‘strong enough’ relationship between police and Home Office border staff. Homeless Romanians congregate on Park Lane in London: Around 800 people from Eastern Europe were arrested in the capital last month . There now needs to be a ‘concerted effort’ by both agencies, he added, to identify and kick out the most dangerous criminals operating on British soil. Mr Rowley said: ‘By definition, much of the information that would help us deal with these people more effectively is held in their home country. ‘It is only if people are here a long time and develop a criminal history that this gap is equalised. There is a capability issue that needs to be closed.’ A Met study discovered that foreign national offenders are more likely to be cautioned and less likely to be prosecuted. They are also arrested more often for low level offences such as ticket touting, begging and prostitution. Senior officers are concerned that they often cannot get information about the criminal histories of European suspects while they are in custody. They hope to reach an agreement with Poland, Lithuania and Romania by February for ‘fast time’ access their criminal databases. Officers from Poland and Romania are already working in London in a bid to improve links between the countries. Scotland Yard has scored some significant victories by deporting dangerous men in the face of lengthy court appeals, often on human rights grounds. Among them was a serial knifepoint robber and sex offender sent back to Sierra Leone after 18 years in Britain. He was named as a suspect in 46 inquiries. A violent Jamaican gangster with convictions for rape and armed robbery was deported using police intelligence and banned from the country for a decade. Around 70,000 foreign nationals are arrested in London every year, about 28% of all criminal suspects taken into custody. Intelligence analysts also estimate that a quarter of the most dangerous criminals are from overseas. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Greenhalgh said: ‘The police have upped their game and there is now stronger enforcement against foreign national offenders. ‘Now we need to make sure the police get the intelligence from overseas partners so the prior convictions of all offenders are routinely available. ‘Foreign nationals who commit crime must be treated the same as British nationals. London is a global city but it must not be a soft touch for foreign criminals.’","Many arrests linked to cashpoint fraud costing £40million in six months .

The distressed pony is believed to have struggled desperately to save itself as investigators discovered drag marks leading to the waters edge. The RSPCA has urged anyone with information to get in touch after they were contacted by dog walkers who made the grim discovery. The pony had died by the time it was found on Saturday, but the RSPCA think it may have still been alive when it was put into the water and could have struggled desperately to save itself . The RSPCA is appealing for help to find the sick people who dumped a live pony in a canal . The stretch of water was opposite a lay-by, and a dark Range Rover was seen in the area at around 7am that day . Inspector Louise Labram said: 'At the moment I am treating this as suspicious.

Jurors who look up details of their case online should be prosecuted, the government’s top lawyer has warned. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said members of juries must not try to find out about defendants by searching the internet. And he wanted against trawling ‘chat and banter’ about cases on Facebook or Twitter or be charged with contempt of court. Crackdown: Jurors are told not to search online for details of cases, and if they are caught trials can collapse at great cost to the taxpayer (file picture) In a speech to think-tank Politeia, Mr Grieve QC backed plans by the Law Commission to create a criminal offence for jurors who intentionally seek information beyond the evidence presented in court. It follows a number of cases in which jurors have been jailed for using the internet to find more information about cases than was set out in court. Jurors have always been told by judges at the start of cases not to carry out their own research, discuss it with anyone, visit the scene of the crime or try to find out about the witnesses or defendants. These directions now extend to not researching the case on the internet. Dominic Grieve said members of juries must not try to find out about defendants by searching the internet and backed plans to make it a criminal offence . Mr Grieve said: ‘To ignore those directions, intentionally, amounts to a contempt of court. ‘This does not mean that jurors must refrain from reading the news  - online or in the traditional way -, nor that they should not use the internet as they would normally. ‘It means that they must not seek out extraneous information about the case they have sworn to try in accordance with the evidence.’ He said there will be ‘all kinds of prejudicial information “out there” on the internet’. ‘This could be in the form of archived news reports about the defendant’s previous court appearances, or it could be, to use the words of the old authorities in a modern context, mere chaff and banter about the case on someone’s Facebook page or Twitter feed. ‘But the chances of a juror seeing such material are fairly slim, providing they haven’t gone looking for it.’ He highlighted the case of Theodora Dallas who was jailed for six months in 2012 after causing a trial to be stopped because she researched a defendant’s past on the internet. The lecturer was a juror in the case of a man accused of grievous bodily harm, and after looking on the web discovered he had previously been acquitted of rape – information not given during his assault trial at Luton Crown Court. Dallas shared her findings with her fellow jurors who informed the judge – and the trial of Barry Medlock, 64, a violent drinker, was halted. At the time the Lord Chief Justice said: ‘The problem is not the internet: the potential problems arise from the activities of jurors who disregard the long established principles which underpin the right of every citizen to a fair trial.’ But Grieve said he endorsed the remarks, adding: ‘My recent experience is that the law of contempt is both adaptable and resilient in the face of the challenges of technology. ‘The fundamental principles underlying the need for juror restraint are timeless.’","Dominic Grieve backs call for new criminal offence of researching cases .

A three-year-old girl may have tried to change her tiny brother’s nappy just moments before he suffocated to death in his cot, an inquest heard today. The little girl was alone in the room in Witney, Oxfordshire, with six-month-old baby Feonyx Clarke before he was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head. The coroner, who would not name the girl, recorded an open verdict on the death - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs. 'Very sad and tragic': Feonyx Clarke, of Witney, Oxfordshire, was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head . Kirsty Clarke, their mother, had earlier told the hearing that her daughter - referred to in the inquest as ‘T’ - may have tried to change Feonyx in his cot in an upstairs room without her knowledge. Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours later at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. A pathologist told the inquest in Oxford that Feonyx’s brain was starved of oxygen, but could not explain how this happened. The unused nappy bags which were found in Feonyx’s cot had not been there when his mother checked on him 20 minutes earlier. Dr Steve Gould, a consultant paediatric pathologist, gave a cause of death as acute cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury and sudden unexpected death in infancy - which remains unexplained. ‘There was a lack of oxygen to the tissues, including the brain,’ he said. ‘What has caused it is not something I can explain during the course of the investigation. ‘What was found could be the cause of the collapse or just as likely the result of the collapse.’ He added: ‘It is possible (nappy bag death). I can’t exclude it. It could be suffocation or it could be a naturally occurring collapse with an unknown cause, which then goes onto cause these symptoms.’ Feonyx was also found to be suffering from bronchopneumonia as he had been unwell in the days leading to his death. Treatment: Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours after being found limp at John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford . Mrs Clarke, 27 - newly married to waste collector Gavin - provided a police statement following the baby’s death. ‘There were some toys at the bottom of the cot which he could not reach. He had a snuggle over him. Apart from that there was nothing in the cot,’ she said. The full-time mother collected her oldest child ‘N’ from school with her father watching over Feonyx. She came back after 4pm. 'I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn’t appear to breathing' Kirsty Clarke . ‘At about 5pm ‘T’ went upstairs. She was three years old at this time and ‘N’ seven,’ her statement said. 'I went up after her to see what she was doing. ‘She got back into my bed and went straight to sleep. I checked on Feonyx. He was warm so I removed his blanket and then went back downstairs. ‘Between about 5.20pm or 5.30pm I went back up to check on him. He was lying face down on some nappy bags. Also in the cot was a clean nappy with a bag of baby wipes. ‘They had not been in the cot at 5pm when I had changed him. T was still in my bed. She was under my duvet, so I do not know whether she was asleep or not. I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. 'I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn’t appear to breathing. I started CPR and called 999. I did CPR until paramedics arrived. They then took him to hospital.’ Inquest: The coroner recorded an open verdict on the death at Oxford Coroner's Court (pictured) - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs . She said that Feonyx, born on November 8, 2012, was a ‘bubbly and playful’ child, who had only seen his health visitor and doctor for routine baby check-ups and eight-week injections. During evidence, brunette Kirsty told the hearing: ‘He was teething and had a cold the days before and was a bit more sleepy (than normal). I remember nappy bags in the cot. ‘I don’t remember if his face was on . them. They were at the top of the cot. There were four or five loose . nappy bags. At 5pm there were no nappy bags, no wipes and no nappies (in . his cot). There was no bed in his room. T was in another room.’ 'It was a very sad and tragic death' Darren Salter, Oxfordshire Coroner . Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter asked her: ‘It is possible that T may have tried perhaps to change Feonyx? That would be an explanation wouldn’t it?' Mrs Clarke replied: ‘Yes.’ She said nappy bags would normally be kept on a window sill. Feonyx died at 1.18pm on May 25, 2013. Coroner Mr Salter said: ‘All I can say is repeat what Dr Gould said. The suffocation on nappy bags is possible and can’t be fully excluded, but there is no direct evidence at the post-mortem of it. ‘The best thing for me to do is return what is called an open verdict where the evidence at the inquest doesn’t fully show what the cause of death is. ‘I think the most likely aspect of this was that it was a natural cause, but it is hard to determine what that natural cause was. It was a very sad and tragic death.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","The little girl had been alone in room with six-month-old Feonyx Clarke .

Nicky Suddons, 26, was originally jailed for seven sex attacks on women and girls in Manchester carried out during a two month reign of terror back in 2004 . A notorious rapist used a knife to launch a savage sex attack on a woman walking her dog – after he was let out of prison for a day on ‘work experience’. Nicky Suddons was jailed for life aged 17 for a rape and six other serious assaults on women and a girl aged 13. But granted day release from his ‘open’ jail he assembled a ‘rape kit’ containing a knife, balaclava and rubber gloves. He even included condoms to stop police tracing him through DNA. Left unsupervised during his lunch break, he tried to rape a woman in her 50s as she walked her Labrador in woods near Grantham, Lincolnshire. His victim was only saved because the dog turned on Suddons. After he was found guilty of attempted rape in just an hour yesterday, the judge described the case as ‘very worrying’. Judge Sean Morris said: ‘You may  wonder what on earth was going on. Someone gets life and they are out wandering around Grantham.’ Last night Justice Secretary Chris  Grayling ordered an immediate probe into what happened. Mr Grayling said: ‘This is a truly horrifying case and one that needs to be investigated thoroughly. ‘I’m determined to get to the bottom of what went wrong and to take forward any lessons learnt from the reviews I have commissioned. ‘In future when people are released on temporary licence I want to see them tagged so we can better monitor where they are and where they have been.’ After his initial crime spree in his teens, Suddons, now 26, became known as the ‘Yellow Brick Road’ rapist, after the area of Manchester where he carried out his attacks. He committed seven sex attacks on women and girls in 2004. The former lifeguard – who boasted about his attacks on social media sites – said he carried out the knifepoint assaults for kicks and regarded himself as ‘untouchable’. The judge in the case warned he had ‘an extremely high risk of reoffending’ and described him as a ‘highly dangerous young man’. Suddons collected together a 'rape kit' including a balaclava, rubber gloves, condoms and a Stanley knife and went on to attempt to rape a middle-aged woman after disappearing from his work placement and going to Queen Elizabeth Park where he lay in wait for a victim . Suddons was given a life sentence with a minimum term of just four . years, making him eligible for release around four years ago. In . December last year, the Parole Board ordered he be moved to North Sea . Camp open prison. It also ordered that, because of his age when . convicted, he must be given work experience during the day. From . March he was let out to do painting and decorating work on a church . property in Grantham. Each day as part of his work placement, Suddons . was granted an hour’s unsupervised lunch break. During this time he was . able to walk unmonitored through the riverside park that is popular with . mothers and their children. On June 28 during his unsupervised . break, he walked half an hour to nearby Queen Elizabeth Park to attempt . his horrific assault in broad daylight. His victim told Lincoln Crown . Court she turned around to find herself face to face with  a masked man . brandishing a knife. As she fell to the ground and screamed, he stood . over her and warned ‘don’t scream’. She told the jury: ‘My eyes were . fixed on the knife and the mask. His thumb was on the Stanley knife as . if the blade was ready to be flicked.’ He only backed off as the dog . lunged – and was caught by a passer-by. Outlining the contents of the . ‘rape kit’, David Outterside, prosecuting, said: ‘What was on his mind . was rape. This time he was prepared and absolutely determined not to be . caught. He was caught red-handed.’ Suddons admitted attacking the woman but denied he intended to rape her. He remains in custody and is due to be sentenced. He . had an earlier conviction in 2002, when he was 14, for assaulting a . 12-year-old girl. He was jailed for life by Manchester Crown Court in . 2005 after admitting one rape and six sexual assaults on victims aged . between 13 and 28. Last night local MP Nick Boles said: ‘It is extremely . troubling when convicted criminals are released on some form of . probation and are in a position to go on committing crimes. ‘I make . no criticism of the church, who weren’t responsible for acting as . jailers. But we need to be sure they are properly supervised. There must . be appropriate checks to ensure prisoners are properly rehabilitated . before they are allowed into the community.’ It is the second recent . high profile case involving a life sentence inmate from North Sea Camp . in Lincolnshire on work placement. In October 2012, Lee Cyrus went . on the run after being let out on day release for work, committing five . counts of exposure, wounding with intent, unlawful wounding, affray, . aggravated burglary, robbery and burglary.

Daniel Severn, 27, was trying to break into the house of Richard Wilson in Howden, East Yorkshire, by getting in through the bathroom. But his foot got trapped in the window and he was left hanging upside down for an hour with his head resting on a toilet. Burglar Daniel Severn, 27, begged his victim to call the police after he got stuck upside down over his toilet . He . tried to contact police with his mobile phone, but dropped it in the . bath and had to wait until Mr Wilson went into the bathroom at 5.30am. Mr Wilson described seeing Severn wearing marigold gloves, hanging over the toilet and begging him saying 'please help. Call the police.' Mr Wilson contacted police who eventually went to his house, but not before Mr Wilson's wife took a photograph of Severn in the window which was left open for the family cat. While waiting for officers to arrive, Severn told the Wilsons his name and confessed that he was a heroin addict. He was also said to be 'unexpectedly grateful' when police arrived to release him. Since the incident, Mr Wilson's teenage daughter has been too afraid to live in the house. Recorder Amanda Ripon said: 'It would be funny if it were not so serious. Make no mistake it was a very serious offence. ‘You . explained to the occupant you were a heroin addict. I doubt that gave . them much help in distress. You have 80 convictions for 32 court . appearances. The crime took place at Richard Wilson and his family's home in St John's Street, Howden, East Yorkshire . ‘The worst part is the teenage daughter who lives at the house now refuses to do so because she fears a repeat of the burglary.’ Crown barrister Mark Kendal said: 'He . said he got his foot stuck climbing in the house. He had a mobile phone . with a torch on it, but it had fallen in the bath. He had two pairs of . gloves on so as not to leave finger prints and a Stanley knife.’ Mr Kendal said the court heard Severn had 80 previous convictions. Defending . barrister Richard Sheldon said: ‘While at first glance it would like a . sophisticated burglary, that really was not the case. The picture shows . he was dangling by his leg from the window. ‘If . his head had been 1ft to the right his head would have been down the . toilet. That would have been more appropriate you may think. ‘Although . the family had the horror of finding him, he has expressed genuine . remorse. He gave them a lot of detail. He told them his name.

Tariq Al Habtoor has been convicted of kidnapping the dog he had given away in a 'military-style' operation . With a billionaire for a father, Tariq Al Habtoor is perhaps used to getting what he wants. So when the 22-year-old decided that giving his pedigree Labrador to a fellow student was a mistake, he assumed money would get the animal back. But Roseanna Morgan refused his offer of £1,500, saying Ozzy was not for sale. Al Habtoor, from Dubai, then took the extraordinary step of dognapping the animal in the dead of night. His mission succeeded – but he gave himself away by documenting his movements on Twitter. Yesterday, a judge threw out his appeal against a community sentence for the theft and imposed a suspended jail sentence. The saga began last December when Al Habtoor, whose father owns a hotel chain and has played polo with Prince Charles, offered Ozzy for free, saying the one-year-old needed more space and a family to play with. He posted a picture of the dog – whose pedigree name is Douglas Ozito Dormillon – on a Kingston University website . Miss Morgan, 22, and her boyfriend Joshua Gold, 23, stepped in and took Ozzy to Mr Gold’s family farm in the village of Chislet, Kent. But two weeks later Al Habtoor decided he wanted the dog back and made his £1,500 offer. It was rejected and on March 28 he drove 70 miles to the farm to kidnap Ozzy. His tweeted updates included ‘patience is a virtue’, ‘time for a late night mission’ and, at 5.30am, ‘success!’ Al Habtoor, who claimed all he wanted was one last visit with the dog, was spotted clearing a 5ft fence with Ozzy before making off in his silver Range Rover. Al Habtoor, 22, gave chocolate Labrador Ozzy away after deciding he could no longer look after him . The engineering student was questioned by police but refused to say what he had done with the dog. Apparently . abandoned, Ozzy was found in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, more than . 40 miles from Al Habtoor’s home in Surrey. Representing himself at . Canterbury Crown Court yesterday, Al Habtoor said: ‘I felt wronged when I . wasn’t allowed my last visit. I had given everything for free. When he was 16, Tariq Al Habtoor fled from the home of his strict . father, Rashid, said to be a devout Muslim, to live with his mother, . Sarra Fotheringham, in Surrey. As a teenager in Dubai, Al Habtoor was surrounded by bodyguards and unable to go out with his friends. In . 2008, he reportedly got away from his bodyguards, hailed a taxi to . Dubai International Airport and boarded a plane to London in his school . uniform. It was the first time he had seen his mother in nine years. ‘I . didn’t ask for anything. I just wanted a visit. I know that what I did . was wrong by taking the dog but it was the only way I was going to be . able to see him. ‘To me he . wasn’t just an animal, but when I thought I wasn’t going to see him . again I felt I had no choice. I tried to negotiate but there seemed to . be no way we could be civilised about it.’ Asked . why he planned the ‘military-style operation’, Al Habtoor replied: ‘I . didn’t really think that I would make it. I thought I would be caught.’ He said his studies stopped him doing the 120 hours of voluntary work initially imposed on him by magistrates. ‘I . am a full-time student in my second year of engineering,’ he said.  ‘I . don’t have time for community service, so I would rather have a . suspended sentence or a prison sentence.’ But his appeal was thrown out . in barely five minutes. Tariq Al Habtoor (pictured right when he was younger) is the son of billionaire Rashid (left) Giving . him a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, Judge Nigel .

LaRue Drummond, whose longest nails measure 14 inches, demonstrates how she washes the dishes at home in Perth Amboy, New Jersey . LaRue has not cut her fingernails for eight years and they cost her more than £10,000 in upkeep . LaRue shells out hundreds having her nails coloured and adorned with rhinestones. The grandmother-of-eight says she attracts attention wherever she goes from people curious about her extreme nails. And while her look is shocking to many, LaRue says she wants to grow them even bigger. She said: 'People stop me wherever I go and want to ask me about me nails and I'm always happy to tap about them. 'I like to look after them and the money I have spent I could have bought a car with - but this is what I want to spend my money on. LaRue gets her nails decorated with long nail technician Maria Ortiz at Maria's Nails in Newark, New Jersey . 'The most frequently asked question is how do I go to the bathroom. 'I tell them, ""the same way as you do. If you know of another way, let me know.'"" As a child LaRue used to bite her nails until they bled, but that all changed after a chance encounter. She explained: 'I was thirteen and in the supermarket with my mum when I saw a woman with 12-inch nails. 'I plucked up the courage to speak to her and she told me if you look after your nails, they will look after you. Getting her nails shaped and painted each month costs £100 and can last up to 12 hours . 'From then on I let me nails grow and became obsessed with pampering them.' Up until eight years ago LaRue, from New Jersey, USA, kept her nails at a 'sensible' three inches, but then decided to grow them as long as possible. LaRue, a part-time child-minder, said: 'I'd always wanted really long nails and it felt that the time was right. The children aren't scared by my nails - they're fascinated. I know their parents because they're all family friends but I'm always extra careful not to scratch them.' Long nail technician Maria Ortiz poses with some of her clients, including Larue, at her salon . And since reaching 14 inches LaRue has worked out new ways of working with her hands. She said: 'I just have to learn new ways to do things. For example when I'm using my phone I push the buttons with my knuckles. 'But there is not a lot I can't do myself. My daughters sometimes help me with tying my shoelaces or fastening jewellery. 'There has been the odd breakage over the years, so they're not all the same length, but that gives them more character. 'I named the longest one on my index finger Miss Attitude because she's the only one that twists. 'In the future I would like to get to 21 inches and then see if I can go longer.' The mum-of-four says her 14-inch talons are like her babies and is happy to spend money on their upkeep . LaRue spends 30 minutes cleaning her nails every day and gets her nails shaped and painted each month, costing £100 for a session, which can last up to 12 hours.

My mum has such dedication. 'Mum definitely has a nail obsession - now her babies are grown, those are her babies.' But not everyone is as comfortable with LaRue's unique look. LaRue said: 'I've seen people snigger at my nails. 'Once a woman wouldn't even sit next to me as if I had a disease or something. It really hurt my feelings. 'But it's who I am so I am not ashamed.

More than 40 police officers were tonight involved in a ‘substantial’ hunt for a 17-year-old girl who has been missing for 10 days. Jayden Parkinson has not used her mobile phone, bank card or updated her Facebook page since the start of the month - and detectives said ‘alarm bells were ringing’ over the disappearance. The teenager from Didcot, Oxfordshire - who was described as 5ft 5in with shoulder-length brown hair and has never gone missing before - has not been seen since Tuesday of last week. Concerns: Jayden Parkinson has not used her mobile phone, bank card or updated her Facebook page since the start of the month - and detectives said 'alarm bells were ringing' over the disappearance . Thames Valley Police detectives hunting Jayden appealed directly for her to get in touch with her parents, amid growing concerns for her safety. Police officers have so far failed to find the teenager, despite scouring footage from hundreds of CCTV cameras and conducting helicopter searches. Superintendent Christian Bunt, who is leading the inquiry, has called for Jayden to make contact, saying she could be in her hometown but also had links to Oxford and Reading, Berkshire. He added at a press conference: ‘The concerning thing for us is we don’t believe she’s has got access to any finances, a telephone or fresh clothes. She has not left with a bag or anything. ‘She’s not made contact with anyone at all as far as we are aware. We’ve had no contact from her whatsoever, which is highly unusual. ‘If you think of all the normal footprints you would leave in your life - card transactions, phone calls or internet use - she’s not making those footprints, which is a real concern for us.’ He said a ‘substantial police operation’ was in full swing, adding: ‘There has been a large amount of inquiries which we have made in the last week and unfortunately at the moment, most of them are coming back negative, or at least not leading us to Jayden’s whereabouts.’ Jayden had moved out of her family home in Didcot ‘a matter of weeks’ before she vanished from a youth hostel in Oxford called 1 Foot Forward, around mid-afternoon. However, Supt Bunt said there had been ‘no bust up’ with her family or friends to trigger her out-of-character disappearance. Scene: Jayden had moved out of her family home in Didcot 'a matter of weeks' before she vanished from a youth hostel in Oxford called 1 Foot Forward (on this road), around mid-afternoon . Jayden left the hostel wearing light blue faded jeans, a brown hooded jumper and high-top trainers and said she was ‘going out’ before vanishing. Supt Bunt said the unemployed teenager had left her mother, father and sister ‘very worried’. ‘Her mother is, as you would expect any mother to be,’ he told reporters. ‘She is very upset and very concerned. The whole family is completely engaging with us.’ 'If you think of all the normal footprints you would leave in your life - card transactions, phone calls or internet use - she’s not making those footprints, which is a real concern for us' Superintendent Christian Bunt, Thames Valley Police . He added: ‘There’s been no contact on Facebook or social media. There’s nothing at all. There’s no contact which is highly unusual not just for a young person but anybody these days. ‘She has previously used social media and kept in contact with people and now she is not so something has changed. That rings alarm bells for us.’ In a direct appeal to the missing teenage girl, Supt Bunt said: ‘Jayden, you are not in trouble at all. We just want to hear from you. We are concerned for your safety and well-being. ‘Please make contact with us on our 101 number or come into a police station. We don’t mind how you get in contact, we just want the contact because we are growing concerned for you.’ Supt Bunt admitted a previous missing persons appeal elicited just ‘one or two’ phone calls to police and urged the public to keep an eye out for Jayden. ‘She is a 17 year old girl without the appropriate resources to take care of herself. We are hoping she is with someone who is looking after her and she just wanted to get away for a bit. ‘But we need to know this for sure, we need to hear from her. If anyone sees Jayden or knows where she is then please get in touch with the police, because we are really concerned for her.’","Jayden Parkinson hasn't used phone, card or updated Facebook page .

Uruguay has become the first country in the world to legalise marijuana after passing a law which allows the production, sale and use of the drug. Last night hundreds of cannabis-smoking supporters cheered and set off fireworks as they celebrated the new legislation in the centre of the capital, Montevideo. The law permits both the large-scale distribution of marijuana and the growing of small amounts by individuals - although it will be tightly controlled by the country's Left-wing government. Scroll down for video . Celebration: Campaigners in Uruguay during a vote to legalise the sale and production of marijuana . March: Demonstrators on a parade through the streets of Montevideo supporting the new law . International groups have warned that Uruguay's legislation violates global treaties which state that narcotics should remain illegal in every country. Senator Roberto Conde, of the ruling Broad Front, said that 'the war against drugs has failed' as he presented the bill, which was passed in the Senate by 16 votes out of 29. Another senator, Alberto Couriel, added: 'It is an historic day. Uruguay is now on the international forefront of this issue.' President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter, has described the legalisation plan as an experiment, saying: 'There are a lot of doubts and the doubts are legitimate. 'But doubts shouldn't paralyse us in trying new paths to deal with this problem that has gripped us.' Legal: Uruguay is the first country in the world to create a regulated market for cannabis . Joyful: Another marijuana fan wearing a hat which trumpets his support for the government's measure . Uruguay is the first country fully to legalise the production, distribution of sale of marijuana, but several other countries have relaxed their laws against the drug in recent years. The Netherlands is well-known for its liberal policy on cannabis, and the capital Amsterdam is full of 'coffee shops' where residents and tourists can smoke weed, although production is still illegal. Switzerland, Spain and Canada are among the many other states where the drug has been decriminalised for personal use, with official efforts directed against dealers and producers instead. Last year the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington both voted to make the sale and use of marijuana legal - however, as it is still banned under federal law, the long-term functioning of the states' laws are uncertain. In addition, 18 other American states allow the use of medical marijuana, and in some of those states it is so easy to obtain a licence for this that the drug is effectively decriminalised. The law is much more liberal than in other places which have legalised aspects of marijuana use, such as the Netherlands or the American states of Colorado and Washington. Anyone over 18 will be allowed to grow up to six marijuana plants each, join a cannabis club or buy up to 40 grams per month from a pharmacy, as long as they have registered with the government. Valeria Rubino, an activist who has taken part in marches supporting the law, described it as 'another blow against social hypocrisy'. However, opposition parties have opposed the measure, while pharmacists are angry that they will have to sell marijuana. A poll taken in September suggested that 61 per cent of Uruguayans disapprove of the law. Legalising cannabis will 'diminish the perception of risk and foster consumption, especially among children and adolescents,' said Alfredo Solari, a senator from the opposition Colorado Party. 'Neither our government nor the rest of the world should experiment with Uruguayans.' Even some drug users oppose the measure, because they argue that the government controls on marijuana are overly restrictive. Pioneer: The production of marijuana is currently illegal worldwide, although some countries have relaxed their anti-drug laws in recent years . 'It's invasive, because it is not up to the government to determine how much marijuana can be consumed and the quality,' said Alicia Castilla, the author of a book on 'Cannabis Culture'. The International Narcotics Control Board, which oversees international treaties on drugs, has warned that the law violates the Single Convention of Narcotic Drugs, adopted in 1961 by Uruguay and 185 other countries. But following decades of drug-related violence throughout Latin America, a number of former leaders from the region have endorsed the plan. Mr Conde insisted that the law will do nothing more than recognise what is already happening around the country. 'Marijuana is the illegal drug that is most consumed, fundamentally by young people, one that is perceived as extremely low risk and is easily obtained,' he said. The government has accompanied the law with a publicity campaign featuring the slogan, 'All drug consumption has risks.'","Law will allow users to buy marijuana if register with the government .

The gap between what men and women earn in work has widened for the first time in five years, new figures show. Full-time men now earn 10 per cent more than their female colleagues, but including all employees the gap has risen 19.6 per cent to 19.7 per cent. Unions seized on the figures as proof that years of ‘slow, steady progress’ on pay equality was being eroded. Working women receive £97-a-week less than men in full-time jobs, the Office for National Statistics said . The Office for National Statistics said it was the first time the gender pay gap has increased since 2008. The figures showed that median annual earnings for full-time employees were £27,000 in the year to April, an increase of 2.1 per cent from the previous year. One in 10 full-time workers earned less than £7.28 an hour, while 10 per cent earned more than £27 an hour, both figures increasing by 1.5 per cent over the year. Weekly pay was highest in London at £658, and lowest in Northern Ireland at £460. Full-time pay for men increased by 1.8 per cent to £556 a week and went up by 2.2 per cent for women to £459. Working mothers are seen as ‘scatty . clock-watchers’ who are given a bad name by out-of-date sitcoms, a . Labour frontbencher has warned. Lucy . Powell said attitudes had to change because the days of dad working . while mum 'stays at home bringing up the kids' are long gone. The shadow childcare minister said she wanted to ‘bust the myth’ of working parents as unreliable employees. Miss . Powell, who recently returned to Westminster from maternity leave, . called for a revolution in the way employers and colleagues view working . parents. And . she complained that the depiction of mothers on television has not . changed since the 1970s, when the sitcom Butterflies featured the . frustrated, culinary-challenged housewife Ria, played by Wendy Craig. Mothers . are wrongly seen as unfocussed employees who take too much time off . while fathers have requests for leave rejected, she said. In . her first speech since taking the role in Ed Miliband’s reshuffle, she . said society must value the contribution parents make in the workplace. She added: 'Far from being . scatty and clock-watching, working mums have done a day’s work before . they leave the house - we don’t waste a minute of our day.’ The TUC said its analysis of the data based on mean, or average, figures showed that the gender pay gap was 15.7 per cent. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘Years of a slow, steady progress on closing the gender pay gap has gone into reverse. Ministers should be ashamed of presiding over this latest dismal record on pay. ‘It is not right that in Britain today . women still earn 15 per cent less per hour than men, a pay gap that . costs full-time women over £5,000 a year. ‘The light-touch, voluntary approach to tackling gender pay inequality is clearly failing. 'We need tougher action to force companies to look at their pay gaps, while government can lead the way by making all new jobs available on a part-time or flexible basis.’ The TUC said the real value of the average full-time wage fell by more than £200 over the last year, and by nearly £2,000 since 2010. Charlie Woodworth of the Fawcett Society said the widening gender pay gap ‘is a damming indictment of the Government's record when it comes to women's standing in the economy’. Labour’s shadow women’s minister Gloria De Piero said: ‘After falling under Labour, this morning we learn that the gender pay gap is back on the increase and no progress has been made in three years of this government. ‘Women are bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis and today confirms that decades of progress on women’s equality are being undermined by a government that just doesn’t get it when it comes to women.’ However Chancellor George Osborne said it was ‘interesting’ that the ONS figures showed the increase in average earnings keeping pace with inflation. He told the Commons Treasury Committee: ‘It shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent. 'That is, of course, the current rate of inflation. ‘So I think that points to the broader argument that I have been making, which is that as the economy recovers, that is the route to a sustained increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy, and you can't pretend that the two aren't connected, that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan.’","Men working full-time earn 10% more than women, up from 9.5% .

Police are searching for Kyshan Van Der Zanden, right and his daughter Lylah, centre, after he allegedly snatched her from her mother Gemma Mountney, left . Spanish detectives have launched a hunt for a Belgian man who snatched his toddler daughter away from her British mother. Kyshan Van Der Zanden, 22, made sure that his partner Gemma Mountney was out of the house all day by treating her to shopping vouchers and a trip to the spa. He then packed up his and his daughter Laylah's belongings from their Alicante home and fled before the 21-month-old's mother returned. Ms Mountney believed that Van Der Zanden had dropped the little girl off at nursery earlier, but instead he had hidden her with friends while he got her mother away from the house and packed. Although Ms Mountney called the nursery after noticing some of Van Der Zanden's belongings were gone when she returned home at lunch time, her partner had told nursery staff to lie to her because he had planned a surprise family day out. It wasn't until early evening when she went to pick up her daughter that Ms Mountney discovered the ploy and called police. Ms Moutney, who moved to Spain from Thame, Oxfordshire, ten years ago with her family, said: 'It is absolutely heartbreaking. 'He was the single person in the world who I thought would never do something like this - I'm devastated. 'I . miss Laylah so much and I just want her back in my arms and to be . giving her a huge hug. I thought he loved and cared for me and Laylah - . clearly not. Van Der Zanden told Ms Mountney that he had taken the couple's daughter to nursery school . 'If I could speak to him I would just urge him to bring her back. Bring her back to her mum so I can just hold her in my arms.' She met Van Der Zanden on a night out three years ago. They . set up home together in the coastal town of Calpe, and as far as Gemma, . a full-time mother, was concerned, everything was perfect. Speaking today she said: 'It was absolutely fine. When he came back . from apparently dropping her off at nursery he gave me a kiss and told . me he loved me. Ms Mountney's family have been appealing for information on Facebook . '[I went out . for my facial and went to the shoe shop he had given me vouchers for - . looking back he was doing his best to make sure I was out of the house . all day.' 'He had called the nursery in the morning and told them she wasn't going to be coming in. 'He said he had a surprise for all of us as a family - to go and have a lunch and a family photo shoot - and to lie if I called up.' The Guardia Civil - the Spanish police force - has issued alerts to airports and ports all over Europe. Ms Mountney said they are now treating it as a kidnap case and her family has taken to Facebook in a bid to track down Laylah by publishing family pictures. She noticed Laylah's passport and identity cards were missing two weeks ago, but when Van Der Zanden said he thought they had been lost and offered to organise replacements, she took his word for it. She fears Laylah and her father might be on the run in his home country of Belgian where his parents Nancy and Peter Van Der Zanden still live - or in Dubai where his father has business links. Two days after Laylah went missing, Ms Mountney's family finally got through to Van Der Zanden's mother who at first claimed she had no idea anything was wrong - but then slammed the phone down. Hours later she admitted she 'knew where Kyshan was' but put the phone down and has not been in touch since. Van Der Zanden distracted Ms Mountney, pictured with Laylah, by giving her shoe shopping vouchers and treating her to a spa trip . A spokeswoman for reunite International Child Abduction Centre, confirmed the charity was working with the family. He said: 'It's so sad every time we see it, but what is particularly upsetting in this case is how young the little girl is. 'She must be very confused at the moment and probably doesn't understand what is going on. 'The . first step we need to take is to establish exactly where her father has . taken her, which the Spanish police are currently assisting with. 'Once . we know where the little girl has been taken we can then help the . mother decide what the best option is with regard to getting her back . safely. 'Unfortunately cases . like this are rising and we are now seeing over 500 cases per year of . children being abducted by their parents.' A spokesman for Guardia Civil in Calpe said they were aware of the case and were investigating. Police believe that Van Der Zanden may have returned to his native Belgium with his daughter .","Kyshan Van Der Zanden is thought to have taken 21-month-old Laylah .

Modernising: Once reliant on Victorian buildings, prison governors now have phones in every cell . Prisoners in newly-built jails will have phones and computer terminals in their cells so they are able to contact relatives, arrange activities and order meals. The feature will be rolled out in the newest prisons in the UK in order to improve the quality of prisoner accommodation. According to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) published today, in-cell phones and computer terminals have already been installed in HMP Thameside. The report recommended new prisons contain ‘terminals to book activities and order meals’. It added: ‘In-cell telephones, as well as allowing prisoners to maintain family contact (important for successful rehabilitation), also contribute to prisoner safety,’ the report said. The phones will be used in new prisons throughout England and Wales, where more than 2,500 prisoners are housed. The Government’s spending watchdog said the facilities built by National Offender Management Service provide ‘a good standard of accommodation for prisoners.’ The report said that the new forms of communication had been welcomed by prisoners in focus groups. ‘Prisoners generally recognised the improvement in accommodation, as has the independent inspectorate,' it added. More than 90 per cent of cells have built-in showers and in all new buildings have attached toilets. The report, which looked at value for money across the prison system, said the measures were introduced because they saved funds. Ease: There is no more queueing for precious moments on the phone in several prisons, where talking to relatives from their cells helps prisoners integrate into the wider world, the report said (file photo) Cell: Having more facilities inside cells saved time and money unlocking them, said the NAO (file photo) Removing the need to unlock prisoners to wash helps to reduce staff costs, while in-cell telephones reduce the need to set up queues for communal phones or watch prisoners out of their cells. Elsewhere the report said more foreign prisoners should be removed from the country after the number of deportations fell by 14 per cent since 2009. It added: 'Removing more prisoners would allow the Agency to reduce prison capacity. This could happen if the Home Office prioritised cases better, improved case administration and used the foreign national offender-only prisons, that the Agency has created, more effectively.' Meanwhile only 14 per cent of prisoners in new capacity now share cells - but some are in overcrowded conditions, the report said, adding it was 'against United Nations and Council of Europe guidelines'. The report claimed changes to the prison system have saved £71 million since 2010.","National Audit Office claimed the facilities make prisons more efficient .

One Direction fans have long been highly visible on Twitter, but the boyband's true dominance of the social networking site was confirmed today. Twitter announced that three of the year's top five tweets came from members of the British group, who between them have over 90million followers - much more than any other band or musician. However, the event which triggered the fastest trending alert on the site was altogether more sombre - the death of fiction writer Iain Banks had the biggest response from Twitter users in 2013. On top: British boyband One Direction dominated the list of the world's top tweets from 2013 . Popular: This tweet by Niall Horan was the third most retweeted of the year . Fans: More than 327,000 'Directioners' have retweeted this photo of Harry Styles asleep in bed . Thanks: Zayn Malik posted this tweet after announcing his engagement to Perrie Edwards of Little Mix . Many members of One Direction's teenage fanbase are keen Twitter users, and three of the messages sent out by the band made it into the list of the five most retweeted. Irish band member Niall Horan had the third top tweet of the year after more than 367,000 users retweeted a message saying: 'Yesss! I'm 20! Wohooo! No more teens!' Zayn Malik occupied fourth and fifth spots on the list, with a picture of bandmate Harry Styles asleep in bed and a tweet thanking fans for their warm wishes after he announced his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards. The most retweeted message of all came from Glee actress Lea Michele following the death of her boyfriend and co-star Cory Monteith. Mr Banks's death started trending faster than any other item of UK news, including the birth of Prince George and the death of Margaret Thatcher. Scottish author: The June death of 59-year-old Iain Banks (pictured) became a 'trend' - a topic that causes sharp peaks in Twitter activity - faster than any other item of UK news throughout the whole of 2013 . Tribute: Spandau Ballet star Gary Kemp was one of thousands of web users who took to Twitter in the wake of Iain Banks's death . The author, who was suffering from cancer, passed away in June aged 59. And the announcement of his death prompted a swarm of online activity, according to the Year on Twitter report. Mr Banks's name immediately started trending on Twitter, and the annual review shows that this created a greater surge of online activity than any other event. The annual report breaks trends down into different subject headings including sport, politics, music and UK news. October’s St Jude storm, which caused widespread damage across the UK, was second in the UK news shortlist - with people using the social networking site to warn others of perils and offer condolences to families of the dead and injured. Their interest was also captured by . discussions about the NHS, in third place, the death of Irish poet . Seamus Heaney in fourth, and Coronation Street character Ken Barlow, in . fifth. Hot topic: The arrival of Prince George this summer, which prompted thousands to gather outside royal landmarks in the days before and after his birth, saw 'RoyalBaby' become number six in the top-ten list .

Worries: Another storm earlier this month provoked a flurry of tweets from Twitter users . The actor who plays him, Bill Roache, is currently facing a trial over allegations of historic sexual offences against five girls. And the arrival of Prince George this summer, which prompted thousands to gather outside royal landmarks in the days before and after his birth, saw ‘#RoyalBaby’ become number six in the top-ten list, followed by X Factor winner James Arthur at seven. ‘Thatcher’, which began trending following Mrs Thatcher’s death in April, is at number eight, ahead of ‘Richard III’, whose remains were discovered in August, at nine. And at the bottom of the shortlist the news that Hull was to be named ‘City of Culture 2017’ was the tenth most frequently trended topic. Of course, it is not just news events that have caused sharp peaks in Twitter activity. And other shortlists were formed to reveal the top trending topics for international news, people, music, politics, TV, football, other sport and events. Interest: Discussions about the death of Irish poet Seamus Heaney (left) were in fourth, and Coronation Street's Ken Barlow, in fifth.

Nick Clegg has revealed he has never smacked his own children, but refused to be drawn on whether other parents should. The Deputy Prime Minister was challenged over an admission by Great British Bake-Off star Mary Berry that she used to hit her children with a wooden butter pat if they misbehaved. Mr Clegg insisted he does not ‘use a wooden spoon’ to discipline his three sons, but insisted raising children can be incredibly frustrating and leave parents wanting to ‘pull your hair out’. Scroll down for video . Parenting: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he and wife Miriam do not smack their three sons . Miss Berry revealed last week that she would smack her children when they were young, and insisted it did not do them any harm. The 78-year-old said she reached for the kitchen utensil if Thomas, Annabel and William were naughty. She said: 'We had corporal punishment in our house. I don't think it hurts them too much, a quick slap on the legs. They would run very fast.' Today Mr Clegg repeatedly refused to be drawn on whether Miss Berry was wrong to hit her children, saying he had never met her and did not know what the circumstances were.

I do not use a wooden spoon.’ Miss Berry’s revelation reopened the debate about smacking, and whether times have moved on from the age of parents regularly hitting their children as a form of discipline. Asked if Miss Berry had been wrong, Mr Clegg replied: ‘She’s the mother of her children, I’m not going to start second guessing. 'I have no idea what a tap with a wooden spoon means. ‘It’s really, really important that you don’t start judging parents until you know exactly what happened, why they did it. ‘I am not going to start becoming terribly judgemental about what other parents have done with their children. ‘You should not in my view inflict violence on children, you certainly do anything which is against the law.’ Mr Clegg said he had ‘no idea’ whether a . gentle tap on the legs was appropriate or not. ‘It’s certainly not . appropriate if you do something that inflicts pain.’ Leave some for me!

What would make the perfect Christmas present for the Prime Minister after the week he has had? A photo frame for the latest selfie? A beginner’s guide to contempt of court? A shopping spree to spend his £7,400 MP’s pay rise? In fact David Cameron has revealed he has much simpler tastes and is looking forward to some peace and quiet over the festive break. And some squidgy tennis balls. New balls please: Tennis fan David Cameron has revealed he wants squidgy tennis balls for Christmas . In recent days Mr Cameron has found himself making headlines for all the wrong reasons. News outlets around the world carried pictures of him posing for a selfie with the Danish Prime Minister and US President during Nelson Mandela’s memorial service. And today he has been rebuked by a judge for backing TV cook Nigella Lawson in an ongoing court case. But as he come under fresh pressure to reject a planned 11 per cent pay hike for MPs, the Prime Minister has admitted that he hopes that the Christmas holidays will bring some respite from his frantic schedule. Mr Cameron, a keen tennis fan, said he had started playing the sport with his son Elwen, seven, and wanted balls that would not travel too far when you ‘really whack’ them. The Prime Minister is looking forward to a festive break from the cut and thrust of political life . Speaking to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire about what he wanted for Christmas he said: ‘A bit of peace and quiet would be quite a nice thing but you can never bank on that in this job.’ He added: ‘I want some squidgy tennis balls. I have started playing tennis with my son. ‘I would like those ones which you can really whack and they don't go very far. ‘If Santa's listening, you can get them down the chimney pretty easily and there will be a very happy recipient at the other end.’ Mr Cameron was yesterday forced to . defend his decision to pose for a light-hearted ‘selfie’ in the middle . of Nelson Mandela’s memorial service – by claiming he was only being . polite. The . Prime Minister said the snap with U.S. President Barack Obama and . Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt was proof that even in death . Mandela was ‘bringing people together’. Miss . Thorning-Schmidt is the daughter-in-law  of former Labour leader Neil . Kinnock, and when she asked for a group photo it was ‘it was only polite . to say yes’, Mr Cameron told MPs. Mr Cameron was challenged over the . photo at Prime Minister’s Questions by Liberal Democrat MP Martin . Horwood, who asked him: ‘Has the Prime Minister had the opportunity to . discuss international mobile phone usage with any other European heads . of government over the last day or so?’ To laughter from MPs, Mr . Cameron replied: ‘You could say, in a roundabout way. Perhaps in my . defence, you should always remember that the television cameras are . always on. ‘But in my . defence I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in . his life and in his death in bringing people together. 'So of course when . a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it . was only polite to say yes.' The polite thing to do: David Cameron has defended posing for this selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service, saying it was proof the late leader was still 'bringing people together' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also came to Mr Cameron's defence today. Speaking on his radio phone-in on LBC . 97.3, Mr Clegg said: 'I know some people aren't happy about it. I think it was . a bit of friendly light-hearted joking around by the three of them.

The names, dates of birth and immigration status of 1,598 immigrants involved with the family returns process were revealed on the government’s website. In a written statement to Parliament, . immigration minister Mark Harper said measures have been put in place to . prevent the error from happening again. Labour condemned the ‘staggering level of incompetence‘ at the Home Office after the data was left on public view for almost two weeks. The Information Commissioner has been called in to examine the data breach and the Home Office has ordered an internal investigation. The details were available in error between October 15 and October 28 and were taken down by department officials when the mistake was identified. The information did not include personal addresses or financial information. Fewer than 30 visits were made to the relevant webpage and the Home Office believes the risk to those whose personal information was accessible for the period is ‘low’.

He said: ‘This breach yet again raises serious questions about the departments' ability to function adequately. ‘The Home Affairs Committee recently scolded the Home Office for taking months to reply to our correspondence, yet it seems in just seconds they were able to release this private data. ‘We will be seeking assurances from the Home Office that they are looking carefully at their reporting systems.

Among other measures, the process involves helping families return home through conferences, providing notice to families who are required to leave and dealing with those who refuse to depart the UK. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘It is a staggering level of incompetence in the Home Office that has let the personal data of nearly 1,600 people be put on the internet for anyone to download, and yet again shows just how chaotic the Home Office is under this Government. ‘People need to be able to trust the Home Office to process their immigration applications efficiently and confidentially but this huge breach of data security seriously undermines that. ‘Ministers need to provide answers about how this was able to happen and whether people's data is still at risk, and Theresa May needs to take urgent action to stop the incompetence on her watch.’","Information Commissioner called in to examine how breach happened .

Brave: Police constable Andrew Reid, 49, was kidnapped and pistol-whipped on duty but stabbed himself through the heart two weeks after retiring, an inquest heard . A policeman who was taken hostage and pistol-whipped on duty 20 years ago stabbed himself through the heart just two weeks after retirement, an inquest heard. PC Andrew Reid's suicide was linked to depression and came almost 20 years after he was kidnapped. He suffered serious injuries and needed eye surgery but still completed 31 years of distinguished service with Thames Valley Police. But two weeks after his retirement he was found lying in a pool of blood, having stabbed himself four times, once in the heart. The coroner heard that Pc Reid had suffered 'psychological and physical injuries' by having to undergo surgery to his damaged right eye after being pistol-whipped in 1995. The 49-year-old was found dead his shocked mother Yolanda in the home they shared together in May. The former Thames Valley Police officer, based in Oxford, had inflicted the stab wounds with a kitchen knife and was pronounced dead at the scene. No suicide note was ever found, the hearing was told. Pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt took the coroner through his understanding of the background to the case at the inquest in Oxford. 'Before carrying out the post-mortem examination I was given information on the background from the police,' he said. 'At 8.14am on May 21, Yolanda Reid, aged 75 years, had called both 999 and her GP surgery,' he said. 'During the call to the GP surgery she said her son was laying in a pool of blood and asked what she should do. 'Paramedics were shown into a utility area near the kitchen. He was found on his right side with his knees in a bent position. 'There was a large amount of blood on the floor and blood staining on the wall. The rear door was secured and there was no sign of forced entry. 'Inquires at his GP surgery showed he may have suffered depression after an incident when he was taken hostage while on duty in 1995. He had been taken anti-depressant drugs for some time.' Excellence: PC Andrew Reid completed 31 years of distinguished service with Thames Valley Police , based in Oxford, pictured . Dr Hunt added: 'The injuries were in two groups. Firstly the injuries caused by a sharp object and secondly the blunt injuries. 'There were four stab injuries. One penetrated the heart. The other the aorta. Three were deep, one was superficial. 'There were also 12 pin-prick stab injuries. Tragedy: PC Reid was found dead by his mother, having stabbed himself through the heart after suffering depression . 'He died as a result of stab wounds. Whilst there were injuries entirely consistent with self-infliction.' Detective Sergeant Simon Hannam, an officer involved in the case, attended the death scene. In a statement to the inquest he said: 'When I arrived I could see no signs of a disturbance. The deceased was lying on his side with his feet towards the kitchen door and there was a large amount of blood in the area of the floor. 'His clothes were heavily bloodstained. 'He was dressed like he was going for a run or a cycle ride. There was no sign of blood in the rear garden. 'There was no evidence of any third party involvement.' Det. Sgt. Hannam added: 'He was a serving police officer until he retired two weeks ago of 31 years service. 'On February 6 1995 he was a victim of a hostage situation in which he was pistol-whipped and received physical and psychological injuries. 'His GP Dr Mervin Dunlop spoke of him having depression for more 20 years, which ties into the 1995 incident. 'He was taken to hospital in relation to that incident. 'He suffered severe swelling to his right eye, which required surgery. 'In April of that year a meeting was arranged with Pc Reid for the person invoilved wanting to apologise. This meeting was refused.' Assistant Oxfordshire Coroner Nick Graham said: 'The report shows some very brave actions of Mr Reid, who was carrying out his duty.' The coroner ruled that Mr Reid, of Headington, Oxford, who was never married and had no children, died as a result of a suicide on May 21, 2013. Recording his verdict, the coroner said: 'On the basis of the evidence I have heard I feel that I can reach a conclusion that Mr Reid took his own life given the nature of the injuries, the lack of any third party involvement, no foul play and a history of depression.' His family declined to comment after the hearing.

Flush British Gas bosses have splurged £10,000 on a festive Alton Towers 'jolly' for staff in charge of cutting off customers who cannot afford to pay their bills. Warrant officers - who can break into homes to shut off the power - were sent to the Staffordshire theme park to learn how to cope with irate customers after the energy giant's 9.2 per cent price hike. In return they were put up in a £60-a-night hotel and enjoyed a three-course meal in a function room decked out in fairy lights and sprinkled with fake snow. Training: British Gas sent 80 people from their debt team to Alton Towers (pictured) to learn how to cope with customers irate about the energy giant's 9.2% price hike . Around 80 'debt team' staff had to attend a series of seminars over two days, British Gas said. Campaigners against fuel poverty today accused 'disgraceful' British Gas of 'rewarding those responsible for condemning people to poor health and death'. 'It beggar's belief that the company is still spending . money on parties and hotel rooms for staff when customers are finding it . so hard to pay their bills. It's extra insulting when the staff being . wined and dined are the ones who cut people off,' a company insider told the Mirror. Fuel Poverty Action added: 'Taking staff on a jolly may be fun for them but millions are facing a cold harsh winter.' Track record: Last month British Gas sent customer service staff on a £20,000 'morale boosting' trip to a hotel for a talent show . Warrant officers are a form of bailiff, who are given permission by magistrates to break into a home if the householder or landlord has failed to pay his bills for a prolonged period. They then cut off the electricity or gas. British Gas said today that the staff from all over Britain were at Alton Towers. 'The two day event at the Alton Towers conference centre consisted of seven seminars for our field based debt team. The staff involved in the training live around the country so we provided them with accommodation and a meal, after which they bought their own drinks,' a spokesman said. It came three weeks after the company sent workers on a £20,000 'morale boosting' talent show at another hotel. Yesterday official figures revealed the spending of the average family has fallen by £18.40 a week since 2010, mainly because of spiralling energy bills. The Office for National Statistics said families have cut back on driving and going out to restaurants to pay for gas and electricity. Researchers said that higher spending in ‘housing, fuel and power’ was ‘driven in part by rises in electricity and gas prices, and this is an area where there may be limited scope for many households to reduce consumption’.","Warrant officers - who cut off supplies - enjoyed hotels stay and banquet .

A 63-year-old man is desperately trying to reconnect with his first love after a severe bump on the head rekindled his feelings for her. George Eyres was in a relationship with Sylvia Holland for four years before his family moved to Ireland in the early 1970s, meaning the couple lost contact. Nearly four decades on, after a head injury brought memories of her flooding back, Mr Eyres would like to reacquaint himself with his long-lost love, who he never really got over. George Eyres is trying to reconnect with his first love after a bump on the head rekindled his feelings for her . After the 2010 incident, Mr Eyres underwent an operation to reduce bleeding on his brain and was warned he might lose all of his memories. Instead, the injuries rekindled his feelings for his long-lost love – and he has put an advert in his local newspaper asking for her to get in touch. Mr Eyres, who lives in County Meath, said: ‘I’m not sure why we broke up. I’ve regretted not being with her my whole life. It’s only when the memories came back that I realised how much. ‘She would be 61 now and I just want a . chance to get in touch with her. I would love to talk to her and know . what happened to her. ‘She probably got married and maybe she had children. All I know is that her mother wrote to me that all her dreams came true.’ This picture shows Mr Eyres with his then girlfriend, Sylvia Holland, when they were together in the 1970s . The pair were an item for four years when they lived next door to each other in Swindon, Wiltshire. She visited him once for a three week holiday in Ireland, but they then lost touch. He said: ‘I was a little bit older than Sylvia - she was 19 and I was 20 or 21 years old. ‘We’d been together for three or four years when I went back to Ireland. I didn’t want to go and I was reluctant to leave her. ‘When she came for three weeks, I was struggling financially and I couldn’t go back to Swindon. ‘I wanted to do well in life before I went back. And that was the last time I ever saw her. ‘I had a couple of relationships but nothing compared to what I had with Sylvia. I never really got over her.’ Mr Eyres was injured in October 2010 when he slipped on a wet patch of road when he was walking between two parked cars. He said: ‘It was the weirdest feeling. I was half-conscious and the only way I can describe it was as though my head was a ton of bricks.’ He was rushed for an emergency operation to reduce bleeding on his brain and spent three weeks in hospital recovering. Retired George, who worked as a baggage handler at Dublin Airport, said: ‘The surgeon told me I might forget things but it was the total opposite. ‘I could remember things I thought I had forgotten. I could remember Sylvia's facial expressions, the way she used to cover her top lip over her bottom lip when she was shy. ‘She was very shy sometimes back then, but I found it quite endearing.’ He placed the advert in the Swindon Advertiser to track her down last Friday. He added: ‘I know she is probably married now, and I don't want to cause a fuss or anything, but when I stopped hearing from her mother a few years ago, I feared the worst and it would be nice to just catch up with Sylvia and find out how her life turned out.'","George Eyres, 63, was in a relationship with Sylvia Holland when he was 21 .

The family of a murder victim have hit out at the 'odious' Jeremy Kyle Show after they say they were twice invited to confront the wife of his killer on television. Timmy Wallace, 24, was brutally beaten and tortured by his friend Kevin Gibson before his body was bundled into a suitcase and dumped in the Water of Leith in 2003. Mr Wallace's family say they were first contacted by producers of the ITV show when Gibson, who is serving a 15 year sentence, was allowed to marry and again when he announced he would sue for the right to have conjugal visits with wife Louise Kennedy. Anger: The family of murder victim Timmy Wallace have hit out at the 'odious' Jeremy Kyle Show (pictured) after they were twice invited to confront the wife of his killer Kevin Gibson . Mr Wallace's stepfather, Martin Edmunds has criticised the attempts to convince his family to appear on television with Ms Kennedy, describing the show as 'odious'. He said the family would never agree to go on the controversial programme and discuss Mr Wallace's murder. Mr Edmunds said he had first been approached by producers working for the Jeremy Kyle Show in 2012 when Gibson was allowed to marry Ms Kennedy. He was contacted again by a production company, who he understood to be working for the show, when the issue of conjugal rights surfaced. 'To be honest, I didn’t give the matter much thought as I was not interested in doing it whatsoever,' he told the Daily Record. Victim: Timmy Wallace was brutally beaten and tortured by his friend Kevin Gibson before his body was bundled into a suitcase and dumped . 'I do not mind speaking to newspapers and giving my views on the issue . but when it is used for cheap TV entertainment then it’s not for me.' A spokesman from the Jeremy Kyle Show said there was no record of Mr Edmunds being asked onto the programme. 'We have no record of approaching Mr Edmunds to appear on on the show,' she said. 'Furthermore, we do not use outside profuction companies to approach potential guests on our behalf.' This week Gibson was awarded financial assistance, enabling his lawyers to launch a full legal aid bid to fund his fight for the right to have sex with his wife in prison. He has argued that Scottish Prison Service’s refusal to allow conjugal visits breaches his human rights to have a child with 32-year-old Ms Kennedy and start a family. He was engaged to Ms Kennedy when he was on remand for the murder, but they split up after he was sentenced. The couple rekindled the relationship and were married last year at a service inside Addiewell Prison, West Lothian, where Gibson is serving his sentence. Gibson has been awarded taxpayers’ money for 'advice and assistance' so the couple's lawyers, Taylor & Kelly, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, can start preparing a case for legal aid support. Mr Edmunds, from Galashiels, . Selkirkshire, Scotland, has hit out at the Scottish Legal Aid . Board, accusing them of failing crime victims and their families. 'I find the show odious but having heard about the legal aid award perhaps I should have gone on TV,' he said. The family have not received any compensation for the death, and Mr Edmunds said he will fight to stop Gibson's legal battle. He said it was wrong that Gibson should be allowed to start a family, having denied Mr Wallace the same opportunity, and that the state should not help to create single parent families. He added: 'I find it laughably ironic that a killer will receive thousands of . pounds in public money to pursue this disgraceful action which, if . successful, will open the floodgates for other criminals to have access . to conjugal visits, which are currently not allowed in Scottish jails, . or IVF treatment.' Appalled: Mr Wallace's stepfather, Martin Edmunds (pictured) has criticised the attempts to convince his family to appear on television with Ms Kennedy, describing the Jeremy Kyle Show as 'odious' Mr Edmunds, who works as a JobCentre clerk said that as a civil servant his employers would not approve of him agreeing to appear on the programme. He said he believed the shows had not been made, and he had not discussed the issue of payment with the production company. Heroin addict Gibson was living in . the same homeless hostel as 'trusting and vulnerable' Mr Wallace when he . attacked him; punching, kicking and stamping on his victim as well as . hitting him with a belt. He . then threw boiling water over Mr Wallace, who walked with a limp after . suffering meningitis as a child, before putting the body into the . suitcase, which he threw over a bridge. He was found guilty of murder in April 2004 after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. Couple: Killer Kevin Gibson (left), and wife Louise Kennedy (right), who married in prison, believe they should be allowed conjugal visits, allowing them to start a family . Mr Edmunds, who attended court every day during the trial said he had written to his MP Michael Moore and MSP Christine Grahame, asking them to support his campaign to stop Gibson from being allowed the right to start a family. A spokesman from the Scottish Legal Aid Board told MailOnline: 'Advice and Assistance has been granted by Kevin Gibson’s solicitor to prepare an application for legal aid. 'The Scottish Legal Aid Board has not received an application for civil legal aid in regard to this case. 'When considering the grounds for approving a legal aid application of this kind, we look at whether there are fundamental human rights issues that have not been heard before in a Scottish court. 'The background of applicants is not a part of the process to test how the case sits with European Court of Human Rights provisions.'","Timmy Wallace, 24, was beaten and tortured by killer Kevin Gibson in 2003 .

A new two-part drama series will tell the story of the 'crime of the century' through the eyes of the criminals and the police whose job it was to bring them to justice. To mark the 50th anniversary of the Great Train Robbery, the BBC has taken a fresh look at the untold story behind the well-known folklore. The country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed, just 35 miles from its London destination in August 1963. A 15-strong gang launched a raid on the overnight service from Glasgow at the Bridego Railway Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire in the early hours of August 8. The cast of A Robber's Tale, play the gang responsible for plotting and carrying out the Great Train Robbery in August 1963. Centre is actor Luke Evans, who plays mastermind of the crime, Bruce Reynolds . The cast of A Copper's Tale, including DCI Bradbury played by John Salthouse, left, DI Williams played by Robert Glenister, second left, DCS Tommy Butler played by Jim Broadbent, centre, and DS Slipper played by Nick Moran . Led by the charismatic Bruce Reynolds, who is played by bright actor Luke Evans, 34, the group of mid-level criminals and a corrupt solicitor pulled off the infamous heist, making off with £2.6million. The bulk of the huge haul of money was never recovered. The gang fled the scene, seeking shelter at Leatherslade Farm. It was after police officers uncovered their hideout that incriminating evidence led to the arrest and conviction of most of the gang. Leader Reynolds escaped the law for five years after going on the run, but was eventually tracked down and jailed for 25 years in 1969. The mysterious crime baffled and frustrated police, but thrilled the general public with the press hailing the gang 'plucky heroes'. The first film, A Robber's Tale, focuses on the story of Bruce Reynolds as he masterminds the raid on the Royal Mail train. It is followed by the second installment, A Copper's Tale, telling the story from the perspective of DCS Tommy Butler, the police officer leading the investigation aimed at bringing the gang to justice. The films, written by Chris Chibnell - the man behind the hit ITV drama Broadchurch - will be shown on BBC One on consecutive nights next week. In a scene from the production, the train robbers can be seen hauling the £2.6million from the London-bound Royal Mail train . The 'crime of the century' was masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, played in the BBC production by Luke Evans, 34 . The first installment, A Robber's Tale, will examine the planning and preparation in the lead up to the great heist in August 1963. Reynolds, right, is seen with fellow gang member Charlie Wilson, left, played by Jack Roth . The Torchwood and Doctor Who writer, said his depiction aims to tell the untold side of the much-debated crime. He said: 'It is a piece of modern folklore so you grow up knowing there was this extraordinary event. 'I was born in 1970, so it was seven years before I was born but I always knew of its place in British history but also there is a sense of myth to it as well.' 'I had always known the general sense of the story but when I started to research both these films I had a much greater sense of the detail of it,' he added. 'What's happened in the ensuing years is the stories of the escapes, the journey to Rio, all the stuff that happened after they were sent to prison, most of the attention has gone on that side of the story. 'Whereas I think the detail of the planning and the detail of how the robbery took place and what happened afterwards has been absolutely lost. 'That is what excited me when I was researching it, to go there is a huge story here. The robbery was well-rehearsed and thoroughly planned. The gang targeted the overnight Glasgow to London Royal Mail train, striking at Ledburn in Buckinghamshire . Bruce Reynolds, played by actor Luke Evans, spent five years on the run before being jailed for 25 years in 1969. He was released in 1978 . Mastermind behind the Great Train Robbery, Bruce Reynolds, left, and fellow gang member Ronnie Biggs, right . Buster Edwards, left, and Bob Welch, right, were also among the 15-strong gang of robbers which made off with £2.6million . 'There is a huge story on the side of the guys who carried out the robbery and actually the absolutely untold story of the Flying Squad, the story of Tommy Butler, a guy who never gave a press interview, and his team of policemen who took the robbers down. 'There is a huge side of the story that I thought I don't know about, and I have certainly never seen it told in a drama... so that was the thrilling thing. Speaking to the BBC about his role, he said: 'In real life the great train robbers spent a lot of time with each other, so what you are very aware of is that they would never ever do anybody in.'They never gave up names of the crew – even if they went to prison. So there was this camaraderie, this real sense of friendship between them. So we [the cast] hung out a lot.'The first film sees what happens as the robbers retreated to a farmhouse to divide up their stash and keep a low profile. The second installment sees Jim Broadbent, pictured, take on the role of DCI Tommy Butler . Chief Superintendent Tommy Butler led the Flying Squad, the team who worked to bring the Great Train robbers to justice . It also explores the fall-out after driver, Jack Mills, got hurt and why even their best laid plans had to be changed causing some members to be on the run for the rest of their lives.In one of the stills, the robbers are seen forming a human chain to unload the bags, carrying the money which is the equivalent to £40 million today.The story is then turned on its head as DSC Tommy Butler, played by Jim Broadbent, gets to work with six of the best officers from across London.Speaking about taking on a real life figure, Jim said: 'In some ways it’s a challenge and in some ways it’s a great help because you’ve got the research you can do, archive footage, documented material.Adding: 'Interrogation scenes are always nice to do in a way, particularly with a good script and good actors. It was fascinating how all the interrogations varied with different characters.'Though Reynolds was undoubtedly the gang’s leader, it was Ronnie Biggs, a relatively minor player, who would achieve the greater fame during the decades he spent on the run.‘When I took on the role of Biggs,’ says actor Jack Gordon, ‘I only knew about him from reading about his antics in the tabloids.'During filming my affection for him grew and grew. I’ve come to see that, even though he was a criminal, he was no monster. He was a decent bloke, a committed family man. People enjoyed his company. He was a chancer.'The Great Train Robbery: A Robber's Tale and A Copper's Tale will be shown on BBC1 on December 18 and 19 at 8pm.

The RAF has carried out unmanned drone missions against the Taliban from British soil for the first time. In an escalation of the war in Afghanistan, raids on extremists were flown by 13 Squadron, operating out of RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. The hi-tech Reaper drones are primarily used to gather intelligence on enemy activity on the ground, but they also carry 500lb bombs and Hellfire missiles for precision strikes on insurgents. Controversy: RAF crews controlling armed Reaper drones in Afghanistan are doing so from British soil for the first time, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed . Until this week, RAF crews who control armed drones in Afghanistan have been operating from the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. An MoD spokesman said they had been carrying out missions including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, but would not comment on exactly what individual missions had been flown in the past week by drones piloted from the UK. The pilots in Lincolnshire are operating with British and American colleagues still based in Nevada - but having drone operators in a different time zone makes it easier to coordinate shift patterns and conduct 24 hour operations. The UK currently has five Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles but Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed in 2010 that the fleet of Reaper aircraft would expand. The Reaper is the more powerful version of the lethal Predator, a 27ft long drone armed with Hellfire missiles and equipped with an infrared camera capable of identifying a human on the ground from 10,000ft in the air. Drones: RAF-controlled Reaper drones are used to gather intelligence on the ground in Afghanistan, but also carry 500lb bombs and Hellfire missiles for precision strikes (file photo) Last year the Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced that the UK was doubling the number of armed RAF drones in Afghanistan to 10. Delivery of the new aircraft is expected this summer. The move is controversial since American drone strikes are blamed for killing innocent civilians. The Ministry of Defence will only confirm one incident of civilian casualties involving British aircraft, when innocent people were killed by the blast of a missile that also killed two insurgents. An MoD spokesman said: ‘13 Squadron have commenced supporting ISAF and Afghan ground troops in Afghanistan with armed intelligence and surveillance missions, which are remotely piloted from RAF Waddington.’ Anti-war protestors are set to gather outside the base today to call for a ban on the 'killer' drones, claiming the Government is using them to 'fight wars behind our backs'. Members of the Stop The War Coalition, CND, the Drone Campaign Network and War on Want marched to RAF Waddington from Lincoln today to protest against the drones. The organisers of the protest march and rally are calling on the Government to abandon the use of drones, claiming they make it easier for politicians to launch military interventions, and have increased civilian casualties. Around 400 demonstrators took part today's March to the base, which assumed control of British drone missions in Afghanistan earlier this week. The protesters cheered calls for the international community to emulate action taken against cluster munitions by outlawing armed drones. 'Killer' drones: The use of drones like the lethal U.S. Predator - which is loaded with Hellfire anti-tank missiles - has been condemned by anti-war campaigners . Protest: Hundreds of protestors marched on the base in Lincolnshire today to voice their opposition to the lethal drones . 'Ground the drones': Protestors said the use of the drones raised serious moral, ethical and legal questions . Chris Cole, a co-ordinator of the . Drone Campaign Network, said the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to wage war raised numerous legal, ethical and moral issues. Speaking near Waddington's perimeter . fence, Mr Cole said: 'This is the new home of drone warfare in the UK . and there are questions about the growing use of these armed, unmanned . systems. 'Because of their remote nature, . there is no risk to any of our forces and that makes it easier to launch . weapons and makes it much easier for politicians to get involved in . warfare,' he added. Commenting ahead of the protest, War on Want senior campaigns officer Rafeef Ziadah said: 'Drones, controlled far away from conflict zones, ease politicians' decisions to launch military strikes and order extrajudicial assassinations, without democratic oversight or accountability to the public. 'Now is the time to ban killer drones - before it is too late.' Chris Nineham, vice-chairman of the Stop the War Coalition, claimed drones were being used to continue the 'deeply unpopular War on Terror' with no public scrutiny. Conflict: The UK and the U.S. are operating unmanned drones in the skies over Afghanistan . Calling for armed drones to be banned, Mr Nineham said: 'They're using them to fight wars behind our backs.' The Ministry of Defence has defended its use of drones in Afghanistan, which it says have saved the lives of countless military personnel and civilians. An MoD spokesman said: 'UK Reaper aircraft are piloted by highly trained professional military pilots who adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement which apply to traditionally manned RAF aircraft.' Lincolnshire Police held talks with the organisers of the protest to minimise disruption to the local community. The route of the march from South Common along the A15 to the peace camp site opposite RAF Waddington saw the road closed in phases to limit inconvenience to motorists. Its new role in the war on terror is not the first time RAF Waddington has been at the heart of Britain's fight against foreign enemies. Squadrons flew out from RAF Waddington on the first day of the Second World War, and more than 40 years later the base would provide the Vulcan aircraft that bombed Port Stanley during the Falklands conflict. Today, RAF personnel based at Waddington are controlling unmanned drones in the skies above Afghanistan in a bid to gather intelligence on enemy insurgents. Historic: A squadron lines up in front of an Avro Vulcan bomber at RAF Waddington in 1982 . Over the decades the rural base has housed aircraft that played a crucial role in British military operations; from the Bristol Blenheim to the V-bomber nuclear strike force. RAF Waddington first opened in November 1916 as a flying training station, teaching hundreds of British and U.S. Army pilots to fly in a wide range of aircraft. Four years later the station was designated for care and maintenance, until a major RAF expansion began in 1934. That expansion saw the construction of some hangars which remain in use to this day. In March 1937 Waddington was re-opened as a bomber base, and became the home of squadrons flying the light bomber aircraft the Bristol Blenheim, which was later replaced by twin-engine Handley Page Hampden bombers. Arsenal: RAF Waddington was home to the Bristol Blenheim, a light bomber aircraft used extensively in the early days of the Second World War . In 1939 both Waddington squadrons; 44 and 50, were in action on the first day of World War II, attempting to bomb the German Navy at Keil. During the Battle of Britain, Waddington's Hampden aircraft bombed German invasion barges anchored in English Channel ports. The Hampdens were eventually replaced by Avro Manchesters, before the superior Avro Lancasters entered RAF service for the first time with 44 Squadron at Waddington in 1941. It was with this unit that Squadron leader John Nettleton earned the Victoria Cross in June 1942, after heading up an attack on a German U-boat engine factory. Waddington saw further modernisation in 1943 with the introduction of concrete runways, after which two Royal Australian Air Force Lancaster squadrons took up residence at the base. The final WWII raid from Waddington - which targeted an oil refinery at Tonsberg in Norway - took place in April 1945, just months before the war came to an end. 21st Century: Today Waddington is home to six badged RAF squadrons, members of which are seen being greeted by the deputy prime minister following their return from a mission in Libya in 2011 . In the years that followed Waddington hosted a range of Lancaster and Avro Lincoln squadrons, before being put into maintenance once again in 1953 to prepare the base for the V-bomber - the aircraft that comprised the UK's strategic nuclear strike force during the '50s and '60s. The V-bomber class included the famous Vulcan - the RAF's jet-powered delta wing aircraft. By 1961 Waddington housed three squadrons of Vulcans, and the aircraft would remain a fixture at the base until March 1984, its planned retirement having been postponed as a result of the Falklands conflict. Once again the Lincoln base was at the heart of the UK's military strategy; providing the Vulcans that bombed Port Stanley and also those hastily modified for air-to-air refuelling duties.","Afghan raids being controlled by crews operating out of RAF Waddington .

He said: 'I was just flicking through the TV channels when suddenly Babestation came on. 'I carried on and there were a couple more not blocked - I was shocked.' The man said he was told by staff that all children were supervised, but he claimed many did spend time alone in their rooms.

A cure for dementia or a drug that can halt the disease in its tracks will be available by 2025, the Prime Minister has said. David Cameron has pledged to double the amount that is spent on research into the devastating illness and to help speed up the development of treatments. At a summit in London attended by the health ministers of the G8 nations – including the US, Canada, Japan and France – he said that a cure was ‘within our grasp’. Prime Minister David Cameron says that a cure for dementia is within reach . There are around 800,000 adults in Britain with dementia – and 44 million worldwide – but these numbers are predicted to double in the next 40 years as the population ages. But despite the vast numbers affected, there are only a handful of treatments available, and these only temporarily slow the advance of the disease. The Prime Minister yesterday unveiled a package of measures, with the health ministers of G8 states promising to share more research across national boundaries and to  cut the bureaucratic hurdles which delay treatments becoming available to patients. A drug which would stop dementia in its tracks could soon be on the market . Mr Cameron told the summit in central London yesterday: ‘This disease steals lives, wrecks families and breaks hearts. ‘If we are to beat dementia, we must also work globally, with nations, business and scientists from all over the world working together as we did with cancer, and with HIV and Aids.’ He added: ‘This is going to be a  bigger and bigger issue, the key is to keep pushing. The challenge is huge and we are a long way from a cure, but there is hope.’ Last week, researchers from University College London said they hoped that a monthly jab capable of halting dementia in its tracks could become available within the next five years. The drug – solanezumab – is in trials and could be given to patients even before symptoms have developed if the disease is picked up in scans. And yesterday a brain scan capable of accurately diagnosing Alzheimer’s became available on the NHS for the first time. The test – which costs £810 – distinguishes the illness from other forms of dementia, meaning patients can be given the most effective treatments. Ministers hope they can speed up the time it takes for drugs to come on to the market by removing some of the unnecessary safety checks and regulations. It can take at least ten years for drugs to be offered to patients after they are first developed – but politicians believe this could be slashed to two or three. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was also at yesterday’s summit, said: ‘The amount going into research is too little. ‘We would like a cure to be available by 2025. It’s a big, big ambition to have. If we don’t aim for the stars we won’t land on the moon.’ There are 800,000 adults suffering from dementia in Britain today (file photo) Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘The UK has demonstrated global leadership on tackling dementia. ‘We have committed to a global plan, better support for people with dementia through research, and the Prime Minister has agreed to narrow the funding gap between dementia and cancer research – something we have long campaigned for. ‘Dementia has come out of the shadows and is centre stage, but we must ensure G8 has a lasting legacy.’ Dementia is a progressive disease, meaning that symptoms cannot be reversed. Symptoms include loss of memory, mood changes, and trouble communicating. The most common types of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.","Prime Minister pledges to double the amount spent on research .

A 'spoilt, jealous mummy's boy' who throttled his model girlfriend before his parents tried to cover it up smashed his victim's head against a table in the 24 hours before he murdered her, it was revealed today. Newly released CCTV shows the moment controlling Elliot Turner, 20, attacked Emily Longley, 17, in a packed Bournemouth bar on the night before he strangled her. In a fit of rage the killer is then seen flinging a glass across the room while Emily's friends console her on the evening before she was choked to death in his bedroom. A new documentary, to be broadcast tonight, also contains the 999 call his mother made 40 minutes after Emily was found dead, which was a devious attempt to conceal her son's crime. Killer: 'Brash, flash, spoilt' ex-public schoolboy Elliot Turner, 20, choked Emily Longley in his room at his parents' home and then used his parents to cover it up . Anita Turner, 51, tried to claim that Miss Longley, may have been choked by a tight necklace, but in fact her child had gone 'absolutely nuts' and killed her in his bedroom. His father Leigh destroyed a letter his son wrote confessing to the crime. Turner's friends have spoken of his paranoia before he killed his girlfriend in May 2011, after a month where he became increasingly paranoid that she was seeing other men. On 'Mummy's Little Murderer' due to be broadcast on Channel Five tonight, Turner is shown as a maniac intent on killing her. Emily's father Mark told The Sun: 'It is horrifying to think someone put their arm around our daughter's neck and literally choked the life out of her. 'To think someone could put their hands on Emily, who would never hurt anyone, and do such a violent act to her, was awful.' Cover up: Leigh and Anita Turner helped to hide evidence that Emily had been murdered and were also jailed last year for protecting their spoilt son . The murderer had enjoyed a privileged life where his parents denied him nothing. Turner had been educated at a £12,000 private school, and as an adult would carry up to £1,000 cash on him to 'show off'. He also spent nights out in Bournemouth bars with his friends, who he called 'The Firm', drinking champagne and trying to seduce women. His parents were so wealthy they even paid £30,000 to send him to the Priory for rehab after he became addicted to cocaine and alcohol. After spending huge sums impressing women he met Emily, and considered her a 'trophy', his murder trial heard. But the model received admiring glances from other men and Turner could not cope, sending him spiralling into fits of rage. During their four-month relationship it later emerged he had bullied and physically abused her, before threatening to kill . her and other men who knew her in a series of texts and emails. In one note written by Emily to him said: 'I love you but don't say you'll kill me. You make me scared'. CCTV also reveals on one occasion he took a hammer into a nightclub to threaten another man he believed was attracted to his girlfriend. Guilty: Elliot Turner (left) strangled Miss Emily (right) in his bedroom during a drunken argument . Love note: A letter from Emily Longley to Turner said: 'I love you' but 'don't say you'll kill me' After he killed her Turner claimed that Emily had died in her sleep and his parents backed him up. A post-mortem was inconclusive and the 20-year-old was not charged. But police were suspicious and bugged his house, and his parents were heard discussing the conspiracy. Elliot said he 'lost it' that night and his mother said: 'We've done the right thing'. His father then said: 'Stop denying it. He f****** strangled her'. He was then arrested and Turner then claimed during the trial he acted . in self-defence when Emily attacked him and he grabbed her by the . throat for five or six seconds and he then woke up to find her dead in . his bed. Pictured together: Elliot Turner and Emily Longley, pictured in the days before her death. Behind the scenes he was controlling and abusing her . Bereft: Emily's parents Caroline and Mark. Caroline said  that Turner saw Emily as 'a trophy adorned on his arm' and were distraught that she tried to hide it from them . But the jury did not believe him and he was jailed for 20 years in May 2012. His arrogance was such that even . his own defence lawyer was forced to describe him as ‘brash, flash, . boastful, spoilt, volatile, obsessive, possessive and obsessed’. He will . serve a minimum of 16 years. His parents Leigh, 56, and Anita, 53, were jailed for 27 months, and were both released in September.

A seven-year-old schoolboy has died of meningitis becoming the second British child to die from the infection in the last week. The youngster, who was a pupil at a primary school in the West Midlands, died in hospital on Monday after contracting meningococcal disease, according to a council spokesman. His death is likely to raise fears among parents following the death of another child in Berkshire last week but health officials have moved to reassure parents the risks of developing meningitis are rare. The boy was a pupil at Little Bloxwich Church of England Primary School in Walsall, above . The boy, who has not been named, was a pupil at Little Bloxwich C of E Primary School in Walsall. A statement released on behalf of Walsall Council said it was working to support the school and also reassure other parents over any public health concerns. A spokesperson for the Council said: 'Members of Walsall Council's cabinet have tonight sent their deepest sympathies to the family and friends of a seven-year-old who has passed away after contracting meningococcal disease. 'The council and Public Health England are liaising closely with parents and the school community - who are understandably shocked and anxious at this difficult time - to reassure them that while this is an extremely tragic case, it is very rare.' The boy was treated at Walsall Manor Hospital and later transferred to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent, where he died. Tests are still under way to establish which strain of the disease was involved, according to officials. There was a meeting . at the Grenfell Road site between health officials, support workers and . parents to discuss symptoms and the ongoing risk to other children. Anyone who came into close contact with the . youngster has been offered antibiotics and a letter has also been sent . to parents setting out the facts about the infection. Matt Croxall, . Meningitis Now's community support officer, said: 'There were a lot of . upset and anxious people at the school, but alongside the PHE team and . Children's Services, I was able to help dispel some myths and reassure . parents that although their concerns were understandable, any further . cases are highly unlikely and that there is no need for any panic.' He . added there would be further face-to-face support for 'what is an . extremely emotive and distressing situation for the school community'. Mr . Croxall added: ""Of course our immediate thoughts are with the little . boy's family, and I have passed on a letter via the school letting them . know that we are here if and when we are needed."" There . are two types of meningitis, bacterial and viral. Bacterial is the most . dangerous because it can cause septicemia - or blood poisoning, which . can be fatal.Most people . know to look out for a rash which doesn't fade when pressed against a . glass - but this is a later symptom and doesn't always appear.In . babies and very young children, early warning signs include being . floppy or unresponsive, vomiting or refusing food, and being very sleepy . and reluctant to wake up.The child may also develop a staring expression, pale or blotchy skin, and be irritable and not want to be held.Other symptoms can include having unusually cold hands and feet, blue lips, shivering, and pain in muscles or joints.If you detect any of the above symptoms with a fever, you are advised to call 999 immediately and request an ambulance.Later symptoms are drowsiness, confusion, seizures, sensitivity to bright lights, rapid breathing, and a rash.Viral meningitis can still be serious, but usually has mild flu-like symptoms. Dr Isabel Gillis, Walsall's director . of public health, said she was encouraging parents and carers, who know . their children best, to seek advice if they are at all concerned about . their health. She said: . 'Information, which has already been circulated to worried parents, can . be found on the Meningitis Now website at www.meningitisnow.org.' Dr . Gillis, colleagues for Public Health England, Meningitis Now and the . council's interim executive director of children's services, visited the . school yesterday to meet parents and staff, answer their questions and . offer support. The boy's death comes after another child died from meningitis in Berkshire last week. Windsor and Maidenhead Council confirmed the death of a student aged between 9-13 at Dedworth Middle School. As a precaution, antibiotics were offered to members of the child's family and others who had had close contact. The age and gender of the child has yet to be confirmed. After the case, the Department of Health said: 'Letters have been sent to parents of children attending the school informing them of the situation and reassuring them that the risk of any further cases is extremely low. 'The bacteria do not spread easily and those who have had prolonged, close contact with the person with meningitis/septicaemia are at a slightly greater risk of getting ill.' In October, a baby who fell ill on a flight to his first foreign holiday died hours later from suspected meningitis. Ten-month-old George Moore became poorly after arriving in Tunisia with his mother and grandparents. After appearing hot, lethargic and sleepy on landing, he was seen by the hotel doctor who recommended he go to hospital. But once there his condition deteriorated and despite the best efforts of medical staff he went into cardiac arrest and died. The schoolboy was rushed to Walsall manor hospital, above, after falling ill . His mother Emma Moore, 24, urged parents to be vigilant and told how the disease struck with shocking speed. Babies affected by the more dangerous bacterial form of the illness often know to look for a rash which doesn't fade when pressed against a glass, but this a late stage symptom which doesn't alwats appear. After the recent spate of deaths, parents have been urged to keep an eye out for overheating, a staring expression and unusual lethargy in their babies.","Primary school student is the second in a week to die from the disease .

Whenever those seasonal surveys come around about how much time women spend getting ready for Christmas parties (there was one recently, I think, that suggested it was something like 48 hours), everyone always misses the point. Getting ready is the fun part. My pre-party prep always begins with a bath and a sneaky 'dressing drink'. The ideal addition is Chanel No 5 Bath Oil (not because I particularly like Chanel No 5, but because the idea of bathing in it makes me feel glamorous) and a gin and tonic (Hendrick’s and Fever-tree) with ice and a slice of lime. Given that combination, I have been known not to bother going out at all. But assuming one must, it's good to plan ahead. Be prepared: Pre-party prep includes planning for the morning after . So before you've even decided which shoes to wear, prepare for the morning-after. Put a large glass of water by the bed, a couple of paracetamol, two Alka-Seltzer and a packet of Soap & Glory's Off Your Face Wipes (£4.50, boots.com). This little kit will come in extremely handy later on, when you roll back home smelling of illicit cigarettes (honeshtly, I never normally shmoke) and wine. The Face Wipes are particularly excellent because apart from being alcohol-free (and by now you are wishing you were, too) they will get the worst off without requiring much in the way of hand-eye co-ordination. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. A party is one of the few occasions when it's worth bothering with a primer, especially if there are photographs involved and you don’t want to look like you’ve been imbibing port since breakfast. Revlon PhotoReady Makeup (£11.99, boots.com) does a great job of controlling shine and glossing over open pores and fine lines, creating a matt, but moisturized canvas. I would do your foundation and concealer last, so you don’t have to worry about making a mistake. If you have the time and money, and if your diary is chock-a-block with parties, I would also consider investing in eyelash extensions. Done now, these should last well into the new year, and they will completely eliminate the need for mascara. Flutter (fluttereyes.co.uk) do an at-home service which spans the country and they can give you anything from the most subtle of sets to a full-on Strictly. They are very low-maintenance and lightweight, but the difference is remarkable. I get mine done twice a year, once around now and once in the summer. Christmas is the time of year when many women also decide to take the plunge and do a red lip. Again, if you know what you’re doing, great; if not, caution is advised. A bright red nail is just as festive, and a lot easier to carry off. But if you insist on red lipstick, be sure to use a liner. This is the difference between looking like a pro and a child who has gone mad with a crayon. Mac's High Energy Pro Longwear Lip Pencil (£14.50, maccosmetics.co.uk) coupled with Lipstick Queen's Brat Pack from the Velvet Rope collection (£35, spacenk.com) is a killer combination. Give yourself a few layers, blotting with a tissue in between (red lipstick on your glass isn't sexy, it's slutty), and top with a clear gloss for a super-glamorous finish. For an absolute fool-proof eyeliner, I would invest in one of Charlotte Tilbury's new Colour Chameleon pencils (£19, charlottetilbury.com). And now for the morning-after. My favourite cure for hangover face (puffy, baggy etc) is to suck on an ice cube. Get rid of any excess make-up and bring your skin back to life with GlamGlow Youth Mud (from £8, glamglowmud.co.uk), a ten-minute treatment mask that will tighten, brighten and generally put some life back into your face. Apply Cover FX Cream Concealer (£23, harveynichols.com). This water based, liquid cream concealer instantly erases under-eye circles, redness, dark spots and overindulgence damage, and makes you look like you’ve had 12 hours' sleep. Finish with a swirl of your favourite blusher, a large cup of hot sweet tea and, wherever possible, a sausage sandwich. It is the morning of my first training session with Mr Lean and Clean himself, super-celebrity trainer extraordinaire, James Duigan. With the help of a warm spoon, I manage to encase my lower body in the pair of Bodyism leggings (size L) that he kindly sent me. I have on my special new sports bra - and baggy old top, which I vainly hope conceals the worst. It doesn't. 'You're not taking me to school like that,' says my daughter. 'Why, what's wrong?' I reply as casually as I can while struggling to breathe. Whipping Sarah into shape: Personal trainer James Duigan . 'Seriously? Have you seen yourself?' I take a look in the hall mirror. She's right. We compromise: I will drop her, but do not get out of the car. Then it's straight to Duigan's gym at the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge before anyone else sees me. The atmosphere is a bit like one of those scary cocktail parties where everyone is either richer or thinner than you, or possibly both. Matters are not much helped by the fact that not only do all the clients look like supermodels, so do the trainers. Thankfully, Duigan himself looks rough. Really rough. He's just got back from Australia via a private client in Turkey, and he has jet-lag and a weepy eye. BEAUTY CRUSH... Shu Uemura Natural Brush 18R Red, £42, liberty.com . Every girl needs a good blusher/powder brush, and this is it. Those bright red bristles are also fabulously festive. BEAUTY FAIL... The Sanctuary Spa in Covent Garden . The spa is closing its doors next year. I remember when this was THE place to be seen. A shame…  but part of the decline in day spas. Physique like a demi-god, of course; but still, it's a crumb of hope. Our session starts with a glass of swamp water (chlorophyll) and hip and leg raises, which don't tax me unduly. I do the plank, then he puts an elastic band around my ankles and makes me walk up and down like a crab. All the while he chats away about this and that, a mixture of gossip, instructions and terrible jokes. The jokes are bad, but they break the ice, and soon we are nattering away like old friends. The exercises go by in a flash: he's attentive, but lets me find my own pace. Duigan's whole technique seems to be the opposite to most trainers, who are vocal about pushing yourself, always trying to get you to do more rep, one last squat. By contrast, Duigan seems non-judgemental, almost pathologically laid-back. His training style is fluid: if it isn't working, we move onto something else, always tweaking and changing. I've never encountered this sort of gym-nudge theory before. Before I know it, we are done, and I am sitting on a mat feeling rather pleased with myself and drinking a nice smoothie. I emerge awash with endorphins. I am so excited about the new me, I contemplate buying some proper gym kit in nearby Harrods. Thankfully, I catch sight of a rotund woman wearing an ill-advised pair of shiny black leggings in the shop window, and think better of it. There's still a very, very long way to go.","Getting ready is the fun part .

We were soulmates, best friends, inseparable, Darby and Joan. Anyone . observing my partner, Julia, and I together, so at ease with each . other, sharing so many interests - from drinking fine wine to long walks . in the sun - would have said we were prime candidates for matrimony, a . wedding waiting to happen. Yet something stalled the inevitable, and . kept on stalling it. Until now. Two weeks ago, Julia and I, with more . than 120 years on the clock between us, walked down the aisle. So what . took us so long? Just married: Max and Julia on their wedding day which took place after they had lived together for 20 years . Partly it was the caution born of experience. We had . both been married before, for 13 years apiece. When you have learnt the . hard way that marriage is no guarantee of living happily ever after, . you hesitate before taking the plunge again. Partly, also, it was . simple logistics. I am English and Julia is Australian, so we could not . have married in one hemisphere without disappointing loved ones in the . other. As the long years passed, compromises were pondered. Once we . found ourselves on a Greek island, outside a church, and toyed with . getting married then and there and telling people when we got home. Some . couples take that route. But mainly, if I am honest, it was apathy. Why bother? Why go to all the trouble and expense of organising a . ceremony whose significance, as we saw it, would be largely symbolic? Neither . of us was religious. Neither of us was minded to view marriage as a . solemn sacrament. We could not muster the enthusiasm to take a step that . did not seem particularly momentous. And we were not alone in our . apathy. Happy day: The couple loved taking centre stage as bride and groom . For in largely secular 21st-century Britain, nobody seems to . mind whether couples are married. Some people tie the knot, some don't, . just as some people smoke and some don't. And with more and more women . retaining their maiden names after marriage, and the wearing of rings . becoming ever more haphazard, there is often no way of telling if Bob . and Wendy are Mr and Mrs or Mr and Ms. Before, we had just been two people in the crowd. Now we . were the bride and groom, the centre of attention, principal actors in . an age-old drama which society invested with profound significance . Fifty years ago, people might . have tut-tutted and told us we were living in sin. Friends would have . taken me aside and urged me to make an honest woman of Julia. Nowadays . there is no such peer pressure because so many couples have taken the . same course as us. In the latest census figures, the number of unmarried . adults in the UK has crept ahead of the number of married ones for the . first time. One friend did urge me to get married, but only to save . money in death duties. There has been not a murmur of disapproval at our . living arrangements. We were 'partners', and happy with that . designation. Signing the register: But Max now knows being married is about more than just a piece of paper . So why now? I would like to say it was the result of . long, hard thought, but nothing could be further from the truth. When I . proposed to Julia - on holiday in France this summer - it was more . impulsive than premeditated. I simply suggested that, as we were flying . out to Australia for a wedding in November, we might as well get married . ourselves while we were out there. She agreed, in the same . matter-of-fact spirit. It was typical of our approach to life - simple, easy, calm. But there was nothing calm or matter-of-fact about what followed. The . prospect of marriage, and arranging our wedding, had a galvanising . effect. To the settled routine of our lives, it brought a sense of . soaring excitement that neither of us had foreseen. As we sketched . out our plans - a small wedding in Julia's birthplace of Melbourne, . followed by a big party in our home town of Oxford - and took others . into our confidence, we realised that we were surfing a tsunami of . goodwill. Before, we had just been two people in the crowd. Now we . were the bride and groom, the centre of attention, principal actors in . an age-old drama which society invested with profound significance. Soulmates: The couple, pictured in 1999, delayed marriage as they were found divorced and couldn't face organising a big wedding . The . first people we told were my two daughters from my first marriage, now . grown up. 'I never saw this one coming,' gasped the elder daughter. Her . sister let out a great yodel of excitement.

Did the fact that we were 30 years older . than the other couple in the shop, who were also buying a ring, make us . feel self-conscious? Not a bit . Some explosion! The excited phone calls, the tears, the whoops of joy, the clamour for . more details. 'How good that you have finally decided to join the . Establishment,' emailed one old friend, Lionel, who had just celebrated . his silver wedding anniversary. The tone was ironic but not the . sentiment. In free-and-easy 2013, married couples do not exactly feel . beleaguered, but they do vaguely worry that they are an endangered . species, fuddy-duddy in their attitudes. For Lionel, as for other . married friends, our decision to join the club was not just a cause for . celebration but a validation of their own lifestyle. As we threw . ourselves into planning the wedding, we not only found ourselves smiling . and giggling like a couple half our age, but realised how much pleasure . we were giving others. Our postman chortled when he heard the news. The local newsagent beamed his delight. Neighbours stopped us in the . street to congratulate us. It was if we suddenly possessed a magic aura. At the jewellers where we bought the ring, they insisted on serving us . bubbly at ten in the morning. Did the fact that we were 30 years older . than the other couple in the shop, who were also buying a ring, make us . feel self-conscious? Not a bit of it. Marriage makes no discrimination . on grounds of age. We were embarking on the same journey as the other . couple and enjoying the same following wind - the good wishes of people, . young and old, who thirst for a love story with a happy ending. Paradise: Max has discovered being husband and wife is better than being just partners (posed by models) I . dusted off my old suit, and Julia started shopping for a suitably funky . wedding dress. All low-key by some people's standards, but we felt . simultaneously self-conscious and quietly proud. The chorus of . congratulations was still ringing in our ears when we boarded the plane . for Melbourne. There were still arrangements to be finalised. We had . found a venue with an appropriately British feel but not briefed the . celebrant, the florist, the harpist, the chef, the sommelier or the rest . of the supporting cast. It was all pretty hectic and, having . promised friends in England we would make a video, we had to rush around . taking shots of kangaroos, surfers and barbecues to prove we’d married . in Australia and not the Home Counties. Organising even a small . wedding - ours was just 15 guests - involves so much time, trouble and . expense that you can see why some couples are put off the idea. But we . were buoyed by so much goodwill that the days before the wedding flew by . in a happy blur. The warmth of our welcome Down Under at least . matched the enthusiasm in England. Julia's 90-year-old mother was . thrilled for us. So were all her other relatives. As the big day loomed . and guests started to gather, I felt such boyish excitement. Outside I . may have looked like an old fuddy-duddy, inside I was a teenager again. SHE, in all her elegance and beauty, was marrying ME! Vintage vows . Britain’s longest wedded couple are Karam and Kartari Chand, from Bedford, who have been married for 86 years . The most . electrifying moment came shortly before the wedding. Of our guests, all . Australian, I was told I had met everyone except Garry, husband of one . of Julia's old university friends. 'You'll like Garry,' Julia assured . me. Like him? I loved him! 'Garry' turned out to be a cunning . disguise for my sister Claire who, unbeknown to me, had flown ten . thousand miles to be there. As I stared at her in amazement, I could . feel tears welling up in my eyes. And they welled up again later as I . intoned those ancient vows: '. . . for richer for poorer . . . in . sickness and in health... so long as we both shall live . . .' Julia . looked me in the eyes. I looked her in the eyes. The celebrant . pronounced us husband and wife. Guests applauded. Cameras clicked. What . had we done? It was certainly not something trivial or ephemeral. It . reverberated like thunder across the room. The day after the wedding, . we strolled along the beach. After the giddy emotions of the day . before, it was a time for sober reflection. How will marriage affect . our relationship? Will we be less inclined to take each other for . granted? Or more inclined? For simply by making such a public . commitment, we have altered the landscape of our lives. Cynics would say that nothing has changed. Somehow I hope we can prove the cynics wrong. A month ago we were mere partners. Now we are husband and wife. It feels like a promotion.","Max and Julia have finally tied the knot after living together for 20 years?

The Valleys star was stung by repeated jibes about her weight after she put on two stone filming the hit MTV show. The abuse peaked at the end of the last series when some viewers took to Twitter to taunt Carley over her figure. Slimming down: Carley Belmonte, who found fame on The Valleys, has lost 10lbs in a week at bootcamp . Before and after: Carley, pictured (L) before her weightloss and (R) after, decided to lose weight after cruel Twitter bullies branded her a 'whale' One said: 'You look like you've been blown up like a balloon.' Carley knew she needed to take action and checked into boot camp for a week of intensive, military style training. She slimmed down from 10st 12lbs to 10st 2lbs and lost 3.5. inches from her waist (9cms) and 2.5 inches (6.5cm) of fat from around her upper thighs. Speaking about her weightloss, Carley, 23, said: 'I feel like a new woman and it has taught me so much about staying in shape. 'My lifestyle has completely changed. I've swapped wine for water and biscuits for broccoli.' She had put on two stone starring in The Valleys because cast members are expected to party all the time during filming and eat fast food at all the wrong times. Carley said: 'You have got no time to go to the gym and you are eating rubbish all the time. 'I don't like myself when I am watching the show. I am not concentrating on how I am coming over - I'm just looking at the rolls of fat. 'It makes you so self-conscious, especially with all the cruel comments.'

Sending a Christmas card should be a chance to wish season's greetings and make vague promises to catch up in the New Year. But for political leaders it is increasingly a carefully choreographed, intensely observed photo opportunity to present themselves as a relaxed man of the people. Labour leader Ed Miliband today released his smart-casual festive offering, featuring his wife and sons in a pose which would not look out of place in a mail order catalogue. Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine take their children Daniel (left) and Sam (right) for a walk along Brighton beach, in a photograph chosen for his official Christmas card . The Miliband family portrait shows Mr Miliband and wife Justine with their sons Daniel and Samuel. It was taken during a walk along Brighton beach at the start of the Labour Party conference earlier this year as the family headed out to a play park before the heavy political agenda got under way. In smart trousers and a grey pullover, Mr Miliband appears to be straining to look relaxed. When the pictures were taken in September it was noted that they were markedly different to Gordon Brown’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children. But Labour strategists made clear that they wanted to give Mrs Miliband a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost. The release of the Labour leader's card comes after Number 10 revealed David Cameron’s three-year-old daughter Florence has been given a starring role in the Prime Minister’s official Christmas card - for the second time. Greeting: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha photographed with daughter Florence at 10 Downing Street for their 2013 Christmas card . The striking black and white portrait features Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hugging their daughter inside Number 10 in October. The card will be sent around the globe to world leaders and dignitaries, as well as to senior figures in the UK. Captured . by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the . Camerons’ youngest child gripping her father’s neck while she snuggles . against her mother. UKIP leader Nigel Farage . It . is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because . David Cameron has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving to . Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are . pixelated. Mr Cameron has opted for a photograph of . himself and wife Samantha each year since taking power in 2010, when . they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby Florence on the . steps of Number 10. The outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom does not take himself so seriously. After . a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments . about aid to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women being ‘sluts’ for not doing . the cleaning properly, the 64-year-old and his wife have posed for a . self-mocking Christmas card. Godfrey Bloom holds bongos in their Christmas card and wife Katie does her best 'slut' impression . The MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, . who quit the UK Independence Party in September to sit as an . independent, clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife . Katie is dressed as a ‘slut’. The . photo, taken in the kitchen of the couple’s house in a village near . Goole, East Yorkshire, will be on cards posted to friends and family. But his old boss, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, takes a very different view about the trend for political leaders to feature in their own cards. 'Rest assured, any cards sent from family Farage will be suitably festive rather than have my face on it,' he said. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond revealed his official Christmas card last week, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who . turned up too late to see Jesus. He opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson. Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card . The . artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned . whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive. Since 2007 Mr Salmond . has raised £148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the . original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card. Today . he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the . New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice . Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic . International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by . the artist. He insisted the image of Artaban is a ‘hugely appropriate’ work for his card. Mr Salmond said: ‘The legend of . Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the . vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to . herald the birth of the Christ child. ‘Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching. ‘Now . an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a . sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery. However, in a dying vision, Artaban is comforted that his devotion to . the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven. ‘The story reminds us that hope, faith and self-sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things.","Miliband family photograph taken during Labour party conference .

Theresa May tonight blocked a bid by the Labour MP Keith Vaz to conduct a high-profile interrogation of the boss of MI5. Mr Vaz had wanted his Westminster committee to be allowed to question Andrew Parker over the damage caused by the Guardian’s Edward Snowden revelations. The session would have been guaranteed enormous TV coverage and publicity. Theresa May has blocked a bid to publicly interrogate the boss of MI5 over the Edward Snowden leaks . But, to the fury of Mr Vaz, the Home Secretary has intervened to stop the committee’s plans. At the same time, Prime Minister David Cameron refused a similar request for the national security adviser to give evidence. Mr Vaz responded by threatening to haul Mrs May before his committee more often. The row centres on the decision by the Guardian to print intelligence secrets stolen by the fugitive US National Security Agency operative Snowden, who is currently holed-up in Russia. Keith Vaz wanted to question the head of MI5 over the impact that Guardian's publishing of the leaks had on the agency . Mr Parker says that, by disclosing surveillance techniques used by spies to monitor emails and the internet, the newspaper has handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and put lives at risk. Some Labour MPs are keen for him to give specific examples. In an historic first, Mr Parker – flanked by the heads of MI6 and GCHQ - gave evidence to Westminster’s Intelligence and Security Committee on the subject last month. The ISC is conducting its own probe into Snowden and yesterday announced a ‘call for evidence’ on whether the right balance is being struck between privacy and national security. Alan Rusbridger, the Editor of the Guardian newspaper, carried a copy of Peter Wright's book Spycatcher as he arrived to be questioned by the committee on December 3 . But Mr Vaz decided his committee should have its own turn at quizzing Mr Parker, and issued a formal invite last week. Mrs May, who is the Cabinet Minister in charge of MI5, yesterday intervened to block the request. She said any appearance would ‘duplicate’ the existing oversight provided by the ISC. A similar request for Kim Darroch, the Prime Minister’s security adviser, to give evidence was blocked by Mr Cameron. He said ‘it was not a good idea’ because Mr Darroch's role focused on providing private advice to him. The Home Office and Number Ten were concerned about setting a ‘precedent’ in which Mr Vaz and MPs could regularly haul security chiefs in front of the cameras. Mr Cameron said it should be left to the Home Secretary to give evidence to the MPs over the Snowden row. She is due to appear before Mr Vaz’s committee on Monday. Mr Vaz responded: ‘I am disappointed by the Prime Minister’s and Home Secretary’s responses, which are not helpful to the Committee’s inquiry into Counter Terrorism. ‘We cannot play pass the parcel on the issue of accountability on these important issues. ‘Ministers should take care not to dictate to Parliamentary Committees which witnesses can be called and for what reasons. Witnesses, no matter how senior, should not be afraid of answering questions from MPs. ‘As a result of this correspondence our session with the Home Secretary next Monday will be longer and more detailed than we originally anticipated, and she needs to prepare to come before the Committee more often.’ Former US spy agency contractor Edward Snowden who leaked classified information to The Guardian . Kat Craig, legal director at human rights charity Reprieve said: ‘This is a scandalous attempt by the Government to insulate itself and the security services from anything even approaching genuine accountability. ‘Theresa May’s claim that the Intelligence and Security Committee is providing real “oversight” would be laughable were it not so depressing. ‘This is a committee which has missed every scandal from UK complicity in rendition and torture to the more recent revelations on excessive surveillance.’","Keith Vaz wanted the committee to be able to question Andrew Parker .

The Mediterranean secret to longevity and a healthy heart is down to a simple tomato sauce, researchers believe. Sofrito - made out of tomato as the main ingredient along with onion, olive oil, corn flour and occasionally garlic - is eaten widely around the Med but scientists could help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Spanish researchers have found that tomato-based sauce contains as many as 40 antioxidants, called polyphenols, which are believed to protect the heart from 'oxidative stress.' To get the health benefits the ingredients have to be combined in the sauce, rather than eaten separately . Polyphenols are natural antioxidant molecules derived from vegetables. But to get the health benefits the ingredients have to be combined in the sauce, rather than eaten separately. Scientists from the Universty of Barcelona tested various sauces available from supermarkets made using ingredients that had been produced on regular farms. Sofrito - made out of tomato along with onion, olive oil, corn flour and occasionally garlic - is eaten widely around the Med . Rosa Lamuela said: 'Those sofrito which . contain extra-virgin olive oil have better antioxidant properties as . they are richer in phenolic compounds. 'Those with better antioxidant properties are the ones which contain protocatechuic acid, for instance quercetin. 'The differences found among sofrito samples may be due to their different ingredients - tomato, garlic, onion, olive oil - and different proportions used to cook them.' Experiments on supermarket sofrito revealed the eating the combination of ingredients as a sauce brought greater health benefits than eating each on its own. Anna Vallverdz Queralt added: 'First, there is a synergistic effect among ingredients which is translated into a higher number of total polyphenols. 'Second, the sofrito contains more polyphenols than tomato or tomato juice because garlic, oil and onion provide polyphenols too.' The researchers used a technique called high-resolution mass spectroscopy also found a number of other health-protecting compounds including carotenoids, another kind of antioxidant in the sofrito. The study was published in the journal Food Chemistry.","Spanish researchers found tomato-based sauce contains as many as 40 antioxidants which are believed to protect the heart from 'oxidative stress'

She was so close to death so we were relieved when she was stable. ‘The last thing I was thinking about was her getting back on a horse. But we have never stopped her doing anything and her attitude is amazing.’ Ellie was diagnosed with meningitis and septicaemia after she developed sickness, a high temperature and a blotchy red rash. Her father rushed her to hospital where she would found to be seriously ill . Ellie's mother, Karen Dunnaway said: 'All me and her father Paul have wanted is for Ellie to make a good recovery. She was so close to death so we were relieved when she was stable' Ellie was diagnosed with meningitis in 2006 after developing sickness and a high temperature. Her parents took her to see her GP, who thought she had a viral infection. However, within hours Ellie started to develop a blotchy rash on her arms and legs and her father rushed her to Sandwell Hospital, in the West Midlands. Doctors diagnosed Ellie with meningitis and she was transferred to University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Ms Dunnaway said: ‘At the time I didn't have a proper understanding of meningitis, but she had doctors all around her and we knew it was serious.’ When she had recovered from her illness, Ellie returned to horse riding using a specially adapted saddle. She now rides her horse, Mollie, three times a week and dreams of become a Paralympic dressage rider . When Ellie was in hospital (pictured) her parents were, at one point, told she was just 30 minutes from death . Over the next ten days the youngster battled for her life, and her diagnosis was confirmed as meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia. Ms Dunnaway said: ‘At the time I told Ellie, ""the doctors are going to have to take your legs or you are going to leave Mummy and go to heaven"". ‘She asked me to show her her legs, as they were covered up and said she didn't like them anyway. She was so grown up and brave.’ She added: ‘One day when I came into the ward she was with a play therapist who was helping her paint. Ellie (pictured before her illness) also enjoys cooking and swimming now and her mother says she believes Ellie can do anything she puts her mind to . Ms Dunnaway said: 'Horses rely a lot upon being guided by legs and as Ellie doesn't have any she has to use other parts of her body language. It is important for Ellie to bond with her horse, but also for the horse to bond with Ellie' ‘She was holding the paintbrush in her mouth. It was the happiest I'd seen her for a long time and I was so glad.’ Ellie now makes time to ride her horse, Mollie, at least three times a week and also enjoys swimming and cooking. Ms Dunnaway said: ‘Horses rely a lot upon being guided by legs and as Ellie doesn't have any she has to use other parts of her body language. It is important for Ellie to bond with her horse, but also for the horse to bond with Ellie.’ She added: ‘Often Ellie will wake up before me in the morning and surprise me with homemade pancakes. Ellie's mother, Ms Dunnaway (pictured with Ellie) said: 'I never discourage her from doing anything - I firmly believe she can do whatever she wants to' Ellie (pictured on holiday at the age of six) now helps raise awareness of meningitis . ‘She loves cooking and has taught herself how to do it. If she drops something then she drops it- it isn't an issue. ‘I never discourage her from doing anything- I firmly believe she can do whatever she wants to.’ Chris Head, of Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘Ellie and her family know better than anyone how quickly meningitis and septicaemia can strike. ‘Despite suffering from life-changing after-effects, which is sadly the case with many of our members, Ellie is still able to enjoy life to the full and doesn't let her amputations hold her back. ‘Vaccines have almost eliminated many types of meningitis and septicaemia, but they still present a very real threat so make sure you know the symptoms, trust your instincts and seek medical help.’ Early warning signs of bacterial meningitis - the more serious form - include pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, unusually cold hand and feet, shivering and pale or blotchy skin. The next symptoms to develop are often a severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and feeling generally unwell. As the condition develops the patient may suffer drowsiness, confusion, fits, a fear of bright lights, a stiff neck, fast breathing and a blotchy red rash that does not fade when a glass is pressed against it. In babies and young children the symptoms include being floppy and unresponsive, becoming irritable and not wanting to be held, unusual crying, vomiting, pale and blotchy skin, loss of appetite, a staring expression and being very sleepy.

Home Office minister Norman Baker said legal highs had already caused too many young deaths . Legal high producers could be forced to prove their drugs are safe under a government clampdown to prevent more deaths linked to dangerous substances. Police and ministers are constantly playing catch-up with the creators of legal highs, who tweak the chemical make-up of banned substances to get around the law. Home Office minister Norman Baker warned that people who take legal highs cannot be sure they are safe or legal, and said they have claimed the lives of ‘far too many young people in our country’. Suppliers get round existing drugs laws by describing their substances as ‘plant food’ or chemicals used fotr rsearch. Ministers fear that even schoolchildren are able to legally buy legal highs which are potentially more dangerous than ecstasy. The new review will look at how the UK's laws and enforcement against new psychoactive substances, also known as legal highs, can be improved. Options to be considered will include widening legislation to ensure police and law enforcement agencies have better-tailored powers. The move comes as the Government announces that two new groups of psychoactive substances - NBOMe and Benzofury - will become classified as Class A and B drugs respectively. Mr Baker, the crime prevention minister, said: ‘The coalition Government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs, which has tragically already claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country. ‘Despite being marketed as legal . alternatives to banned drugs, users cannot be sure of what they contain . and the impact they will have on their health. Nor can they even be sure . that they are legal. ‘Our review will consider how current . legislation can be better tailored to enable the police and law . enforcement officers to combat this dangerous trade and ensure those . involved in breaking the law are brought to justice. ‘NBOMe . and Benzofury are drugs which have caused serious harm and in some . cases death to those who have taken them. Outlawing them is crucial in . the battle to restrict their supply and use.’ NBOMe . and benzofuran compounds are currently under a temporary banning order, . which will become permanent when legislation is passed next year. Deadly: A sample of 251-NBOMe - a recently discovered psychedelic substance which is to be banned . Jake Harris, 21, is said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night party after taking a mind-bending drug known as N-Bomb. As . he was suffering terrifying hallucinations, Mr Harris, a leisure centre . lifeguard, was heard shouting and pleading: 'I want it to stop.' He then broke a wine glass on a bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat open. An inquest heard that Mr Harris and . friend Steven Higgins, 27, had gone to a party at the luxury flat of . Heather Turner, 28, near Manchester city centre. The . court was told she had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to . share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his . friend. He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect . before visiting the Glastonbury festival. N-Bomb is also known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) last month recommended both substances are banned permanently. The review will be led by the Home Office, with input from experts in law enforcement, science, health and academia and will present its findings in spring 2014. The Home Office has also published updated guidance for local government on the different action trading standards can take against shops selling new psychoactive substances. Ten ‘legal highs’ were identified last year for the first time in the UK by a specialist Government system that targets music festivals and tobacco shops. A total of 27 new psychoactive substances, also known as legal highs, have now been detected by the Home Office's Forensic Early Warning System since it was set up in January 2011. Official figures also show that the number of deaths being linked to legal highs soared by 80% last year to 52, from 29 in 2011. Martin Barnes, chief executive of DrugScope, a charity supporting professionals working in drug and alcohol treatment, said: ‘It has been clear for some time that the law has been unable to keep pace with the chemistry when it comes to the production and supply of new drugs. ‘As DrugScope's recent Street Drug Trends Survey highlighted, in some areas so-called 'legal highs' are not only being sold online and in 'headshops', but in outlets such as newsagents, petrol stations and take-away food shops. ‘This is an attempt by the Home Office to bolster current enforcement efforts and to see what other legislative options could be brought to bear on this new and complex drug situation. ‘However, it is important to remember that the law by itself cannot bring this trade under control. ‘It is vital that education and information efforts are significantly enhanced in order to make the public - especially young people - more aware of the risks posed by experimenting with substances of unknown content and origin. These substances are not labelled 'research chemicals' by sellers for nothing.’ Shadow crime and security minister Diana Johnson said: ‘The Home Secretary came into office promising 'swift action' on legal highs. Three years later she is launching a review. ‘In the meantime hundreds of substances have come on to the UK market and thousands of sellers have opened up. ‘While the Government have failed to act, hundreds of thousands of young people have been trying these drugs, and sadly this has often had fatal consequences. ‘While the Home Secretary has been burying her head in the sand, local authorities across the country have been trying to close down the high street shops selling these drugs but they have consistently been thwarted by hopelessly out of date legislation, which allows sellers to pretend that these drugs are research chemicals. ‘Instead of telling local authorities what the law is, the Government should be updating it.’ In July, Labour proposed an amendment to Anti-Social Behaviour Bill to enable successful prosecutions of shops selling legal highs. Ms Johnson added: ‘If the Government was serious about helping to close down these shops they'd back our amendment in the Lords in January.’","Home Office minister Norman Baker warns too many lives have been lost .

If you want to make it to the finish line of a Tough Mudder obstacle race, you'll have to fight more than just exhaustion and dehydration - there's also the shock of 10,000 volts of electricity. Emergency room doctors conducted a case study of a Tough Mudder obstacle run in Philadelphia last June and found that of the 38 people admitted that weekend, about half suffered electrical injuries. The patients ranged in age from 18 to 46 years old, with 22 men and 16 women. Scroll down for video . Do you have what it takes? About half the injured at a recent Tough Mudder obstacle race experienced electrical shocks . 'One of the patients, 18-years-old, experienced 13 shocks - he essentially had a heart attack, inflammation of the heart,' Dr Marna Rayl Greenberg, director of emergency medicine research at Lehigh Valley Hospital, told Today. Obstacle runs like the Tough Mudder have become popular in recent years, attracting a thrill-seeking crowd looking for a new accomplishment. Two of the obstacles involved in the Tough Mudder are the Electrical Eel and Electroshock Therapy which have participants running and crawling through fields of live wires up to 10,000 volts. Heart attack: One 18-year-old 'essentially experienced a heart attack' during the race because of 13 electrical shocks . At first, Dr Greenberg was confused about the nature of the injuries, since she didn't expect them in a race course. 'I have been practicing for over 20 years, and I have never seen an event that shocked people. It took me a while to understand what was happening to them,' Dr Greenberg said. Electrical injury expert Michael Morse says that the elements involved in the race only make the risk for shock worse since wet skin 'increases the risk of electrical injury dramatically'. Nothing to worry about? One medical expert said you shouldn't let fear of electrical shock keep you from entering a race . But he doubts that the live wires are actually delivering 10,000 volts because 'that would kill people'. He hypothesizes that the volts could be caused by capacitive discharge or static shock. But one medical professional says you shouldn't let fear of electrical shock get in your way of competing in these races. 'It almost has that haunted house effect to it - it appears to be more dangerous than it really is,' said Dr Howard Mell, spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. 'There’s no question that the race is designed to create discomfort, and the idea of it is, ""Hey, I can overcome this.""'","The Tough Mudder is one of many obstacle courses attracting thrill-seeking competitors at races across the nation .

The mothers of two little girls both suffering incurable diseases became acquainted in an unusual way - and found their daughters' lives, like their names, were startlingly similar. Amber Greenawalt is mother to five-year-old Savannah who suffers mitochondrial disease, and Lindsay Cairns Lennox is the mother of five-year-old Seattle, who has transverse mylitis. Friends of the two, realizing that Savannah is in desperate need of an oxygen tank and Seattle needs a new wheelchair, created a Go Fund Me page for the little girls to raise money for their medical care. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Little warriors: Savannah Greenawalt (left) and Seattle Lennox (right) have both been fighting illnesses for much of their short lives . In need: Savannah suffers mitochondrial disease and needs an oxygen tank to help her breathe throughout the day . The pair met after Greenawalt, a die-hard Battlestar Galactica fan, met actress Leah Cairns at a 'Galacticon' conference in Houston. They began talking and realized they had much in common as mothers of three children. Leah Cairns mentioned her sister, Lindsay Cairns Lennox and her daughter Seattle. 'I never could have imagined how blessed I would be to have Leah come into my life and how impactful that connection would turn out to be,' writes Greenawalt on her blog Life, Love & Laundry. 'While the diagnoses are different the life experiences of our girls have been remarkably similar. In fact the parallels in their stories are incredible and it's easy to see that the wee warriors are kindred spirits right down to their city names.' Catalyst: Lindsay Cairn Lennox and Amber Greenawalt met through actress Leah Cairn, pictured (left) in character on Battlestar Galactica and (right) at a film premiere . Seattle's condition, transverse mylitis, is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation across both sides of one level, or segment, of the spinal cord. After initially being paralyzed by the condition as a 15-month-old, Seattle has mad a good recovery but can't walk for long periods of time and experiences constant pain due to transverse mylitis. Savannah has Complex I and Complex III mitochondrial disease. She was diagnosed three weeks after her first birthday. Her mother writes that the condition has 'caused her body to experience poor growth, hypermobility (Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome Type 3), hypotonia, Eosinophilic Colitis and other gastrointestinal issues, hypoglycemia, asthma, immunodeficiency, chronic infections, seizures, dysautonomia, polydipsia/polyuria, dysphagia, reflux, vasso-constriction/dilation and lactic acidosis among other things.' Fighter: Seattle walks as much as she can but she needs a new wheelchair to help her get around . This currently incurable cellular energy disorder keeps Savannah’s body from being able to convert food and oxygen into energy. This causes cell damage, and eventually cell death. There is no cure for the disease and many sufferers do not make it to their teenage years. Both little girls have spent much of their short lives in hospitals, hooked up to machines and in pain. 'If . they survived at all, it was doubtful they would ever be able to talk, . walk or function on their own,' reads the Go Fund Me page. The little fighters have both proved that they're made of stronger stuff. Seattle walks and Savannah's progress has been nothing less than remarkable. But there's still a long way to go for both of them. As babies: Amber Greenawalt and Savannah (left) and Lindsay Cairn Lennox with Seattle . 'Leah [Cairn] and another incredible . woman who came into our life because of her, Lacey Harrison, and two . other gals Tammy Sheperd and Jo Sharples set up a Go Fund Me page for .

'We have done many fundraisers through the years to benefit some amazing organizations doing research for a cure but we have never fundraised directly for Savannah's medical needs. As I'm sure Lindsay would agree its a tough thing to do....Ask people for direct support. But the truth is our girls have medical needs right now that surpass what we can cover out of pocket on our own. That's why this page, this campaign, means the world to us.'The money will be split 50/50 between Savannah and Seattle.

A teenager suffers from a bizarre 'growth spurt' condition which means he can grow up to two inches in just two weeks. Josh Gott’s condition is so rare that it doesn't even have a name and his mother fears her giant son will only get bigger and bigger. The 18-year-old is thought to be the only person in the world to suffer from a bizarre disease which causes dramatic and sudden spurts of growth. Towering: Josh Gott (with grandmother Sylvia and sister Nicola) suffers from a bizarre 'growth spurt' condition which means he can grow up to two inches in just two weeks . Josh is currently 6ft 10in, despite his mother Sharon Elston being just 5ft and his father only 5ft 4in. Ms Elston, 44, has spent years trying to find out what is wrong with her son. She has now been told by scientists in Newcastle that Josh has a chromosomal disorder - but it's so rare that little is known about it. There is no cure. It causes Josh, of Stockton-on-Tees, to have rapid spurts of growth - which normally last around two weeks and can see his height rise by as much as two inches. Ms Elston said: 'It is a nightmare - I can’t get clothes to fit him. I'm having to look online and am thinking about ordering trousers from America. 'I don’t know where it will stop. Josh is forever banging his head on door frames and has trouble going down the stairs. 'People stare at us. We are an odd sight, as I am so short, and he is so tall. People don’t understand what is wrong. Challenging: Josh with his mother Sharon, who is only 5ft. She said: 'It's a nightmare - I don't know where it will stop. Josh is forever banging his head on door frames and has trouble going down the stairs' 'He's not going to stop growing. He once grew two inches in two weeks.' She first noticed there was something wrong with Josh’s growth when he was about 11 years old. She said: 'He was just shooting up. I didn't understand it. I went to the doctors dozens of times, but they told me it was just his age, and that it was normal. 'But I knew different, instinct told me there was a problem. He was the tallest boy in his class, and me and his dad are both so short.' After years of speaking to doctors, Josh’s case was finally referred to leading research scientists at Newcastle’s Centre for Life and a definitive diagnosis was delivered about 18 months ago. After years of trying to find out what was wrong, Josh was diagnosed with a small deletion on one of his chromosomes . Josh has a small deletion on one of his chromosomes which involves three genes. One of these genes is the main antagonist (or threat) to the growth hormone. It is different disorder from Gigantism, whose sufferers over produce the hormone. In a letter written by Consultant Clinical Geneticist Doctor Miranda Splitt to Josh’s doctor she said: 'There are a few other patients who are known to have a deletion of the three genes but all of them have a much larger deletion involving many more genes. 'I have asked for more information about the patients with overlapping deletion to see whether any of them have very tall stature but have so far had not had any replies from the clinicians involved.' Josh's mother was told researchers had contacted colleagues across the world, but no-one else had seen a chromosome disorder that mirrors her son’s. She said: 'This new information means very little to Josh, but to me it means a lot. 'I have always said, ""there’s something else"", but now I would like it do him some good, I don’t want it just to be interesting research.' Josh has also suffered from a number of other serious problems throughout his life, including brain damage, epilepsy, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), Perthes (a hip growth disorder), autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. But Ms Elston, who works transporting children with various mental and physical disabilities to school, says she always knew there was something undiagnosed which could be crucial for Josh’s welfare. Around two-and-a-half years ago she refused to leave the University Hospital of North Tees until a doctor took the problem seriously. She said: 'I told the doctor my height, and Josh’s dad’s height, and I insisted that something was done. I said I would not leave unless it was. I was determined.' It was then that the case was finally referred to the Centre for Life. She added: 'I just hope something can be done to stop him from growing. I dread him getting taller.'","Josh Gott, 18, suffers from a bizarre 'growth spurt' condition which means he can suddenly grow up to two inches in just two weeks .

When President Obama announced the landmark deal with Iran, he included some points that the Islamic republic says it never agreed to . Iranian officials claimed on Tuesday that the Obama administration concocted a fact sheet on a landmark nuclear agreement that doesn't match what they endorsed over the weekend. Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham said the version of the pact released by the White House 'is a one-sided interpretation of the agreed text in Geneva and some of the explanations and words in the sheet contradict the text of the Joint Plan of Action.' At issue are several differences between the White House's summary of the accord and the plain text of the agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other industrialized nations – specifically the administration's claim that Iran has agreed to stop enriching uranium for the next six months. On Saturday evening the White House said in a statement that Western nations and Iran had 'reached a set of initial understandings that halts the progress of Iran's nuclear program and rolls it back in key respects.' President Obama delivered an address 17 minutes later, announcing that under the agreement, 'Iran cannot use its next-generation centrifuges, which are used for enriching uranium.' He also said the Islamic republic 'will halt work at its plutonium reactor.' On Tuesday Iran released what it says is the actual agreement, and insisted it had made no such commitments. Awkward: Secretary of State John Kerry shook hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday, and less than a day later the two were squabbling over the terms of the Geneva agreement . The talks in Switzerland included Iran, Germany and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France . 'This agreement that has just been signed mentions that Iran is fully entitled to the right of enrichment and it will never quit its rights in the future,' Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the following day in Geneva. He said Wednesday that the White House misrepresented the Geneva negotiations. 'They released that fact sheet because they wanted to make their desired changes in it,' he told Iran's parliament in a closed briefing. On Tuesday Abbas Araqchi, Iran's top nuclear negotiator told Trend magazine in Azerbaijan that 'Iran's uranium enrichment right cannot be granted or limited by another countries.' And Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, insisted on Monday that the Geneva accord won't affect operations at his nation’s major nuclear sites. 'Work at the Arak reactor will continue,' Salehi said. '[Uranium] enrichment to 5 percent will continue. Research and development will continue. All our exploration and extraction activities will continue. There are no activities that won’t continue."" He announced on Tuesday that Iran's enrichment program will actually increase, and added that construction of the heavy-water reactor at Arak – which the U.S. believes is one component of a plutonium production facility – will continue as before. Iranian Atomic Energy Organization president Ali Akbar Salehi said 'work at the Arak [nuclear] reactor will continue,' meaning Iran is likely committed to producing plutonium for military purposes . Not impressed: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the nuclear agreement with Iran as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within Tehran's reach . Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday that 'there is no right to enrich' uranium in the Geneva agreement. 'We do not recognize a right to enrich.' Iran's President Hassan Rouhani began distancing himself from the White House almost immediately, saying that 'our [uranium] enrichment activities will continue as before' But the Obama administration is now suggesting that differences in interpretation are moot since the interim agreement is just one step along a path toward a permanent arrangement that would curb Iran's nuclear program in the long run. 'Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told MailOnline. Asked to react to Iran's claim that the White House changed key elements of the agreement for public consumption, she said 'I don’t have any particular response to these reports.' But she acknowledged that 'domestic enrichment' would likely be part of 'a limited, tightly constrained and intensively monitored civilian nuclear program' that the West would negotiate with Iran over the next six months. In exchange for Iran's now-disputed concessions, the U.S. has agreed to release as much as $7 billion in capital that was previously part of crippling economic sanctions, largely in the form of oil revenue.. The White House's fact sheet – the same one Iran now calls illegitimate – said it would also lift 'certain sanctions on gold and precious metals, Iran’s auto sector, and Iran’s petrochemical exports.'","The White House published its 'fact sheet' on the nuclear agreement a day before the text of the pact was officially released .

The mass pile-up, involving around 40 cars, happened on a snow-covered highway in Wisconsin on Sunday . The crashes occurred on Highway 41/45 near Germantown and continued for around five minutes. People stood on the road, despite police warnings not to do so . Twelve people were injured, according to police, but miraculously there were no fatalities . Twelve people were injured, according to Germantown police, who said they were amazed by the number of motorists who remained standing on the road. Officer Tim Miller, who was en route to another crash, said: 'If people watch Nascar, and they watch the Daytona 500 or Talledega, where they wait for what’s called the Big Crash, where all the cars crash because they’re all so close together, that’s what this was like - only there was nobody there to stop it with a yellow flag and slow all the other cars down. 'It just kept going and going and going. I mean that’s what was helpless about it,' he told the Inquisitr. Up to half the motorists fled the scene, while others just stood around on the highway despite being cautioned not to do so. Officer Tim Miller said the crashes just kept 'going and going and going' Captain Mike Snow, of the Germantown police, said: 'Stay in your vehicle, and certainly, keep your seatbelt fastened. 'Make sure everybody in the vehicle has their seatbelt fastened.' 'Only after members of law enforcement have secured the scene, and permitted you to exit, should you leave your vehicle,' he told Fox 11. The video was released by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Further down the highway, a 67-year-old man was killed in a pile-up involving 40 cars. Emergency personnel respond to an accident on southbound Interstate 43 in Mequon, Wisconsin on Sunday . A powerful storm that crept across the country dropped snow, freezing rain and sleet on the Mid-Atlantic region and headed northeast on Sunday. The storm forced the cancellation of thousands of flights across the U.S. and slowed traffic on roads, leading to a number of accidents, including a fatal crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Morgantown that led to a series of fender-benders involving 50 cars that stranded some motorists for up to seven hours. More than two dozen vehicles were involved in another series of crashes on nearby Interstate 78. And early this month, 30 people were injured when an icy bridge caused a massive pile-up of 70 cars, two tractor-trailers and one box trailer in Worcester, Massachusetts.","Crashes occurred on Highway 41/45 near Germantown .

These pictures show the horrific injuries an Afghani woman suffered when a man allegedly threw a powerful acid in her face. Akhtara, 29, lives in a one-bedroom home with her four children in Kabul, Afghanistan. At the age of ten, she married a rich, elderly man, who was later killed by a jealous nephew, she claims. Terrible injuries: Akhtara, 29, says a man she refused to marry threw a powerful acid in her face . The nephew, named Amanullah, killed her husband before asking her for her hand in marriage, she says. The man left the city for Pakistan, but returned three years later to the mother's home. When Akhtara opened the door Amanullah threw the acid in her face - leaving her with horrendous scars, it has been reported. Speaking to Voice of America, Akhtara said: 'On the night my husband was killed I was overwhelmed with grief. Amanullah came and asked me if I wanted to remain a widow until I die or whether I wanted to marry him. 'He promised to give me money and look after me. Horrifying: Akhtara, pictured with her daughters Gul Pari and Gul Sanam, says she cannot find work because of her terrible injuries . Poverty: The mother, pictured with her four children, says the family are forced to live off bread and tea as they cannot afford anything else . 'Three years after the death of my husband I heard a knock on the door. 'In my heart I thought he has comeback to apologise for his actions. He immediately threw acid in my face. 'It felt like my face was on fire.' Akhtara has been unable to find work to support her four children since the attack and is forced to beg on the side of the road to support her children. She says they often go without - and survive on a diet of bread and tea.

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:46 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:12 EST, 27 November 2013 . An Ohio couple committed a crime when they recently gave child welfare officials a 9-year-old boy they raised from infancy, prosecutors say. Cleveland Cox, 49, and Lisa Cox, 52, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor counts of nonsupport, allegedly left the boy with children's services after saying he was displaying aggressive behavior and earlier threatened the family with a knife. This is the couples' first court appearance since they voluntary turned themselves into police November 15 after a three month search mounted by authorities. Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser has said there are legal consequences to what he called 'reckless' abandonment. Unthinkable: Cleveland and Lisa Cox (L, R), talk to their attorney, as they turn themselves in Friday, November 15. Authorities say the couple returned their 9-year-old adopted son to the county after raising him since infancy . No comment: Mrs. Cox and their husband have not spoken publicly about the case. They pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of nonsupport on Wednesday . Adolfo Olivas, an attorney appointed by the court to protect the boy's interests, has said the emotionally hurt and confused child is now receiving help that the parents should have gotten for him. A defence attorney and prosecutor declined to comment after the hearing. The couple was scheduled to be in juvenile court later overnight for a pretrial hearing regarding custody of the child. People within the adoption community say they worry about emotional trauma to the child. They say giving up a child after so much time is rare and undermines the stability and commitment that adopted children need. Christopher Hehn, of Greenwood, Indiana, knows the importance of commitment after being shuffled from foster home to foster home before a social worker adopted him at age 12. 'When the going got tough, it was out . the door for me,' Hehn said. 'But when I was adopted, my mother said it . was forever, no matter what. She stuck it out, and I was finally able . to trust again.' Sixto . Cancel, a 21-year Virginia Commonwealth University junior in Richmond, . Virginia, also stressed the importance of stability for adopted . children. Cancel said he experienced abuse and never found a good fit, moving from a troubled adoptive home to foster care homes. As . an adoptee, 'you need reassurance that you are not alone,' said Cancel, . who also is an advocate for adopted and fostered children. Charged: The couple surrendered Butler County, Ohio authorities on November 15 (pictured). They now face misdemeanor charges of nonsupport . Well-to-do: The couple lived in this lovely neighborhood where the median income is around $100,000. They'd raised their son since he was three months old . Not a money problem: The Coxes live in this home valued at more than $330,000 home in Liberty Township . Threatening? Neighbors said the Coxes are good parents and people. One of them described the 9-year-old adopted boy as a 'bad seed.' The couple claims the boy has threatened them with a knife . 'These are the only parents he has ever known': County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser, who usually doesn't seek indictments but finds the nature of this case to be exceptional . Greg and Robin Smith, of New Richmond, about 17 miles southeast of Cincinnati, became adoptive parents in a ceremony last week, adopting four siblings — ages 5 to 12 — who they cared for as foster children for more than three years. Robin Smith acknowledged some anger and other issues among the children, stemming from their experiences before coming to the Smiths. 'But you just can't give up on children, not matter how hard the situation is,' she said. Two biological brothers adopted this month by the Rev. Edward Byers and wife Darnette, of Cincinnati, say they know the 9-year-old must feel depressed and lonely. 'I know what it's like to move from . house to house,' said the youngest brother, 14-year-old Tyshawn. 'But I . would tell him to stay in there and not give up.' Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser has said there are legal consequences to what he called 'reckless' abandonment. Extraordinary case: County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser said he doesn't usually seek indictments in misdemeanor cases but views this as an exceptional case . National adoption advocates say failed adoptions or dissolutions are rare in cases where the child has been raised from infancy. They said such discord seems to occur more often with youths adopted at an older age. But Kathleen Strottman, executive director of the Washington-based Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, said that while there seems to be less trauma in children placed with adoptive parents as infants, emotional and behavioral issues can surface long after adoption. Strottman said she was concerned about the wellbeing of the Ohio child, but she also worried that the threat of criminal prosecution could discourage adoptive parents from seeking help. 'I'm hoping that ultimately there was a good cause for this prosecution,' she said. 'What everyone wants is a child protection system that first and always stays focused on the needs of the child.'","Cleveland and Lisa Cox of Liberty Township, Ohio were charged Wednesday with misdemeanor counts of nonsupport after allegedly trying to give the son they'd raised from infancy to child services .

Yesterday the family of cycle crash victim Ryan Smith – left in a coma after refusing to wear a helmet in case it messed up his hair – publicly shared the moment he woke up and gave them a hug. The 16-year-old schoolboy athlete opened his eyes and uttered his first words in 123 anxious days: ‘Hello dad... hello mum.’ Scroll down for video . Magic moment: Ryan Smith, 16, who was knocked off his bike and left in a coma, hugs his father Mark, as he woke and spoke for the first time since July . Starting again: Ryan will now undergo six months of rehabilitation at The Children's Trust unit in Tadworth, Surrey . Recovering: Ryan Smith, 16, was knocked off his bike and severely injured - but had decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his fashionable hairstyle . Then he wrapped his arms around his father at the start of what will be a long rehabilitation programme that could one day see him walk out of hospital. Earlier this year Mark Smith published a desperately poignant photo showing him cradling his son in his motionless, brain-damaged state. It was meant to serve as a warning to other parents and teenagers on the danger of riding without a helmet. Yesterday the family released an equally moving snapshot, this time of the ‘miracle moment’ he awoke. Star: Ryan's plight even touched Welsh footballer John Hartson, left, who travelled to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire to offer his support . Emotional: Ryan holds the hand of his sister Rachael Smith, 21, who took the picture when her brother woke after four months . ‘To go from being told he might not . survive to holding him in my arms was something I will cherish for . ever,’ the 44-year-old paramedic said. ‘It was the best hug I’ve ever . had.’ Ryan, who represented . his Lincolnshire school and county at athletics, spurned a cycle helmet . because he didn’t want it to flatten his impressive mane of swept-back . blond hair. In July he was . hit by a van, suffering a serious head injury. Since then he had . remained unconscious, only recently showing signs of movement. Vigil: Devoted dad Mark Smith has been by his teenage son's hospital bed every day since July and says the moment he left the coma was 'incredible' and was 'the best hug of my life' Crash: Ryan didn't want to ruin his hair by putting on a helmet as he cycled to work and now his father is calling for all cyclist to wear them . Eye activity suggested he might be registering voices around him but Mark, and Ryan’s mother Julie, 46, could never be certain. Until, . that is, he opened his eyes and spoke to them from his bed at Boston’s . Pilgrim Hospital, close to his home in the seaside village of Chapel St . Leonard’s. His parents and their other children . Rachael, 21, and Charlie May, five, had been chatting ceaselessly to . him, including telling him he had passed all his GCSE exams, with an A* . and three A-grades among them.

Twerking is the now famous dance performed by Miley Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards in the summer. The dance craze, started in the New . Orleans 'bounce' music scene of the early 90s and has now become so mainstream it was even honoured with an official entry in the Oxford . Dictionaries Online. The top spot on Thursday night - worth £200 - was awarded to a 19-year-old from Tottenham, East London who goes by the stage name of Mizz Versatile. She told MailOnline: 'I've been . dancing for years. Twerking recently came up and I decided to learn. Popular: The event had an 18 age limit and the pumped-up crowd were cheering throughout the night . A 'jelly round' saw the girls standing still and shaking without moving their feet . 'I . tried different ways of moving my bum and practice whenever I have time.' Mizz . Versatile, who has a daughter aged two-and-a-half, said the venue was . packed and the crowd were extremely loud as they cheered on the . competitors, who were selected from regional heats. The . full-time dancer, who is a size 8 and 4ft 9in, said her success was . down to her technique during the 30-second rounds which include . freestyle and splits. Covered: The 18 and 20-year-old sisters were covered with balaclavas as they danced on the small stage, but they denied it was because they were ashamed . Focus: The older sister said 'I felt it was an advantage because me and my sister wanted to be judged purely on our twerk skills, not our looks' Crowd pleaser: The event had an 18 age limit and the pumped-up crowd went crazy during the grand finale round where the girls twerked upside-down while being held up by a male audience member . 'It's not about the size of your bum. People with large bums can not move to save their life,' she said.

Sold-out: The final 10 competitors danced in front of a sold-out crowd in London's King's Cross on Thursday . Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes . To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward . To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone . Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section . For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out . Then up the tempo and shake the butt . Directions provided by HowCast . The 18 and 20-year-old's faces were covered with balaclavas as they danced on the small stage, but they denied it was because they were ashamed. The older sister, who wore a black balaclava and brightly-patterned leggings with a dark crop top told The Sun: 'I felt it was an advantage because me and my sister wanted to be judged purely on our twerk skills, not our looks. 'If our faces are covered they have to look at our a**** only. 'We combined balaclavas with crop tops and patterned leggings. 'You have to showcase more effort to see the jiggle through the fabric — so that's why we don't wear shorts.' A 'jelly round' saw the girls standing still and shaking without moving their feet. The event had an 18 age limit and the pumped-up crowd went crazy during the grand finale round where the girls twerked upside-down while being held up by a male audience member. Event organiser, Harry Anthony, from Jump Off TV, told MailOnline the event was sold out very quickly and he hopes the competition will become an annual event. 'The crowd had an incredible time. They never stopped making noise and we're getting requests about when the next event is. We are most definitely looking to make this an annual event and currently working on a UK tour to showcase the winners.' Although twerking is currently in the media spotlight Mr Harry denied it was a recent phenomenon. He said: 'Booty shaking or what its now more commonly known as twerking has been part of hip hip culture for decades and is only getting the media spotlight because of Miley Cyrus' attempts to try to twerk.' Twerking is the now famous dance performed by Miley Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards in the summer . The term 'twerk' was added to the Oxford Dictionary recently. Katherine . Connor Martin, from Oxford Dictionaries Online, said 'twerk' was around . 20 years old and seemed to have been coined as part of the 'bounce' hip-hop scene in the United States. 'By . last year, it had generated enough currency to be added to our new . words watch list, and by this spring, we had enough evidence of usage . frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our . dictionaries of current English,' she said. 'There are many theories about the origin of this word, and since it arose in oral use, we may never know the answer for sure.

Connecticut highway cleanup crews had nothing to celebrate Wednesday when a tractor trailer crashed, spilling a mountain of pricey champagne. Around 2:15pm, the truck tipped over after smashing into a Department of Transportation vehicle and dumping hundreds of cases of Veuve Clicquot across I-395. The bright yellow cases, valued at $500 each, held up travelers in Griswold well into the evening as crews scrambled to clean up the bubbly mess. Scroll down for video... Pricey: Hundreds of cases of Veuve-Clicquot spilled across highway I-395 in Connecticut on Wednesday . According to the Norwich Bulletin, the driver William Wronski, 56, failed to merge ahead of a construction zone. When his lane ended, he smashed in to the back end of a parked DOT truck. Wronski was relatively unscathed, but his truck toppled onto a hillside as the French champagne, which goes for about $40 per bottle, smashed and sprayed its way across the highway. Crews were removing trees in the area and were saved, despite the trucker’s inattention, because the DOT truck was outfitted with cushioning in order to protect them. At least one man tried to make the best of traffic holdup when he scaled a hill for a closer look, or perhaps taste. Pricy mistake: The truck carrying the $500 cases smashed into a Department of Transportation vehicle after the driver failed to heed construction signs . Big job: The cleanup required a small bulldozer and took hours. The driver of the truck, 56-year-old William Wronski was treated for minor injuries, as was the driver of the DOT vehicle . The man failed, though, when he slipped down a slope and tumbled to the closed-down highway with a thud. Emergency workers were already there and bandaged the man’s hand and elbow. It even took a bulldozer to scoop up the broken glass and wine-soaked cardboard. Traffic in one lane opened around 5pm, reported WFSB, but two hours after the crash cleanup continued into the evening with a tow truck finally arriving after 7pm to haul away the totalled 18-wheeler. Pile up: Traffic was held up for hours and crews were still cleaning up the 2:15pm crash after 7pm, when a tow truck arrived to haul away the 18-wheeler . Popular: A Dumpster was on scene to hold the smashed glass and soaked cardboard. Veuve-Clicquot, which retails for around $40 per bottle, is easily recognizable for its bright yellow label . Both Wronski and James Tuttle, who was behind the wheel of the parked vehicle, were treated for minor injuries at the scene and taken to an area hospital as a precaution. One of the most famous brands of champagne worldwide, Veueve Clicquot is instantly recognizable by millions for its bright yellow label, though other bottles—many of them far more expensive—do exist.

Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani says the Mafia put out a $800,000 contract to kill him within weeks of taking office. The 69-year-old said that during his time in office the price on his head fell, with a second member of the Mafia offering only $400,000 near the end of his term in 2001. He told Oprah's Where Are They Now? show that despite the threats from organized crime gangs, what really scared him was Islamic extremists. Scroll down for video . Threats: Rudy Giuliani says two members of the Mafia put out contracts to kill him . 'Part of why I didn't worry about the Mafia was because there was a certain rationality to their kind of . violence. This other kind of violence is completely irrational . violence,' he said in an interview that aired on Sunday. 'When we start talking about Islamic extremist terrorism - that worries me more, because they are suicidal,' he added. The U.S. attorney said he made lots of enemies during his two terms as mayor. 'I don't think anybody prosecuted more Mafia members than I did. Certainly, no one sent them to prison for the . lengthy periods of time than I did,' he said. Mr Giuliani claimed in the interview that the Sicilian Mafia offered $800,000 to kill him during his first year in office and, near the end of his term, a Mafia member jailed for 100 years put out a $400,000 contract on him. Campaign: Giuliani, right, in 1986 when he tackled organized crime as a U.S. attorney . Acting up: Giuliani plays the part of Marlon Brando in a skit of The Godfather near the end of his term as New York Mayor in 2001 . 'I kind of felt bad that I went down in value - I started at 800, I went down to 400,' he said, making light of the situation. The former mayor, who was in office at the time of the 9/11 terror attacks, said he was proud at the way New York coped. 'Tourism set a record last year - 50 million people,' he said, during an interview filmed as he walked down the city streets. 'Fifty million, which shows you that even though we were attacked, even though there was threats of attacks, people know how to process it correctly. They realize it's a small, small risk in comparison to the wonderful things you can do here.' Positive: Former New York Mayor Giuliani says tourism in the city is booming despite the 9/11 attacks . Mr Giuliani said it was hard readjusting to everyday life after his mayoral term came to an end, saying that he would jump every time he heard sirens.

The iconic balloons will likely still fly at this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade despite an incoming storm that has threatened the East Coast with messy mix of snow, rain and wind for days. Earlier forecasts called for winds to exceed the maximum allowed under city rules enacted after a woman spectator was tragically injured thanks to a wind-whipped Cat in the Hat balloon in 1997. Now, the forecast 'looks very good,' NYPD Chief of Patrol James Hall said Wednesday afternoon. The final decision won't be made until the morning, however. Is his Spidey sense tingling?

'On Thanksgiving morning, Macy's works closely with the NYPD, who, based on real time weather data and the official regulations, determine if the balloons will fly and at what heights.' Looking good but no all clear: The wind forecast fluctuated Wednesday, causing many to wonder whether the parade would go on. Serious gusts were still expected. but sustained winds many not be strong enough to ground the balloons . Dangerous cat: The Cat in the Hat was the culprit when winds whipped the balloon so hard it topped a lamp post, which in turned seriously injured a woman . Balloons have only been grounded once in the parade's 87-year history, when bad weather kept them from flying in 1971. They're set to be inflated in Manhattan on Wednesday evening. The parade was awash in animal-related protests over its floats, with controversies involving the unlikely pairing of rocker Joan Jett and Shamu the killer whale. Activists planned to line the parade route to protest a SeaWorld float over accusations in a new documentary that the theme parks treat whales badly. And ranchers succeeded in getting Jett pulled off the South Dakota tourism float after they questioned why the vegetarian and animal-rights ally was representing their beef-loving state. SeaWorld says the accusations have . 'absolutely no basis' and that 'the men and women who care for these . animals at SeaWorld are dedicated in every respect to their health and . well-being.'

Families who build ‘granny flats’ for elderly relatives or house grown-up children in converted garages are to be given a lucrative tax break. From April, tens of thousands of households who have an annexe lived in by a family member will get a 50 per cent discount off their current council tax bill. At present, these self-contained  buildings are classed as individual properties so homeowners pay a  full rate of council tax on them – on top of what they pay for their own residence. Reforms: From April, tens of thousands of households who have an annexe lived in by a family member will get a 50 per cent discount off their current council tax bill (file picture) Currently a typical home would have a council tax of £2,427 for both properties, but the tax break is expected to knock £500 a year off this. There are an estimated 24,150 family annexes in England, plus many more in Wales and Scotland. The Government hopes that by  giving such granny flats a tax break  it will encourage more families to  build them and help elderly relatives and older children to live independently. It is also expected to give a huge boost to the construction industry. Paul Green, of over-50s firm Saga, said: ‘It’s great to see that the double taxation faced by families that want to house family members has been addressed. ‘A 50 per cent council tax discount on an annexe could encourage more families to have a ‘‘granny flat’’ for older relatives so that they can remain independent, whilst still being close enough in case help is needed. ‘It could also offer a cost-effective alternative for grown-up children whilst they save for a deposit to get their foot on the property ladder.’ The taxman is to increase its use of debt collectors to target households that refuse to pay their bills. In a drive to claw back £2.3billion from tax fraud, errors and debts, the Chancellor revealed the Government would use more private sector agencies with ‘specialist recovery skills’. Although they will not be able to call at people’s homes, they will be allowed to write letters, phone and send texts and emails. The debt agencies will be paid by results. In most cases, the targets are families who were overpaid tax credits after failing to tell HMRC about a change in circumstances. A blitz on tax avoidance and fraud is set to raise £9billion over the next five years, the Chancellor said. George Osborne unveiled a crackdown on aggressive tax dodging schemes, saying it was unacceptable for firms or individuals to ‘avoid paying their fair share’. Hedge funds and other partnerships will have to pay another £2.2billion in tax, as he announced an end to murky arrangements whereby fund managers are treated as self-employed and avoid paying National Insurance. They will also be stopped from delaying income tax payments to earn interest. Whitehall officials will also get better systems to help them claw back £2.3bn paid out in benefits and tax credits because of fraud and error. The double council tax bill has been . dubbed a penalty for families because it particularly affects . generations who want to live together. For . a local authority to class an annexe as a separate property it must . usually be self-contained and constructed or adapted for use as separate . living accommodation. It will usually include a kitchen area, a bathroom or shower-room and toilet. Tens of thousands of expats who claim the state pension will have to prove they are still alive. Every two years, many Britons who live overseas will be obliged to get a certificate signed by their doctor, a lawyer or a Government official if they want to keep claiming state payouts. It is thought up to 500,000 expats living in countries that do not automatically share information with the UK may be affected. The new rules are to crack down on the number of people who continue to pocket a pension for a partner who has died. The fraud is estimated to cost the taxpayer up to £25million a year. The typical council tax bill for a band D home in England is £1,456. On top of this an annexe, which would be classed as band A, would incur a bill of £971. Families will now get a 50 per cent discount off this second tax, which will save them a total of £5.3million in 2014/15. The plans do not go as far as when they were first mooted by Communities Minister Eric Pickles last year. At that time the Government suggested it could axe council tax completely on such annexes. There is already an exemption from council tax for annexes lived in by relatives who are classed as dependent – such as frail older relatives or the disabled. This will remain unchanged. But the new rules will particularly help relatives who want to live independently and annexes used by any other family members. It will not apply if the annexe  is lived in by someone who is  not family. A levy on self-built homes, including all extensions and home improvements will also be lifted. Alex Ingram, of My Ageing Parent which advises families how to care for older relatives, said: ‘Everyone can benefit from this. ‘It could make life much easier for thousands of families who are forced to travel hundreds of miles to look after elderly relatives and end up feeling guilty they don’t see them enough. ‘At the same time it allows elderly people to live independently.’ But Neil Duncan-Jordan, of the National Pensioners Convention, suggested the proposals were not sufficient in helping elderly people. He said: ‘Putting a shed on the side of the house is not the long-term answer to solving the housing issues for older people.","Changes will see a dramatic cut in tax bill for thousands from next April .

Detained: Facey, seen playing for Bolton against Everton in the Premier League in 2003, is one of six arrested in the NCA swoop . Six members of a suspected betting syndicate have been arrested on suspicion of fixing English football games, it was revealed last night. Officers from the National Crime Agency swooped on the group, who include at least three footballers, over the past two days. It is understood that among those arrested is Delroy Facey, a player-turned agent who has played in the Premier League. The operation took place after police were tipped off about an Asian betting syndicate attempting to target games across Britain. None of the games are believed to involve teams playing in the two most senior leagues, the Premier League or the Championship. But similar cases in other countries including Spain, Italy and Australia have shown organised crimes will attack the integrity of matches at any level. The high-profile arrests will confirm the worst fears of sports experts who suspect English football is not exempt from the global problem. Earlier this month a Government Minister said there are no plans to bring in match-fixing laws despite pressure from Europe. Culture Minister Helen Grant said existing laws and sports rules are sufficient to tackle the problem. The National Crime Agency operation began earlier this week when an internationally known fixer arrived from Asia and was arrested. In a series of conversations covertly recorded by a national newspaper over the past fortnight, he claimed that lower league matches could be fixed for as little as £50,000. He also correctly forecast the outcome of three games played by the same team. During a meetings in Manchester, one of the fixers claimed he could rig games and that gamblers would make hundreds of thousands of pounds on Asian-based betting websites. Journeyman: The striker also had spells at Bradofrd, Burnley and West Bromwich Albion before descending through the divisions. He is currently a free agent after being released by Hereford Town in 2012 . The fixer, from Singapore, also claimed he controls teams in other European countries and could influence foreign referees to secure results. He offered to target two football matches this month and said he planned to tell players how many goals he needed to be scored in total. The fixer also told an undercover investigator to create certain results at half-time and full-time, to maximise the opportunities for gambling. He also claimed he would pay one player an extra £5,000 to take a yellow card at the beginning of the game. This would serve as a signal that the match’s result would be fixed. During one meeting boasted one match involved ‘my team’ after correctly predicted how many goals would be scored the following day. Huddersfield (1996-200) 82 games, 15 goalsBolton (2002-2004) 14 games 2 goalsBradford (2002) 6 games 1 goalBurnley (2003) 16 games 5 goalsWest Brom (2004) 9 games 0 goalsHull City (2004-2005)  25 games, 6 goalsHuddersfield (2005) 4 games 0 goalsOldham Athletic (2005) 9 games 0 goalsTranmere Rovers (2005-2006) 41 games 9 goalsRotherham  (2006-2007) 43 games 11 goalsGillingham (2007-2008) 35 games 3 goalsWycombe (2008) 8 games 2 goalsNotts Co (2008-2010) 71 games 12 goalsLincoln City (2009-2011) 50 games 5 goalsHereford Town 2011-2012 43 games 6 goalsTotals: 453 games, 77 goals . He added: ‘I know because they all tell me every time. Because sometimes I have extra money, I just send them some money … because sometimes they need money or they call me so I just leave them some pocket money.’ The suspected match fixers are being held under the bribery and fraud laws at a police station in the Midlands. Investigators have already held preliminary discussions with senior lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service over what offences may have been committed. Concern was already mounting across the footballing landscape that Asian match fixers were targeting lower league British games. Chris Eaton, Fifa’s former head of security, said that match fixing had become ‘endemic’ internationally in a recent interview. There are believed to be police investigations into football match fixing in more than 60 countries. A National Crime Agency (NCA) spokesman said: Six men have been arrested across the country as part of an NCA investigation into alleged football match fixing. ‘The focus of the operation is a suspected international illegal betting syndicate. The NCA is working closely with the Gambling Commission and the Football Association. ‘This is an active investigation and we are unable to provide further detail at this time.’ A Football Association spokesman confirmed it was aware of a ‘number of arrests’ and said it is ‘working closely’ with the NCA. A First Division match between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford on Good Friday in April 1915 was fixed in United’s favour, with players from both sides benefiting from bets placed on the result. Three players from the English first division — Peter Swan, Tony Kay and David Layne — were paid to fix a game between their side, Sheffield Wednesday, and Ipswich in December 1962, which Wednesday lost 2-0. All three got four months’ imprisonment and life bans. Unusual betting patterns were reported on a match between Accrington Stanley and Bury in May 2008. A FA investigation resulted in Jay Harris being banned for a year, David Mannix for 10 months, Robert Williams and Peter Cavanagh for eight months and Andrew Mangan for five months. They were fined between £2,000 and 5,000. Four Australian players, who used to play for Hornchurch, were arrested in September after allegedly conceding goals as part of a match-fixing ring.

Del Boy also had a love of French - albeit a garbled version - including phrases such as 'not goodbye, Margaret, no just bonjour' and using 'au revoir' for hello. It was first broadcast in 1981 and aired in seven series until 1991, with sporadic Christmas specials in later years. One festive episode in 1996 - in which Del Boy and Rodney became wealthy following the discovery and sale of a valuable watch - attracted 24.3million viewers, the highest UK audience for a sitcom.

An Operation Desert Storm veteran has been fined $5,000 for having trees in front of his house shorter than allowed by his home owner’s association. Patrick Fitzgerald, 51, of Merritt Island, Florida, found himself at odds with the HOA earlier this year after they cited him for having trees shorter than the minimum required six-foot height for new plantings. Bad blood on both sides of the dispute has led Mr Fitzgerald to call the HOA ‘idiots’ and for the association to call the situation ‘ludicrous.’ 'I love these trees': Patrick Fitzgerald says he doesn't understand how a few smaller trees can have such a big impact on property values . ‘I love these trees,’ Mr Fitzgerald told WESH while standing next to his prized magnolias, which he planted about a year ago. The man was fined $100 per tree per day until the bill came to $5,000, according to WESH. The trees stand only three-feet-tall, a full three-feet shorter than allowed by the HOA, according to the station. River Grove Association rules require every street to be lined with trees of similar height spaced an equal distance apart from each other. 'Throughout the association there are live oaks and magnolia trees that are 10 to 15 foot height,' the HOA president told ABC. 'They've taken root and are getting pretty big, so they don't want minor seedlings being planted,' he added. Half the required height: Mr Fitzgerald's magnolias are just under three-feet-tall, they need to be six-feet-tall . Mr Fitzgerald admitted to ABC News that he did not entirely read the homeowner‘s guidelines when he bought the house. ‘I don't know about you, but I didn't go through every single page,’ he told ABC. The former soldier the station he planted smaller trees because he believes they will be healthier than taller trees recently planted in other areas of River Grove that are in poor health. But the association disagrees. ‘Mr Fitzgerald wanted to make a nursery out of an area controlled by the HOA and we said no,’ a spokesperson told WESH. He planted the trees despite being told no, drew huge fines and even spent $2,000 on a lawyer to argue his case during a mediation hearing – still, the trees must go. Up to code: The association requires homeowners to have trees of equal height and spacing lining all streets . They must go: Mr Fitzgerald's lawyer worked out a deal requiring him to remove the trees within 20 days to avoid paying the fine . ‘I came back to this country after (serving in Iraq) and it’s funny I don’t have the right to plant a tree in front of my house,’ said the veteran. ‘There’s something wrong there.’ The HOA again disagrees. ‘This has gotten so carried away it is absolutely ridiculous,’ the association’s president told ABC News. ‘To me it's ludicrous.’ ‘We're not a bunch of idiots.’ The president added. ‘We're just a bunch of neighbors trying to keep property values where they are,.’ This is where Mr Fitzgerald draws his line in the sand. ‘I don’t think they’re bringing down property value,’ he told WESH. Mr Fitzgerald's lawyer worked out a deal with the HOA where he has 20 days to remove the trees and avoid the fine, something he will begrudgingly adhere to, he told ABC.","Patrick Fitzgerald drew the ire of his homeowner's association after planting two trees shorter than the minimum allowable height .

A couple have won a landmark legal battle to have 10 wind turbines taken down because they spoil the view from their dream home in France. In a judgement which could have widespread implication across Europe, including Britain, the husband and wife successfully argued that the 360ft high structures ruined their quality of life. As well as agreeing that the turbines ‘spoiled the view’, judges noted the ‘groaning and whistling’ and ‘unsightliness of white and red flashing lights’. Erik Wallecan and his wife Ingrid have won a landmark legal battle to have 10 wind turbines taken down because they spoil the view from their dream home in France . Now the company responsible has to take them down, and pay large fines and legal expenses. It is seen as a major victory for those campaigning against wind farms, and those who believe their spread is destroying both beloved countryside and cultural heritages. Erik Wallecan, a retired vet, and his wife Ingrid bought the 18th Century Chateau de Flers in the Pas-de-Calais, in northern France, in 1996, after moving from nearby Belgium. Their restoration of the house and its 42 acres became a labour of love, and they also turned adjoining buildings into a guesthouse. Victory: Erik Wallecan stands outside his 18th Century Chateau de Flers in the Pas-de-Calais . But when, in 2007, the ten wind turbines went up, they were horrified to suddenly lose their ‘bucolic and rustic’ view. They first spotted them on returning from a trip to Anvers, in Belgium, with Mr Wallecan telling Le Monde: ‘The first evening when we arrived in the chateau after their construction, there was a firework display and we wondered where these lights were coming from. A couple have won a landmark legal battle to have 10 wind turbines taken down because they spoil the view from their dream home in France . ‘We were not even aware that these projects existed. 'Three huge turbines are visible when gazing across the gardens from the bay windows in the chateau’s grand salon. ‘Every day we have to suffer the visual and noise pollution. I can see the turbines from everywhere in the house, from every room.’ The Wallecans launched a civil action against La Compagnie du Vent (The Wind Company), a subsidiary of the energy giant GDF Suez, which runs the turbines. Judges in Montpellier ruled that the structures blighted the countryside, causing the ‘total disfigurement of a bucolic and rustic landscape’. The company was ordered to pay the Wallecans the equivalent of £31,500 in damages and to remove the wind farm within four months or face a fine of £450 per day per turbine. La Compagnie du Vent said it would appeal the judgement, but Philippe Bodereau, the Wallecans’ lawyer said: ‘People are often too scared to take action and suffer in silence. ‘Today we are saying no - justice has been done and this shows all those who suffer wind farms with a sense of powerlessness that the fight is not vain, that one can have one’s life respected — one’s right to peace.’ Erik Wallecan and his wife Ingrid bought the 18th Century Chateau de Flers in the Pas-de-Calais, in northern France (pictured) In August, a French court banned a local council from erecting turbines near the Mont Saint Michel abbey in Normandy, after Unesco warned they could cost France’s most visited provincial tourist site its World Heritage status. A plan to build a vast offshore wind farm within view of several Normandy D-Day beaches has also been condemned as ‘an insult to the memory of the thousands who died there’. Britain is a world leader in wind farm technology, with new installations continually being erected across the country, often in areas which provoke criticism.","Judgement could have implications across Europe including Britain .

Sophie Dahl and her musician husband Jamie Cullum are planning on moving into her grandfather's home, according to reports . Roald Dahl used the garden hut to write his books, including classics such as Matilda, James And The Giant Peach and The BFG . According to the Sunday Times, the author's second wife Felicity, known as Liccy, currently lives in the house but is understood to be moving to the West Country. The paper has reported Dahl, 36, and Cullum, 34, who already live in a £3m house in the village, could move in when the property is vacated. The Dahl family caused a stir in September 2011 when they appealed for £500,000 to save the writing hut and move it from the garden to the nearby Roald Dahl Museum for public display. The plan was hoped to stop the decay which left the hut in danger of collapse. The hut contains the items which Roald Dahl surrounded himself with to aid the creative process . Roald Dahl lived in Gipsy House until his death in 1990 . The legendary children's author visited the hut every day for 30 years in . order to write. Only he was allowed into the structure. The . idea to move the shed came from the author's grandson, Luke Kelly, who . was inspired by relocation of Francis Bacon's studio to the Hugh Lane . gallery in Dublin. At the time, Roald Dahl's widow Felicity said: 'It is a forensic exercise, not only to retain the eccentric objects but more importantly the magical atmosphere that fed Roald's seemingly limitless imagination.' Felicity inherited the bulk of the £2.8million the writer left in his will after his death in 1991 - worth nearly £5million in today's terms. Sophie Dahl also said at the time: 'When my grandfather died, he left in his wake an aching gap, but also a palpable magic and limitless imagination, which is not exclusive to my family. 'It is now time for us to save the hut but, even more importantly, to share it.'","Model-turned-author and singer could be moving in 'within the next year'

Women play an important role in mediating the more reckless behaviour of their male counterparts . Women play an important business role in mediating the more reckless behaviour of their male counterparts, according to new research. Most companies have a vast gender bias, with the boards of Britain's largest companies being less than 25 per cent female. However new research published in the Journal of Corporate Finance shows that these women lower the cost to the company of takeovers and acquisition as women tend to avoid high risk, hot headed moves, the Telegraph reports. Researchers from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia investigated companies’ take-over purchases between 1997 and 2009 and compared the results of the bids to the number of female board members of each company. They found that not only did the number of women on the board lower the number of takeover attempts, which are risky and offer little benefit to shareholders, but also that when takeovers did happen, they cost less. For every female board member companies also attempted 7.6 per cent fewer takeover bids, and the cost of each successful acquisition is reduced by more than 15 per cent for every woman on its board. The effect seems to be due to women . ‘reining in’ the more aggressive men on the board, as well as being . more frugal and questioning details. The boards of Britain's largest companies are still made up of less than 25 per cent women . Prof Kai Li, co-author of the study, said: ‘Female board members play a significant role in mitigating the empire-building tendency of CEOs through the acquisition of other companies. ‘On average, merger and acquisition transactions don't create shareholder value, so women are having a real impact in protecting shareholder investment and overall firm performance.’","Research looked at company takeovers between 1997-2009 .

'A bond that should never be broken': German authorities are threatening to destroy a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who has been 'caring' for comatose boy Dylan Gerzmehle for the last six years after it bit a neighbour's dog . Devoted: Every morning, Tascha comes into Dylan's room, snuggles up to him and remains by his side all day .

More than one in four incapacity benefit claimants have been found ‘fit for work’ following new medical examinations. Of the 841,000 who have been re-tested, about 227,000 were well enough to come off the benefit, said the Department for Work and Pensions. A further 346,500 were found likely to be fit for work at some point and have been placed in an interim, ‘work-related activity’, group. They will be re-tested more often and get support or training to move into employment. Drain on the state: More than one in four incapacity benefit claimants have been found 'fit for work' following new medical examinations . The figures were seen yesterday as an indictment of how previous governments let the unemployed languish on sickness benefits without regular health checks to see whether they had recovered. Those found fit for work will now go on to Jobseekers’ Allowance, which means they will have to show they are looking for employment to stay on the benefit. Ministers are anxious to get the burgeoning welfare bill down, but disability rights campaigners have pointed to the high number of successful appeals against DWP decisions as evidence that the system is unfair. Mike Penning, the minister for disabled people, said: ‘We spend more than £13billion on sickness and incapacity benefits for almost 2.5million people of working age and  we need to make sure that support goes to those who need it most. ‘It’s right that we look at whether people can do some kind of work with the right support – rather than just writing them off on long-term sickness benefits, as has happened in the past.’ Battling the welfare bill: Disability minister Mike Penning . Separately, among those on the new Employment and Support Allowance benefit  – for people who have a limited capability for work because of a health condition or disability – 42 per cent were found to be fit for employment. This meant they were no longer eligible to claim, leaving just 58 per cent still entitled to the benefit. To continue claiming the ESA, most people had to be reassessed by independent health professionals, under  a programme that started in 2010. Those with terminal illnesses, severe disabilities or undergoing chemotherapy were spared from having  to be re-assessed, but the tests – called the Work Capability Assessment – have proved controversial. Figures from the latest quarter show that almost 33,000 ESA applicants who went for an independent assessment with a health professional were found fit for work. Almost 70,000 who applied for the ESA withdrew their claims before they were tested. Liz Sayce, chief executive  of Disability Rights UK,  said: ‘The Work Capability Assessment asks questions like “can you raise either  arm to the top of the head  as if to put on a hat or  mount or descend two  steps unaided?” ‘But there is no evidence this has any bearing on whether you can actually work. It depends on the job and whether you get the adjustments and support you need to do it [such as a lift to get up the steps]. ‘Many disabled people can work with the right support – and want to – but the test itself is a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money.’ Kaliya Franklin, a disability rights campaigner who has written a report exposing the ‘misery’ inflicted by the current testing regime, said: ‘I think we do need to have tests but they need to be fair and independent for everyone. We don’t want a system that is easy to play. ‘The biggest problem is that the DWP wrote into the original contract with assessors ATOS that just 11 per cent of people can go into the support group [those who will continue to get disability benefit of some form].’ Officials insist that they have tried to improve the tests by working with medical experts and charities to make them more accurate. Tests now also look at  mental health as well as physical conditions.","A further 346,500 were found likely to be fit for work at some point .

Fish skin from cod caught in the Atlantic is being used as a way to help kick-start the healing of chronic wounds. It is estimated that at any one time, more than 200,000 patients have a  hard-to-heal wound, and the cost to the NHS is up to £3 billion a year. A wound is defined as being chronic if it takes more than six weeks to heal. Fish skin from cod caught in the Atlantic is being used as a way to help kick-start the healing of chronic wounds . Wounds that typically become chronic include foot ulcers (a common complication of diabetes which can lead to gangrene and amputation), pressure sores or bed sores, and leg ulcers (caused by high blood pressure). This failure to heal can occur for a variety of reasons, ranging from poor blood and oxygen supply to a weakened immune system and low levels of growth factors necessary for healing tissue. As a result, the scaffolding around which cells should gather to create new tissue to seal the wound does not work properly, leaving it open and inflamed, sometimes for years. A wide range of treatments have been used, including antibiotics, new types of dressings and ultrasound. The idea behind the new treatment, known as Fish Skin Extracellular Matrix (ECM), is to provide a natural scaffolding to help new tissue grow and to complete the healing process. The advantage of fish skin is that it similar to human skin, with the addition of omega 3 oils (which reduces inflammation to boost healing). It is estimated that at any one time, more than 200,000 patients have a  hard-to-heal wound, and the cost to the NHS is up to £3¿billion a year . The fish skin comes from cod farmed in the North Atlantic off Iceland. It is processed to remove most of the cells — leaving the connective tissue and fat behind — and then sterilised. This is placed over the wound. Over time, the fish skin is converted into living, human tissue. Small trials conducted by Kerecis, the Iceland-based company behind the treatment, have shown promising results. In one, ten patients with serious non-healing wounds received the treatment for 28 days. All the wounds treated improved, with six completely healing. None of the wounds had responded to hospital-standard treatment for at least six months before the trial started. In another study involving 37 patients, a year after treatment 36 of the patients had improved — the 37th did not improve but the wound did not get worse, according to Dr Baldur Tumi Baldursson, medical director of Kerecis. It’s hoped that the fish skin could also be used in surgery for hernia repair and breast reconstruction, again as a scaffold for new tissue to grow on. Dr Richard Warren, a consultant dermatologist at Salford Royal NHS foundation Trust and the University of Manchester said: ‘Chronic non-healing wounds are a huge issue for patients, causing enormous suffering, and are often resistant to treatment. ‘Thus, any new effective therapy would be most welcome. 'This new technology has been tested on some patients with encouraging results and has recently been approved for use in the U.S. ‘It is, however, important to recognise that tests so far have been in small numbers of patients and its true effectiveness is yet to be fully appreciated.","Fish skin from cod is being used to help kick-start the healing of wounds .

Karie Murphy's teenage son Ryan was apparently signed up to vote in Falkirk, where she was standing for election, while he was actually living with his father in Glasgow . The Unite union is today facing an explosive new vote-rigging scandal after the son of a woman it fiercely backed to become an MP was apparently signed up to vote for her. The teenage son of Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, was said to be living in Falkirk, where she was fighting a battle for Unite to seize control of a Labour safe seat. In fact, Ryan Cullen lived in Glasgow with his father, from whom Miss Murphy is separated. He is registered on the electoral roll as living in the city, where he works and, until recently, went to school. In the run up to his mother’s vote, he was enrolled as a Labour Party member using the addresses of two rental properties in Falkirk, which would have enabled him to vote for her. However, the owners of the properties have no record of him ever living there. At the time, Miss Murphy, 49, and her allies at Unite recruited new members who they apparently could count on to vote for her to be Labour’s prospective MP. In an apparent bid to manipulate the selection up to 112 membership documents were allegedly falsified, residents were signed up without their consent and signatures forged. Complaints of corruption sparked a police investigation and a Labour probe, which was called off in September by Ed Miliband, who claimed no evidence of wrongdoing had been found. The revelation that Miss Murphy’s own family were among those recruited to Labour – the most damning evidence of electoral corruption in Falkirk to date and a clear breach of party rules – comes as the Labour Party leader faces increasing pressure to reopen investigations into the scandal, which he has repeatedly refused to do. Mr Cullen, who turned 18 in September, has been signed up to the Labour Party in Falkirk for over a year. In that time, he has been registered as living at two rental properties in the town. However, on the electoral roll he is listed as living in the Glasgow suburb Cambuslang with his father William Cullen. A Labour investigation into the alleged vote rigging was called off in September by Ed Miliband who claimed no evidence of wrongdoing had been found . According to the Labour Party, it is an ‘abuse of party rules’ to recruit members who do not live at their claimed addresses and all members must sign up at properties where they are listed on the electoral roll. On his social networking profiles, Mr Cullen declares that he lives in Glasgow, and the owners and agents of the Falkirk rental properties have no record of his ever having lived there. None of them recognised a picture of Mr Cullen or had heard his name before. Miss Murphy’s niece Michelle Crockert, 21, was also signed up at one of the addresses in Falkirk even though she, too, lives and works in Glasgow, where she is registered to vote. Her boyfriend told the Daily Mail: ‘Michelle did have her name down. Her and Ryan. [But] they were not living together. She has always lived here [in Glasgow]. Ryan stays with his dad.’ The Mail spoke to Miss Crockert last week at her home in Glasgow. She did not refute the allegations about her false address in Falkirk, but said: ‘I’m not going to give you any information at all. I don’t want to discuss this. I’m not telling you anything.’ The address where she and Mr Cullen were listed appears to have been carefully selected because it is just inside the parliamentary constituency but also sits within the boundaries of the neighbouring Falkirk East area for the purposes of Scottish elections. Miss Murphy’s close friend and Unite’s main organiser in the town Stevie Deans was expected to run for the Scottish Parliament in Falkirk East next year – so their supposed false address would have allowed them to vote for both Miss Murphy and Mr Deans. Last night Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These allegations are extremely serious. Faced with this new evidence, Ed Miliband must re-open the inquiry into the Falkirk scandal.’ Labour said it was ‘prepared to examine the new evidence’ but would not be drawn on whether the inquiry would be reopened. A spokesman added: ‘We have taken action to ensure no one who joined the Party after Eric Joyce resigned can take part in the selection of a new candidate. Karie Murphy has already withdrawn as a candidate, the UnionJoin scheme has been abolished and Ed Miliband has embarked on the biggest reform of the party in a generation.’ Unite and Miss Murphy declined to comment.","Karie Murphy was fighting for Unite to secure Labour Falkirk seat .

That might be because you’re so engrossed in your words that you’ve stopped breathing. It might sound strange, but apparently 80 per cent of us have picked up this habit – and it could be seriously damaging our health. It is thought that around 80 per cent of us have email apnoea which occurs when your body goes into 'fight or flight mode' while typing . Apnoea is more commonly associated with sleeping. It is characterised by sudden pause in breathing and is most common in adults who are overweight. Like other parts of the nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system operates through a series of interconnected neurons. Breath-holding, shallow breathing and hyperventilating can all trigger something called the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). When . activated, the SNS – among other things - can cause pupils to dilate, . increases heart palpitations, enables opens up blood vessels in the face . and can lead to restless legs and excessive sweating. It also helps in feeling sensations like cold, heat, and pain. Its job is to protect the body when it’s facing physical danger. During an episode, lack of oxygen causes a sufferer to come out of deep sleep and into a lighter state of sleep, or a brief period of wakefulness, to restore normal breathing. Symptoms of the condition include tiredness, waking up with a sore or dry throat, poor memory and concentration, headaches, irritability, anxiety, depression, low libido and impotence. However a variant of sleep apnoea could be caused by the simple process of writing an email. Writing in Gizmodo, blogger Adam Clark Estes, noticed he became lightheaded when he was concentrating on a particularly challenging paragraph. ‘I must've slipped a little too deeply into the zone,’ he said. ‘A head shake and a couple breaths later, and I was back at it. ‘Within minutes, the same light-headed feeling was back. I'd stopped breathing, again.’ After some research, Mr Clark Estes diagnosed himself as having something called ‘email apnoea’. The term, first introduced by former . Apple executive, Linda Stone, describes what happens when you go into . ‘fight or flight’ mode. Breath-holding, shallow breathing and hyperventilating can all trigger something called the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). In the comfort of an office, email apnea can cause undue stress to both the body and the mind . When activated, the SNS – among other things - can cause pupils to dilate, increases heart palpitations, dilates our blood vessels in the face and can lead to restless legs and excessive sweating. Its job is to protect the body when it’s facing physical danger. But in the comfort of an office, the unnecessary reaction can cause undue stress to both the body and the mind. ‘Are we more obese and diabetic because of a combination of holding our breath off and on all day and then failing to move when our bodies have prepared us to do so?’ asked Ms Stone, writing in the Huffington Post. Ms Stone offers some advice to deal with email apnoea, including monitoring breathing, trying to become better aware of anxious feelings and even using a heart-rate monitor. ‘In the meantime, why not breathe while doing email? Awareness is the first step toward wiping out email apnoea,’ she said.","Email apnea occurs when body goes into 'fight or flight' mode while typing .

A mother has told how her three-year-old son has been given only a 50 per cent chance of survival just weeks after doctors first diagnosed him with constipation. Ashton Hutcheson was in tears with constant stomach pains and sickness, but despite several visits to the doctors, his mother was told there was nothing seriously wrong with him. But after a week of sleepless nights, his mother Shanna Hutcheson, 21, begged a paediatrician to check her son again. Ashton Hutcheson, three, was taken to the doctor by his mother, Shanna, 21, when he developed stomach pains and sickness. Ms Hutcheson was told he was constipated and was sent away with medication . He found Ashton had an enlarged liver and a rapid heartbeat and advised him to be rushed to hospital. After a series of scans and checks, it was discovered Ashton had a rare condition called dilated cardiomyopathy and his heart was operating at just five per cent capacity - barely keeping him alive. As a result, he will now need a risky heart transplant. Ms Hutcheson said: ‘He’s the only kid in Scotland to have the condition, as it normally only affects adults, but I will be complaining about the doctors. ‘They basically left me at home for a week with him fighting for his life and it’s just not good enough. ‘We’re now waiting for a heart donor to be found, but they’re saying it is 50/50 whether he’ll survive the operation or not - it’s horrible. When Ashton's condition did not improve, Ms Hutcheson (pictured) begged a paediatrician to check him over again and he was found to have an enlarged liver and an excessively fast heart beat . ‘Ashton’s condition means only five per cent of his heart is actually working - it is basically just keeping him alive and no more.’ Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition which causes the heart muscle to become stretched and thin meaning it cannot cannot pump blood around the body effectively. Ms Hutcheson, from Aberdeen, says the news knocked her for six and admitted she couldn’t have kept herself together if it wasn’t for the support of her mother, Deborah Hutcheson, 42. She said: ‘My mum has been such a great help to me. She was just as worried about Ashton when he had a sore tummy and was being sick. ‘We were both convinced there was something wrong with him, so I took him to a doctor, but he said “no that’s just constipation” and we were told to go home. Ashton (pictured in hospital) was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition which means the heart muscle becomes stretched and thin preventing it from beating effectively . ‘Ashton got worse and I tried to get a doctor to see him a number of times for a whole week, but they said just to keep on giving him the medication they had given me. ‘Eventually I said “I’ve had enough of this” and demanded to see a doctor again. ‘A paediatrician came around and found that Ashton’s heart was beating a too fast and his liver was enlarged, so he got us into hospital straight away.’ After being admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI), Ashton was given echocardiography and an ultrasound. He was then diagnosed with stage two dilated cardiomyopathy and flown by air ambulance to the intensive care unit at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Hospital. Ashton is now waiting for a heart transplant but his mother has been told there is only a 50 per cent chance of him surviving the operation . Ashton spent eight days in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow in the intensive care unit and high dependency unit before being driven back to ARI in an ambulance for another three nights. Ms Hutcheson said: ‘The doctor at ARI explained Ashton’s condition had deteriorated to stage three by then. ‘He then told me that he would need a heart transplant, which will be carried out at a hospital in Newcastle. ‘When I found out that he needed a heart transplant I just kept thinking he was going to die. ‘The doctor sat me down to tell me and I just started screaming and crying.’ Ms Hutcheson now faces an agonising wait . as a heart donor for Ashton is tracked down, but she is worried the . operation won’t come quick enough as her son battles for survival. Ms Hutcheson said: 'When I found out that he needed a heart transplant I just kept thinking he was going to die. The doctor sat me down to tell me and I just started screaming and crying' She said: ‘The operation could be any time from now until the New Year. ‘He’ll be going down to Newcastle soon for a couple of days to have tests done, but we have no word on the op yet. ‘I’ve been told there’s a chance his body could reject the heart, but the main concern at the moment is getting him fit enough for the operation as the medication he’s been taking is making him sick and they couldn’t operate on him at the moment anyway because he’s too thin. ‘I just want to appeal to people and highlight how important organ donation is. ‘I want everyone to go and sign up because it could save a life.’ A spokesman for NHS Grampian said a complaint about Aston's treatment had not been received and that he would encourage his mother to register her concerns through the complaint system. To find out more about organ donation visit www.organdonation.nhs.uk . Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle which causes it to become stretched and thin. This means it is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. The condition can be inherited but it can also be caused by viral infections, uncontrolled high blood pressure, problems with the heart valves, excessive alcohol consumption and pregnancy. The disease can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, ankles, abdomen and other organs - this collection of symptoms is known as heart failure. The most common symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy are shortness of breath, swelling of the ankle and abdomen, excessive tiredness and palpitations. There is no cure for the condition but treatment can be used to control the symptoms and to prevent complications. Treatment options include medicine to control the heart rhythm, a pacemaker and an ICD - an implant which gives the heart an electric shock if it slips out of a normal rhythm.

In its latest project, a cancer foundation based in Belgium has tried to get 20 people to experience the feeling of being 'carefree' after being diagnosed with the disease - and captured that moment on camera. The idea was inspired by a patient who told the foundation, 'You know what I miss the most? Being carefree'. So to make that happen, staff invited 20 patients to a photo studio for what they told them was a free makeover from a team of professional hair and makeup stylists. Noella got a shock when she saw what the stylists had done to her - given her dreads . Being carefree: Hayat couldn't stop laughing after seeing her Mimi Foundation makeover . But there was a condition: They . had to keep their eyes closed the entire time. The stylists then got to work - giving them a completely outlandish look they would never have expected. And when the 20 patients opened their eyes, a photographer captured their shock and surprise through a one-way mirror. Some looked horrified at first, while others broke into laughter straight away. But all of them enjoyed it in the end. The project, named If Only for a Second, was created by the Mimi Foundation, an organisation dedicated to 'the improvement of the quality of life of people affected by cancer'. President and founder Myriam Ullens de Schooten said: 'Learning that one is struck by cancer is terrifying. Suddenly, life changes. 'An operation is always difficult and painful , the following treatments often long and hard. The impact of the disease is different for everyone but still has significant consequences on the patient's life and that of her environment. Before and after: Cancer patient Fabienne's first reaction after being given an extreme makeover . Whoa: Ariane gave this smirk after seeing what the stylists had done to her . Surprise: Jeannine opened her eyes to see this - a very pink makeover . 'I've had difficult times. But I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all those who meant something to me. 'A nice wig and a caring beautician made me feel like I was still a full-fledged woman despite the obvious effects of the disease. 'The support of a psychologist helped me to stay strong throughout my fight. Katy before and after: This cancer patient looked overjoyed at her makeover . Hair-raising: Cancer sufferer Patrick was given this mullet-makeover . The project, named If Only for a Second, was created by the Mimi Foundation, which produced this book . 'The attention from nurses and doctors, brightly decorated oncology centers have made the chemotherapy sessions less stressful. 'The testimonies of people in recovery showed me that I could win the fight and look at the future more positively. 'From that experience I adopted the belief that cancer must be attacked on all fronts, not just medically. And the desire to offer to all those who face this disease, the possibility to be supported , helped and comforted. 'For everyone to live through the cancer ""better"", to take on the challenge with greater confidence.'","Project in Belgium tried to make 20 people experience being 'carefree'

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 21:04 EST, 8 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:04 EST, 8 December 2013 . Hundreds of people with lung cancer have been diagnosed and given potentially lifesaving surgery as a result of a hard-hitting advertising campaign, say experts. Anyone with a cough lasting more than three weeks was urged to see their doctor during the six-week Be Clear On Cancer campaign in the summer. It led to around 700 extra patients being diagnosed with lung cancer - many at an early stage – and 300 more patients getting surgery which gives them the best chance of prolonged survival. Advice: The six-week Be Clear on Cancer campaign urged anyone with a cough lasting more than three weeks to see their doctor (file picture) Fewer than one in seven of the 38,000 new cases every year are diagnosed early enough for effective treatment by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Although survival rates for other forms of the disease have significantly improved in the last 30 years, they have remained almost static for lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer. On average patients will live for just five months after diagnosis compared to nearly 10 years for cancers affecting the bowel and breast. Dr Mick Peake, lung cancer expert and consultant in respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester, said ‘We are starting to see a dramatic change in potentially curative treatments for lung cancer. ‘As a result of the Be Clear on Cancer campaign we’ve seen as much progress, particularly in the proportion of patients having an operation for their lung cancer, in those three months as in the previous two years.’ Pleased: Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said it was 'great news' the campaign had raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms . The £1.8 million campaign is part of a Government drive to improve early cancer diagnosis in the hope of saving an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2015. Adverts on the TV, radio and in newspapers and magazines in August urged people to go to the GP if they had a cough lasting longer than three weeks. An analysis of the results by Cancer Research UK charity found almost 10 per cent more people - around 700 -  were diagnosed with lung cancer than in the same months the previous year. Around 400 more patients had their lung cancer picked up at an early stage – the earlier cancer is detected the more likely treatment is to be successful. There was also a significant fall in the proportion of people diagnosed at a late stage. Around 300 more of those diagnosed received surgery which is vital for better survival. The successful results mean the campaign is likely to run again next year. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said ‘It is great news that this campaign has raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms among those most at risk of the disease. ‘By acting quickly if you notice a possible symptom, you can give yourself the best chance of survival. In many cases it won’t be cancer, but it is better to be sure and, if it is cancer, to detect it earlier rather than later. ‘ . Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said ‘Current lung cancer survival rates in the UK are sadly very low, and it is an area in which we lag considerably behind the rest of Europe and the US. ‘Naturally, we won’t know for sure until subsequent years whether this impact will be a lasting one, but these very positive early indications seem to confirm that such awareness campaigns can make real tangible differences to people’s lives. ‘Coming when new figures revealed lung cancer surgery rates to be at a record high, the Be Clear of Cancer findings tentatively suggest that we might finally be turning a corner in tackling a disease that has been killing too many for too long.’ Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said ‘Until recently a lung cancer patient in Sweden was nearly 70 per cent more likely to survive their disease for at least five years than if they lived in England.’ Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England HE, said ‘To see such encouraging results from the first national Be Clear on Cancer lung campaign is very reassuring. ‘We are now looking to re-run the campaign in 2014 which we hope will improve survival for even more patients.’","Be Clear on Cancer campaign ran across the UK for six weeks this summer .

People in their 40s are the most likely to be admitted to hospital after abusing drink or drugs, a new report has revealed. More than half a million people were admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last three years with health problems related to drink or drug use, health performance experts Dr Foster said. Of the 533,302 admitted since 2010, more than 120,000 were in their 40s. People in their 40s are the most likely to be admitted to hospital after abusing drink or drugs . Of those, 60,738 were 40 to 44, the Guardian said, while 60,083 were between 45 and 49. Almost one in five people in their 40s admitted to hospital in 2012/13 were classed by the NHS as ‘emergency admissions due to a known drug/alcohol issue’, the report said. The news comes just days after the Health and social Care Information Centre revealed that official figures showed alcohol-related hospital admissions among those aged 45 and over have more than doubled in the last ten years. The figures also revealed alcohol-related hospital admissions among those in their 60s have almost tripled. In contrast, the increase was much lower among younger adults. The data shows that in 2012/13, a total of 26,209 men and 12,461 women aged 45 to 49 ended up in hospital due to alcohol. More than half a million people were admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last three years with health problems related to drink or drug use . This was the highest total for any five-year age group. But the statistics reveal that the greatest increase in hospital treatment for alcohol problems over the past decade was among those in their 60s. During that period there was a 178 per cent rise in admissions of men aged 65 to 69 and a 177 per cent increase in admissions for women aged 60 to 64. Admissions more than doubled for every age group over 45. Experts said this was the cumulative effect of life-long drinking by the baby-boomer generation who felt liberated from societal constraints in the 1960s and 1970s. Almost one in five people in their 40s admitted to hospital in 2012/13 were classed by the NHS as 'emergency admissions due to a known drug/alcohol issue' But they added that many older people are drinking too much now. In contrast, the smallest rises among adults in the past ten years were seen among those in their 30s – perhaps because this is the age at which many people settle down and have children. Commenting on the latest figures, experts warned of a generation that is gambling with its long-term health through heavy drinking and drug taking. Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr Foster, told the BBC the figures suggested there was a particular issue among people born in the 1960s. He said: ‘The bulk of the problem is in this age group. It seems they are the ones that have used drinks and drugs more than previous generations and it is now catching up with them in middle age.’ The data, collated for Dr Foster’s annual Hospital Guide, which is released today, also revealed that alcohol and drug abuse problems cost the NHS £607million a year. While drinking problems were spread across all socio-economic groups, the poorest were most likely to end up in hospital. Some 192,014 – 36 per cent - of the total admissions since 2010 were of people in the most deprived income group, compared with 45,957 - 8.6 per cent - of people in the wealthiest 20 per cent. The figures also showed an alarming number of children and teenagers were admitted to hospital for drink and drug problems. More than 1,000 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were hospitalised each year - 3,013 over the three year period - and 24,101 teenagers between 15 and 19 years old. Some 15 per cent of drink or drug-related admissions were among those aged 30 to 34, 18 per cent between 35 and 39, and 16 per cent for 50 to 54-year-olds. More than 1,000 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were hospitalised each year - 3,013 over the three year period - as were 24,101 teenagers between 15 and 19 years old . And the figures uncovered a geographical divide in the numbers of patients admitted because of drink or drugs, with higher rates in the north of England, the Guardian said. Matt Tee, chief operating officer of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said the hidden problem of middle-age drinking to excess was more harmful than binge-drinking. He told the newspaper: ‘It’s all too easy to dupe ourselves that binge-drinking teenagers or stag and hen parties in their 20s are the cause of alcohol-related pressures on the health service. ‘Today’s news puts this myth firmly back in its place and makes it even more important that as a society we seriously examine the impact our drinking habits have on our health - and on our health service.’ The British Medical Association warned that the burden from alcohol on the NHS was unsustainable . The British Medical Association warned that the burden from alcohol on the NHS was unsustainable. A spokesman said: ‘It is vital that we take more action to tackle the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on the UK’s population and the NHS. ‘As the Dr Foster research highlights, this is a problem that affects large numbers of people across all age groups and as a result places serious strain on a number of already overstretched NHS services. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘These figures highlight the very real harm that alcohol and illicit drugs can have on users of all ages, and the need for action not just to raise awareness and prevent substance abuse, but also to ensure that the right services are accessed by the people that need them. ‘We are helping the NHS target harmful drinkers with measures such as increasing the use of interventions by health professionals, and introducing alcohol liaison nurses in A&E. ‘However there must also be more focus on prevention, not just treatment for those with existing problems. ‘We are also working to both reduce harmful drug and alcohol use and to increase the numbers recovering from their dependence. Our focus is on combining health and social policies to help people affected access services, rebuild their lives and play a full part in society.’","More than half a million people were .

EastEnders star Kierston Wareing has branded the BBC soap 'boring' and her character 'one-dimensional' as she prepared to leave the show. The actress, who only came on the show last Christmas, has been axed from her role as Kirsty Branning and is savaging the programme ahead of her exit. The 37-year-old said she did not believe any of the storylines and that her character's behaviour around shotgun husband Max, played by Jake Wood, was ridiculous. Sour grapes? Kierston Wareing has blasted the BBC soap, saying that her character became one-dimensional and that she did not believe in the storyline . 'She was a wet drip by the end of it,,' she told the Daily Mirror. 'When I joined the show there were layers to it – ""Is she nice? Is she not nice?"". 'I had all these ideas. I wanted it to be really gritty but no one wanted to do anything like that.' Ms Wareing said she was happy to be written out as she would not have left a safe acting job had they kept her on the show. She added that the initial shock of celebrity that followed after joining EastEnders left her in tears. Hard to believe: Kierston said she did not understand why her EastEnders character chased after onscreen hubby Max Branning, played by Jake Wood .

Earlier this week it was revealed that Ms Wareing suffered a miscarriage at four months while on set for the show. She told OK! Magazine: 'It's been hard, especially at four . months when you've got the baby scan picture and everything's fine. EastEnders were very supportive during that time.

Shocking footage has emerged of the horrific abuse of pigs at a farm that until recently provided pork to the largest meat producer in the United States. The appalling video was shot at West Coast Farms between September and October by an activist with Mercy for Animals and shows pigs being punched, kicked, smashed into concrete and locked in cages so small they can’t even move. West Coast Farms, in Oklahoma, supplied meat for Tyson, according to Mercy for Animals. Tyson severed all ties after the video was made public. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO -- WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Horrible: This man violently shakes an innocent piglet . Pregnant and abused: This pig is too fat to move, so workers kick it down the walkway . ‘We’re extremely disappointed by the mistreatment shown in the video and will not tolerate this kind of animal mishandling,’ a Tyson spokesperson told The Daily Dot. ‘We are immediately terminating our contract with this farmer and will take possession of the animals remaining on the farm,’ he added. Farm owner Lonnie Herring reportedly fired all employees involved in the video, but their faces were often obscured from sight. The disturbing footage begins with a montage of animals being hit with wooden boards, kicked, beaten and lying in pools of blood or locked in cages. The deplorable physical abuse didn’t just stop at kicking and punching the defenseless pigs. Piglets also endured being violently shaken, thrown through the air only to be spiked on to the concrete floor like footballs or even held by the tail and swung repeatedly into the floor. No anesthesia provided: Piglets have their tails cut and testicles removed without the benefit of any medication to dull the pain . Appaling: This worker sits on the pig, repeatedly punching it . No big deal: A former hog farm worker commented on Reddit that the pigs don't even feel the punches . Despicable: This piglet is kicked by an out-of-control farmhand . Over the top: It is not uncommon for animals to be hit, the former farmhand said, but it usually never approaches this level of violence . A walkway is shown with several bloody piglets on the ground having seizures or writhing in agony, blood is splattered everywhere. Multiple piglets have their tails removed either with a shovel swung violently down on the tail, severing it, or with a pair of shears – no painkillers are administered. Another unfortunate piglet is also shown being held by their hind legs and having their testicles removed, again without painkillers or anesthesia. The suffering causes it to let out a loud squeal and violently shake. A pregnant pig too fat to move is kicked, punched and has clumps of hair ripped out. Horrifying: This pig is still alive, but has begun to rot after being tossed on a pile of other dead pigs . Write caption here . This is not right: Piglets writhe in agony after being slammed onto the concrete floor, some have seizures . Not uncommon, but being done wrong: Ill or infirm piglets are often slammed into the ground to instantly kill them, according to a former pig farm employee . One pig had a bowling ball thrown at its head, other had their eyes gouged out or their ears violently pulled. Pigs barely clinging to life are tossed in piles of dead pigs, they start to rot even though they are still living. A Reddit user who once worked on a hog farm commenting that the abuse shown in the video is far from uncommon, but that this farm took it too far. ‘Piglets are killed by having their heads smashed against the concrete because it’s quick and if done properly (which those guys aren’t doing) the piglets are dead before they even know what happened,’ said legless_kraig.

"The convicted women were immediately transferred to prison . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:30 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:30 EST, 27 November 2013 . An Egyptian court has today jailed 14 women said to be Muslim Brotherhood members for 11 years for belonging to a 'terrorist organisation.' A court in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria also sentenced six men, said to be Brotherhood leaders, to 15 years. Authorities have also ordered the arrest of two leading activists for demonstrating against a disputed protest law. Egyptian courts have jailed 14 women members of the Muslim Brotherhood organisation for belonging to a 'terrorist group' the day after anti-government protests in Cairo . Security forces disperse protesters against the newly released protest law at Talaat Harb Square . The men were found guilty in absentia of inciting the women to block key roads in the city during the uprising between supporters and opponents of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi on October 31. The convicted women were immediately transferred to prison. Seven girls in the same group on trial were sent to a juvenile detention centre until they reach the age of 18, state media said. Their sentencing is the latest in an ongoing government crackdown against Morsi's supporters since the army toppled him on July 3, AFP reports. More than 1,000 people have been killed during clashes between pro- and anti-Morsi groups, while thousands have been arrested, mostly Islamists. On Tuesday, the authorities appeared to widen their campaign when police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse secular and pro-democracy groups, protesting against a law passed at the weekend regulating demonstrations. The law requires protest organisers to give at least three days' written notice before holding demonstrations. Tuesday's clampdown triggered a stand-off between authorities and some prominent activists who led the revolt against long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Tempers flared again on Wednesday when the general prosecutor ordered the arrest of Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 movement that spearheaded the 2011 revolt against Mubarak, and Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent activist. Egypt has issued a protest law that bans demonstrations without a prior notice . Thirteen members of Egypt's constitutional drafting committee suspended their membership on Tuesday to protest against the arrest of activists and protesters in Cairo . 'The two are accused of inciting protesters to hold demonstrations that broke the protest law,' the prosecution said, according to state news agency MENA. The report added that 24 other protesters who joined the demonstration had been ordered detained for four days. Judiciary and other sources said about 60 protesters were detained, including prominent activist Mona Seif, founder of a campaign against military trials of civilians. She was held after joining a protest on Tuesday outside the Shura Council, where Egypt's new constitution is being drafted. Seif and a group of 15 other women and 12 men were later released in the middle of the night on a desert road some 10 kilometres (about six miles) south of Cairo. 'The ministry of interior alleges that each one of us had been dropped at her house, which means that all of us are living in the desert,' Seif wrote on Twitter. The interior ministry later approved a demonstration against the protest law in downtown Cairo's Talat al-Harb Square which hundreds of people attended Wednesday. 'New opponents within own camp' Analysts were puzzled by the law, especially since the revised constitution would guarantee freedom of expression. 'By passing such a law the government is creating opponents within its own camp,' said Hassan Nafea, political professor at Cairo University. 'It is alienating true young revolutionary groups such as Maher's April 6 movement and others who led the January 2011 revolution.' Nafea said it was unlikely the new law signalled the emergence of a police state but said: 'There is a lack of cohesion and cooperation... and there is political immaturity among officials.' Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Egyptians were increasingly 'objecting to the ascendancy of the military and the re-emergence of the secret police. 'Egyptians won't be patient for long with a state that failed to deliver services, abused human rights, and monopolised economic benefits.' Egypt's cabinet, however, vowed to press on with its enforcement of the law. 'The cabinet will support the police in implementing the law with full force and determination. It respects the freedom of expression but as long as it does not turn into chaos,' it said. Under the law, security forces must first verbally warn protesters at prohibited demonstrations to disperse before using water cannon or tear gas, and should only gradually escalate to the firing of birdshot if other means fail.","Court in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria also sentenced six men .

Twitter: Friends of Ralph Ferrett, 34, from Plymouth launched a Twitter campaign to find him a girlfriend . A man who complained he was struggling to find a girlfriend has been inundated with the offer of dates from around the world after his friends launched a campaign to find him a lady on Twitter. Ralph Ferrett's friends decided to take action after tiring of hearing him moan about how 'hopeless' he is with women. They decided to advertise Ralph on Twitter - inviting single women to submit themselves for consideration using the hashtag #GetRalphADate. Within days they had received dozens of responses from ladies keen to try their hand at wooing the 34-year-old Royal Mail union official. Most of the replies came from faraway places like Istanbul and Dubai - but Ralph says he'd rather find a girlfriend closer to his home in Plymouth, Devon. He said: 'When it comes to affairs of the heart I'm a bit hopeless. But this is the 21st century, Twitter is part of the zeitgeist, so who knows? Fingers crossed.' His friend Donna Galloway said: 'We have had quite a lot of interest but most of it has been from outside Devon. 'He is a really intelligent guy, you can have a good conversation with him about politics and he is good with technology. Ralph says he is only really nervous when it comes to girls and has a hard timing speaking to the opposite sex . Friends used the hashtag #GetRalphADate to set the campaign trending . 'He has got a really good sense of . humour, he is a really good cook and he is into his fitness. He is just a . good bloke. He just needs a bit of confidence.' Ralph describes himself on his Twitter page as a ‘Argyle fan, food fanatic, avid reader, tech nerd, triathlete and film lover'.

'I’m a full time trade union official so I have to do a lot of public . speaking and helping people with problems – I’m good at all those sort of things,' he said. 'But when it comes to talking about myself I clam up and get really nervous. ‘I’ve not met anybody in person since the campaign took off on Sunday . night, but I have chatted to a few people. ‘It’s been overwhelming, but I made a conscious decision to let my friends do it.

You're likely to be rated as more attractive when pictured in a group than when alone, according to new research. Being pictured with friends could boost your perceived attractiveness as people tend to 'average out' everyone's facial features when looking at group photos. Observers perceive each individual's face as . more average than they would otherwise - and average faces are deemed more attractive. The phenomenon is dubbed the 'cheerleader effect'. Tulisa shows her support to Little Mix by attending their gig at G-A-Y earlier this month . Research suggests those who are thought to look most average and most attractive, due to lack of oddities. 'Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies,' says Drew Walker, a psychological scientist. He carried out the study alongside Edward Vul of the University of California, San Diego. Their findings were published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, reported Science Daily. 'Perhaps it's like Tolstoy's families: Beautiful people are all alike, but every unattractive person is unattractive in their own way,' says Walker. Tulisa pictured alone at Heaven Nightclub (left) and with Mollie King and Una Healy (right). Research suggests the 'averaging out' of looks in group photos makes everyone look more attractive . The character Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother first coined the term in an episode of the popular TV show. He . said the Cheerleader Effect (Bridesmaid Paradox, Sorority Girl . Syndrome, and, for a brief window in the mid-90s, the Spice Girls . Conspiracy) is when women appear 'hot' - but only as a group, not . individually. If you take each member of that group individually they are in fact, on the contrary, unattractive, as flaws become more obvious. Walker and Vul set out to find out wheher the attractiveness of average faces, coupled with the tendency to encode groups of objects as an 'ensemble', might support Stinson's theory. To test this, researchers performed five experiments with over 130 undergraduate students who were shown pictures of 100 people, and asked to rate their attractiveness. Sometimes the person being rated was in a group portrait with two other people, and other times the pictures were cropped to show the person alone. Overall, participants rated both female and male subjects as more attractive in the group shot than when pictured alone. Being seen in a group offers an attractiveness benefit roughly enough to bump someone up two per cent. The phenomenon was first dubbed the 'cheerleader effect' by Barney Stinson on How I Met Your Mother . 'The effect is definitely small, but some of us need all the help we can get,' said Vul. In several other experiments, Walker and Vul discovered that the pictures don't need to be from an organic group portrait to obtain this effect. Participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of one person out of a collage of 4, 9, and 16 pictures. The 'group' picture was still rated more highly than when that individual's picture was presented alone. 'If the average is more attractive because unattractive idiosyncrasies tend to be averaged out, then individuals with complementary facial features - one person with narrow eyes and one person with wide eyes, for example - would enjoy a greater boost in perceived attractiveness when seen together, as compared to groups composed of individuals who have more similar features,' says Vul. In the study, 'group' pictures were rated more highly than pictures of individuals presented alone .","Cheerleader Effect says group photos boost perceived attractiveness .

One in every four pounds collected in council tax in the last year has gone to funding local government pensions in England. Of the £22.4billion handed over by families in council tax in England in 2012-13, some £5.7billion went towards paying for council workers’ pensions. More than half of all council tax revenue collected in Scotland went on local government pensions in 2011-12. Uncertain future: Pensions expert Michael Johnson claims the figures are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable . Scottish councils paid £1billion in employer contributions for local government pensions, yet they collected just £1.9billion in council tax. The figures, unveiled by pensions expert Michael Johnson, are a sign that the Local Government Pension Scheme is totally unsustainable, he said. In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, he warned that high costs and lax governance are corroding the pension scheme for council workers. This would ultimately end with council taxpayers or the Treasury being landed with the liabilities for paying pensions. Mr Johnson told the Mail: ‘The implications of how much is spent on pensions out of the council tax collected are enormous. There is going to be an absolute societal schism in the years ahead when you compare the average public sector worker to the average private sector worker. ‘The public sector worker’s benefits will on average be three times more than what the private sector employee gets.’ Unlike other public sector schemes, employees do contribute to the Local Government Pension Schemes. Huge disparity: For city of London council workers the administration management costs are £317.30 compared to just £7.60 in West Yorkshire . But an ageing population and a public sector pay freeze has eroded the value of those contributions. Experts predict that within three years the scheme will run out of cash. The weakest funds were already selling off assets just to bankroll existing pensioners. ‘With no realistic prospect of recovery, they are probably in a death spiral, heading to an unfunded status,’ Mr Johnson said. He warned that the ‘ultimate liability will probable fall on council taxpayers’. There was also a ‘quiet assumption … that one day, the Treasury will step in’. ‘Successive governments, irrespective of political hue, have, for decades, acted with irresponsible abandon when making provision for their own staff’s pensions. Pension promises have historically been worth roughly 35 per cent of salary, yet contributions have been only around 21 per cent: pure Madoff economics,’ he said, referring to the pyramid scheme which has been described as the biggest financial fraud of all time. Mr Johnson’s report highlighted the massive disparities in administration management costs: £13.70 in Nottinghamshire per member compared to £119.40 in Durham. Fund management costs were even more varied with City of London council workers paying £317.30 each compared to £7.60 in West Yorkshire. Mr Johnson called for some of the 101 pension schemes to be merged into several regional ones. The also queried why councils were paying so much to fund managers to actively invest their money when studies showed they provided little value when compared to ‘passive’ investments. The Mail understands that ministers and senior civil servants are closely scrutinising his recommendations. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘The problems identified in this report are already being addressed and many of the suggested reforms are underway and well advanced. ‘The LGPS is one of the lowest cost pension schemes in the country and we will continue to work very hard to improve performance and value for both taxpayers and pension fund members. The steps we are taking to make it possible to compare costs and performance between funds, and make merging easier for those funds that chose to do so, will secure the long-term viability of the scheme. ‘We are in the middle of a formal call for evidence on the future structure of the LGPS which is considering a number of issues including the size of funds, investment strategy, deficit management and cash-flow. That will result in a formal consultation early in the new year.’","Of the £22.4billion handed over by families in council tax in England in 2012-13, some £5.7billion went towards paying for council workers’ pensions .

Activist: Taylor Radig was charged Friday for waiting two months after she had stopped working at Quanah Cattle Co. to report the severe animal abuse she filmed while undercover at the farm . An animal rights activist who worked undercover at a Colorado cattle company and filmed the ‘severe abuse’ of newborn calves has been cited for animal cruelty. Taylor Radig was charged Friday with the misdemeanour for waiting for two months after she had stopped working at Quanah Cattle Co. to report the abuse. The video she filmed earlier this year for the animals rights organisation, Compassion Over Killing, shows three farmworkers cruelly abusing the calves – some of which still have their umbilical cords attached - while they move them on and off trucks. Quanah Cattle Co. (QCC) is an animal agribusiness company in Kersey, Colorado, that purchases newborn calves from dairy factories and temporarily confines them in small cubicles before shipping them out to be raised for their meat, according to Compassion Over Killing. Many of these calves are just days old and are too feeble or frightened to walk steadily. The fragile animals are seen being violently dragged by their legs, kicked, pulled by their ears, lifted by their tails, thrown to the ground, slammed onto the trucks and even flipped over - and covered in flies. Abuse: Radig went undercover at a cattle farm in Colorado and filmed the abuse of calves, some of which were picked up by their tails . Thrown: The animals were seen being violently thrown into the back of trucks . Terrible: The men were seen pulling the calves by their ears while many of the animals tried to resist the bad treatment . Ill treatment: The feeble animals were pushed to the ground and kicked off the trucks. They are seen falling down and struggling to get up . Picked up: This animal was grabbed by its tail and dangled as it was hauled towards the holding cell .

She was the American society beauty who captured the heart of a king and changed the course of British and Commonwealth history in the process. Now a stunning collection of jewels that shed light on the extraordinary love affair between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII is to go on sale at Sotheby's. Among the pieces going under the hammer today is a silver watch that tells of Simpson's heartbreak after being forced to separate from her future husband in the months leading up to his abdication. Love story: Jewels and mementos belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor will go on sale at Sotheby's . Magnificent: Stunning jewels including a sapphire bracelet and diamond medallion will also be part of the sale . Present: This inscribed silver cigarette case was given to the future Edward VIII by his mother, Queen Mary . The keepsake, which was sent to Edward VIII in 1937, even bears an inscription in Simpson's handwriting, which reads, simply: 'Wallis Easter 28 - III - 37 David'. Also included in the sale are examples from Simpson's magnificent jewellery collection, among them a stunning sapphire bracelet by Cartier that is expected to fetch between Â£130,000 and Â£180,000. Other jewels belonging to Simpson include a coral, diamond and emerald torsade choker, made by Cartier for the then Duchess of Windsor in 1949. There is also a stunning pair of diamond, enamel and coral clips commissioned by the royal couple from Van Cleef & Arpels and presented to the Duke's private secretary Anne Segrim as a Christmas gift. But not every piece in the sale . belonged to the American duchess. Also included in the sale are pieces linked . to other members of the Royal Family, including Queen Victoria, her son . Edward VII and his wife Queen Alexandra. Particularly touching is a silver frame presented by the Queen-Empress to the future Edward VIII on his fourth birthday that bears the inscription: 'From Great Grandmama V.R.I 24th May 1899'. Heartbreak: This fob watch was given to the Duke by the Duchess in the months leading up to his abdication . Another gift in the collection, a silver cigarette case, carries an equally affecting message and was given to Edward VIII by his mother, Queen Mary of Teck. The rectangular cigarette case, featuring an elaborate silver basket-work design, has an inscription on the inside that reads: 'Darling David from Mama, God bless you, 1925'. Sotheby's, which achieved a world record sales total when it auctioned the rest of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels in 1987, hopes that the new collection will be similarly well received. 'Sotheby's 1987 landmark sale of the jewels of the Duchess of Windsor remained the most valuable single-owner jewellery sale for almost a quarter of a century and inaugurated a new era in the jewellery auction market,' explained David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's jewellery division in Europe and the Middle East. 'Three years ago, we witnessed the continuing fascination for this collection when 20 pieces from the original sale reappeared at auction in Sotheby's London and established new price levels. 'We are delighted to present this further selection of attractive jewels and precious objects, which shed light on the Duke's life, and what has been called the greatest love story of the 20th century.' The sale of 459 lots will be held in two sessions beginning at 10am and again at 2pm. Enduring: After refusing to give Mrs Simpson up, the former Edward VIII abdicated in favour of his brother . Few could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the Royal Family - and the UK - has ever faced. But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king. The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love. At first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died on the 20th January 1936. When, the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he intended to marry her. This precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees. Edward suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and South Africa rejected the plan. By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country. Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on the 13th December 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII. The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the 3rd June 1937 in the south of France. Although Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'

Alone in the darkness, in icy waters on the sea bed, her rusting hulk symbolises the sacrifice so many made for freedom. This is the ghostly image of HMS Royal Oak, torpedoed by a German U-Boat during one of the blackest days of the Second World War. The magnificent battleship’s guns lie twisted in the deep, her once-proud tower broken and buried by the sands of the last seven decades. Tragedy: 800 officers were killed in the attack on HMS Royal Oak on October 14, 1939 as it sat in the Orkney sea. It sank in 13 minutes after being torpedoed . Cheap: Naval leaders ordered for the battleship to be cheaper than they could afford. But as war approached they backtracked and weighed it down with weaponry . But today, after a poignant mission . ahead of tomorrow’s Remembrance Day commemorations, a white ensign was . raised once again from the ship. Royal Navy divers carried a new . standard 80ft below the surface of Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, where the . warship sunk in 1939, and attached it to the upturned hull. It is an annual ritual performed to underline an eternal promise - that those who gave their lives would never be forgotten. Remembering: A naval diver replaced the White Ensign - a Union Jack and St George's flag - on the wreck of HMS Royal Oak in the Scapa Flow in the Orkneys . Wartime: She faced Franco's bombers while protecting the borders of Spain during the Civil War 1936-9. The ship also starred in a film as a South American rebel vessel . 'The Mighty Oak' as she was known, was a Revenge Class battleship built in Devonport and launched in 1914. She first saw action at the Battle of Jutland. The 29,000 ton ship had a top speed of 20 knots and an impressive array of guns. But by the time World War II broke out she was deemed unsuitable for front-line action. She was sunk while anchored at Scapa Flow, the wartime home of the fleet, on October 14, 1939. The war was just 41 days old. A U-Boat captained by German naval ace Günther Prien sneaked through a blockade into the supposedly safe haven, and fired a series of torpedoes. Three scored direct hits and the ship took only around ten minutes to sink. HMS Royal Oak was loaded with fuel and ammunition - so regular safety inspections of the wreck have to be carried out along the wreck's 620ft (189m) hull. Twelve years ago, 97-year-old war widow Dorothy Golding was reunited with her late husband Arthur when her ashes were placed in a weighted casket in the ship on which he died. Six weeks into the war, 833 sailors were killed when the ship went down in minutes after being attacked at anchor. Most were killed by fire, many as they slept in their hammocks. Of those who escaped, few survived the freezing cold sea. More . than 100 of the ship’s 1,234 compliment were ‘boy sailors’, the war’s . biggest loss of these brave teenage seamen, assigned to the British . fleet before they became ordinary seamen at 18. In . a sombre ceremony, ten divers from the Royal Navy Northern Diving . Group, based at Faslane, raised the flag in the eerie underwater silence . before attaching it to an upper propshaft and saluting the memory of . the fallen. Normally, the white ensign is flown at all times when Royal Navy ships are underway. Here, . it could hardly flutter in the same way as the one on a nearby shore . memorial does - but at least the current allowed it to stay unfurled . with some dignity. This . was still a war grave, after all, and hundreds of ordinary men and . boys, who once served beneath this flag’s wartime forebear, lay inside. The ship’s previous ensign was recovered and will be presented to the Royal Oak Association. The . haunting picture of HMS Royal Oak was created technologically 12 years . ago by joining together a series of photographs and video clips, the . only possible way to visualise the wreck through the murky waters as a . single image. Even on the clearest days, visibility is limited to around 50ft; on bad days, to virtually nothing. After . the ensign was in place, the diving group’s commanding officer, . Lieutenant Commander Richard Osbaldestin, paid tribute to the dead and . their sacrifice. ‘Diving . on the Royal Oak is a timely reminder to the younger members of the . team of the UK’s maritime heritage and the great contribution the Royal . Navy made,’ he said. ‘For . many at the time, this tragedy symbolised the beginning of the war in . the realisation that nowhere was safe - and the country was at war at . home just as much as it was on the Continent.’ Having survived the First World War, she narrowly missed bombs thrown by Franco's pilot during the Spanish Civil War while conducting 'non intervention patrols' around the coast. In . 1937 she also starred in a melodramatic movie, Our Fighting Navy, as a . South American rebel ship, El Mirante, commandeered by Robert Douglas. Despite the relatively shallow water in which she sank, the majority of bodies could not be recovered from Royal Oak. The wreck has been designated a war grave and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. Ritual: Officers remember the site, now an official war grave, every year. This time, they recovered the original flag and took it to display . 'Diving on the Royal Oak is a timely reminder to the younger members of the team of the UK's maritime heritage,' Lt Cdr Richard Osbaldestin said . The brass letters that formed Royal Oak's name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. After being returned twenty years later, they were displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness. A . memorial at St Magnus' Cathedral in nearby Kirkwall displays a plaque . dedicated to those who lost their lives and a book of names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. A page of the book is turned every week.","HMS Royal Oak was fired three times by Germans in the early hours of October 14, 1939, in Orkney, Scotland .

In the wake of a traumatic murder, many grieving relatives look to old photos and mementos for comfort. When tragedy struck her family, photographer Noelle Swan Gilbert chose to pick up the camera instead and unknowingly began forming a collection of photos that documented what life looked like after a murder. Noelle's sister Laura Swan was stabbed to death by her husband in the family kitchen, leaving their two young sons without a mother and with a father behind bars. 'I was obviously in a state of grief and shock when it happened and I just stopped doing everything in my life,' Ms Gilbert told MailOnline about the 2007 murder. Facing the uncertain: For the year after their father killed their mother, Tommy (left) and Mike (right) were kept in the dark about exactly what happened for fear that their father would take them away from the custody of their maternal grandparents . Changes: When Laura Swan was killed in 2007, her mother (pictured right) took custody of her two grandchildren and moved them from their home in Colorado to her house in Seattle, Washington . Heartbreaking: The boys initially were told that there father was staying behind in Colorado to help police find who killed their mother. They didn't know that he was the one who stabbed her to death . Watchful eye: It was only after their father's sentencing, when he accepted a 25-year plea deal, that they learned what happened and their grandparents were awarded custody . A professional fine arts photographer, Ms Gilbert could not even bring herself to pick up a camera until three months after Laura's death. By that time, Laura's two sons- Tommy, 2, and Mikey, 4- had been taken out of temporary foster care and been temporarily placed in the guardianship of their maternal grandparents. In her memory: Noelle Swan Gilbert, the boys' aunt, told MailOnline that they love hearing stories about their 'beautiful' mother Laura Swan (pictured) It was only when the family gathered for Thanksgiving at her mother's Seattle home that she thought to bring her camera, as her mother wanted a photo of the seven grandkids together for her Christmas card. 'It was really the first time I had had a camera in my hands,' Ms Gilbert told MailOnline. 'I was so sad and instead of looking at them directly, I just started taking pictures of them,' she said of the two orphaned boys. At first glance, the pictures appear to be just simple depictions of the normal lives of everyday children. It is only with the knowledge of what the boys went through that a new element of sadness is cast over each image. Ms Swan Gilbert took photos of the boys starting from three months after the murder and stretching until just recently. 'The last time I saw them, it didn't feel right to shoot them so I haven’t actually shot them in two years because I do value our privacy and our relationship too much,' Ms Gilbert said. Their father, Alfred Michael 'Mike' Strauss, accepted a plea deal of 25 years for second degree murder. Powering through the pain: Ms Gilbert, a professional fine arts photographer, found the first Thanksgiving after her sister's murder the most difficult and she found it comforting to look at her nephews through a camera lens . Stopping the bad guys: The boys sometimes receive cards from their father behind bars . Moving on: Tommy, the younger of the two, reminds Ms Gilbert of his slain mother with his mischievous sense of humor . Growing up: The boys are both extremely athletic and have adapted quickly to their new home in Seattle . Keeping busy: Tommy and Mike, seen here with other relatives, now live with their aunt who also has a son their age and Ms Gilbert says that all three boys are being raised like brothers . In court, he said that he stabbed his wife in the midst of an argument, but gave little other explanation as the case never went to trial. He legally had custody of the couple's two sons for months immediately after the murder and his wife's mother and father, the boys' grandparents, was given temporary custody while he was behind bars up until he was finally sentenced. 'We fought a really long battle to keep them and my parents were visited all the time by social services,' Ms Gilbert said of the period before her grandparents were granted full custody. During that waiting period, the relatives kept mum on what happened between the boys' parents because they feared that, since Strauss still had legal authority over the boys, he may revoke their guardianship of them. 'It feels like it was yesterday and then it feels like it was ten years ago,' Ms Gilbert says of her sister's murder . Moving fast: Ms Gilbert said that as time went on, she began taking fewer and fewer photos of her nephews during their visits . Rights of passage: Mike, seen here ahead of his Holy Communion, enjoys sports just like his younger brother but Ms Gilbert says that he can be slightly more quiet at times . 'They knew that their mother was dead and they thought their father was helping them find the person who killed her,' Ms Gilbert said of what they told Tommy and Mikey, who now prefers to go by Mike. 'They were confused! We felt like such a******s!' Ms Gilbert said of the pressure of keeping the truth of their mother's death under wraps for so long due to the custody controversy. Now, the boys lives have adapted to life far removed from the 2007 murder in their old house in Colorado. They originally were taken in by their grandparents in Seattle, Washington. Their aunt Megan and her son- who is about the same age as Tommy- moved into the grandparents home for a time and now Megan has moved out and takes care of all three of the boys, raising them like brothers. Small moments: The boys have adapted to their new life but their aunt caught several of their reflective moments on camera (Tommy seen here with one of his aunts) 'They're both extremely athletic and they are really the kind and smart and really great kids,' Ms Gilbert said of Tommy and Mike who are now 9 and 11 years old respectively. 'Mike is more quiet and really smart. He's like a superstar basketball player. Tommy's hilariously funny and reminds me a lot of my sister. He's kind of mischievous. 'When I look at him and he says something I immediately think of my sister. He's so freaking cute.' The boys are aware of the photo project that their aunt has put together through the years, but they are not overly interested in looking through those trying times. 'They love talking about their Mom because they love hearing stories about her but they're 9 and 11- they want to talk about the Broncos and the Seahawks. They're doing their sports stuff,' Ms Gilbert told MailOnline.","Laura Swan was stabbed to death by her husband in 2007, leaving their two sons motherless and their father behind bars .

Upstate New York is braced to receive an onslaught of lake effect snow by week's end. New Yorkers from Syracuse to Watertown could see as much as three feet thanks to the coldest temperatures to hit the region yet this season blowing across Lake Ontario. Other lakeside cities like Chicago and Buffalo also expected major snow from the second bitter arctic blast of the year, which is set to chill Americans from Cincinnati to Boston by Thursday. Lake effect: Cities across much of the Great Lakes region will see snow through the end of the week, with localized accumulation as much as four feet in some areas . Weather maps of the Great Lakes region show nothing but snow in the forecast through Friday, with the most intense precipitation in Upstate New York. Locally intense snowfall east of Lake Michigan, south of Lake Superior and east of Lake Ontario could reach a whopping four feet, according to Accuweather.com. Lake effect snow occurs when cold, dry air passes over the relatively warm water of the Great Lakes and picks up moisture. That moisture eventually freezes and falls in the form of snow. Enough already: Buffalo, new York (pictured) is no stranger to lake effect snow and received this blanketing at Thanksgiving. The city is now braced for another two feet by Friday . How it works: As cold, dry air blows across the relatively warm lakes, it gathers moisture and eventually releases it as snow . Frigid days ahead: The air currently blowing across the Great Lakes is the coldest arctic blast of the season and is due to stretch through the Midwest, the South and then chill most of the Northeast by Thursday . In addition to Upstate New York, parts of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania also commonly feel the effects. Buffalo, New York is no stranger to lake effect snow and is expected to receive slightly less than the Syracuse area, with accumulation closer to two feet. Chicago saw a couple of inches of snow Wednesday morning as the arctic blast blew south. While the snowfall was brief, the city braced for extreme cold and wind chills that could feel like -25 degree Fahrenheit at their worst. While too far from any lakes for this round of snowfall, East Coasters from Washington, DC through New York City to Boston can expect the feel the coldest temperatures yet this season by Thursday as the arctic blast reaches south then blows northeastward.

Pigs are considered unclean by Muslims, who are forbidden from eating them. Gruesome: Islamic faithfuls inspect the spot where the heads of two pigs were dumped on Wednesday morning . Muslim leaders have condemned the act, while the mayor of Montauban branded the incident an 'odious and blasphemous act toward the Muslim community'. Police have launched an investigation. Muslim leaders said the vandalism was especially shocking because it happened during the holy month of Ramadan. Abdallah Zekri, a regional Muslim leader based in Nimes, said: 'This was meant to dirty this place of prayer.' The incident has been condemned by the mayor of Montauban as an 'odious act towards the Muslim community' It was the first such incident in Montauban, a town with a population of around 56,000 near the city of Toulouse in southern France. In 2009, pigs' trotters were hung on a mosque in Castres, also in southern France, and a Nazi swastika was painted on its walls along with racist and nationalist slogans. The discovery of the pigs' heads came a day after officials in the northern Paris suburb of Gennevilliers reinstated four summer camp counsellors who had been suspended for Ramadan fasting. After an outcry, the town decided that during the month of August it would not apply a clause in the labour contract requiring summer camp counsellors to be fully fed and hydrated, a statement said.","Heads of two animals found on Wednesday morning in mosque in Montauban, near Toulouse .

Sheila Hibbert went three days without insulin injections after doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to notify her district nurse when she was discharged . A diabetic grandmother who went up to three days without receiving insulin injections died as the result of multiple failings by hospital staff, a coroner has ruled. Sheila Hibbert, 77, was admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary where staff failed to check her blood sugar levels or give her prescribed treatments for up to nine hours. The grandmother went an additional 24 hours without receiving any medication as the hospital failed to notify her district nurse when she was discharged, an inquest heard. By the time Mrs Hibbert's nurse, who had administered her insulin on a daily basis since 1991, arrived at her home, the 77-year-old's blood sugar levels were considerably high. She was taken to hospital for a second time, where she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, a dangerous complication caused by lack of insulin. The pensioner, who was also undergoing chemotherapy for endometrial cancer, died from multiple organ failure on February 6, just a week after being admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary. Bradford Assistant Coroner Dominic Bell said a 'series of assumptions' from nurses and doctors contributed to Mrs Hibbert not receiving her medication. Dr Bell ruled there was a failure to identify the origins of her admission symptoms, a failure to identify her deteriorating renal function, a failure to act on her high blood sugar levels, a failure to prescribe and administer the appropriate insulin and a failure to notify the district nursing team when she was discharged. During the inquest, the court heard that Mrs Hibbert was with her son and daughter-in-law on January 30 last year when she began feeling unwell. Mrs Hibbert was kept in hospital overnight where she was already due to undergo chemotherapy the following day. She was discharged from hospital on January 31 after her scheduled chemotherapy, but the district nurse said she was not aware her patient was back home until February 2, when she received a call from staff at Ward 15. Care workers had found Mrs Hibbert was ill at home and called the hospital. District nurse Laila Bretts told the inquest: 'We kind of got a bit worried thinking that as far as we knew she wasn’t at home. 'Then they told us she had actually been discharged on the Tuesday, at which point I picked up my coat and bag and set off. A coroner ruled staff at the hospital failed to ensure the 77-year-old received appropriate medication and failed to notify her district nurse when she was discharged . 'I realised then she hadn’t been seen on Wednesday to have her insulin.' Despite care workers' best efforts, Mrs Hibbert's condition did not improve. She was taken back to the hospital where she died days later. Mrs Hibbert’s 50-year-old son Julian is now pursuing legal action against Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Speaking after the hearing, he said: 'It seems there was a complete breakdown - nobody seemed to be doing what was expected, and nobody seemed to be taking responsibility. 'It seems there have been a lot more mistakes made than we initially thought - mistakes all the way through.' The inquest heard that since Mrs Hibbert’s death changes had been made at the hospital ward following an investigation. Mr Hibbert, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, added: 'The new measures seem to be very good, but they’re too late for us.

The family of a 10-year-old Amish girl with leukemia have fled the country with her as they seek to avoid their child being forced to resume chemotherapy treatments. Attorney Maurice Thompson confirmed today that Anna and Andy Hershberger have disappeared along with their daughter, Sarah from their Homer Township, Ohio home and he doesn't know if they have returned to the United States. The family has been fighting a hospital in court for months after the parents decided to halt the treatments because they couldn't continue to watch their child undergo the arduous radiation treatment. No Answer: Anna and Andy Hershberger are not at their farm in Homer Township, Ohio and their lawyer confirmed today that the they have fled the country along with their 10-year-old daughter, Sarah, to avoid her receiving treatment for her cancer . It has emerged they left their home in rural northeast Ohio just days before a state appeals court appointed a guardian in October to take over medical decisions for the Sarah Hershberger, said Thompson - and have not been seen since. 'They don't want Sarah to be taken away,' he said. County Sheriff Tom Miller said his office has no idea where the Hershbergers might be and is not actively searching for the family. 'It would take a court order for us to get involved,' Miller said to the Medina Gazette, 'and I’m not anticipating a court order.' Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable, but say she will die without chemotherapy. The hospital went to court after the family decided to stop chemotherapy and treat Sarah with natural medicines, such as herbs and vitamins. Absconded: The parents of Sarah Hershberger - the Amish girl who has treatable cancer have reportedly fled the United States to avoid her being forced into treatment . An appeals court ruling in October gave attorney Maria Schimer, who's also a registered nurse limited guardianship over Sarah and the power to make medical decisions for her. The court said the beliefs and convictions of her parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child. Hoping to help: The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, would be granted the right to make Sarah Hershberger's medical decisions if the appeal is granted . The family has appealed the decision . to both the appeals court and the Ohio Supreme Court. They also plan to . file a motion to terminate the guardianship. They have not had any contact with the guardian since the ruling, said Clair Dickinson, the guardian's attorney. A . taxi was sent to the family's home nearly two months ago after the . guardian was appointed to take the Sarah to the hospital in Akron, but . someone at the home said the family was not there, Dickinson said. There . are no plans to ask the court to find the family or force the girl into . chemotherapy while the case is being appealed, he said. He . said Sarah's last known chemotherapy session was in June, and that . doctors have said she could die within a year if treatments don't . resume. 'I'm very concerned about her,' he said. Clair Dickinson, an attorney representing Schimer, said he didn’t know the family’s whereabouts. 'All I know is that she and her parents don’t seem to be at her house,' he said. Thompson said the girl has undergone . alternative-therapy treatments and is doing well. The family told him . that she has more energy and that CT scans show the treatments are . working. Andy Hershberger, . the girl's father, said this past summer that the family agreed to begin . two years of treatments for Sarah last spring but stopped a second . round of chemotherapy in June because it was making her extremely sick. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (who is not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . Sarah begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer, Hershberger said. The family, members of an insular Amish community, shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious. They live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of Spencer in Medina County, about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland. Hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care. The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, is now appealed in August to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for Sarah. 'The plan presented by Sarah’s parents is almost certain to lead to Sarah’s death,' she wrote in a letter to the court. 'Every day that goes by without treatment, Sarah’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished.' With chemotherapy, her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent.","The Amish parents of Sarah Hershberger, 10, have fled their home in Ohio to avoid her being forced to resume treatment for her cancer .

The 16-year-old boy who died after suffering a medical emergency on a Delta flight on Saturday has been identified as Zachary Bisiar. The teenager, who suffered from cerebral palsy, went into cardiac arrest after a medical emergency 30 minutes after take-off from Seattle on a flight bound for Atlanta. The boy was flying with his mother, grandmother and younger brother to visit his father, who is stationed at McChord Air Force Base, for Christmas. Zachary Bisiar, 16, who suffered from cerebral palsy, went into cardiac arrest 30 minutes after take-off from Seattle on a flight bound for Atlanta . The medical examiner's office in Washington's Spokane County said on Monday that the autopsy results for Zachary were still pending further tests. Forensic pathologist Sally S. Aiken, with Spokane's Medical Examiner office, noted that the cause of the boy's death is currently 'pending' further microscopic and other studies. In a statement, Dr. Aiken said that it was 'thought to be a rare complication of a rare disease process. The manner of death is natural.' The plane was diverted to an airport in Spokane, Washington, after the boy suffered a medical emergency and died on board. 'It was a complete surprise - they were completely devastated,' said Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian Schaeffer. Zachary's uncle Steven Leahy has launched a fundraising page to help his sister and her husband cover the expenses involved in funeral which is scheduled for December 22. He hopes to raise $15,000.

Washington State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from divulging such information outside of a coroner’s report, but Schaeffer did say there was nothing in his medical history to suggest such an incident was to be expected. The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline.

"By . Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 26 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 27 November 2013 . He has promised to show his baby son, Prince George, the marvels of Africa one day. And yesterday Prince William took his first step to safeguard the continent and its wildlife, launching a new project to halt the sickening global trade in illegal animal products. Accompanied by his father, Prince Charles, an equally ardent conservationist, the second in line to the throne said he wanted to highlight the worrying increase in the trafficking of ivory and rhino horn as well as bush meat and live endangered species. William shared a joke with his father Prince Charles while on a visit to London zoo to launch the new project aimed at protecting some of the world's most vulnerable animals . The new scheme aims to stop the trade in endangered animal products including rhino horns and ivory . The princes chose to launch their initiative in the uniquely appropriate surroundings of the new Tiger Territory at the world famous London Zoo. The zoo has two Sumatran tigers, a five-year-old male called Jae Jae and his mate, Melati, five, big cats who face an uncertain future in the wild. To combat their instinctive shyness, the keepers had left nothing to chance, leaving an offering of fresh horse meat and spraying their enclosures with perfume which, apparently, stimulates their scent marking instincts. William is president of the new United for Wildlife which aims to curb the recent boom in the trade of endangered species and animal products . The scent of the day was Hugo Boss although the female, unsurprisingly, prefers Jo Malone, while the male rather likes Old Spice. Keeper Teague Stubbington said: ‘We have kept back a little of their breakfast - horse meat today - in order to encourage them out of their enclosures. ‘This is quite normal and helps to stimulate their natural hunting behaviour. We will often hide it and make a game of finding it. ‘I have also been leaving a trail of perfume - Hugo Boss today. Tigers don’t hide away in the jungle, they like to advertise their presence. ‘Putting perfume down helps to stimulate their scent marking behaviour. Melati prefers Jo Malone and Jae Jae is partial to a bit of Old Spice.’ Describing them as ‘beautiful and majestic’ creatures, William couldn’t hide his passion for conservation as he launched his new United for Wildlife project. United for Wildlife is an umbrella organisation, bringing together seven of the world’s biggest campaigners, including WWF-UK and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), in order to tackle global crises in conservation. William is president of the organisation. The first issue for them is the trade in illegal wildlife products, which has exploded again in recent years. According to research highlighted at the London Zoo briefing, just 60 African rhinos had been poached by the middle of the last decade - compared to 800 already so far this year. That number is expected to rise to 1,000 by the end of 2013. Similarly out of the 423,000-strong African elephant population, 25,000 were slaughtered for their tusks last year. The royals looked at new technologies are . being used to wage war on illegal wildlife poachers, from remote . controlled drones to monitor animals to cameras that can be hidden in . fake stones to capture images of the poachers and send them back . remotely to local rangers. The Royals spoke with Zoological Society of London President Sir Patrick Bateson (2nd right), and Director General Ralph Armond (right) The trade in rhino horn has boomed in recent years. While just 60 were poached in the middle of the last decade, 800 have been killed so far this year, along with 25,000 elephants slaughtered for their ivory . William spoke from the heart about his determination to get such experts in ‘one room to focus their energy and their commitment to one cause - particularly obviously this illegal wildlife trade at the moment is such a big issue’. The charities uses technology such as remote drones and cameras hidden inside rocks to catch poachers. Here Prince William gets to grips with a toy segull . ‘The idea was that United for Wildlife can progress and we can really start the ball rolling and the momentum and really try and change and tackle this issue,’ he said. The prince, who said he hopes to travel to Kenya next year to further his work, went on: ‘Education is the most important thing as we saw with the shark fin soup campaign - the more education, the more obviously we can put out there and show people and educate them on what they’re buying and what they’re seeing and really try and change their attitudes. ‘I think we’ve got a real chance of changing the way things are going. ‘One of the aims is to identify just who is doing it. If they cannot be caught at the time, at least we have a picture of the guy so they can be prosecuted.’ Charles also said the need to reduce the markets for illegal animal products was a crucial issue. He explained: ‘One of the most important things is helping the NGOs who struggle away, particularly organisations like Traffic (the wildlife trade monitoring network) and WildAid (anti-illegal wildlife trade body) and the World Wildlife Fund, of which I’m president in the UK. ‘They’re doing a fantastic job but they’re up against a huge series of obstacles.’ He added: ‘The most important thing to remember, I think, is that you have to reduce consumption of illegal wildlife parts, whether it’s ivory, or rhino horn, tiger parts, or whatever from various endangered species.’","The two princes visited London Zoo today to launch a wildlife project .

Anger: Jordan Graham (pictured with her deceased husband Cody Johnson) allegedly spoke about killing her mother and step-father in the weeks before she became a widow . The Montana bride accused of killing her new husband by pushing him off a cliff at Glacier National Park had spoken of killing her mother and stepfather in the weeks before her June wedding, federal prosecutors claimed in legal documents filed on Tuesday. Prosecutors allege that 22-year-old Jordan Graham was unhappy in her new marriage and deliberately shoved her blindfolded husband of eight days off a rock ledge during an argument while hiking a steep trail on July 7. She was indicted last month on charges of first- and second-degree murder in the death of Cody Johnson, 25. Her attorneys have insisted his death was an accident. Prosecutors, in filings in U.S. District Court in Missoula, said they plan to produce evidence at next month's trial that Graham made statements about killing her mother, Lindel Rutledge, and stepfather about five weeks before Johnson plunged to his death. They argued that Graham's remarks about killing her parents, made in the weeks before her wedding, would be used to 'negate innocent intent and demonstrate the likelihood that the defendant did an act with the requisite intent in the charged case,' according to legal documents filed late on Tuesday. Prosecutors also notified the court that they intend to prove Graham lied about alleged abuse she suffered in previous romantic relationships, arguing that such fabrications provided key insights about her state of mind and credibility. Accused: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the courthouse after pleading not guilty to charges last month . Graham told federal investigators that Johnson had 'tried to hold me down' during an argument at their home in the city of Kalispell just before the couple went for the hike at Glacier, court records show. She said that when her husband 'tried to grab my arm and my jacket' during the dispute and that she acted in self-defense by pulling away even as she pushed him, according to legal documents filed by Graham's federal defenders. Her attorneys have previously scolded prosecutors for labeling their client a sociopath and for theorizing that a cloth found near Johnson's body might have been used to blindfold him. Her lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Prosecutors said in legal filings on Tuesday that an FBI forensic scientist who conducted tests on the material will testify at trial about 'the discovery of six human hairs embedded in the cloth.' A U.S. judge in September ordered Graham released from jail, fitted with an electronic monitoring device and placed in the custody of her parents at their Kalispell home pending trial. Earlier this month, Jordan Graham testified at her murder indictment that she instinctively pushed Cody Johnson away when he grabbed her arm, causing the July 7 fall. Victim: Cody Johnson's body was found at the bottom of a cliff in the Glacier National Park . She also alleged that an FBI agent improperly interviewed her and made her uncomfortable by touching her knee. Graham, 22, and Johnson, 25, had been married for eight days when they argued over her doubts about the marriage, prosecutors said. Graham has pleaded not guilty, and said she was only attempting to remove Johnson's arm - not push him off the cliff. She repeated the claim on the stand on Friday that she was acting instinctively. She added that she felt uncomfortable in a July 16 interview with FBI Agent Stacey Smiedala, during which she dropped her previous claims that Johnson had driven off with friends. Graham's attorney Michael Donahoe alleged in court filings that Agent Smiedala interrogated his client alone and unrecorded for nearly one and a half hours so that he could 'shape' her statement to get Graham to admit she acted not instinctively, but in the 'heat of passion', required to file manslaughter charges. U.S. prosecutors say 22-year-old Jordan Graham was unhappy in her new marriage and deliberately shoved her husband of eight days off a rock ledge during an argument while hiking a steep trail on July 7 . During that time, Agent Smiedala allegedly made her uncomfortable by sitting very close and touching her knee for extended periods of time, Graham testified. A shorter statement of Graham's version of events was then recorded and the agent 'told me that I was in the clear, that I wouldn't be seeing him again, and that I was free to go', she said.Her recorded statements were later distorted in the criminal complaint, Mr Donahoe alleged. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus said in court filings that Graham participated voluntarily, and that FBI agents conducted the interview and filed the complaint properly.","Jordan Graham allegedly spoke of killing her mother, Lindel Rutledge and stepfather just weeks before she allegedly pushed her husband off a cliff in July .

A former New Orleans police officer whose 2010 manslaughter conviction was touted as a milestone in the city's healing after Hurricane Katrina was acquitted Wednesday by a different jury of charges he fatally shot a man without justification during the storm's chaotic aftermath. David Warren spent more than three years behind bars after he was charged in the September 2005 death of 31-year-old Henry Glover, whose body was burned in a car by a different officer after a good Samaritan drove the dying man to a makeshift police compound. Leaving the courthouse a free man, Warren, 50, was reunited with his wife and five children after jurors acquitted him of a civil rights violation and a firearm charge. David Warren embraces his wife, Kathy, on Wednesday after a federal jury found him not guilty on manslaughter charges in the shooting death of Henry Glover . Warren told reporters that he 'took the action that I had to take' when he shot Glover once with a rifle from a second-story balcony at a strip mall he was guarding. 'We have spent years talking about something that lasted seconds,' he said. Warren's trembling relatives wept and embraced each other after the verdict, which jurors delivered less than two hours after they informed a judge they were struggling to reach a unanimous decision. 'Oh my gosh, I can't even get it in my head,' his wife, Kathy Warren, told a supporter. David Warren, right, has been acquitted of fatally shooting Henry .

Her husband had been in custody since June 2010, when he surrendered to authorities following his indictment. On the other side of the courtroom, Glover's sister, Patrice, slumped over and wailed so loudly that U.S. District Judge Lance Africk paused as he spoke to jurors. After a man carried Patrice Glover out of the room, several jurors wiped away tears as they filed out. Friends and relatives tried to console Patrice Glover as she sat in a chair in the lobby of the courthouse. 'He was a good child,' she said of her brother. 'That was my baby.' U.S. Attorney Kenneth Allen Polite Jr. said in a statement that prosecutors were disappointed by the verdict but thanked jurors for their 'attentive service.' His predecessor, Jim Letten, said after the 2010 verdict that it marked a 'critical phase in the recovery and healing of this city, of the people of this region.' David Warren's four daughters and other family members exit federal court in New Orleans on Wednesday after celebrating his release after three years in jail . Africk . had sentenced Warren to nearly 26 years in prison after the jury in his . first trial convicted him and two other former officers of charges . stemming from Glover's death. But an appeals court overturned Warren's convictions and ordered a new trial last year. A . three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit ruled that Warren should have . been tried separately from four other former officers charged in an . alleged cover-up of Glover's death. The . panel agreed with Warren's lawyers that the 'spillover effect' of . evidence about the cover-up, including testimony about the burning of . Glover's body and photos of his charred remains, denied him a fair . trial. A different officer, Gregory McRae, was convicted in 2010 of burning Glover's body. The 5th Circuit upheld McRae's convictions. Glover was shot at the Oakwood Shopping Center in Gretna, La., which burn't to the ground days after Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans . The . jury for Warren's retrial was barred from hearing any testimony about . what happened to Glover in the aftermath of the shooting. On Monday, . Warren testified that he feared for his life when he shot Glover because . he thought he saw a gun in his hand as he and another man ran toward . the building he was guarding. Prosecutors, however, said Glover wasn't . armed and didn't pose a threat. Defense attorney Richard Simmons said the case was always about 'a policeman's worst nightmare, that split-second decision.' 'The . benefit of the doubt has to go to the officer,' Simmons said, adding . that 'there's no winners or losers, there's just survivors.' Warren . and another officer, Linda Howard, were guarding a police substation at . the strip mall on the morning of Sept. 2, 2005, when Glover and another . man pulled up in a truck. Edna Glover, mother of the victim, clutches a picture of her son as she walks outside the federal court surrounded by her family after the original verdict in 2010 . Warren said he screamed, 'Police, get back!' twice after Glover and his friend, Bernard Calloway, exited the truck . and started to run toward a gate that would have given them access to . the building he was guarding. Calloway, however, testified that . Glover was standing next to the truck and lighting a cigarette when . Warren shot him. Howard testified Glover and Calloway were running in . different directions when Warren opened fire. Jurors also heard . testimony from a former officer, Alec Brown, who said Warren told him . shortly after the shooting that he believed looters were 'animals' who . deserved to be shot. Warren denied saying that. Earlier on the same . morning as Glover's shooting, Warren had fired what he called a warning . shot at a man who had been riding a bike near the mall. Warren said he . knew officers aren't allowed to fire warning shots, but was worried the . man intended to do 'something stupid' because he had circled the mall . several times. Guilty: Lt. Travis McCabe, left, was convicted of falsifying a report while Gregory McRae, right, was convicted in 2010 of burning Glover's body . Warren was one of 20 officers charged in a series of . federal investigations of alleged police misconduct in New Orleans. His . December 2010 conviction was touted as a major milestone in the Justice . Department's ambitious efforts to clean up the city's troubled police . department. The same jury that convicted Warren and McRae also . convicted a third former officer, Travis McCabe, of writing a false . report on the shooting. Africk later ordered a new trial for McCabe . based on new evidence that surfaced after the trial: a different copy of . the report that McCabe is accused of doctoring.

Shocking assault: Phoebe Connolly, a youth worker, was biking in the Columbia Heights area of the city this month when she encountered a group of teenagers, one of whom punched her in the face . Connolly said the kid yelled 'whoop pow!' - the sound comic book characters make when they punch each other - when he hit her. ‘The whole group of kids laughed,’ Connolly told CNN on Tuesday night. She was not seriously injured in the attack, but says people should think critically about how such attacks can be stopped. ‘[Teenagers] just don't always think about the ramifications of their actions, how they can hurt people, how they can cause problems for the rest of their lives’, said Connolly, who works on youth programs. She said it was due to the popularity of so-called ‘knockout’ videos. Severe ramifications: Connolly was not seriously injured when she was punched, but says people should think critically about how such attacks can be stopped . ‘Instead of constantly replaying them on media, or on YouTube, or whatever it is, you know I really feel like that's just creating more of a culture of fear and polarization - instead of actually spending time thinking about why it is that people are choosing to do this and how can it be stopped and prevented,’ she told CNN. Another woman was attacked in the same area one day earlier. She, too, sustained minor injuries and was not knocked out, according to Washington police. A police spokeswoman said authorities are investigating the two attacks as simple assaults. Similar incidents have been reported in New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Missouri. Investigation: Police commissioner Ray Kelly says the New York Police Department is investigating the recent attacks to see if there is a trend or not . A 78-year-old women was sucker-punched in New York City on November 9, while pushing her great-granddaughter’s stroller on Avenue L and East Fifth Street. She did not know the man nor had any previous contact or connection. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said they are working to determine whether she is a ‘knockout’ victim. This week an elderly . Russian woman was reportedly punched on the back of the head by a young thug . as part of the vicious Knockout Game craze. The . random attack happened on November 25 when the 72-year-old woman was walking . to the Jewish community center in Canarsie, Brooklyn, at around noon. Her . attacker - a male in late teens/early 20s - didn't say anything or try . to rob her. The latest possible example of a 'Knockout Game' attack happened on Monday when an unnamed 72-year-old woman was hit while walking to a Jewish community center in Brooklyn (Photo of separate incident) In another incident, photography intern Israel Blizovsky, . 19, from Israel, said he was punched in the face by a group of teenagers . in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last week. ‘They just kept walking. They were all laughing,’ he told the New York Post through a Hebrew translator. On Friday NYPD arrested a man on charges of assault as a hate . crime after a 24-year-old Orthodox Jewish man was punched in the face in another so-called ‘Knockout Game’ assault. Amrit .

Crime figures are routinely massaged by police desperate to show that they are making the streets safer, it was claimed yesterday. Serious offences including rape, child sex abuse, robberies and burglary are disappearing in a ‘puff of smoke’, MPs were told. Police are accused of downgrading crimes to less serious offences and even erasing them altogether by labelling them as accidents or errors. Crime figures are routinely massaged by police desperate to show that they are making the streets safer, it was claimed (file picture) One police analyst claimed that hundreds of burglaries ‘disappeared’ in a matter of weeks at the Met after managers intervened. The claims were made at a hearing of Parliament’s Public Administration Committee. Chairman Bernard Jenkin said he was ‘shocked’ by the evidence. ‘What we have heard is how there is a system of incentives in the police that has become inherently corrupting,’ he said. Officers claim they are under pressure to record crimes as less controversial offences or even no crime at all. Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons committee, said he was shocked by the evidence . Pc James Patrick, who analyses crime figures for the Met, said he found robberies being logged as ‘theft snatch’ in order to get them ‘off the books’. The officer, who faces disciplinary proceedings for gross misconduct after writing a blog about the impact of police reform, said burglary figures were also changed. ‘Burglary is an area where crimes are downgraded or moved into other brackets, such as criminal damage for attempted burglaries,’ he said. Pc Patrick said an internal audit found that ‘as many as 300 burglaries’ vanished from official figures in just a few weeks. ‘Things were being reported as burglaries and you would then re-run the same report after there had been a human intervention, a management intervention, and these burglaries effectively disappeared in a puff of smoke,’ he said. He claimed that in 80 per cent  of cases where an allegation of a serious sexual offence had been recorded as ‘no crime’, the label was incorrect. Pc Patrick also said numerous other cases were incorrectly recorded as ‘crime-related incidents’, a category covering allegations made by third parties but not directly confirmed by the supposed victims. He said pressure was put on victims to drop crimes by ‘attacking the allegation’ instead of investigating the crime. He was supported by Peter Barron, a former Detective Chief Superintendent at the Met, who said victims are ‘harassed’ into scaling down the seriousness of incidents. Around 300 burglaries disappeared from Met Police records in a few weeks, the Commons Public Administration Committee heard . They would be telephoned and repeatedly questioned on the circumstances of the crime. ‘Victims were putting the phone down in disgust, harassed by another call from someone trying to persuade them that they were mistaken about the level of force used,’ he added. Mr Barron said the Met had been set a target of reducing crimes in several priority areas by 20 per cent. ‘That translates into “record 20 per cent fewer crimes” as far as senior officers are concerned,’ he said. The Met said it has appointed a ‘force crime registrar’ to rule on disputed crimes and to ensure the correct policies are followed.","Officers tell Commons committee about how figures are manipulated .

A newly discovered dinosaur that lived 100 million years ago has been unearthed by palaeontologists. Experts believe it is one of the largest species of meat-eating dinosaur that ever lived in North America and was the top predator before the Tyrannosaurus rex. The dinosaur, Siats meekerorum, has been named after a cannibalistic monster of Red Indian legend, called Siats, which closely resembled a T-Rex. Siats meekerorum, has been named after a cannibalistic monster of Red Indian legend, called Siats, which was based on a T-Rex . The ‘man eating monster,’ which is described in the latest issue of Nature Communications, is thought to have measured up to 40 feet long and weighed around seven tonnes. Palaeontologists think that it was only when Siats meekerorum became extinct that T-Rex was able to become the apex predator. The fossilised remains of the newly discovered species were found near Green River in the Badlands of Utah. The dinosaur discovered was a juvenile when it died, but is thought to have measured 30 feet long and weighed 9,000 pounds. Palaeontologist Dr Lindsay Zanno, of North Carolina State University, said: ‘This dinosaur was a colossal predator second only to the great T-Rex and perhaps Acrocanthosarus in the North American fossil record. ‘It has been 63 years since a predator of this size has been named from North America. You cannot imagine how thrilled we were to see the bones of this behemoth poking out of the hillside.’ An illustration of a Siats meekerorum within its ecosystem, eating an Eolambia and intimidating small-bodied tyrannosauroids. A new species of carnivorous dinosaur, which is one of the three largest ever discovered in North America,  lived alongside and competed with small-bodied tyrannosaurs 98 million years ago . Siats meekerorum is one of the three . largest dinosaurs ever discovered in the U.S. and a species of massive . meat eaters called carcharodontosaurs which include the Argentinian . Giganotosaurus. The only other giant from North America . is Acrocanthosaurus, which stalked the eastern side of the country more . than 10 million years earlier. Dr Zanno discovered part of the . skeleton of the new species with Dr Peter Makovicky of Chicago's Field . Museum of Natural History during a 2008 expedition to an area known as . Cedar Mountain Formation - a famous dinosaur graveyard. It . is now clear Siats' large size would have prevented smaller . tyrannosaurs from taking their place at the top of the food chain. Dr . Makovicky said: ‘The huge size difference certainly suggests . tyrannosaurs were held in check by carcharodontosaurs and only evolved . into enormous apex predators after the carcharodontosaurs. disappeared.' Dr Zanno said: ‘Contemporary tyrannosaurs would have been no more than a nuisance to Siats, like jackals at a lion kill. It was not until carcharodontosaurs bowed out the stage could be set for the evolution of T Rex.’ T-Rex evolved 30 million years later and weighed around twice as much as Siats meekerorum . The newly discovered species would have terrorised what is now Utah during the period known geologically as the Late Cretaceous between 100 million years and 66 million years ago and was previously unknown who the top meat eater was in North America at the time. Dr Zanno said: ‘Carcharodontosaurs reigned for much longer in North America than we expected.’ The newly discovered species fills a gap of more than 30 million years in the fossil record when the top predator role changed hands from carcharodontosaurs in the Early Cretaceous to tyrannosaurs in the Late. The lack of fossils left palaeontologists unsure about when this change happened and if tyrannosaurs outcompeted carcharodontosaurs, or were simply able to assume apex predator roles following carcharodontosaur extinction. At the time, Siats dominated the landscape, which would have been populated by plant eating dinosaurs, turtles, crocodiles and giant lungfish and other predators such as early tyrannosaurs and several species of feathered dinosaurs that have yet to be described by the team. Dr Makovicky said: ‘We have made more exciting discoveries including two new species of dinosaur. Stay tuned. There are a lot more cool critters where Siats came from.’","Palaeontologists discovered the fossils near Green River in Utah .

The father of a girl found dead after being bullied over her red hair has called for ginger jokes to be made a hate crime. Enda Farrell, 56, said he believed his daughter Helena, 15, might still be alive had she not been picked on because of her hair colour. The teenager was found dead in woodland half a mile away from her home in Kendal, Cumbria, in January. Scroll down for video . Teenager Helena Farrell allegedly suffered lifelong bullying over the colour of her hair - which her father claims contributed to her death . The 15-year-old's body was found in dense woodland half a mile from her home in Kendal, Cumbria . The cause of her death has not yet been officially established, but yesterday her father said he believes Helena killed herself. Mr Farrell, a former town councillor, said she had been tormented all her life by bullies’ taunts about her ginger hair. He called for a change in the law to make it illegal to discriminate against people because of their hair colour. ‘People need to realise that when they say the things they do, it can have deeply traumatising effects and can lead to self-harm and suicide,’ he said. ‘Helena’s death was not just because of it but the bullying she faced all her life certainly contributed.’ The teenager, who was a gifted cellist and singer, had been out with friends just hours before she died and was said to be ‘very happy’ when she said goodbye to them. But at about 10pm her body was found in dense woodland close to the grounds of the town’s Castle Green Hotel. Cumbria Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious. At the time, Mr Farrell said his family had tried desperately to help Helena ‘overcome her dark thoughts that began to cloud over her shining personality’. Mr Farrell, his wife Maria and their 15-year-old son Declan said their lives had been ‘ripped apart’ by her death. She went to the comprehensive Kirkbie Kendal School as well as  studying at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and dreamed of becoming a professional musician. Mr Farrell believes police forces should also recognise victimisation based on hair colour . Helena, who was a gifted musician, was bullied about her hair colour from a young age . Helena had already achieved a distinction in a grade seven cello exam and a merit in a grade six singing exam. She also played the lead role of Scaramouche in her school’s musical We Will Rock You. Her father spoke out after last week’s unofficial ‘Kick a Ginger Day’ – thought to have stemmed from American cartoon South Park – which reportedly led to attacks on redheads across the country. Mr Farrell said he had heard this caused one local boy to skip school and to leave early the next day. In April, Greater Manchester Police recognised ‘alternative sub-cultures’ as a motivation for hate crime. It followed the death of Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was attacked for being a ‘goth’. Mr Farrell said he believes police forces should also recognise victimisation based on hair colour. He is supported by local MP Tim Farron, who this week tabled a written question to Home Secretary Theresa May on the subject. He demanded to know what plans she had to ensure action was taken against those who persecute others on the basis of hair colour. Condemnation of such bullying follows the death of Simon Walters, 14, from Wolverhampton, who reportedly took his life after being bullied about his ginger hair. Mr Farron added: ‘Kids can be really quite cruel but it shouldn’t be tolerated. Bullying is described by the UK government as behaviour that is 'intended to hurt someone either physically or emotionally'. It . can include physical assaults, teasing, making threats, name-calling or . cyberbullying, which is bullying via mobile phone or online. Anybody suffering at the hands or a bully, or bullies, should immediately tell a parent, teacher or someone they trust. The police can also be contacted on non-emergency number 101, or 999 in an emergency, if the bullying involves a crime. There . are also several anti-bullying charities that can help, including the . Anti-Bullying Alliance, BeatBullying, Bullying UK, ChildLine, Kidscape . and the NSPCC. ‘It’s a serious matter and I cannot see how being ginger is any less qualifying for the additional category of hate crime that being a  goth is.’ Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator for the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said attacks on ginger people should be dealt with in the same way as any other prejudice. He added: ‘For people with ginger hair bullying seems to be acceptable – the norm. That’s what makes it totally inappropriate.’ Windermere councillor Ben Berry, who also has red hair, said: ‘People laugh at me when I say it’s almost as if ginger-haired people are our own race. ‘But it’s like that – we’re beaten and made fun of just the same as someone is by a racist because they’re black. ‘I went to a football match and the doorman said, “Sorry, we don’t let ginger people in” – this was a  full grown man making fun of another adult.’ For confidential support on suicide matters call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch or click here.","Helena Farrell 'bullied all of her life over the colour of her ginger hair'

It might not fit inside the crusher – but this new kind of garlic can be chopped or grated without the need for extensive peeling. The same size as a traditional garlic bulb, it is not separated into smaller cloves. This means the desired amount can simply be sliced off, avoiding the usual fiddle of peeling – and the rest stored for future use. The product - dubbed 'lazy garlic' - has recently gone on sale at Lidl stores after the discount supermarket became the UK's only single clove garlic supplier. A 250g basket containing around eight single cloves costs £1.49. Single clove garlic was discovered being grown by organic farmers in the south of China in the misty foothills of the Himalayas. Normal garlic is planted as a single seed clove which is then triggered into developing multiple cloves by cold weather. But in the temperate climes of the Yunnan province the garlic seeds stay as a single clove, growing to around two inches in diameter. The white and purple crop is harvested in February and March, and is said to have a milder, more fragrant taste than regular garlic. A spokesman for Lidl said: 'The single . clove garlic originates from the mountainous area of the Yunnan province . in the far south west of China.' The unique vegetable looks like a normal . head of garlic but rather than being made up of many small segments it . comprises just one .

He continued: 'The seeds are planted approximately 2,000 metres above sea level in warm temperatures and with a large amount of sunlight. 'Only 50 per cent of the garlic seeds that are planted in these specific conditions will develop into a single clove garlic. 'This isn't a species - rather it is the conditions under which the seeds are cultivated that result in a single clove garlic. 'A single clove garlic has a high nutrition content, but it is also popular in cooking due to its slightly milder flavour compared with multi-clove garlic. 'It has a uniquely fragrant taste. 'Single clove garlic is also very easy to peel and can therefore be prepared much more quickly than multi-clove garlic. 'The feedback from our customers has been very encouraging although we have had to advise some of them about what to do with it.'

The British father who has admitted to cutting the throats of his two young children was seen buying sweets, bread and drinks in a bakery with his son and daughter just hours before the double killing. Julian Stevenson, 48, was arrested on . Saturday after the bodies of son Mathew, 10, and daughter Carla, five, . were found in his apartment in a suburb of Lyon, eastern France. The shop owner, who asked not to be named, said: 'Mr Stevenson came into the shop on Saturday lunchtime with his two children. 'They seemed happy and he bought them sweets. There didn't appear to be anything wrong. He also bought a baguette. An unmarked police car containing Julian Stevenson arrives at court this afternoon . The balcony of the apartment where the bodies of Julian Stevenson's children Carla, five, and Mathew, 10, were discovered with their throats cut . Stevenson, who is involved in a bitter child custody battle, is due in court in Lyon today . The second-flat apartment in the Lyon suburb of Saint-Priest where the children were found . The flat is believed to have been where the family of four lived before the divorce . 'We see a lot of him here. He is friendly with my staff and always talks to the servers. 'I know hundreds of people, everybody comes here to buy their bread, but I remember Mr Stevenson because of his accent. 'This tragic incident has shocked everybody. He always appeared to be a good dad and a caring father.' Earlier on Saturday, Stevenson took . his family to a McDonald's restaurant close to his home, and the . children were seen in the play area. A manager at the fast food restaurant . said: 'The family were here on Saturday. The father came here with his . two children at about 11am. They stayed for about an hour.' The manager said detectives have . since visited the restaurant to question staff. 'The police were here . for three hours interviewing everyone,' she said. 'They took away CCTV footage as part of their investigation.' The 48-year-old is said to have carried out the double-murder in a fit of rage before fleeing on a pair of roller-skates. Yesterday . Stevenson had his head covered by a blue blanket as he was driven into . an underground car park beneath Lyon's main criminal court complex in an . unmarked police Renault Laguna. The hand-cuffed defendant sat next to a . plain-clothed detective in the back seat of the car, as armed officers . also sat in front. An accompanying patrol car had its blue lights . flashing. Stevenson was then led into a closed . hearing at the Tribunal de Grande Instance where the allegations against . him were formally read out. Police sealed the apartment after finding the bodies inside . 'Homicides' translates to 'murder scene' on the note attached to the apartment door . Prosecutors say they were 'not . currently' charging Mr Stevenson with premeditated murder, suggesting . that he may plead diminished responsibility. A judicial source said: 'We are presently holding back from the charge of premeditated murder but this could always change.' The source said all the circumstances surrounding the horrific crime would be investigated over many months. Neighbours of Stevenson said he . had appeared 'calm and relaxed' as he wandered around the St Priest . suburb of Lyon with the two children on Saturday morning. 'It was a warm day and he was in . T-shirt and long shorts,' said one. 'The children were smiling happily, . and appeared to be enjoying a day out with their dad. 'He was buying them little presents, including sweets, and did not appear in the least bit flustered.' Stephanies, Stevenson's French . ex-wife, had handed over the children on Friday evening, and they spent a . night in the old family home in Saint-Priest, around three miles from . the city centre. This was despite Stevenson being a . heavy drinker, and having been violent towards his wife before their . divorce up to three years ago. When Mrs Stevenson, an accountant's . assistant also in her 40s, returned to pick up the children from the . second floor apartment at around 5pm on Saturday she saw Stevenson . looking 'panicked and angry', according to a neighbour. French suburb: The children's bodies were found in a flat in Saint Priest, to the south east of Lyon . 'He was in the stairwell of the block, . and his clothes were covered in blood,' said the neighbour. 'He made . off on a pair of roller-skates, leaving his car in the apartment block's . garage.' Following a short manhunt, Stevenson was found in Lyon's 8th arrondissement at around 8pm on the same evening. A judicial source said that a knife which was thought to be the murder weapon had been found in the flat. The source said the double murder was . 'clearly linked to a painful separation' and 'legal procedures . concerning the right to access to the children which the father deemed . insufficient.' In 2010, Stevenson had attacked his then wife, leading to these rights of access being withdrawn. This was the first weekend since then . that Stevenson had been allowed to have the boy and girl with him . without an adult third party. The Lyon prosecuting source said Stevenson 'admitted being the murderer' but 'did not give many more details.' Stevenson has been living in France . for 10 years and married in 2005. His wife was finally heard by . prosecutors on Sunday, providing them with their details of her troubled . relationship with her ex-husband. Investigators were particularly keen to know who gave the father legal authority to look after the children. Ahmed Benguedda, a former neighbour of the couple said the couple had divorced 'two or three years ago.' Stevenson, who is unemployed, had . drinking problems and was violent towards his wife, Mr Benguedda, who . still lives locally, confirmed. She won custody of the children . following the divorce and went to live in the Isere region of France, . which is just to the south east of Lyon and an easy drive or train . journey away. Mr Benguedda said the children were . 'well-balanced' and often played with his seven-year-old daughter. 'The . people who live here are all in a state of shock,' he added. A Foreign Office spokesman said the . matter was being investigated. 'We are aware of the reports and we are . urgently looking into them,' said a spokesman.

Breastfeeding her baby can reduce a mother’s risk of ovarian cancer by nearly two-thirds, according to scientists. And the longer she continues to do it, the greater the protection against the illness. The research adds to evidence of the benefits of natural feeding as numerous studies  have already shown it cuts the chance of  breast cancer. 'Breast is best': Breastfeeding her baby can reduce a mother's risk of ovarian cancer by two-thirds . More than 6,000 patients a year in the UK are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the illness accounts for about 5 per cent of cancer deaths in women. It is known as the ‘silent killer’ because symptoms for many sufferers, such as feeling bloated, are non-specific and the illness may not be diagnosed until it is fairly advanced. For the latest study, Australian scientists studied 493 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and compared them with 472 healthy volunteers of similar age. Each was asked how many children they had and for how long they breastfed each one. The results showed those who breastfed a child for at least 13 months were 63 per cent less likely to develop a tumour than those who did so for less than seven months. The more children they had, the greater the effect, said the findings, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Mothers who had three children and breastfed for a total of 31 months or more were found to cut their chances of ovarian tumours by 91 per cent. This was compared to those feeding naturally for a total of under ten months. The UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe. Nearly eight in ten mothers start when their baby is born but after six weeks, this is down to half . Breastfeeding is thought to help as it delays ovulation, when eggs are released and the ovaries are exposed to high levels of oestrogen-rich fluid. Some researchers believe a higher number of ovulations raises the risk of mutant cells forming, which can trigger the disease. But surveys have shown the UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe. Nearly eight in ten mothers start when their baby is born but after six weeks, this is down to half. After six months – the recommended time for exclusive breastfeeding – it is only 26 per cent. The main risk factors for ovarian cancer include a family history of the disease, having already had breast cancer, starting periods at a young age and being overweight. Dr Helga Groll, of Cancer Research UK, said the findings backed up earlier evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding. But she warned that some mothers may not accurately remember for how long they had breastfed. Gilda Witte, chief executive of Ovarian Cancer Action, added: ‘It is proven that breastfeeding can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. ‘It does this because it reduces ovulation for the nursing mother. ‘The risk is further reduced by each child that a woman bears.’","More than 6,000 patients a year in the UK are diagnosed with ovarian cancer .

It was exactly one year ago today that Darwin the Japanese macaque was found wandering a Toronto Ikea parking lot dressed in a fashionable shearling coat and a diaper. The Internet almost collapsed under the weight of the numerous meme's created in honor of him as he became universally known as the IKEA Monkey. Now 19 months-old and living at the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario, this is the first time that Darwin has been seen since last year - as he passes his time alone playing with his Curious George stuffed toy as he 'learns to be a monkey again.' Twelve months on: Darwin the Japanese macaque is making progress at the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario since he was catapulted to global fame as the Ikea Monkey . Up until the day that he escaped his human mom, Yasmin Kakhuda, Darwin had spent most days dressed in snazzy clothes and a diaper, traveling everywhere with her. Taken into the custody of the sanctuary the day he was found inside the IKEA store, Darwin's rehabilitation has been tough. 'When he came to us, he was lacking in confidence and unsure how to act around other monkeys,' said Izzy Hirji, chair of the sanctuary’s board of directors in an interview with the Toronto Star. 'Through being able to see and interact with the other guys, he’s growing into a healthy, confident adolescent.' Legendary: 'Darwin', wearing a winter coat and a diaper, wanders around at an IKEA in Toronto after letting himself out of his crate in a parked car in the store's lot . A star is born: Darwin wanders around an IKEA parking lot in Toronto, as customers take pictures . Upon losing her beloved monkey, Nakhuda launched a lawsuit the very week he was taken, alleging the sanctuary was 'illegally detaining' Darwin. However, a judge ruled in September that Darwin should remain at the sanctuary and not with the real estate lawyer who called the Japanese macaque her 'son'. 'I love him and I want him back. This is injustice,' she told the Star last Wednesday. 'If I really felt in my heart that justice was served, then I would let it go. 'I’m not doing this to get my picture in the paper, she said. 'I just need to win him back. I just need him to be back home.' Sadly since his re-housing, Darwin has not be introduced to other primates at the sanctuary because they didn't want to run the risk of being liable to Kakhuda if he was attacked. However, that decision may cost Darwin the opportunity to ever safely interact with members of his own species. 'Currently, we’re not sure about that,' said Hirji. 'Of course, we would love to have a partner for him to interact with.' Motherly? Toronto animal control officials originally claimed Nakhuda abused Darwin, even threatened to remove his teeth, but have since dropped those charges . Monkey business: The real estate lawyer took . Darwin with her to the office, left, and dressed him up in a devil . costume for Halloween, right, . Deadly: Experts say it is not only illegal to have a monkey for a pet, but also could be dangerous because rhesus macaques like Darwin can carry the herpes B virus . However, in one sign of progress, Darwin is able to see other macaques and has been mimicing their noises. 'The first time we heard him make a distinct macaque vocalization, it was a joyous moment for us,' he said. Darwin bathes and plays with his Curious George toy, even taking him for a bath and shows him where to drink and grooms it. Having grown one-and-a-half times his size from year ago, Darwin loves playing with his handlers - on his fire pole, slide and pool. However, the cheeky monkey is still learning to behave. 'He’ll throw temper tantrums when somebody turns their back on him, because he’s used to being the centre of attention,' said Hirji. In December last year, Darwin captured worldwide attention after he somehow let himself out of a parked car and ambled around the Ikea parking lot dressed in a stylish shearling coat and diaper. In September, Ontario Superior Court Judge Mary Vallee ruled that while the monkey may have worn clothing and slept in his former owner's bed, he is still a wild animal and therefore should not be returned to her. Close ties: The mother of two said her . relationship with Darwin started out as a baby-sitting gig but turned . into 'fatal attraction' after she was unable to return him to the . breeder because he was crying for her . Heavy burden: Nakhuda explained that caring for a monkey is very demanding because he needs to be bottle fed and that Darwin has 'anxiety disorders' Animal kingdom: Besides Darwin, Nakhuda also has a pet macaw, which unlike the primate, is legal to own in Ontario . Nakhuda's lawyer's office said she would not be commenting on the decision that left her distraught. Allegations she physically abused the monkey were dropped earlier in the year. Nakhuda, a mother of two, has been trying to get back her pet ever since he was taken from her in December after escaping his cage and wandering round Ikea's parking lot. Darwin was taken to Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary where he has been living ever since was picked up at the Ikea in Toronto. The sanctuary alleged that Nakhuda, a real estate lawyer, was an unfit mother who would beat the monkey with a spoon and even threatened to have its teeth removed. She denied these allegations and the animal sanctuary has since dropped them, reportedly in an effort to avoid a lengthy trial. Nakhuda said the Japanese macaque was illegally taken from her after the Ikea incident. She claimed she misunderstood the forms she said that relinquished her ownership of Darwin as part of an emotional testimony in a Canada court in June. Political adviser: On this occasion the famous macaque helps out Toronto's mayor Rob Ford . ‘I think when I had my two children I didn't have time to mother them. I was more focused on building my practice,’ Nakhuda said on the stand, according to CTV. ‘Having Darwin ... was like the chance to experience motherhood again.’ At this trial Nakhuda reportedly broke down repeatedly and told the court Darwin has ‘anxiety disorders’ and that she took him everywhere she went. ‘I treated him like a son. It sounds bizarre to some people, but that’s how we treated him,’ Nakhuda said. On the other side of the debate were Toronto Animal Supervisors who contended that Darwin could be a threat to public safety. Toronto Animal Services supervisor Carl Bandow also testified to the fact that it is illegal to keep a monkey within the city of Toronto, but that Darwin’s case has prompted the city to consider changing the law. Internet star: Darwin is superimposed as a Biblical figure in touch with God . Nakhuda said the monkey was near her at all times, including while she slept and showered. ‘At the beginning, I was told that was the best for him because generally, monkeys live off the back of the mom,’ she said. ‘He always had to be within my view,’ she continued, adding that he would ‘get into a panic attack’ the moment she was out of sight. In multiple YouTube videos, Nakhuda posted her daily interactions with Darwin, who could be seen playing at the office, dressed up as a devil with horns for Halloween and brushing his teeth along with his owner. Ikea King: Darwin becomes part of an internet meme based on the Lion King film . ‘He is more than a handful: needs to be baby bottle fed night time and needs at least 3 diaper change a day,’ Nakhuda wrote in the comments. ‘He has to be with me all the time which means he goes with me to the office, sleeps with me, eats with me, showers with me, goes shopping with me . . . it is more than a human baby so yes, not everyone can handle a baby monkey. He is now 6 months old only and is expected to be around 4 feet tall.’","Darwin launched to global fame exactly one year ago today when he was found wandering around a Toronto IKEA .

The biggest payday loan firms have been threatened with closure over the misery and hardship caused by irresponsible or illegal lending. They include market leader Wonga, which has links to David Cameron’s office and the Tories. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) yesterday gave the 50 firms a deadline of just 12 weeks to clean up their act or lose their credit licences. The firms, which have been dubbed ‘legal loan sharks’, lend more than £2billion a year and target the vulnerable with interest rates of more than 4,000 per cent. Many who initially borrow small sums are encouraged to roll these over several times and end up owing more than they can afford. The watchdog’s chief executive, Clive Maxwell, said: ‘We have found fundamental problems with the way the payday market works and widespread breaches of the law and regulations, causing misery and hardship for many borrowers. ‘Irresponsible lending is not confined to a few rogue payday lenders – it is a problem across the sector. ‘If we do not see rapid, significant improvements by the 50 lenders we inspected they risk their licences being removed.’ The firms under investigation are responsible for 90 per cent of loans. The OFT is also referring the industry to the Competition Commission, which has powers to recommend new laws and regulation. Deadline: The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) yesterday gave 50 firms, including market leader Wonga, the tight deadline of 12 weeks to clean up their act or risk losing their licences . The Treasury and Department for Business tried to pre-empt the damning OFT report by announcing a range of measures it said would ensure a fair deal for consumers. These include large fines for those that mislead or mistreat customers, but there was no pledge to cap punishing interest rates. Regulation is being moved from the OFT, which is being scrapped, to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). But Sylvia Waycot, editor of Moneyfacts.co.uk, warned it will take at least a year before the FCA takes over this job. ‘Until then, those in financial difficulty will be dealing with what is largely a self-regulating industry,’ she said. Lenders: The firms, which have been dubbed 'legal loan sharks', lend more than £2billion a year . Consumer minister Jo Swinson said the OFT’s measures combined with the Government’s proposals would protect the public. ‘The evidence of the scale of unscrupulous behaviour by payday lenders and the impact on consumers is deeply concerning,’ she said. ‘The Government is committed to tough action to tackle these problems.’ The Consumer Finance Association, which speaks for loan  firms, said members are improving how they operate, and offered to ‘consider’ the Government’s proposals. Chief executive Russell Hamblin-Boone said: ‘From credit-checking all new applications, to limiting loan rollovers and providing help for those who get into financial difficulty, we have raised standards all the way through the loan process.’ The fact that Wonga is among the loan firms savaged by the OFT could embarrass David Cameron and the Conservative Party. The firm paid thousands of pounds for the right to have face-to-face lobbying time with senior Conservative politicians at the party’s annual conference in Birmingham last year. Later a member of the Prime Minister’s inner circle, his digital adviser Jonathan Luff, joined Wonga, which has been lobbying against calls from some consumer groups for a cap on the industry’s sky-high interest rates. Yesterday’s announcement that there would be no such cap was ‘broadly welcomed’ by Wonga. Wonga is keen to present itself as the acceptable face of payday lenders through its sponsorship of TV shows such as ITV’s Red or Black, which is fronted by Ant and Dec, and Newcastle United football club. The business was founded in 2007 by two South Africans, Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz, both 43, and has thrived during the recession. It sold a record 2.5million loans – more than 6,000 a day – in 2011 and tripled its net income to £45.8million. Mr Damelin is now said to be worth £34million, while Mr Hurwitz’s fortune is put at £25million. Wonga refuses to give Mr Luff’s job title but he has been variously identified as head of public affairs and head of government affairs.","50 firms risk losing licences as Office of Fair Trading gives tight deadline .

A giant Louis Vuitton suitcase which erected in the middle of Red Square has sparked outrage among Russians who see the publicity stunt as an insult to the country's communist past . President Vladimir Putin's government has strugged to contain an uproar over the nine-metre high case, which is actually a pavilion set up to house an exhibition on possessions of the rich and famous. Critics slammed the judgement of officials who sanctioned the event, which is being held just feet away from the Kremlin and the mausoleum of Bolshevik revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin. Ill-fitting: The patterned suitcase, the likes of which are often seen as a symbol of excess and wealth, was branded an eyesore by critics . Valery Rashkin, a Communist member of the State Duma, said he was 'ashamed' of his country for allowing the pavilion to be built in such a politically significant location . Valery Rashkin, a Communist member of the State Duma, the lower parliament house called it an 'eyesore', saying 'I am ashamed of our country for putting a suitcase on its main square, this sacred area that should be protected by the state'. After growing disquiet, a sign was placed on the pavilion on Wednesday evening announcing it was being dismantled, though the structure remained intact. Despite straps on the structure in the colours of the Russian flag, the image of a Western luxury good only the richest can afford has jarred with patriotic citizens. Climbdown: A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the suitcase would be dismantled after acknowledging a problem with its size . Putin loyalists in his United Russia party also railed against the case, with many claiming it should be moved to a more remote pare of Moscow. Citing an unnamed Kremlin source, Russian news agencies said that Putin's administration had eventually ordered it to be removed. 'There's nothing terrible about the trunk itself and the good intentions - on the contrary' Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'But it is obvious that there's a problem with the sense of scale.' Communist supporters still visit Red Square to see the mausoleum of the Bolshevik revolutionary Lenin . While a skating rink has been set up on Red Square for the winter holidays in recent years, the Kremlin is sensitive about use of the history-steeped expanse at Moscow's heart. Protest band Pussy Riot performed on the square a month before their 'punk prayer' in a cathedral that resulted in jail terms, and a man who stripped naked and nailed himself to the cobbles this month may face criminal charges. Louis Vuitton, whose parent company is LVMH, had said the exhibit, which was to open on December 2, was a tribute to its longstanding ties with Russia and that all revenue from it would go to the Naked Heart Foundation, a children's charity. The charity's founder, model Natalia Vodianova, is the fiancee of a son of Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:31 EST, 18 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:31 EST, 18 November 2013 . Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul told an audience in Charleston, S.C. last week that the wave of health insurance cancellations following the Affordable Care Act's implementation came from 'a regulation written by President Obama' months after he signed the law. And every Senate Democrat, he said during his Nov. 11 remarks, voted against the GOP's attempt to block the regulation. Speaking at The Charleston Meeting, an influential monthly gathering of conservative movers and shakers, Paul said Senate Republicans tried in 2010 to block an Obamacare rule that only permitted Americans to keep their health insurance policies if nothing about them was changed from year to year. That 'grandfather' clause in the Obama administration's regulations has been widely faulted for causing nearly 5 million policy cancellations, and analysts estimate that number could climb to 12 million. President Obama pledged on Thursday to give insurers a one-year grace period, and House Republicans passed a stronger measure on Friday that would empower the companies to keep selling their 2013 policies indefinitely. Scroll down for video . Rand Paul told a partisan crowd on Nov. 11 that the Obama White House crafted the regulation responsible for millions of health insurance cancellations, and that every Senate Democrat blocked an effort to kill it . His fault? President Obama's administration crafted the regulation that has forced nearly 5 million Americans in the ranks of the uninsured . 'I'm still learning about it,' Paul said of the Affordable Care Act. 'It’s 20,000 pages of regulations. The Bill was 2,000 pages. And I didn’t realize this until this week – the whole idea of you losing or getting your insurance cancelled wasn’t in the original Obamacare [law]. It was a regulation written by President Obama, three months later.' In a little-noted Nov. 5 report, the influential Senate Republican Policy claimed that '[t]he Obama Administration decided – all on its own – . that any routine change made to a grandfathered plan would invalidate . the promise that you can keep what you had.' Citing that report, Paul described the GOP's attempt to do away with that regulation in 2010, months before he became a U.S. senator. 'The Republicans had a vote to try to cancel that regulation so you couldn’t be cancelled – to grandfather everybody in,' he said. 'You know what the vote was? Straight party line. Every Democrat voted to keep the rule that cancels your insurance.' Watch the full speech on YouTube . Looking ahead? Sen. Rand Paul is seen as a likely 2016 presidential candidate, but first he aims to force as many Senate Democrats into retirement as possible . The GOP proposal came from Wyoming Republican Senator Mike Enzi, who sought to overturn what he warned would 'threaten small businesses with higher health care costs, more regulation, and even loss of the health insurance many of their employees rely on.' 'Throughout the health care debate, the President continually promised, ""If you like what you have you can keep it,'"" Enzi said at the time. 'The grandfathered health plan rule breaks the President’s promise.' His proposal, a joint resolution expressing 'congressional disapproval' of the grandfather clause, failed on a 59-40 vote strictly along party lines. During a brief debate,  Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley  complained that 'only in the District of Columbia could you get away with telling the people ""if you like what you have you can keep it,"" and then pass regulations six months later that do just the opposite, and figure that people are going to ignore it.' In his Charleston speech, Paul claimed politically vulnerable Democrats including Mark Pryor or Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana will find it difficult to explain their 2010 votes when they run for re-election next year. Sen. Mike Enzi proposed a measure in 2010 that could have gutted the Obamacare 'grandfather' regulation, but every Democrat – including Mark Pryor of Arkansas – voted to block the attempt . Vulnerable? Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu voted for the Affordable Care Act, and also voted against a Republican move to get rid of the law's 'grandfather' regulation . ""This week, have you noticed?' he asked. 'Democrats are, like, going to the White House and saying, ""Mr. President – what did you do?'"" 'We're not responsible for this,' he described them telling their constituents. 'The president cancelled your insurance, but not us. Because we're running in the South now, and we've got a Republican running against us.' But Landrieu and Pryor 'voted specifically, not just for Obamacare. They voted for the rule that says if your insurance ever changes, you'll be cancelled.' Spokespersons for Landrieu and Pryor did not respond to emails seeking comment. A Rasmussen poll released Monday showed that 58 per cent of Americans – a new high water mark –have an unfavorable view of the Affordable Care Act. Mallory Factor, the South Carolina author and businessman who organizes The Charleston Meeting, told MailOnline that his events 'really do get a lot of real, candid comments from big-name politicians.' 'I'm not surprised Sen. Paul raised some eyebrows. These meetings give people an opportunity to see our national leaders outside of three-minute sound bites.'","In a 2010 Senate vote, Republicans failed to block the Obamacare regulation responsible for as many as 5 million insurance cancellations .
The vote was 59-40, with every Democrat opposed .
Sen. Rand Paul told a partisan crowd last week that the rule was never part of the Affordable Care Act, but was tacked on later by the White House .
The so-called 'grandfather' clause virtually guarantees the cancellation of private health insurance policies that change in any way from year to year ."

In 2017, a rare planetary alignment will see Mars and Earth orbit as close as they possibly can to each other and a billionaire plans to take advantage of this by launching a manned mission to the red planet. New York engineer Dennis Tito wants to launch a shuttle, manned by two astronauts, on an 800 million-mile journey to Martian space that could launch as early as Christmas Day 2017. The shuttle will then spend a total of 16 months travelling to within 100 miles of Mars before being flung back to Earth. New York billionaire Dennis Tito wants to launch a shuttle, with two astronauts on board, on an 800-mile journey to Mars by 5 January 2018. The shuttle will then spend a total of 16 months travelling to within 100 miles of Mars before being flung back to Earth . The orbits of Earth and Mars mean the . planets approach each other every 26 months. In late 2017, a rare planetary alignment will see Mars and Earth orbit as close as they possibly can to each other. This rare alignment happens only twice every 15 years. When the planets are as close as they . can be, the amount of time the astronauts will need to spend in space as . well as the amount of fuel needed, is at its lowest. This means the chances of the mission being successful and the shuttle arriving back safely is increased. If 73-year-old Tito doesn’t launch the shuttle in 2018 he’ll have to wait until 2031 to try again. This rare alignment happens only twice every 15 years and if 73-year-old Tito doesn’t launch the shuttle between December 25th 2017 and January 5th 2018, he will need to wait until 2031 to try again. When the planets are this close, the amount of time the astronauts will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed, is at its lowest. This means the chances of the mission being successful and the shuttle arriving back safely is increased. The planets are set to align again in 2021, although won’t be as close to one another as they will be in 2018. If Tito was to try again then, the journey would take 80 days longer and require the shuttle to fly closer to the sun, adding radiation risks. Nasa has previously said that the optimum time to launch a Mars mission would a ‘few months’ before Earth and Mars are closest together, a time astronomers call opposition. Tito announced his plans, dubbed Inspiration Mars, during a hearing at the House of Representatives subcommittee on space on Wednesday. He said: ‘It would be a voyage of around 800 million miles around the sun in 501 days. The orbits of Earth and Mars mean the planets approach each other every 26 months. In late 2017, a rare planetary alignment will see the planets orbit as close as they possibly can to each other. At this distance the amount of time the shuttle will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed, is at its lowest . ‘No longer is a Mars flyby mission just one more theoretical idea. It can be done. Not in a matter of decades, but in a few years.’ The shuttle will be manned by one male and one female astronaut, both from America, although the names of the candidates have not been announced. Tito’s mission will be financed from private donations, as well as support from government sources, and he is working with Nasa’s Ames Research Center and Applied Defense Solutions, among others. Tito is an engineer who was born in . Queens, New York City in 1940. In 1962 he graduated with a degree in . Astronautics and Aeronautics from New York University. Two years . later he gained a Masters in Engineering Science from Rensselaer . Polytechnic Institute. Tito made his money through an investment . management company he set up during the 1970s called Wilshire Associates. The companies assets are said to be worth around $71 billion. In . 2001, Tito spent nearly eight days in orbit as a crew member on board . the Russian spacecraft ISS EP-1 as it visited the International Space . Station.  He is also a former scientist from the Nasa Jet Propulsion Lab. In response to the Tito’s plans, Nasa spokesman David Weaver said:  ‘Inspiration Mars’s proposed schedule is a significant challenge due to life support systems, space radiation response, habitats and the human psychology of being in a small spacecraft for over 500 days. ‘The agency is willing to share technical and programmatic expertise with Inspiration Mars but is unable to commit to sharing expenses with them. However, we remain open to further collaboration as their proposal and plans for a later mission develop.’","The mission will take place when Mars and Earth become aligned in 2018 .

Research by mySupermarket has shown that special offers on wine can be misleading, with some bottles sold for cheaper just months before . They are the offers designed to turn shoppers’ heads – wine at marked ‘half-price’ or ‘two  for £10’. But research appears to confirm what many have long suspected: The bargains are often not what they seem. Six in ten bottles sold by the big supermarkets are wines on promotion. But stores frequently put up prices in the weeks before a wine goes on offer to make discounts seem artificially big, says price comparison website mySupermarket. The ‘yo-yo’ pricing can be so varied that Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda have sold brands at a lower price when they were not on offer. Critics say shoppers need to be wiser to retailers’ pricing ploys but add that the public is partly to blame for allowing its buying habits to be driven by special offers. Among the wines singled out is Tesco’s Ogio Pinot Grigio, on sale yesterday at £5.49, billed as half price, reduced from £10.99. According mySupermarket, Tesco has sold this wine for £10.99 on only 63 days in the past year, while on 58 days it was £4.99 – less than the supposed half-price offer. Also at Tesco, Hardy’s Legacy Shiraz was £4.99, down from £9.99, yet in March it was only £4. Sainsbury’s was selling Toretta de Mondelli Pinot Grigio for £5.32, marketed as ‘Save 33%, was £7.99’.However the wine was priced at £7.99 for only 16 days in the past 365, according to mySupermarket. On 148 days it was being sold for £4.99 – again less than the current ‘offer’ price. Asda had Campo Viejo Crianza at £6, down from £8.50. But according to mySupermarket it has been sold at £8.50 for only 85 days in the past year and had been as low as £5. And at Waitrose, Robert Mondavi Woodbridge Chardonnay – currently on a ‘Save £2’ offer at £7.99, was only £6.29 in April. 'Yo-yo' pricing means that shops inflate the price of a bottle in the weeks before it goes on offer to make the discount seem larger . The mySupermarket research is based on store’s websites so does not cover Morrisons, while Aldi does not run wine promotions. The offers are not illegal as rules on ‘price establishment’ require only that the higher price cited in the promotion has applied recently for 28 consecutive days. Nevertheless former Sainsbury’s wine buyer Allan Cheeseman said some supermarket offers were ‘blatantly manufactured’. ‘You will see a Mondelli or an Ogio on sale for a very high price for a period of time, then discounted massively,’ he said. ‘The problem is that as a nation we have become promotion junkies.’ Most stores insisted they were simply responding to what shoppers wanted. Tesco said: ‘We realise that not every wine will be to the particular taste of every customer, but our half-price wine offers remain popular, indicating customers are satisfied with both the quality and value for money.’ Sainsbury’s blamed its fluctuating prices on harvest yields, transport costs and global demand. ‘We work hard to mitigate these and keep prices down for customers, including offering price reductions and promotions whenever possible’ it said. And Waitrose took issue with the mySupermarket research, pointing out that the Robert Mondavi wine had been sold for the full price of £9.99 on 127 days since May.","'Yo-yo' pricing means supermarkets put up price before discounting .

Most people dread a trip to the dentist and it was no different for this polar bear, who has had to endure an operation to remove her sore teeth. The 11-month-old polar bear cub, who keepers have named Aurora, was discovered in Churchill in Manitoba, Canada, after her mother abandoned her in the wild. She appeared unusually thin and during a routine exam vets discovered she had some broken teeth - which led to her transportation to Assiniboine Park Zoo in nearby Winnipeg. Like a bear with a sore... mouth? A dentist reaches gingerly between the jaws of Aurora, an 11-month-old abandoned polar bear cub, who had to endure an operation to remove three teeth that were infected . This won't hurt a bit: Vets used general anaesthetic to subdue the otherwise fierce juvenile polar bear so they could remove two baby teeth and an adult tooth, which were broken and infected . A team headed by veterinary dentist Dr Colleen O'Morrow sedated the young bear before lying her out and removing two baby teeth and one adult tooth which was broken and infected. Her recovery will take place at the newly constructed International Polar Bear Conservation Centre where staff hope to introduce Aurora to the zoo's latest polar cub addition - 11-month-old Kaska. Dr Chris Enright, the zoo's head of veterinary services, said: 'In the wild this sort of tooth decay absolutely happens but in captivity we want to address it - we want her as comfortable and as healthy as she can be. 'This kind of dental surgery is much the same as working on humans but doing it on zoo animals adds a whole new complication. 'Right now she might only be about 110lbs but she still has the attitude of a 600lb predator - so it's certainly not safe to just ask her to open her mouth.' The Bambi of man-eating beasts?

But Dr Chris Enright said Aurora had the attitude of a 600lb polar bear . Dr Enright added that following the operation Aurora would quickly recover. He said: 'She'll be back at the centre and within a few days she'll be back to her old self eating well and her new friend Kaska will provide her with some companionship and an outlet for all her energy. 'Aurora has already gained seven kilograms since arriving at the zoo so she is well on the way to recovery.'

Dot-bong, Marijuana Inc, the Green Rush - call it what you will, the burgeoning legal marijuana industry in Washington state is drawing pot prospectors of all stripes. Microsoft veterans and farmers, real estate agents and pastry chefs, former journalists and long-time pot growers alike are seeking new challenges - and fortunes - in the production, processing and sale of a drug that's been illegal for generations. In Colorado, the only other state to legalize marijuana, existing medical marijuana dispensaries can begin selling for recreational use in January. But in Washington, where sales are expected to begin in late spring, the industry is open to nearly anyone - provided they've lived in the state for three months, pass a background check and raise money from within the state. Washington on Monday begins accepting applications from those eager to jump in. Here are profiles of nine people hoping to make their mark in the new world of legal weed. The pig farmer . Hoping pot brings home the bacon: Bruce King, pictured here holding a three-week-old piglet on his farm in Arlington, Washington . Bruce King says he was a 22-year-old high-school dropout when Microsoft hired him as its 80th employee in 1986. A software engineer, he eventually left and started or acquired two other companies - telephone adult chat and psychic hotlines - but he really wanted to farm. He found a management team to handle his business and started breeding pigs north of Seattle. After Washington legalized marijuana last fall, he looked at pot as any other crop. The potential margins were ‘fabulously attractive,’ he says. He found a farm with a 25,000-square-foot barn for a marijuana operation. King, 50, however, doesn't like pot himself. He said: ‘If people are going to eat a stupid drug, they should eat my stupid drug.’ He likens it to running a psychic hotline when he's never had a reading. He added: ‘You don't have to like Brussels sprouts to grow them.’ Pot and patisseries . Looking to cook up a profit: Marla Molly Poiset, a Le Cordon Bleu-trained French pastry chef . Marla Molly Poiset had swapped her three-decade-old home-furnishing store and interior design business in Colorado for a life of world travel when she learned some devastating news: Her eldest daughter had leukemia. She suspended her travels to help her daughter and her family through the ordeal. She then continued her tour, attending cooking school in Paris. Poiset, 59, graduated last spring, and had the idea of ‘blending my newfound patisserie skills with medical cannabis’. So she abandoned Paris for Seattle, where she's been developing recipes for marijuana-infused chocolate truffles for recreational and medical use. Her aim is to create ‘a beautiful package’ like French chocolate or pastries for people like her daughter. She said they could ‘ingest discreetly and enjoy life, rather than everything being in a pill’.Pot prospector . Seeing green: Daniel Curylo laughs while posing with some of the marijuana plants that he uses for marketing purposes . If legal pot is the Green Rush, Daniel Curylo has some unique credentials: He's been an actual prospector. He helped put himself through college working for a company that flew him into northern British Columbia and the Yukon with a map, a compass and a heavy backpack. He'd pan for gold and take soil samples. Another source of income in those days? Growing and selling marijuana with a few other political science majors. A former techie and ex-house flipper, Curylo, 41, says his background in ‘business development and taking risks’ is perfect for the legal pot world. He has invested $400,000 so far. His goal? A cannabis business park northwest of Olympia that would feature his growing operation, Cascade Crops, as well as retail stores run by his mother, father and aunt. ‘The poster child for anti-cannabis’ Change of heart: Angel Swanson used to be fiercely anti-drugs . Angel Swanson was raised on the South Side of Chicago by a mother who warned: ‘If you see drugs, run.’ Decades later, the businesswoman and real estate agent found herself in Washington state with a husband, seven children and a strong bias against illegal drugs. She said she was ‘the poster child for anti-cannabis’. That is, until one of her daughters, who had serious digestive issues and had never weighed more than 100 pounds, came home from college one day and ate a full plate of food. The girl had tried pot-laced cookies, which stimulated her appetite. Swanson lost it. ‘Do you have any idea the sacrifices that have been made for you to go to college?’ she remembers saying. Swanson, 52, did some research and couldn't find a reason for her daughter not to use weed. She and her husband opened a medical marijuana dispensary, The Cannabis Emporium, near Tacoma. They now want to sell recreational pot, but hope to continue to serve patients - a challenge, since stores will be barred from trumpeting pot's therapeutic benefits. From MBA to THC . Entrepreneurs: Bilye Miller, left, and her partner Todd Spaits are seeking a retail license in Kirkland, east of Seattle . Todd Spaits and Bilye (sounds like ‘Billy’) Miller are more gym-and-yoga than smoke-and-cough. The couple doesn't use pot. Spaits said: ‘I much prefer a glass of scotch.’ But they say they know a good business opportunity when they see one. The pair previously worked in online marketing in San Diego, and Spaits has a master's in business administration. Their most recent startup is skyfu.com, which helps restaurants monitor what people are saying about them on social media. Spaits, 39, also helps judge business plan competitions and believes his skills are perfectly honed to run a successful pot store. He and Miller, 38, who has also worked as a bartender, are excited about Washington's grand experiment. They sought advice from friends who operate medical dispensaries in California to help draw up a revenue model. They're seeking a retail license in Kirkland, east of Seattle. The path from addiction . Relief: Yevgeniy 'Eugene' Frid, general manager of A Greener Today, found that marijuana helped ease him off painkillers . It started with small doses that eased the aches of restaurant work. But over time, Yevgeniy ‘Eugene’ Frid found himself addicted to prescription painkillers. He said: ‘It completely envelops your whole life.’ He tried to quit many times, and when he finally did, he says, cannabis played a huge role - displacing the opiates with a substance much gentler on the body. Frid, 28, quit his job doing business management and marketing for a video game company when a friend asked him to help start a medical marijuana dispensary. A Greener Today opened in Seattle in 2012 and now serves about 4,000 people. Frid says his most gratifying work is helping patients get off opiates the way he did, so he has mixed feelings about applying for a recreational retail license. The future of unregulated medical marijuana in Washington is dim - many state officials see it as a threat to the heavily taxed recreational system. Some medical dispensary operators believe they have little choice but to convert to the recreational market. Frid said: ‘We don't know what's happening.’The security guard . Gunning for success: Security guard Steve Smith has applied to open two retail marijuana shops near Tacoma . For a guy with a uniform and a gun, Steve Smith was unusually welcome at medical marijuana dispensaries. Of course, he was a security guard, not a federal drug agent. Smith, 29, had a background in food marketing. His father worked for a large grocery cooperative in California. He earned a degree in agriculture business management and started marketing organic and natural products for a food broker. His father liked thinking he was helping people eat better. A friend who was working in security suggested Smith do the same. Looking to keep busy and make some extra money, he undertook training and became a certified security guard. The company that hired him happened to assign him to a couple of medical marijuana dispensaries. He said: ‘You can only work as a guard for so long before you want to open your own shop.’ He wants to apply to open two retail marijuana shops near Tacoma. The secret soda . Thirst for prosperity: Cecilia Sivertson makes pot-infused soda . Cecilia Sivertson worked for eight years as a paralegal in the prosecutor's office for Washington's most populous county. She helped make sure people paid child support and tracked down deadbeat dads. It was a rewarding, stressful and sometimes depressing job. After her husband died in a car accident in 2001, she decided she needed a more upbeat line of work and joined a labeling business. Sivertson, 55, has epilepsy and arthritis in her hands. About two years ago, she says, she noticed improvement in both when she started using marijuana. Last spring, she began making products infused with cannabis oil under her ‘Nana's Secret’ line. Her specialty is pot-infused soda - with the soda concentrate produced by a client of the labeling business. The Alabama native says she's applying to become a licensed marijuana processor so her sodas and other items can be sold in retail pot stores. Cannabis: A force for good . The write stuff: Former journalist Paul Schrag holds two cloned plants that will be used to grow medical marijuana . Paul Schrag has a simple philosophy - he hopes to use his skills to do the most good in the world. For a while, that meant working in journalism, enticed by its power to shape public discourse. Before being laid off in 2009, he worked as a reporter for the Business Examiner, a biweekly publication in Tacoma. Nowadays, it means working in the pot industry. The 40-year-old says he's been growing marijuana since 1999 and uses it to treat lifelong neck pain. He began working at a medical marijuana collective, where part of his job entails coming up with a marketing and public education plan to help erase any stigma associated with cannabis use. He believes the medical and social benefits of the plant are only just starting to be understood. He plans to work as a grower's vice president of marketing, research and development, and believes his knowledge of pot and business will help. He said: ‘I'm one of those rare cats that get both.’","Marijuana was made legal last year in Washington and residents can now apply to run businesses based on its sale .

'We’ve seen domain name cybersquatting activity for key domains increase in the past 48 hours as news has emerged on the Royal couple. 'It’s not just websites that can get taken by opportunistic squatters either. You can see it happen elsewhere on social media,' Ms Tomkotowicz added. 'On twitter, spoof accounts for Kate have been activated by a whole host of impersonators from @kate_middleton to @PrincessKateFTW. 'The Royal couple are among many well known names who have had problems with cybersquatters from Richard Branson to Mariah Carey and Leona Lewis.' Parody: The websites which have been taken by cybersquatters mirror twitter feeds such as @Royal Foetus which were registered within hours of the public announcement . Cybersquatting can involve registering, trafficking or using a domain name with bad faith and intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. Cybersquatters sometimes offer to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark  at an inflated price. The new arrival isn’t the first HRH to become the target of cybersquatting. www.willsandkate.com has previously been taken by a third party, and the baby’s grandfather Prince Charles has also lost key domains, with his UK website www.princecharles.co.uk taken by a professional Prince Charles impersonator.

The Royal Nursery, which has domain names including www.royalbaby.com and www.theroyalnursery.com, sells gifts and clothes for newborns in San Diego, US and has been slow to load ever since Kate and Wills confirmed that they were expecting. Founder Mark D. John’s said: 'At the time my first son was born, Princess Diana was expecting Prince William. 'When it came to choosing the name for my business, I pictured in my mind Prince William's Royal Nursery. It was at that moment that ""The Royal Nursery"" was chosen as our trade name.' 'I registered some of these domain names as early as 1997 including www.TheRoyalNursery.com, www.theRoyalNursery.co.uk, www.RoyalNursery.com, www.RoyalNursery.co.uk and www.RoyalBaby.com.

CCTV images released today show the moment a murderer withdrew cash from a millionaire's bank account months after he killed her in her flat in Marylebone, central London. Rakesh Bhayani, of Wembley, north west London, was found guilty of murdering Carole Waugh at the Old Bailey. He had admitted perverting the course of justice by concealing the death and also conspiracy to defraud. Scroll down for video . Captured: Rakesh Bhayani is pictured withdrawing money from Carole Waugh's bank account . Co-accused Nicholas Kutner, 48, Kentish Town, north west London, was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of perverting the course of justice by concealing the death. He had already admitted conspiracy to defraud. Carole Waugh was stabbed in the neck . A third defendant, Elie Khoury, 40, of Paddington, central London, was found not guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Bhayani, 41, and Kutner, 48, were accused of killing Ms Waugh, who was described as a lonely woman who worked as an amateur escort. Bhayani was Ms Waugh's 'boyfriend' who she met online and lent £40,000 to - but instead of repaying her he stabbed her to death. The jury at the Old Bailey heard claims that they were professional conmen with gambling habits who killed the millionaire in April last year then went on to steal large sums of her money. Miss Waugh sought excitement in sex with strangers and fabricating stories that hid the truth about her life, the jury heard. After working in Libya she returned to the UK and began advertising herself on at least nine different dating websites. Using the pseudonyms Sarah and . 'poshtottyfun', she described herself as 'not a professional but with . girlfriend experience interested in lots of good clean adult fun.' Dozens of men who responded to the adverts arrived at her flat to find her waiting at her door dressed only in a dressing gown. Although many paid her between £100 and £200 for sex and never saw her again, she occasionally refused payment. In some cases the men became long-term boyfriends. One of them would be Bhayani. Decision: Bhayani (left) was convicted for murder and Kutner (right) was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by concealing the death . Her mistake was to trust Bhayani enough to lend him £40,000 after he showed her a bag full of 150,000 counterfeit Euros. Bhayani's determination to avoid . paying back the debt would eventually lead to him killing her and taking . over her identity to plunder her assets. 'Mesmerising and beguiling' Bhayani . even got Miss Waugh to visit him in prison and lent him cash for . 'treatment' for his gambling addiction. She . had previously loaned him smaller sums after he told her he could . double it in a betting opportunity - and he had always delivered. He was setting her up to borrow a large sum he could never hope to repay - but Miss Waugh trusted him. Millionairess Carole Waugh was stabbed to death in her flat and her body hidden in the boot of a car . Ms Waugh, 49, was stabbed in the neck in her flat in Marylebone, central London. The court heard her body was placed in a bag, which was carried to a car. The vehicle was initially stored in a central London car park, then left in a rented garage in New Malden, south London. By the time her body was found on 2 August her bank accounts had been stripped and her house put on the market. In the dock (left to right) Khoury, Kutner, Bhayani were all accused of being involved in the murder of millionaire Carole Waugh . Ms Waugh was a self-made millionaire who boasted of her connections with Colonel Gaddafi - but despite her claims of a colourful, was a doting aunt and daughter. The millionairess was determined to make her fortune in London and moved there when she was 22. Although . she revealed little of her work and life in the capital, her family . believed she was mainly temping as an office worker. By 1998 she had made enough money to buy the flat in Marylebone, west London, which is today worth more than £650,000. Miss . Waugh spent the next ten years in Tripoli in Libya working as a payroll . clerk for Veba Oil on a tax-free salary of £25,000 a year and earned a . reputation as a private woman who preferred to stay out late at night . with the locals rather than her work colleagues. The crime scene in New Malden, south west London where Miss Waugh's body was discovered . She . returned home when the political situation started to deteriorate and . later wrote a letter to her boss Stuart Anderson claiming that she had . been threatened by a senior figure in the government and feared for her . life. Ms Waugh made enough money to pay off . her flat's mortgage and she could easily have got an ordinary job - but decided . to mix business with pleasure, and began advertising herself on dating . websites. But her colourful personal life never . prevented her from regularly returning north to see her family . including a niece she doted on and speaking to her mother every other . day by phone. At the time of her death they were talking about the arrangements for her 50th birthday celebration in June 2012. Her . brother, acting on his mother's concerns about the lack of contact, . first contacted police in late April and made a formal missing persons . report at Penrith, Cumbria, on 7 May 2012. But it was only when he discovered her bank account was empty that he knew for sure something was terribly wrong. A court heard that before her death . Ms Waugh boasted of being 'set up for life' thanks to her friendship . with Colonel Gaddafi and his family in Libya. Referring to her claims of friendship with Gaddafi, Mr Waugh added: 'The stories were embroidered and exaggerated to give an impression she was more successful than she was and happier than she was.' She . told family and friends how she worked at a merchant bank and rubbed . shoulders with Foreign Secretary William Hague and his staff. As . well as constant namedropping, Ms Waugh was also not afraid to show off . her prized Cartier jewellery and expensive luxury cars. But . in fact she was a spendthrift who hid £5,000 in cash in an airing . cupboard at her flat, kept £50,000 in the bank, invested in shares and . lived on the proceeds of the escort work she advertised on casual sex . websites. She proudly told her family how she . discovered a vintage Chanel handbag worth hundreds of pounds being sold . for £5 at a charity shop - and promptly haggled the price down to £3.50. 'That is instructive of how careful she was with money,' her brother Christopher Waugh told the court. The millionairess was born in Haswell . in County Durham on 20 June, 1962 and was brought up by her mother . after her father Stephen died when she was young. She . joined the civil service after leaving Shotton Hall comprehensive . school but at 22 decided to leave the area and seek her fortune in . London. 'She was . determined to make her own way in the City of London,' said Mr Waugh, . who revealed that Carole had carefully erased any trace of her northeast . accent by the time of her death. Miss Waugh, who always wore a wedding . ring and went jogging every night, told her family in around 2011 she . had a wealthy fiance called 'Earl' who had connections to Brentford . football club and lived in south London. She later explained that the wedding had been called off after his mother died. Other . boyfriends included a deep sea diver called Peter and a mystery man who . drove an Audi TT and was known only as 'The Boy Wonder'. Bhayani was a professional conman who was always pretending to be someone else in a life-long career as a 'grifter.' His own QC described him as 'a huge show off.' He has made 14 court appearances for 95 separate offences and has tried so many scams in betting shops he was once banned from every Ladbrokes in the country. He was released from this sentence just six weeks before Carole Waugh died. Bhayani has a daughter and had desperately tried to keep his marriage together by pretending to his wife he was seeking help for his gambling addiction. He would get Kutner to pose as his case worker who would collect him from his home for 'treatment' and phone up his wife to give her regular progress reports. Kutner specialises in buying jewellery through fraud and selling it on. He has made 13 court appearances for 97 offences, beginning in 1986. He was posed as a wine merchant to fraudulently buy fine vintages which were quickly converted into cash. Kutner was not averse to preying on family and friends - in July 2007 he was asked to house sit for a former girlfriend and ransacked her home. He was involved with another woman and stole her cashpoint card to remove £400. She finished with him but began seeing him again and he bought her a diamond engagement ring and pendant. He told her the ring's clasp was loose and pawned it for gambling money. Miss Waugh had set up a monthly direct debit of around £20 with the National Lottery in the hope of hitting the jackpot but in July a letter arrived to say that it had not been paid. Brother Christopher, a branch manager at Barclays, asked permission to check the state of her accounts but was refused by his bosses on the grounds that it would breach the Data Protection Act. Her family have always insisted that Miss Waugh would never have agreed to hand over they keys to her assets to a fraudster without a fight. Mother Margaret Waugh told the court: 'If she bought something she would always say how much it was. Carole has always been obsessed about money and possessive over her own items.' Mr Justice Wilkie deferred sentencing until tomorrow for Bhayani and Kutner to allow for Ms Waugh's family to attend. 'I am particularly aware that the family of Carole Waugh are not in attendance today and that it should be desirable that they should be present,' he told the court. 'I have in mind that I should proceed to sentence tomorrow when they will be here and therefore able to hear what is said. I know that they are coming from a long way distant.'","Carole Waugh was stabbed in the neck in her Marylebone flat, London .

The 22-year-old ex-boyfriend of a Kansas nurse found murdered alongside her three young children has been arrested late last night after a day-long manhunt involving 100 officers. David Cornell Bennett Jr is being held on $5 million bail after the bodies of 29-year-old Cami Umbarger and her three children, aged 9, 6, and 4, were discovered. Friends say the single mother from Parsons had gone on a couple of dates with Bennett but tried to distance herself from him when he began 'acting scary'. Horror: Cami Umbarger with her children Hollie, Jaxon, and Averie. Their bodies were found on Monday . The 22-year-old had been taken into custody last month after police were allegedly alerted to a posting on a social media site that said he planned to carry out a murder suicide, KOAM TV reported. He was held until a mental evaluation was carried out, and was then released. It is not clear who the intended victims in the alleged online post were. Colleagues of Ms Umbarger, who worked as . a nursing home, raised the alarm when the dedicated nurse failed to . show up to work on Monday. Suspect: David Cornell Bennett Jr has been arrested in connection with the deaths . Police have not yet said how the family died or where they were found, but some local stations reported that the mother was killed in her own home alongside her two daughters Hollie, 9, and Averie, 4, and son, Jaxon, 6. She had last been seen on Saturday night when she attended her sister's wedding shower. The children's father, Donald Betts, said: 'They are what I live and breathe for. I don't know how anyone could do this.' The victim's sister, Beth Umbarger, told the Wichita Eagle that Miss Umbarger had been on a few dates with Bennett, but broke it off after he 'started acting pretty scary'. She said: 'She'd been trying to stay away from him . and he just kept coming back and going back. She . was just hoping that he would leave her alone ... and she would be able . to move past it.' The victim's sister added that the family had been killed in their Parsons home, about 30 miles from where Bennett was later spotted. 'I want them back. I miss them. You go through life every day and you never expect that this would happen to you,' Beth Umbarger said. Tara Umbarger said her cousin Cami had met Bennett around the end of September and went out with him a couple of times. She said he began calling her 30 or 40 times at a time, at times making threats. 'He was basically stalking her and wouldn't leave her alone,' Tara Umbarger said. Tribute: Donald Betts, the father of Hollie, Jaxon and Averie, kneels at a makeshift memorial in Parsons on Wednesday . Support: Lexi Umbarger cuddles a teddy bear during a vigil for the family found murdered on Monday . No complaint was filed with the police and Cami Umbarger was described as the type of person who probably thought he wasn't serious. Bennett was arrested in connection with the murders at about 9pm on Tuesday, after he was spotted walking on a street. At the time of his arrest Bennett was talking on a cellphone to a friend who had alerted police, according to Kake. His clothes were said to be soaked through and freezing when police found him. No formal charges have been made yet against Bennett. A candlelit vigil was due to take place in Parsons on Wednesday night, and counseling services were being set up at the children's schools. Investigation: Officers are still collecting evidence at Cami Umbarger's home . Victim: Nurse Cami Umbarger was last seen at her sister's wedding shower on Saturday night. Co-workers raised the alarm when the mother-of-three failed to turn up for work on Monday . Joanna Wilson, who worked at the Good Samaritan Society of Parsons home with Miss Umbarger said they raised the alarm after the nurse failed to come to work. 'That’s just not like her. We’re a close-knit group. If someone is missing and you were expecting her, you’d reach out and see where they are,' she said. She added that the children were 'part of the family' and regularly came to the nursing home. 'She has many dear friends, and we’re working through it. It’s been a tough time,' she said.","Cami Umbarger found dead with her daughters and son aged 9, 6, and 4 .

Barack Obama continued a White House tradition today when he pardoned two turkeys destined for the Thanksgiving dinner table. But it was his 12-year-old daughter Sasha who almost stole the show today in a bold outfit including red jeans and green Doc Marten boots with yellow laces. Two birds from Badger, Minnesota, named Popcorn and Caramel ended up as the lucky pair pardoned by Obama, although only the former got to meet face-to-face with the President. Obama joked at the ceremony that his office carries many responsibilities 'but this is not one of them'. ‘Quite literally the Hunger Games,’ joked the president. And while Popcorn was chosen by social media voters as the best, both birds Obama called the ‘top tributes’ will now safely live out their lives at Mount Vernon. Scroll down for video . Presidential pardon: Barack Obama gives the annual presidential pardon to the national Thanksgiving turkey 'Popcorn' at the White House But his daughter Sasha was in danger of stealing the show in red jeans and fashionable Doc Marten boots .

The turkeys came from a farm in Badger, Minnesota, where most of the other birds will soon wind up on dinner tables. But thanks to a tradition begun by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, one bird a year has avoided that fate ever since.

Stand up guy: The president took the festive opportunity of the National THanksgiving Turkey pardon to try his hand at comedy . This year, two birds will be spared, but only Popcorn has been named National Thanksgiving Turkey.’ He was chosen by voters on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram who hashtagged, regrammed, and ‘liked’ the 37 pound fowl to victory. ‘Now, before these turkeys get away,’ said the president, ‘I want to grant Popcorn a full reprieve.’ And with a wave of his executive hand, the deed was done. Oh daddy, stop: The First Dad cracked jokes about how much his daughters love the turkey pardon, football, and even the Hunger Games . 'Especially at a house with two dogs': The comedy hits kept coming as Obama joked that Thanksgiving is a tough time for turkeys, especially at his home . 'Top tributes': The president compared the turkeys to the 'tribute' fighters in the smash hit The Hunger Games and his jokes received several chuckles from the White House audience . Brother birds: Caramel and Popcorn are presented to the press one day before Popcorn was named the National Thanksgiving Turkey . Thin to win: The White House website has dedicated a full page to its chosen ones, brothers Caramel and Popcorn, who were the top two of some 80 birds. The site even offers visitors the chance to listen to the unique gobble of each respective bird. Popcorn, the lighter of the two, became the National Thanksgiving turkey on Wednesday . A vision in white: Popcorn, the National Thanksgiving Turkey, from Badger, Minnesota stands on the North Portico at the White House in Washington . ‘You have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing,’ Obama said. ‘We’re gonna give caramel a break as well.’ The two turkeys will now live out their days at George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. They’ll be alone, though, because all the other pardoned turkeys are dead. Even the six pardoned by Barack Obama. Something to crow about: Caramel and Popcorn will both survive the holiday season, and, if they are lucky, be able to live out their golden years for awhile yet . Settling in: One perk to being the National Thanksgiving Turkey is the real estate! Popcorn and Caramel will live out the remainder of their lives at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate in Virginia . That’s because the breed isn’t cut out for much besides filling up American tables and bellies on Turkey Day. ‘The . bird is bred for the table, not for longevity,’ Dean Norton, who’s in . charge of livestock at Mount Vernon, told CNN. ‘Some of [the pardoned . turkeys] have been pretty short lived.’ Domesticated turkeys are slaughtered at after living mere months, and often can’t survive much longer than that when spared. But at least for now, Popcorn and Caramel will survive to cluck another day. Or so.

When all was said and done, both Popcorn and his brother Caramel were pardoned from being eaten on Thanksgiving.

But the domesticated turkeys won't live long even at Mount Vernon. Many don't even live as long as a year . Lonely at the top: Popcorn may have been riding high on the horse Wednesday afternoon, but he and Caramel will be the only turkeys at Mount Vernon because all the other National Thanksgiving Turkeys have gone to turkey heaven .

They may regret saying it, but the winners of a £148million lottery jackpot insist they read every single begging letter they receive. Gillian and Adrian Bayford get between 30 and 40 requests for money a week – and they consider them all. Speaking for the first time since their win last summer, Mrs Bayford, 40, said: ‘We do get a lot of letters, but in this world if you don’t ask, you don’t know. ‘You can’t condemn anybody for asking. It takes a lot of guts just to ask somebody for money, to just to come out and say it. Scroll down for video . Bulging postbag: Gillian and Adrian Bayford (pictured celebrating their £148m win on Euromillions last year) says they get at least 30 letters a week from people begging for money . Payout: The Bayfords won £148million in August, one of the biggest lottery jackpots in the UK . ‘We still read every one of them and work out yes or no on their own merits.’ When they won their massive EuroMillions jackpot, Mr Bayford, 41, ran a music shop in Haverhill, Suffolk. He closed it just before Christmas, charging £10 for 20 CDs or DVDs. The Bayfords went public with their win because they realised it would be hard to give money away and expect people to keep quiet about it. Bombarded: They were rumours that the couple were forced to close their music shop (above) because of nuisance and abuse from beggars, but Gillian has denied this was the case . In business: Mr Bayford with his best friend Richard Hudspith, left, inside the shop . They said they planned to share their good fortune with a small but close group of family and friends. Immediately after their win, the family were rumoured to have flown to a secret destination to ‘acclimatise’ after their life-changing jackpot. But rather than choosing somewhere exotic, they took an easyJet flight to Scotland and headed straight to the caravan park where Mrs Bayford’s parents, Ian and Brenda McCulloch, live. The couple were new entries in the Sunday Times rich list this week, but Mrs Bayford insists their life hasn’t changed hugely. Their children still go to the same school and play with the same friends, and the family’s priorities have not altered. ‘You can’t say it doesn’t change you but we’ve tried not to let it change us. It highlights who your friends are, the people who are behind you through thick and thin,’ said Mrs Bayford. There are no financial worries any more . and we’ve moved to a slightly larger house, but my main aims are still . there – my friends, my family, my children. It doesn’t matter how much . money you have in the bank, you wouldn’t be anybody without friends and . family behind you.’ Still on a budget: Adrian and Gillian Bayford board a helicopter after it was revealed that they had won £148million on the lottery . Jet-setters: The helicopter took the couple on a four-mile journey to Stansted Airport, where they boarded an easyJet flight with their two children . Trading up: The couple have bought a £6million Georgian mansion, with a stable in its grounds which is set to be turned into a musical instrument workshop . When Mrs Bayford, who now lives in a £6million Georgian mansion set in 100 acres, won the lottery last August, she said she wanted to do things locally and she is now helping to re-open a children’s soft play centre. A year ago, the former health care assistant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge struggled to pay for her two young children, Aimee and Cameron, to have a joint birthday party at the play barn in Haverhill. So when the Cheeky Chimps Funhouse went out of business in February she stepped in to buy it.‘The kids both wanted their party there last year – times were tight but we made a point of trying to budget for it,’ she said. ‘Both of them had half of their class there, they had a great time. ‘At the moment there’s nothing for children from Haverhill and the surrounding villages, so we wanted to give them somewhere to go.’ The Bayfords’ new house has seven bedrooms and four marble bathrooms as well as a three-bedroom annexe, a lodge, a three-bedroom farmhouse and four cottages. Their jackpot was the second-biggest to be won by Britons. The record is held by Colin and Christine Weir, from Ayrshire, who scooped £161million, also on EuroMillions.

Probe: International Development Secretary Justine Greening has launched an emergency audit following revelations that 'poverty barons' are making millions in consultancy fees from the foreign aid budget . An emergency audit was opened last night into  revelations that ‘poverty barons’ are making millions in consultancy fees from the foreign aid budget. Nearly £500million was paid out last year to firms that work on Third World programmes. Some give their directors seven-figure salaries. The probe was launched by Justine Greening, who was appointed International Development Secretary against her will in David Cameron’s Cabinet reshuffle this month. Miss Greening, who is an accountant . by training, has demanded a rapid explanation of apparently extravagant . spending and is said to be going through the Department for . International Development’s budget ‘line by line’. ‘Justine . will be sure to bring an accountant’s eye to DfID and will be looking . extremely closely at every single area of spend to ensure value for . money for the British taxpayer,’ said one source. ‘She has ordered a full report on all the issues that have been raised on her desk by the end of the month.’ One of the firms to profit from the . ring-fenced aid budget is Adam Smith International. The London-based . consultancy, which promotes the free market in poor countries, has . received contracts worth tens of millions of pounds in a single year. Its . work includes building schools in Pakistan, developing the free market . in Nepal and reforming the tax system in Afghanistan. Peter . Young, a director of both ASI and its parent company Amphion Group, . made more than £1million in 2010. He receives a salary of £250,000 and . paid himself a dividend of £800,000 two years ago. Defending . his payout to the Mail, he said it was a one-off dividend accumulated . over many years, adding: ‘I don’t think it’s particularly helpful to . take pot-shots at success.’ Mr Young, who lives in Tunbridge . Wells, Kent, said: ‘For a very modest outlay the tax revenue of the . Afghanistan government has gone up to £2billion. ‘I don’t know if you think it would be better to hand the few million it cost to do that to the people in Afghanistan? ‘When people think about aid they think about just handing out money to people, but it’s more complicated than that. ‘There . was one occasion where we were paid out a substantive amount in . dividends that represented profits from a number of years. William Morrison: £1m dividend . Andrew Kuhn: Paid £125,000 . Peter Young: £800,000 payout . Amitabh Shivaastava: £1m . William Morrison: The 41-year-old Bristol University graduate has worked on economic reform in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India and helped set up the post-war government in Iraq. His basic pay at Adam Smith International is around £150,000 but two years ago he took a dividend from the consultancy of more than £1million. He lives in upmarket Lewes in East Sussex. Andrew Kuhn: An economist, he has worked in the Palestinian West Bank but is currently in charge of Adam Smith’s work in Afghanistan. He also banked a dividend of more than £1million two years ago and is on a basic salary of around £125,000. Home is a flat in fashionable Earls Court in central London. Peter Young: As head of strategy and operations for Adam Smith, Mr Young, 53, boasts expertise in ‘resource allocation’. He is on £150,000 a year and claimed an £800,000 dividend in 2010. He has a luxury home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Amitabh Shrivastava: . The 43-year-old has toured 25 of the world’s most impoverished . countries, including Rwanda and Sierra Leone, and boasts particular . expertise in ‘making markets work for the poor’. His annual salary is also in the £125,000 range, again boosted by a £1million-plus dividend two years ago. He lives in affluent Wimbledon in south-west London, but was yesterday working in Afghanistan. He declined to comment. ‘But . our company makes relatively modest profits for doing a very . difficult and challenging job in very difficult and dangerous places. ‘Do . you think no one should make a profit out of that sort of activity? It’s like saying no one should make a profit out of the medical sector, . or judicial system.’ William Morrison, the managing director of ASI, received a salary and dividends worth £1.3million in 2010. Directors of the firm are on an average of £125,000 each, while contractors earn up to £850 a day. A fellow director of Mr Young and his colleagues at ASI is former Tory defence secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, whose party takes a stern line on wasteful foreign aid. Yesterday, Sir Malcolm, 66, did not respond to a request for comment. In need: Nearly £500million of taxpayers' money was paid out last year to firms that work on Third World programmes. Some pay their directors seven-figure salaries . Another firm which was paid around £6million from DfID last year is a subsidiary of the Marie Stopes abortion rights charity. It . carried out work in India, Africa and Nepal. Its highest paid director . was on £233,000 – £80,000 more than the Prime Minister. The highest paid director at another consultancy, Maxwell Stamp, doubled their salary and is now on £326,000. Good intentions: But is Britain's aid budget falling into the wrong hands? The firm raked in £16.4million for its work on legal services in Bangladesh and discouraging child marriage in Ethiopia. Foreign organisations have also cashed in. Washington-based Search for Common Ground took nearly £4million for providing support to the ‘electoral cycle’ in Sierre Leone. The Clinton Foundation has also taken a slice of a £200million contract to advise on forestry while consultancies in Uganda and India are also winning contracts. David Cameron has pledged to increase the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of national income of GDP by 2014. That would see DfID’s budget rise from around £8billion to more than £12billion. That pledge has yet to be enshrined in law and Miss Greening’s appointment could make it less likely that it will be fulfilled. The growth of the budget has angered Tory right-wingers who believe taxpayers’ money should be spent on helping cash-strapped families at home who are struggling with the recession. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Ministers have insisted that they need more money to help the world’s poorest, but taxpayers will be appalled that hundreds of millions of pounds is being channelled to pricey consultancy firms. ‘Sometimes external expertise can be useful, but systematically spending these vast sums on consultants looks like a very bad deal for the taxpayer.’ By Daily Mail Reporter . Gratitude: Indian finance minister Pranab Mukherjee described Britain's £280million a year as 'a peanut in our total development exercises' Britain is spending millions building a foreign aid headquarters in New Delhi, even though our annual aid handout to India of £280million is expected to stop in 2015. The massive aid bill came into question after it was pointed out to ministers that booming India is so rich it now runs its own space exploration programme and dishes out foreign aid itself amounting to £2billion a year. India even said it neither wanted nor needed the cash, with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee describing Britain’s £280million a year as ‘a peanut in our total development exercises’. But despite the row, and the imminent demise of British aid to India, the Government is now spending a fortune on the new base. Opening next month, the HQ will sprawl over 40,000sq ft – the size of a hypermarket – and will incorporate 18 meeting rooms and 280 desks. The furniture bill alone will be £400,000. A spokesman for the Department for International Development said the offices were being shared with the British High Commission and would save money for taxpayers in the long run, despite the high start-up costs. He added: ‘The struggle to squeeze our staff and High Commission officials into one building meant more compact furniture had to be bought.’ Last year the DfID spent £900,000 on hotels – many of them five star – and spent some of its £280million budget for India on payouts including £20million to two consultancies so they can advise India on how to run its health service.","Probe launched by International Development Secretary Justine Greening .

Shocking: For some young girls, sex is a currency - a new report has found (posed by a model) Girls are trading sex in return for favours, status or protection, according to a shocking official inquiry. Many offer their bodies in exchange for ‘goods’ such as alcohol or drugs or to pay off a debt, researchers found. Others do it to gain what they think is respect among peers by being associated with popular or powerful individuals. The survey of 500 people aged between 13 and 28 said the findings indicated a ‘deep malaise within society’. Abuse is rarely reported by victims, some as young as 11, because they believe it is normal behaviour, largely because of the desensitising effect of hardcore porn. Young witnesses also fail to report offences because they blame victims for ‘bringing harm on themselves’ owing to the way they dress or their previous sexual history. Child protection organisations were criticised for ‘persistent failings that result in children falling through the net that is supposed to protect them’. The details emerged in three reports from the Office of the Children’s Commissioner. The reports were primarily involved with sexual exploitation in gangs and groups, where some perpetrators are just 12 years old. However, deputy commissioner Sue Berelowitz said the problems were ‘more widespread’. ‘Our findings about the scale and nature of this form of sexual violence have left our panel members aghast,’ she added. ‘We have found shocking and profoundly distressing evidence of sexual assault, including rape, being carried out by young people against other children and other young people. ‘While we have published chilling evidence of this violence in gang-associated contexts, we know too that it is more widespread. This is a deep malaise within society from which we must not shirk.’ In addition to the 500 surveyed in depth, others took part in interviews and child protection organisations, police forces and other groups were questioned. The currency in sex being used in playgrounds and the streets was most prevalent among gangs and groups of youths and the women who are in their sphere of influence. Around 2,409 are known to have been abused in these circumstances and 16,500 were identified as being at risk. Two-thirds of the young people who took part in the survey were aware of girls who had been pressurised or coerced into sexual activity. Half said the victim had submitted in return for ‘status or protection’.This left them at risk from other gangs, however. One young person told researchers: ‘She like used to sleep with just one gang... and this other gang they seen her on the bus, dragged her off...took her to someone’s house or whatever, made her [perform sex acts].’ Findings: Abuse is rarely reported by victims because they think it is normal behaviour due to the desensitising effect of pornography, the report claims (posed by model) Two-fifths knew about rapes that had taken place and a third knew of instances where girls had been assaulted by more than one man. Only one in 12 young victims would consider speaking to someone else about what had happened. If they did, it was generally a friend. One in 14 youths knew girls who had sex with several gang members to be accepted into their group. One said: ‘She had sex with every boy in a gang just to be part of their gang.’ Two in five gave examples of sex swapped for ‘tangible goods’ such as alcohol or drugs. Some 46 per cent of young people thought victims ‘deserved it’ or ‘asked for it’. This was particularly true of young women who were sexually active with more than one person and were seen to have ‘less right to withhold consent’ – even though they were often pressured into having sex in the first place. Miss Berelowitz said victims were effectively invisible because child protection agencies didn’t believe what youngsters told them, failed to recognise ‘patterns of exploitation’ they were unfamiliar with and didn’t share information with police and other children’s services. Miss Berelowitz said that the ‘sheer levels of sadism’ uncovered by the inquiry had been shocking. ‘In terms of the child-on-child, the peer-on-peer – whether in a gang-involved situation or not – it’s the chilling inevitability of it that has been really deeply shocking. It’s part of the warp and weft of those young people’s lives.’ The reports come at the end of a two-year enquiry into child sex abuse. An earlier report, released last year, was criticised for failing to highlight the targeting of white girls by Pakistani men and other Asians.","Girls offer their bodies in exchange for alcohol, drugs or to pay off debt .

Keeping the Faith: Jon Bon Jovi is staying loyal to Bills owner Ralph Wilson and will not buy the team . Rock legend Jon Bon Jovi is not trying to be the next owner of the Buffalo Bills, he insists - despite wanting to own a football team. CBS Sports claimed the New Jersey rocker was among those jostling to be the team's second-ever owner after 95-year-old founder and owner Ralph Wilson. But the rocker's publicist Ken Sunshine said: 'The Bills are not for sale, and he has too much respect for Mr Wilson to engage in any discussions of buying the team.' He added Bon Jovi had 'a day job that's doing very well' and said: 'It's preposterous to say he's had any discussions with the Bills and Erie County.' Despite his advanced years Mr Wilson, a founding owner of the American Football League, refuses to give up ownership of team until his death. But he has famously ruled out the possibility of his family taking over the 54-year tenure when he is gone. Selling the Bills will take several years, as the franchise will be operated through a trust. Mr Sunshine did not deny Bon Jovi's interest in one day being an NFL owner - saying his client has made that no secret. Bon Jovi has developed relationships with several NFL power-brokers, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. He established an Arena Football team in Philadelphia in 2004 which he owned until 2009, when the AFL folded for one season. But Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz issued a statement saying he has had no discussions with Bon Jovi. The Bills also released a statement saying: 'The organization does not respond to reports of the interest other parties may have in ownership or of speculation concerning various groups that may have such interest.' Blaze of Glory: Jairus Byrd and Da'Norris Searcy during a victory last year in Orchard Park, New York . It's My Life! Bon Jovi insists he will buy an NFL team at his own pace after making friends with powerful NFL figures. His publicist added he already has a 'day job that's doing very well' - his global music career . Mr Sunshine also denied reports that Bon Jovi has ramped up an NFL search after the dismissal in April of his band's longtime lead guitarist, Richie Sambora. He said the guitarist was never fired and was instead dropping out of the band's world tour due to 'personal issues'. Mr Wilson, who lives in suburban Detroit, has already scaled back his control of the team. On January 1, Russ Brandon was promoted to the position of team president, giving him full control of the franchise's day-to-day operations. The team's short-term future in Buffalo was also secured in December, when the Bills signed a 10-year lease to continue playing at their Ralph Wilson Stadium. The $271 million deal locks the Bills in to playing at the stadium financially for at least seven years. Several groups have expressed interest in purchasing the Bills, including one led by Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly.","His name was raised by anonymous sources who spoke to CBS Sports .

Normally the preserve of designer boutiques, the waiting list has now made an appearance on the British high street with savvy shoppers paying homage to the quality of clothing. It would seem that the economic downturn has made cash-strapped shoppers look to ‘ordinary’ shops to bag the hottest finds. The latest ‘must have’ item can be found at your local M&S. M&S Collection Notch Lapel Oversized Duster Coat, part of Marks & Spencer’s Autumn collection, has had store phones nationwide ringing off the hook. The M&S Collection Duster Coat is a new season must-have and is selling  out fast across the country . The light pink coat priced at £85 is part of the new collection- the first under its new style director, Belinda Earl- which was launched back in May. The high street giant did not stage a catwalk show like many of its counterparts but merely releasing a few photographs of the item sparked a flurry of interest. The coat arrives in shops today, in the colour of the season, a dusky blush pink, and the Marble Arch store in London already has a list of 100 customers expecting to be called. Lauren Santo Domingo, the New York socialite and founder of modaoperandi.com, says ‘FOMO’ - fear of missing out- is behind the growth in waiting lists. She told a national newspaper: ‘Being able to secure those potentially impossible-to-find items in advance actually supersedes the hysteria associated with frenzied bricks-and-mortar shopping. ‘But the gratification of knowing you’ve already secured your dream wardrobe makes it all worth the wait.’ The £85 light pink coat is part of the first collection under new style director Belinda Earl .

A retired Minnesota carpenter, shown in a June investigation to be a former commander in a Nazi SS-led unit, ordered his men to attack a Polish village that was razed to the ground, according to newly uncovered testimony. The account of the massacre that killed dozens of women and children contradicts statements by the man's family that he was never at the scene of the 1944 bloodshed. In June, an AP investigation found that Michael Karkoc entered the U.S. in 1949 by failing to disclose to American authorities his role as a commander in the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, which is accused of torching villages and killing civilians in Poland. The investigation found that Karkoc was in the area of the massacres, but did not uncover evidence linking him directly to atrocities. Scroll down for video . New testimony: This 1982 photo provided by the University of Minnesota shows Nadia, left, and Michael, right, Karkoc. The Associated Press has uncovered testimony that says Michael Karkoc, a Minnesota man who was a Nazi SS-led company commander, ordered his men to attack a village that was razed to the ground in 1944, contradicting claims by the man's family that he was never at the scene of the civilian massacre . However, an investigative file originally from the Ukrainian intelligence agency's archive but unearthed and published this week by The Associated Press reveals that a private under Karkoc's command testified in 1968 that Karkoc ordered the assault on Chlaniow in retaliation for the slaying of an SS major. The major, slain by resistance fighters, led the Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, in which Karkoc was a company commander. A German roster of the unit confirms that Pvt. Ivan Sharko, a Ukrainian, served under Karkoc's command at the time. An initial order was given by a separate officer, Sharko testified, before Karkoc told his unit to attack the village. 'The command was given by one of the commanders to cordon off the village and prepare for battle,' Sharko said, according to the Russian-language investigative file, which bears the stamp of Ukraine's Volyn regional prosecutors' office. 'The commander of our company, Wolf, . also gave the command to cordon off the village and check all the . houses, and to find and punish the partisans.' Karkoc fought under the . wartime nom de guerre 'Wolf,' and he wrote a 1995 Ukrainian-language war . memoir under both his real name and the pseudonym 'Wolf.' According to the document, Sharko described how nobody was spared in the ferocious onslaught on Chlanow. Older: This May 22, 1990 photo shows Michael Karkoc in Lauderdale, Minnesota prior to a visit to Minnesota from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in early June of 1990 . Nazi: The June 3, 1944 photo provided by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Heinrich Himmler, SS Reichsfuehrer-SS, head of the Gestapo and the Waffen-SS, and Minister of the Interior of Nazi Germany from 1943 to 1945, center, reviews troops of the Galician SS-Volunteer Infantry Division . 'The legionaries surrounded the homes, set fire to them with matches, or with incendiary bullets, and they shot anyone who was found in the homes or anywhere in the streets,' Sharko said. 'Most of the houses were burned as a result of this action. How many people were killed in all, I don't know. I personally saw three corpses of peaceful inhabitants who had been killed.' The AP learned of the file's existence after its initial report and subsequently tracked down and reviewed its contents. Other eyewitness accounts, both from villagers and members of Karkoc's unit, corroborate the testimony that the company set buildings on fire and gunned down more than 40 men, women and children. Michael Karkoc continues to live quietly in Minneapolis as he has for decades. Karkoc's son and family spokesman, Andriy Karkos, has denied his 94-year-old father's involvement in the Chlaniow incident or any other possible war crime. Karkos, who spells his surname differently from his father, refused to comment on the Sharko testimony when reached by phone: 'Until and unless The Associated Press can provide their alleged evidence and their witness, we will not respond to your defamatory and slanderous allegation,' he said Friday. Sharko died in the 1980s. In July, weeks after Karkoc's . commanding role in the SS-led Legion was revealed, Karkos questioned the . statements from men in his father's unit and comments in his father's . memoir suggesting he was at the scene. He was cited by the Minneapolis . Star Tribune as saying his father told him he was not in Chlaniow when . the killings took place, and wrote in a letter to the same newspaper . that his father was no war criminal. 'There . is no record that Karkoc had a hand in any war crimes,' Karkos wrote. 'He did nothing wrong. He never lied. He's not afraid of the truth.' Army intel: This file undated reproduction shows a page of Michael Karkoc's 1949 U.S. Army intelligence file that The Associated Press had declassified by the U.S. National Archives in Maryland through a Freedom of Information Act request. Officials note in the document that Karkoc told them he performed no military service during the war; working for his father until 1944 and in a labor camp from 1944 to 45 . Village destroyed: This June 19, 2013 file photo, a woman stands near a mass grave and a monument in the village of Chlaniow, Poland, that holds the bodies of Poles killed in a 1944 attack on the village by the Nazi SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion. The Associated Press has uncovered testimony that says Michael Karkoc, a Minnesota man who was a Ukrainian Self Defense Legion company commander, ordered his men to attack the village . Stephen Paskey, who led Nazi investigations for nine years as a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations, said the Sharko testimony is highly credible and should bolster cases in Germany and Poland to launch prosecutions against Karkoc. He noted that Sharko did not appear to be in custody or under investigation at the time of his questioning, and that many of his statements are confirmed by historical documents. 'I see no reason to doubt that is what (Sharko) said and that it was said without any pressure,' said Paskey, now a law professor at the SUNY Buffalo Law School. 'And that's exactly the sort of thing that would help persuade a judge that it's credible — that there's other evidence to corroborate the other things that he said. ... There's no indication in the Soviet statement that the guy they were interviewing had a motive to lie.' Since the initial report, both German and Polish prosecutors have opened investigations into whether to charge Karkoc with war crimes, based on the fact he had 'command responsibility' for his unit when it committed massacres. Karkoc was a founding member of the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion and later an officer in the SS Galician Division. Germany has in recent years taken the position that people suspected of Nazi crimes must be prosecuted, no matter how old or infirm, as it did in the case of retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who died last year at age 91 while appealing his conviction as a guard at the Sobibor death camp. Thomas Will, who is deputy head of . Germany's special prosecutors' office that investigates Nazi crimes, . said he is working 'intensively' to conclude his probe as soon as . possible, especially in view of Karkoc's advanced age. Polish . prosecutors said their investigation was ongoing — and that they have . told the Foreign Ministry they need to ask 'the American side to . question (Karkoc) in the capacity of a suspect.' They referred further . queries to the ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment. Roster list: This undated reproduction provided by the Polish National Archive in Krakow, southern Poland, is a SS administrative file probably dated 1944 showing a roster list for the Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, identifying Michailo Karkoz as the top commander of II company . Home: In this June 14, 2013 file photo, people walk past the home in Minneapolis, where 94-year-old Michael Karkoc lives . The U.S. Department of Justice refused to comment on whether it had initiated its own investigation or was aiding the Polish investigation. 'The Department of Justice is aware of the allegations, which have been widely published,' spokesman Peter Carr wrote in an email. 'We generally do not confirm nor deny whether an individual is under investigation.' Even without the Sharko testimony there is a case against Karkoc from the evidence uncovered in the initial report, Paskey said. 'If he gave the order, there's no question he's guilty of war crimes,' Paskey said in a telephone interview. 'Even if he didn't give the order, as the commander in the area it was his responsibility — if he knew about it to stop it, and if he learned about it after to investigate it and punish those responsible. That's what command responsibility is.' Other soldiers who served under Karkoc back up Sharko's testimony about civilian killings: Vasyl Malazhenski, also a private, told Soviet investigators that in 1944 that unit was directed to 'liquidate all the residents' of Chlaniow — although he did not say who gave the order. Sharko also testified in the investigative documents that Karkoc's company was directly involved in a 'punitive mission' against Poles near the village of Sagryn in 1944. 'We were told that Poles had attacked the village of Sagryn and were killing Ukrainian families,' Sharko said. 'And that's why we had to defend the families of Ukrainians and take revenge against the Poles.' Sharko made his statements to authorities in Ukraine in 1967 and 1968 for an investigation they were conducting against the Self Defense Legion. The documents noted he was living at the time in the village of Vorchin in Ukraine. Local official Oleksandr Petrovich said Sharko had been a resident, and died in the mid-1980s. Many of Sharko's statements are backed up by other evidence and historical fact, giving weight to the overall testimony, said University of Ottawa professor Ivan Katchanovski, a Ukrainian-born political scientist who has done extensive research on the Self Defense Legion. 'I analyzed several hundred such Soviet-era investigative cases for my academic research projects,' he said. 'Based on this research and direct or indirect corroboration of information from the Sharko's testimony by other sources — including the Karkoc memoirs, his testimony concerning the Legion, massacres that it committed, and the involvement of Michael Karkoc in the specific massacre — looks credible.'","Retired Minnesota carpenter, Michael Karkoc, was shown in a June investigation to be a former commander in a Nazi SS-led unit .
