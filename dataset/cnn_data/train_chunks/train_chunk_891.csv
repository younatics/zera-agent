A female jail worker accused of sexual misconduct was arrested on Wednesday in Washington County, Oregon. Jill Curry, 38,  was charged with six counts of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and six counts of first-degree official misconduct, Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt Bob Ray told the Oregonian. Sgt Ray did not elaborate to say which inmate Curry reportedly had contact with or at which jail. However, according to the statute, the charge involves engaging in sexual acts with someone in custody. 'While there's a presumption of innocence in our justice system, this employee is accused of extremely serious misconduct,' said Sheriff Pat Garrett in a statement. 'If the allegations are found to be true then this employee completely violated my trust and the public's trust and will be dealt with swiftly and appropriately.' The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. The caller has not been identified by authorities. Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. After her arrest, Curry was booked into the Washington County Jail and held on $120,000 bond.","Jill Curry was arrested on Wednesday and charged for having sexual contact with an inmate .

"By . Ashley Collman . Prince George is one cute baby, but apparently not cherubic enough to make it on the cover of People without a little photoshopping. The young royal is the coverboy of this week's magazine in honor of his first birthday, and the staff chose to use a picture taken while he was touring Australia earlier this year.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A historic hilltop town in Sicily has put 20 empty properties on the market for just one euro each in a bid to attract new investment to the area. Local authorities in Gangi are offering the properties for just 80p as many lie derelict after being bequeathed to locals who cannot afford to renovate them. The only catch is that buyers have to pay a €5,000 (£3,970) guarantee to ensure that they will refurbish the homes, with some estimated at needing around €35,000 (£28,000) worth of improvements. Scroll down for video . The 20 properties, on the market for just one euro, are available in the Sicilian town of Gangi, pictured, which has Mount Etna as its backdrop . They will also have to pay the €6,000 (£4,760) legal costs associated with purchasing the property. The initiative to encourage people to buy the homes was launched a few years ago, but is now starting to receive interest thanks to English speaking property consultant Marie Webster. Ms Webster who lives in Sicily is now marketing the homes to foreigners. She told the Local: 'They want foreigners to come in and take over the properties, because there isn’t much work around here so people are moving away. It’s a beautiful project. Many of the homes up for sale in Gangi lie derelict and it is estimated 35,000 euros worth of repairs would be needed on each one . 'You need to have someone to fix the roof, the floors, the sewage and water. These more difficult things would cost around €35,000, then the rest you can do yourself and have a house that’s completely like new.' It is thought that there has been interest in the properties from British, Swedish and American buyers with some of the homes already being snapped up by an Italian businessman. The town of Gangi is described as being in central Sicily set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields with Mount Etna as its backdrop. The town of Gangi is described as being in central Sicily set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields and is 50 miles south-east of Palermo . The initiative is similar to a plan launched in nearby Salemi, where houses overlooking the Mediterranean were also put up for sale for one euro. Many of the properties there were barely standing, and in dire need of renovation, following a destructive earthquake in 1968. Owners were to be given two years to restore the house in keeping with its original character.","Homes in town of Gangi are being offered for the equivalent of just 80p each .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Associated Press . Hong Minh Truong, who is accused of sending more than 500 hoax letters containing white powder to schools and government offices around the U.S. A Texas man accused of sending more than 500 hoax letters over a six year period containing a white powder to government buildings in the U.S. and around the world has been arrested. Hong Minh Truong, from Rowlett near Dallas, was detained on Monday and made an initial appearance in Dallas Federal Court after he was charged in a criminal complaint with false information and hoaxes. It is alleged he sent more than 500 hoax letters with terrorism threats that contained the powder, which recipients may have thought was anthrax, to schools, government offices and day care centers. In addition he is accused of mailing letters to cities across the U.S. and to American embassies abroad. More recently some of the letters were sent to hotels in the vicinity of this year's Superbowl, which was held at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. It is alleged that the 66-year-old sent 15 batches of letters containing the hoax threats from the Dallas area starting in 2008 and in all but two batches, the powder was sent too. According to Fox News, in one letter, he is accused of writing that he would hijack a plane at Dallas Love Field airport to hit the NASA Center or the Empire State Building. One of the letters from May 2012 contained the statement: 'Al Qaeda back! Special thing for you. 'What the hell where are you Scooby Doo, Counter Intelligence, CIA, you do not know how to catch the triple dealer spy in your law enforcement. What the hell where are you Scooby Doo, Internal Affairs, FBI, you don't know how to arrest the bad cop in your law enforcement. 'You all flaming idiot, ignorant and arrogant, know nothing! How to protect this country! U.S.A . 'We are Al Qaeda, U.B.L FBI, Al Qaeda, SS Nazi FBI, working in your agency. We claim everything.' In one of the letters, it is alleged Truong said he would hijack a plane at Dallas Love Field airport and hit the Nasa Center or Empire State Building . Investigators focused on Truong after an IP address associated with him was identified after 28 public schools in Boston received letters in June 2013, according to the complaint. It is thought Truong was then tracked to a post office in the town of Garland, after it was found he had used the same type of envelopes, same style of writing in the letters and positioned the stamp in the same place. In a statement Diego Rodriguez, special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas office said: 'While it was determined that the mailings did not contains toxins or poisons, each incident required a field screening of the letter's contents, which cost taxpayers dollars and diverted first responder resources.' More recently some of the letters were sent to hotels in the vicinity of this year's Superbowl, which was held at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, pictured . A judge ordered that Truong should be held in custody until a detention hearing on August 4. His attorney did not immediately return a message on Monday. If he is convicted he could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.","Hong Minh Truong accused of sending more than 500 hoax letters .

But now Mr Blanc has changed his mind as people are being priced out of buying organic produce. He told the Times: 'It has shot itself in the foot by creating a movement that has become elitist by being so expensive.'

And earlier this month, amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables, the government stressed that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic. Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said: ‘It can be difficult balancing a family budget, but in providing a varied, balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower-priced, conventional products.’","Chef says organic produce is too expensive and is now preserve of well-off .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Angelo Fernandez, who is facing child abuse charges after his three-year-old son wandered off in the middle of the night . A father is facing charges of child abuse after his three-year-old son was found wandering the streets in the early hours of the morning. The little boy was only found in Longmont, Colarado when he turned up on the doorstep of a house ten blocks away and was spotted by 12-year-old Rocklynn Moldonado. The police were called and started to track down his parents, but it is alleged when officers knocked on the door of his father, Angelo Fernandez, he refused to answer and wouldn't go and collect the boy. It is thought the toddler had wandered off from his home around 2.30 am on Friday morning and walked ten blocks by himself, wearing no shirt or shoes, just a pair of shorts. It wasn't until Miss Moldonado heard a jiggling noise at the front door that she went to investigate and heard a voice at the other side. She then found the boy, who was asking where his father was and crying. It then took Longmont Police several hours to identify the boy and in turn track down his father Mr Fernandez. After he allegedly refused to answer the door or collect his son, he eventually went to the police station. But Mr Fernandez refutes the police's version of events saying he was the one that called them to report his son missing. The boy wandered ten blocks to this street in Longmont, Colardo where he was found by by 12-year-old Rocklynn Moldonado . He told 7News Denver: 'I woke up and found my son had unlocked the door and left in the middle of the night while we were sleeping . 'I took off, running around looking for him.'

"By . Jennifer Newton . Stephen Quinnell, 33, who was jailed for four years after he targeted a child through online video game Call of Duty . A judge has issued a warning to parents after a paedophile was jailed for using the popular computer game Call of Duty to target a child. Stephen Quinnell, 33, used the best-selling online Xbox game to get in touch with a young boy and encourage him to perform sex acts. Today Judge Christopher Prince imposed a four-year extended prison sentence on Quinnell before issuing a warning to parents arising from what he called a 'sexual pre-occupation with young boys.' Judge Prince said: 'One hopes this will alert parents to the dangers of children gaming online.' Durham Crown Court was told that Quinnell befriended a young competitor in a shared online game of Call of Duty. Quinnell, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, was said to have introduced himself to other players as, ‘Steve, a 34-year-old actor from Chester-le-Street’. Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said after other players left the game, Quinnell exchanged details with the boy and asked him to make contact via the live messaging network Skype. Mr Bennett said over the course of five subsequent Skype link-ups, Quinnell turned the conversation onto sexual matters, culminating in him claiming to have performed a sex act on himself, before urging the boy to follow suit in front of his web camera. The horrified youngster immediately switched his computer off, but later told another player what had taken place. He was urged to inform his parents, which the boy did, and his shocked mother reported Quinnell’s actions to their local police force in the south-west of England. Mr Bennett said based on the description and details given by the victim, the Durham force were informed and visited Quinnell’s home in Chester-le-Street, on May 1. He was arrested and his computer and gaming equipment were seized. Quinnell admitted taking part in the online game, but denied trying to coerce the boy into performing a sex act. But, at an earlier hearing, he admitted causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Referring to Quinnell’s offending history, Mr Bennett told the court: 'It’s evident he has a long-term sexual interest in young children, starting with a caution in 2001 for indecent assault.' Quinnell used the Xbox game Call of Duty, pictured, to target his young victim online and exchange Skype details with him . He said this was followed by several appearances for downloading indecent images of children, for which he was jailed for 24 weeks in August 2009, having flouted previous restrictions from obtaining such material on the internet. Mr Bennett said the latest offence was in breach of a sexual offences prevention order and suspended prison sentence imposed at Newcastle Crown Court, in January, also for downloading indecent child images. Brian Hegarty, defending, said the latest offence did not go beyond incitement, as the boy did not actually engage in any sexual activity. He added that the game itself has an age rating of 18, and Quinnell initially contacted an adult inquiring if he could join the online game. Judge Prince jailed Quinnell, made him subject of a further sexual offences prevention order, and ordered confiscation of the seized computer and gaming equipment. Quinnell, who is subject to an extended sentence, will not be released until he has served two-thirds of the four-year period and will then remain on licence for a further five years. Mr Bennett told the court there were no barriers to anyone joining such games, enabling them to communicate with potentially very young players.","Stephen Quinnell, 33, used the popular online game to target a young boy .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A German amputee long jumper has been left out of the country's squad for the European Athletics Championships after claims his prosthesis gives him an unfair advantage. Paralympic champion Markus Rehm won the long jump at the German national trials last weekend with an effort of 8.24 metres, which would normally have meant qualification for the championships in Zurich next month. But the German athletics federation, known as the DLV, dropped him from the team, saying his leg prosthesis gave him an unfair 'catapult effect', which means he can make longer jumps. Scroll down for video... Paralympic long jump champion Markus Rehm, who has been left out of the German squad for the European Championships despite winning the national trials . The German athletics federation, known as the DLV, dropped him from the team, saying his leg prosthesis gave him an unfair 'catapult effect' DLV president Clemens Prokop said there was a 'significant difference' between jumps with a blade-like prosthesis and natural jumps in the run-up and lift-off. 'There is significant doubt that jumps with a leg prosthesis and a natural joint are comparable,' Mr Prokop explained. He also added that biometric measurements conducted at the nationals in Ulm showed that Rehm's prosthesis also showed he was faster by a second per meter at take-off. Mr Rehm, who has his right leg amputated below the knee after a wakeboarding accident, said it was a pity and disappointing that he wasn't selected and had considered appealing against the decision. Mr Rehm, who has his right leg amputated below the knee, said it was a pity and disappointing that he wasn't selected . But he confirmed today that he would not be contesting the decision because he wanted to respect the other athletes. The case has parallels to that of Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee South African runner who went to court to win the right to compete in the 2012 London Olympics. Pistorius, who is currently on trial for murder after fatally shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, waged a four-year battle to win eligibility to compete in the Olympics. The International Association of Athletics Federations banned him from running in its events on grounds that his carbon-fibre blades gave him an unfair advantage. But he won a court case in 2008 that allowed him to compete and he ran in the 400 metres and 4x400 metres relay at the 2011 World Championships and 2012 London Games. Oscar Pistorius, pictured, also went to court so he could compete at the London 2012 Olympics after it was ruled his prosthesis give him an unfair advantage . The German federation of disabled sport said the decision on Mr Rehm was a 'step backward' in efforts to bring equality between disabled and able-bodied athletes. Karl Quade said: 'I wish the DLV had been more courageous. 'I am not sure you can draw a valid conclusion that Markus Rehm had an advantage. While Alfons Hoermann, president of the German Olympic Committee, explained it was a difficult decision for the athletics federation. 'It's a bitter personal disappointment for Markus Rehm. He made history last weekend with his outstanding performance,' Mr Hoermann said. Current European long jump champion Christian Reif and former European champion Sebastian Bayer, were selected ahead of Mr Rehm along with Julian Howard.","Markus Rehm won the long jump at the German national athletics trials .

"By . Simon Murphy . The Highways Agency is imposing emergency speed limits on pothole-riddled roads rather than repairing them. Temporary speed limit signs have appeared alongside miles of badly damaged carriageway. In some places signs and bollards have been there for weeks, but there is no evidence of repair work taking place. Damage: Some roads have had their speed limits reduced to limit the impact of potholes (file photo) The RAC alerted its patrols to the trend last week after it emerged that miles of the M11  in Essex have been subject to a reduced speed limit because of surface damage. A RAC spokesman said: ‘This is a first from our point of view. We need to get it stopped.’ Last summer, the Highways Agency, which is responsible for motorways and trunk roads, introduced ‘less prescriptive’ road maintenance contracts. Responsibility for maintaining major roads is split into 14 areas managed by private firms, and their contracts allow more flexibility in dealing with repairs. But it is feared the move will lead to a lower quality of road maintenance. Shadow Transport Minister Jim Fitzpatrick said: ‘Reduced speed limits add to congestion and to the frustration of the motoring public, who want to see the roads in a decent state of repair.’ Slow: The measure means it is not necessary to repair damaged roads (file photo) The harsh winter is blamed for causing roads to become especially damaged this year. At the same time, Government departments have been ordered to make cut-backs. The Highways Agency said last night it had invested £420 million in road improvements last year.  A spokesman added: ‘We have always carried out repairs where they are most needed and we will continue to do this.’ Britain’s councils, who look after smaller roads, are facing a £10.5 billion backlog of pothole repairs after a harsh winter. Local authorities warn that road networks could be ‘brought to their knees’ by more bad weather. Other roads with stretches subject to long-term restrictions include the westbound A12 in Essex between Ingatestone and Brentwood and the A11 south between Attleborough and Thetford in Norfolk.","Temporary speed limit signs appear on damaged roads across Britain .

"By . Ben Endley . Richard Hammond (pictured) raved about the Porsche 911 GT3, saying it was 'so good, I had to buy one myself' Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond is being warned not to use his brand new Porsche after two of the limited edition £100,000 sports cars mysteriously burst into flames. Hammond, 44, is known for his love of all things Porsche but is among the 100 British  911 GT3 owners who have been warned not to drive their supercars by the German manufacturer. Hammond, nicknamed 'Hamster', recently wrote of his love for the GT3, saying it was 'so good, I had to buy one myself'. But just a few weeks after he made the comments Porsche has put a halt on deliveries and recommended owners of the 196mph cars stop driving them. The shock move comes after two of the European sports cars caught fire without explanation - prompting James May and Jeremy Clarkson to ridicule their mate, who had just taken delivery of his car. Porsche has now released a statement about the potential issue with its flagship 911. A spokesman said: 'Porsche is informing the owners of the affected vehicles directly and recommending that they stop using their vehicles. 'The company is offering to pick up the vehicles and take them to a Porsche Centre immediately. 'Safety is the number one priority at Porsche, and the company takes its responsibility seriously.' Hammond is one of around 100 Brits left without their cars while an investigation into the model takes place, although the presenter does have a garage full of other supercars to choose from. Two of the limited edition £100,000 sports cars have mysteriously burst into flames since the car was released . A Porsche official said: 'Safety is a number one priority at Porsche, and the company takes its responsibility seriously' The Porsche 911 GT3 can go from 0-62mph in just 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 196mph . When the pint-sized presenter road-tested the Porsche 911 GT3 he said 'there are no bad points about this car'. However, two models have since burst into flames on the continent. But Porsche are not the only manufacturer to experience this kind of trouble. In 2010 Ferrari were forced to recall almost 1,250 of its 458 Italias after a number of the supercars caught fire. The Porsche 911 GT3 was unveiled last year and to buy it new costs £100,540 including VAT. It has a manual six-speed gearbox and is powered by a 3.8-litre flat six engine developing 475bhp. The Porsche can go from 0-62mph in just 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 196mph. It is four-and-a-half metres long and 1.9 metres wide . It also gets a surprisingly efficient 23 miles to the gallon meaning with a standard 16.9 gallon tank it could go 388 miles between fuel stops. The 911 GT3 will also lap the legendary . Nurburgring in less than 7 minutes 30 seconds.","Hammond, 44, described the 911 GT3 as 'so good, I had to buy one myself'

"By . Damien Gayle . Plans to raise the motorway speed limit to 80mph have been consigned to the slow lane amid fears it may alienate women voters and increase risks on the road. The policy was launched with a fanfare in 2011 by then transport secretary Philip Hammond, who claimed the 70mph limit had been 'discredited' and a rise to 80mph would boost the economy. But Patrick McLoughlin, who now fills the Cabinet post, says the move is no longer a priority. Cars whizz along the M25: A plan to increase the motorway speed limit to 80mph, first mooted just two years ago, has been ditched over fears it would increase risks on the road and alienate women voters . The decision will anger many drivers who, polling shows, mostly want higher speeds, but it has already been welcomed by road safety groups and environmental campaigners. In an interview with The Times today, Mr McLoughlin said the plan had been ditched. 'Look, that's not a priority, to be absolutely honest,' he said. 'You would have to do trials in certain areas so it's not something that's a high priority.' A source close to the Transport Secretary told the newspaper: 'This is not going to happen with Patrick McLoughlin as Transport Secretary. 'Safety is paramount to him and his view of how to run the roads and he would not be confident about how you would do it.' The Prime Minister's inner circle is . said to fear that an increase in the speed limit could alienate women . voters. Polls have shown a majority of drivers would support the move, . but significant numbers of women were against it. Mr . Hammond had originally announced the plan at the 2011 Tory party . conference, saying the 70mph limit had resulted in millions of motorists . routinely breaking the law, undermining the principle of policing by . consent. 'Safety is paramount to him': Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who said the plan to increase the limit was 'not a priority' He said: 'The limit was introduced way back in 1965 - when the typical family car was a Ford Anglia.' He claimed a rise to 80mph would 'restore the legitimacy' of the system and benefit the economy by 'hundreds of millions of pounds'. Former roads minister Mike Penning last May said he would set up trials for the higher speed limit on parts of the motorway network, and only last week Stephen Hammond, his successor, told a motoring forum the plan was still alive. The RAC said it was disappointed with the decision to drop the speed limit increase. Motoring groups had argued that 80mph is a safe speed in a modern car, providing drivers leave enough room between vehicles. But last year campaign groups estimated that raising the motorway speed limit to 80mph would cost society an extra £1billion a year, including £766million in fuel bills and more than £62million in health costs. The groups, which include road safety charity Brake, the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and Greenpeace, also estimated that the higher limit would lead to 25 extra deaths and 100 serious injuries a year, as well as 2.2 million more tonnes of carbon emissions. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'The real stumbling block is likely to have been enforcement. 'Police already tend to give speeding drivers some leeway, so it was quite feasible that an 80 mph limit would have actually meant 90 mph in practice and that proved a step too far for ministers.' Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: 'The chaos over plans to change motorway speed limits is extraordinary, even by the Department for Transport's usual standards. 'Only a week after the Roads Minister confidently claimed that trials of a new 80mph speed limit were to go ahead, it's clear that the Secretary of State has applied the brakes on his own reckless policy. 'Labour has consistently warned that a blanket increase in the motorway speed limit risked increasing deaths and serious injuries, pushing up the cost of driving and making it harder to cut the emissions that contribute to climate change. 'The ending of all Government funding for road safety and speed cameras, while slashing the numbers of road traffic police, meant there was no realistic prospect of any increase being credibly enforced. 'Ministers should now end the confusion they have created and clearly rule out any increase in speed limits in this parliament.'","Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the plan is 'not a priority'

"By . Mail Foreign Service . A murderer who killed a toddler during a row with her mother over a parking space in China has lost an appeal against a death sentence. Han Lei was sentenced to death in September after the incident in which he confronted the two-year-old child's . mother in a car park in Beijing, claiming that her shopping . trolley was in his way. During the altercation in July, he beat the woman to the ground, snatched the child from her buggy and raised her above his head before throwing her on the floor. Sentenced to death: Han Lei is handcuffed after a Beijing court convicted him of the murder of a two-year-old girl . She was severely injured and died in hospital several days after the incident. This morning the Higher People's Court in Beijing upheld the sentence, rejecting the killer's appeal. The 39-year-old had claimed to be drunk and said that he believed he was only throwing a trolley to the floor when he originally went on trial at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court. 'At that time I didn't know . it was a baby carriage. I thought because the woman had just been . shopping that it was a shopping cart,' he said. He used that argument to try and get his charge of intentional homicide reduced to involuntary homicide which only carries a sentence of between three and seven years instead of a mandatory life sentence. Chinese media had reported after the original verdict that Han, who had been released from prison less than a year before, was so wracked by guilt that he had actually asked to be executed. He had been in jail for stealing a car, an offence for which he was given a life sentence in 1996. However, the term was later commuted and he was released. A second man, Li Ming, who drove Han away . from the scene, was sentenced to five years in prison for hiding the . suspect at the original trial.","Han Lei was sentenced to death after a trial in Beijing in September .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Hate preacher Abu Hamza is demanding that he is moved to a softer prison hospital for care . Hook-handed hate preacher Abu Hamza has demanded to be moved from a US top-security jail because officials have refused his request for a bidet in his cell. The terror suspect claims he is not being kept in the conditions that were agreed as part of his extradition from the UK. Hamza, who lost both hands and an eye fighting the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s, had his metal hook taken away by prison officials in  New York when he arrived there in October last year. The Muslim cleric’s plea for a bidet  to be installed in his cell was refused, with a judge retorting that jail ‘is  not a hotel’. Now Hamza, born Mustafa Mostafa in Egypt 55 years ago, claims the stumps of his arms have become infected. His lawyers say he can only get the proper medical treatment he needs at a specialist facility and want him moved from the Metropolitan Correction Centre in Lower Manhattan, where he is being held to await trial next year. Lawyer Lindsay Lewis said: ‘The United Kingdom was promised that Mr Mostafa would be provided a certain level of accommodation as a condition of his extradition to the United States.’ She told a federal judge in New York that he needs treatment at a medical centre for his infected stumps. Miss Lewis requested a transfer to the Devens Prison Medical Centre in Massachusetts – where surviving Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was treated for injuries received during a shootout earlier this year. Hamza was extradited to the US after . waging an eight-year battle that is estimated to have cost UK taxpayers . more than £2million. Hooked-handed: The Egyptian-born preacher, pictured here left in 2007, lost his hands and left after . mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan . He . was wanted in America on suspicion of participating in hostage-taking in . Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an . Australian. Hamza is . also charged with providing material support to the Al Qaeda network by . trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organise . support for the Taliban in Afghanistan. His . taxpayer-funded lawyers tried to block the extradition on health . grounds, claiming Hamza would be held in inhumane conditions. After . a British court approved the extradition, Hamza appealed to the . European Court of Human Rights, which delayed his removal until October . 2012. Hamza used to use a metal hook on his right hand but US prison authorities confiscated it, saying it was a security risk. His . lawyers complained that this meant he could take food only through a . straw and as a compromise a special prosthetic hand was made that was a . cross between a spoon and fork. The lawyers also requested the bidet in . his cell. The radical Islamist cleric is facing U.S. terrorism charges after finally been extradited from Britain after an eight-year legal battle last year and is being held in Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan . When they complained to the court about his treatment, District Judge Katherine Forrest told Hamza that jail ‘is not a hotel’. The cleric is due to stand trial in April and faces life imprisonment if convicted. Hamza’s . hate-filled sermons in London earned him such notoriety that French . spies were said to have hatched a plot to assassinate or kidnap him amid . fears he would incite Algerian terrorists to attack the 1998 World Cup . in France.

Egypt's deposed president today claimed he was the country's legitimate leader in a defiant court appearance after four months in secret detention. Mohammed Morsi, 62, was flown in by helicopter to the Cairo police academy compound where the trial was being held before being transferred to the courtroom by minibus. He rejected the court's authority to try him and claimed that those that overthrew him should be on trial instead. On trial: Mohammed Morsi stands in the cage in a Cairo courtroom after being flown in from the secret detention centre where he has been held for four months . Anger: Fourteen other members of the Muslim Brotherhood are on trial with Morsi. While he wore a suit, they were clad in white prison uniform . The trial was then adjourned until Jan. 8 after several interruptions. If convicted, Morsi and 14 other defendants could face the death penalty. The country's first freely elected president has been held at an undisclosed location since the military ousted him in a coup on July 3. Looking healthy, he appeared in court wearing a dark blue suit, but no tie. He had refused to wear a prison uniform as the judge had ordered, according to security officials. Morsi and 14 co-defendants, prominent figures from his Muslim Brotherhood, face charges of inciting the killing of protesters who massed outside the presidential palace in December, demanding he call off a referendum on a new constitution drafted by his Islamist allies. Brotherhood members attacked a sit-in by the protesters, sparking clashes that left 10 people dead. The longtime Brotherhood leader rejected the proceedings and said he had been forced to attend.

Strong words: 'I am the president of the republic and I am here against my will,' he said . 'I am the president of the republic and I am here against my will,' he said. 'What is happening here is providing cover for the military coup,' he said, as his co-defendants chanted 'down, down with military coup.' Monday's raucous session reflected the highly charged atmosphere of a nation deeply polarised between Morsi's Islamist supporters, and the military-backed administration and moderate Egyptians who support it. The start of the hearing was delayed by nearly two hours over what the officials said was a dispute over Morsi's refusal to wear a prison uniform, part of his rejection of the trial's legitimacy. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. The judge, Ahmed Sabry Youssef, had to adjourn the hearing twice because the chants disrupted the proceedings. The proceedings were adjourned until January 8 to allow defence lawyers to review documents, the court's secretary said. Defense lawyers said the judge has ruled that they have access to their clients in prison. It . was not immediately clear where Morsi was taken after the adjournment.

"By . Eleanor Harding . Author Helen Fielding admitted that she suffered many of the same misfortunes as her creation Bridget Jones . She created one of one of the most calamity-hit heroines of contemporary fiction. Now Helen Fielding has revealed that she is more like Bridget Jones than she would care to admit, and is constantly getting herself into embarrassing scrapes. Whether it’s melting her kettle, sending round-robin emails by mistake or accidentally stealing petrol, the author admitted her day-to-day life is not too dissimilar to that of her scatter-brained heroine. Speaking at the Hay Festival in Wales yesterday, Fielding, 56, said ‘things seem to happen’ to her despite being a world-famous novelist. She said: ‘I have always denied it but think actually maybe there are some things in common.’ She recounted one incident in which she received a call from her agent saying that a policeman had called and asked if she was the owner of a Peugeot 308. ‘It turns out that I had driven away from a petrol station without paying for the petrol,’ she said. ‘There was some criminal charge going on.’ In another, she accidentally left a kettle on a hob and came back to find it melting and giving off ‘acrid smoke’. She said although she was ‘very disorganised’, she kept a file of the messes she had got herself into which could provide inspiration for her novels. She said: ‘It started when I had my daughter, and I was having her via C-section. So I decided to do a birth announcement, saying what she was going to be called, when she was going to be born and so on. ‘So I prepared this email to send to everyone before I went into hospital. But then I accidentally pressed “send all”. ‘So then I had to then say, “sorry, I haven’t actually had the baby.” So then when I did have the baby I thought, “I can’t send another one.” It all got into a terrible mess.’ Ms Fielding has written three novels featuring Bridget Jones who was played by Texan actress Renee Zellweger, pictured . She also admitted that, like her heroine Bridget, who is always chopping and changing outfits, she worried what to wear for to speak for the event. ‘I worried a lot about whether it was OK to wear these boots,’ she said. ‘I was infected with the concept of effortless festival chic. This morning I was very confused about what to wear.’ Fielding, whose novel Bridget Jones's Diary and the sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason were published in the 1990s, said she hoped the stories had helped single women feel more comfortable about themselves. The books, which were both made into films starring Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth, tell the story of a single girl in her 30s and her quest for happiness in love, life and work. She hit out at the idea that when a woman comes ‘of a certain age’ they were expected to ‘fade away and say, “never mind me”.’ ‘The truth is, that we do not actually really change,’ she said. ‘That mentalness and that sense of hope and joy and the ability to be childish and  be silly and keep exploring life and keep having adventures and keep having sex and keep seeing what’s round the corner is part of being a person, a woman.’ She added: ‘Life is for living. We live longer, and especially women, we should carry on and give ourselves a new identity. Especially thirty-something women, don’t think of themselves as tragic barren spinsters now. They are not Miss Haversham.’ She also lamented the fact that societal expectations were so high for women to be perfect in every aspect of their lives. She said: ‘The bar now is so high in terms of what we’re supposed to be like. In terms of what we’re supposed to look like, what we’re supposed to wear, what we’re supposed to be like as parents, and what we are supposed to have achieved professionally.’ ‘I think it’s huge and it’s really sad. If Bridget has done anything to change that, and make people think it’s alright to muck up, it’s alright not to be perfect, it’s alright to be fat, it’s alright to sometimes say the wrong thing, as long as you’re kind and you can laugh along with your friends.’ She said that the problem was so ingrained that it was filtering down to children. She added: ‘I’ve yet to meet a woman who does not obsess about her weight. There might be some, but I think we’ve looked at too many airbrushed pictures. ‘With the children aged seven saying “I’m fat,”, it’s really difficult.’ Fielding, from West Yorkshire, started her career as a newspaper journalist and Bridget Jones's Diary began its life as an anonymous column in The Independent in 1995. Her latest novel, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, tells the story of Bridget as an older woman who is widowed and decides to get on the dating scene again. Fielding said she thought most people were meeting online now rather than in person, adding: ‘It’s no longer a sign of desperation.’","Helen Fielding admitted her life was quite similar to that of Bridget Jones .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Faced with two young children desperate for the lavatory during a visit to the opticians, Avril Tye discreetly asked if they could nip to the loo. But staff at Specsavers recommended she leave the premises or risk the children wetting themselves – because using the staff toilet was impossible for ‘health and safety reasons’. Mrs Tye, 43, took her three children – Bethan, eight, Lottie, seven, and William, four – to her local Specsavers in Hertford last Monday. Avril Tye, with her children Bethan, left, Lottie, right and William, centre. Both Bethan and William wanted to use the toilet in Specsavers but were told they weren't allowed . Having come straight from school, Bethan and William complained they needed the toilet. But the staff suggested Mrs Tye take the youngsters down the road to Starbucks to relieve themselves instead. Mrs Tye, a writer, said: ‘It sounded so incredible. I said to them, “surely you can bend the rules for a child?” It was bonkers.’ As the branch was running late for Bethan’s eye appointment, Mrs Tye thought there would be no problem in letting the pair use the toilet. She said: ‘I asked the girl on the desk, but she said they only had the staff toilet and customers couldn’t use them. ‘She then asked an older woman, who was very matter of fact and said no. She was quite curt. ‘I sat down again for another five minutes, and by this time Bethan was feeling quite uncomfortable and embarrassed. The family were in the Hertford branch of Specsavers so Bethan, pictured, could attend an appointment, when the incident occurred . ‘I knew that if little William wet himself there would be tears. We didn’t have any spare clothes for him, so I was wondering what I was going to do. ‘It’s a very uncomfortable situation to put a mum with three children in to.’ As Bethan went in for her eye test, Mrs Tye became desperate and called the Specsavers press department in head office on her mobile phone. She told them she was sitting in one of their branches and that staff had banned her children from going to the toilet. She said: ‘I asked them whether it really was their corporate policy to force me to leave my child behind and run the other two down the road. ‘He stuttered a bit and then said there may be boxes in the corridor which posed a Health and Safety risk and that was why. ‘I told him they were putting health and safety above children’s needs, and then he said he would call the shop. ’Five minutes later, the store manager emerged, having spoken to head office. ‘She confirmed that for health and safety reasons, she was unable to let customers use the staff toilets,’ Mrs Tye said. ‘She asked me whether I would take legal responsibility for the children if she made an exception, and I just burst out laughing at the absurdity of the situation.’ At this point, the two children were allowed to relieve themselves and head outside after their ordeal. Mrs Tye said: ‘At 8 years old, Bethan would have been mortified to wet herself and William would be sobbing. ‘I honestly think the whole episode was crazy, given the store prides itself on being family friendly. The Specsavers store in Hertford, where Mrs Tye's children were only allowed to use the toilet if he took 'legal responsibility' for her children . ‘This was a store full of female staff, all presumably mothers and yet they didn’t have the common sense to let young children go into the back and use the toilet.’ A Specsavers spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for any inconvenience caused to Avril and her children. ‘The health and safety of our customers is always at the forefront of our minds. The store does not have a designated customer toilet. ‘The only staff toilet has access issues as it is located off the shop floor. Under the circumstances a decision was made to let the customers use the toilet at their own risk.’","Avril Tye was at Specsavers for an appointment for daughter Bethan .

"By . Eleanor Harding . TV presenter Davina McCall is endorsing the new cards created by British company Osper . Children as young as eight are being offered celebrity-endorsed Mastercards to use in shops, online or at cash machines. The cards, created by British company Osper, can be topped up by parents with the child’s monthly allowance so they can spend it at will. Banks already issue debit cards to anyone over the age of 11, but it is thought this is the first time younger children will be able to use them. TV presenter Davina McCall is endorsing the prepaid debit card on her website, after it was launched last week. Osper, which is backed by MasterCard, said it aimed to help children learn how to manage their finances at an early age. But critics questioned whether the cards were simply grooming children into becoming ‘mini consumers’. Parents can open an account for their child through the Osper app, prompting an orange chip-and-pin card to be sent under the child’s name. They can then activate the account by making a lump sum transfer or setting up a regular direct debit from their own bank account. Children can only spend what is already in the account, as there is no overdraft facility. The app allows parents to review what has been spent, while children can log in to check their balance and request emergency transfers. The card can also be locked via the app if it is lost or stolen, blocking all purchases. The service is free for the first year and then costs £10 per year thereafter. McCall said in a video: ‘There’s something about the app and the way it works and how simple it is that just feels safe. ‘To me, that’s really important as a mother. It’s teaching me to relax a bit when it comes to finances and my children.’ British company Osper, backed by Mastercard, produces the debit cards for kids . But one critic wrote on an online forum: ‘My under 12s find it very hard to grasp the value of cold hard cash. When their total stash after a birthday comes to £100, they can’t appreciate that it would take many hours’ work to earn that in a typical Saturday job. ‘I can’t think that making cash something invisible would improve things. It would be even less tangible to them.’ Another wrote: ‘Religion works on the principle of ‘get ‘em while they’re young’. Consumerism is the new religion so I guess debit cards for children was inevitable.’ The Osper card follows another prepaid card aimed at children called goHenry, which works in a similar way and allows parents to set controls. There are also a variety of other prepaid cards aimed at teenagers, such as the MeCard, also a Mastercard. Many British banks require youngsters to be 11 years old to receive a debit card, with some setting a minimum age of 16. In 2008, it emerged Lloyds was sending children as young as 11 Visa-enabled debit cards without the knowledge of their parents. It was feared children may begin using them to buy cigarettes, drugs and X-rated videos over the internet. But both Osper and goHenry have pre-programmed restrictions preventing youngsters from using their prepaid cards to buy adult items. Osper have been contacted for comment.","Children as young as eight offered Mastercards to use in shops or online .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Kirsty Wark described her meteoric rise through the BBC in a talk at Hay Festival in Wales yesterday . She is one of the best-known faces of the BBC. But Kirsty Wark has joked she might not be where she is today were it not for the corporation’s positive discrimination policy. The Newsnight presenter attributed her meteoric rise to ‘luck’ during her appearance at the Hay Festival in Wales yesterday. She said her career path had corresponded with the different diversity drives of television bosses. She said: ‘I rose through waves. When I went into graduate entry in 1976, they were looking for more women. And so I was a researcher and a producer. ‘Then when I looked for promotion, they needed to get more women into senior positions in production. ‘Then when I was presenting in Scotland, they needed more women on the telly. Then it was about being representative and needing more Scottish women on the telly. ‘And now we need more older women. So I think it’s been more luck than anything else.’ Dumfries-born Wark, 59, went straight to the BBC after graduating from Edinburgh University, beginning with BBC Radio Scotland. She worked on Scottish and English television until 1993, when she joined the Newsnight team. She said that she had only ever been bullied at work once - as a young researcher - and that it had been by a woman. Giving advice to young girls entering the industry now, she said they should be ‘confident’ in themselves and ‘seek out mentors.’ In a wide-ranging interview, Wark also expressed concern that teenagers were being exposed to derogatory portayals of women. She added that the internet had made it easier for those who want to put women down through ‘trolling’ on social media. The 59-year-old was promoted when the corporation was looking for more women in senior positions, she said . ‘Women still seem to be in the firing line,’ she said. It’s really sad for young women. I want women to feel comfortable about being on the web and on the streets.’ She said she longed for internet browsers to display signs urging people to respect their fellow users. She said: ‘You wouldn’t go up to someone in the street and attack them, one hopes. ‘We don’t have a moral code with which to navigate the web.’ During the talk, Wark also lamented that the break-up of the church and its effect on the elderly. When I joined they needed more women. Then more senior women. Then Scottish women. Now they need more older women... I've been lucky. She said: ‘Whenever one thinks about religion, one thinks of community. ‘That I think now is breaking now. There’s a real problem with loneliness and isolation. I don’t think we yet know how to replace the threads that bind people through churches. ‘I was brought up in the church and I’m not religious but I see the value in that.’ She also said that society needed to address the growing issue of the number of people with dementia. ‘We don’t know how to cope with the fact that we are living longer,’ she said. ‘We need to get our minds to live longer. I don’t know if that’s something we can control. ‘I know that friends are frantically trying to get people to take someone who has Alzheimer’s. There aren’t enough places and actually is that [a home] the best place for someone with Alzheimer’s? I don’t think it is.’ Wark, who presents Newsnight, was talking about her first book, The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle.","Kirsty Wark joined BBC in 1976 they were looking to recruit women .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Secret: Mary Berry lives on a diet of toast and soup - and contestants' cakes - to stay slim, she revealed . She stays slim despite eating her way through several contestants’ cakes, pies and biscuits on the Great British Bake Off. Now Mary Berry has revealed the secret of her enviable figure – she eats nothing but a single piece of toast for breakfast. The TV judge said she also limits herself to a bowl of soup at lunch, leaving her enough room for all the sweet treats she samples on the BBC baking programme. ‘I have been large in my time,’ she said. ‘I know that if I were really quite big, people would look at me and say, “That’s  what happens when you eat a  lot of cake”. ‘I’m very disciplined. I make myself eat one piece of toast for breakfast. When I’m doing Bake Off, I eat soup for lunch. ‘I know what puts on weight for me, its just over-indulgence. ‘It’s a case of grasping the  mettle. I know it’s difficult. It’s about everything in moderation. And a small bit of cake.’ The veteran baker made her comments yesterday during an appearance at the Hay Festival in Wales. She admitted that despite being an accomplished cook, she often indulges in quick-fix food. ‘There are times when I don’t want to cook,’ she said. ‘When I come home from Bake Off, my husband opens the door and we have scrambled eggs.’ Miss Berry also confessed that she sometimes uses ready-made pastry when cooking at home as she would ‘rather play tennis’ than spend time slaving over it. The 79-year-old revealed that she feels ‘terribly guilty’ for working when her children were young. When she was a young cookery star, she said she ‘didn’t have the confidence’ to take time off but felt sad she was not there for the school run. The 79-year-old, who presents the show with Paul Hollywood, said she has been larger before . Asked how she kept going despite having a family, she added: ‘I had a passion for what I do. I have a husband who supports me. I had a mother’s help. ‘There wasn’t maternity leave like there is now … I didn’t have the confidence to think that I could have a year off and they would have me back again. ‘I couldn’t have done it without Paul being there to do the  school run.’","Great British Bake Off judge samples sweet treats for a living .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Successful: Emma Bridgewater's designs adorn the homes of middle-class families across the UK . Her distinctive designs adorn the homes of middle-class families across the country. But Emma Bridgewater admits that her own family paid the price for that success. The 53-year-old, famous for her polka dot patterns, said she felt ‘guilty’ at having to make her pottery business work while bringing up a young family. The stress of running her factory in Stoke-on-Trent eventually became too much and she handed over the reins to her husband Matthew Rice six years ago. Bridgewater, who is worth an estimated £14million, started her business in 1985 after spotting a niche in the market when she could not find a mug she liked to give to her mother. But as her success grew, she had that feeling ‘that when you’re at home you feel guilty about work and when you’re at work you feel guilty about home’. She . said: ‘It was insane. My mother was quite sure that it wasn’t right . that we all went to work when our babies were tiny, she thought we all . should be at home looking after them. ‘Why we’ve done this to ourselves, I don’t know. Except, I am proud of Stoke, and the factory and the company. ‘When I finally said to my husband, “I think you might have to run the company for a bit”, he said: “why did you wait so long?” She added that she felt it ‘quite harsh’ to have to hand over the reins to her husband, but then found a new love of writing books. Bridgewater, from Oxford, made her comments during an appearance at the Hay Festival in Wales yesterday. Guilt: But the 53-year-old admits that her own family paid the price for that success. Above, Bridgewater is pictured with her daughters Kitty (right), Elizabeth (centre) and baby Margaret in 1997 . Her new . book, Toast & Marmalade and Other Stories, is a memoir which . recounts the home counties upbringing which inspired her work. Her designs, she said, were modelled on her mother’s china, which ‘never matched’ but each piece had a special value of its own. But in 1991, her mother Charlotte had a horse riding accident while hunting at the age of just 52, and never recovered from the brain damage. Bridgewater said: ‘It was awful. It did make a big catastrophic hole in our lives. Family: Bridgewater, who is worth an estimated £14million, started her business in 1985 after spotting a niche in the market. Above, Bridgewater, her husband Matthew Rice and their daughter, Elizabeth . ‘Her horse fell on the road and she snacked her head. Extraordinarily she died several times. ‘Although . it was a bad outlook they went ahead and operated. She was in a coma for . three months and when she came around she was speechless. ‘But she lived another 22 years in a very strange, shadowy version. Not with us at all.’ But although looking after her infirm . mother was difficult and heart-breaking, Bridgewater said it . ‘spurred her on’ in her career. She added: ‘I think it’s been quite inspiring. People say that sadness is a spur. And I felt very angry about it – and I feel that it’s probably fired me along the motorway. Store: As her success grew, Bridgewater had that feeling 'that when you're at home you feel guilty about work and when you're at work you feel guilty about home'. Above, the businesswoman at her pop-up store in London . ‘She died . in December. We had the most fantastic funeral for her. All the bad . stuff went away and she came rushing back. I was terrified that people . would forget what she’d been like. ‘It was a joyful relief that her troubles were over.’ Bridgewater said she hoped her . company could become an inspiration for others and that the British . manufacturing industry could be ‘revived’. Memoir: Bridgewater's new book, Toast & Marmalade and Other Stories, recounts the home counties upbringing which inspired her work . She said she ‘wasn’t prepared’ for the ‘wasteland’ she found in Stoke when she decided to bring an old Victorian factory back into life to manufacture her designs. She added: ‘I can’t understand the idea that we might lose touch with our manufacturing. ‘We can’t do without making. We have lost confidence in ourselves. We are not happy about emblazoning “made in Britain” on things.’ She added that it was ‘jolly annoying’ that students in art schools were creating ‘installations to titillate Charles Saatchi’ rather than learning how to make practical products. And she also bemoaned the breaking up of the polytechnic system, which she said may be linked to the current unemployment crisis. Bridgewater has three shops in London, and one in Edinburgh, as well as an outlet located at the company’s factory in Stoke-on-Trent. Her designs are sold by both John Lewis and Fortnum & Mason. In 2012, she launched a collection of Royal commemorative ware to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Her eldest daughter Elizabeth, 24, is training in circus skills at Giffords, and Kitty, 23, is studying illustration in London.

"Comes in week two teenagers stabbed to death in London in 48-hour period . By . Jack Doyle . and Eleanor Harding . and Inderdeep Bains . Lord Chief Justice John Thomas said knife carrying was 'commonplace' among 'very young children' who were members of criminal gangs and called for an urgent review of jail terms . The country’s most senior judge last night launched an impassioned plea for longer jail terms for knife yobs. Lord Chief Justice John Thomas said knife carrying was ‘commonplace’ among ‘very young children’ who were members of criminal gangs and called for an urgent review of jail terms. His comments came in a week in which two teenagers were stabbed to death in London in a 48-hour period. His comments also reignited the political row over knife sentencing which exploded last week when it emerged Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was blocking Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s plans for automatic prison sentences for offenders caught twice with a knife. Supporters of reform seized on the judge’s comments yesterday, saying they reinforced the need for a new approach. Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in England and Wales, made his comments to a committee of Peers in the House of Lords. He told the House of Lords Constitution Committee there was ‘one area where I am concerned that we have a proper and objective look at youth sentencing’. He said: ‘There is obviously a really serious problem in relation to knives. The carrying of knives has become commonplace in gangs and with children who are very young. ‘And it’s easy to have a reaction to that. I think we need to look very, very carefully at the best way of using the various levels of sentencing to control the use of knives. I think this is something which is urgently required. ‘We’ve been extraordinarily successful in this country in controlling the use of guns, but knives, particularly knives carried by 12, 13, 14-year-olds, is a major problem.’ He added: ‘This is a problem which is very, very serious, which is rightly a real concern.’ Tory MPs welcomed the comments. Nick de Bois, who has tabled a Commons amendment in an effort to change the law said: ‘They suggest to me that the courts recognise that we haven’t got sentencing right on many levels in relation to knife crime.’ ‘For many people going to court for carrying a knife is just an occupational hazard, and in too many cases cautions, fines and slaps on the wrist are being given out.’ His comments also reignited the political row over knife sentencing which exploded last week when it emerged Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was blocking Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's plans for automatic prison sentences for offenders caught twice with a knife . Despite the law being changed in 2012 to target knife thugs, many still escape a jail term. Ministry of Justice figures show that in the year to December 231 yobs aged 10-17 caught with a knife escaped a jail term despite being caught with a knife on more than one occasion. The vast majority received community sentences, and 12 walked away with nothing but a reprimand or warning. A separate, tougher law for those caught brandishing a knife has a higher custody rate. Under this law anyone aged 16 or 17 should get a minimum term of four months but there is no minimum sentence for under 16s. A-level student Alim Uddin, 17, was beaten and stabbed to death in Brixton following a row over a second-hand bike. It was one of two fatal stabbings within 24 hours in the capital . The judge’s comments come after a spate of violent deaths in London. Jamil Palmer, 18, became the second young man stabbed to death in the capital in just 48 hours when he was stabbed walking through a park with a friend in the middle of Tuesday afternoon. Yesterday a mother of four Tara Thornley, 42, told yesterday how she tried to save his life while walking her nine-year-old son home from school in Feltham. She said: ‘I left my boy on the path and fought my way through some nettles and saw a boy lying down and covered in blood. ‘As a mother I felt so bad for him and I think I’ll have nightmares about this for ever. I couldn’t even tell how long I was with him, I was in a haze. I’ll never forget the look in his eyes. It was empty. I knew he was dying.’ The attack happened less than 48 hours after A-level student Alim Uddin, 17, was beaten and stabbed to death in Brixton following a row over a second-hand bike. He was killed trying to collect a second-hand bicycle he had bought for £90. A 16-year-old boy was due to appear before magistrates in Camberwell today charged with his murder. His mother Parool said: ‘Our children are being killed and nothing is being done. They are dying like dogs.’ Last week the Mail revealed senior Lib Dems were blocking a crackdown proposed by the Tories, only days after teacher Ann Maguire was stabbed to death in her classroom. In one letter to Mr Clegg, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander insists jailing more offenders caught with blades would be too expensive. The plans were drawn up by Mr Grayling to ensure offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed. Tory MPs now hope to force the change through with help from Labour even in the face of Lib Dem opposition. Aminur Nadir Khan, 20, Mashudur Rahman, 22, and Ali Akbar Choudhury, 20, were told they will serve a minimum of 23 years for stabbing 16-year-old Ajmol Alom. The teenager was days away from receiving his GCSE results when he was attacked near his home in Poplar, east London, last August. Sentencing his three attackers at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, Judge Martyn Zeidman said knives led to 400 deaths in the year to March last year. He added: ‘This knife madness must end. There has to be a change. But cold figures can never sufficiently reflect the tragic sorrow caused by knife crime.’","Lord Chief Justice John Thomas: 'Knife carrying is commonplace in children'

"She said Archer then reneged on a promise to pay for her legal bills . By . Eleanor Harding . For the past 14 years she has refused to have anything to do with him. But now the frostiness between Jeffrey Archer and his ex-mistress Sally Farmiloe may have finally begun to thaw after they met for the first time since the catastrophic end to their affair. They were photographed side by side after bumping into each other at an awards ceremony last week. The frostiness between Jeffrey Archer and his ex-mistress Sally Farmiloe may have finally begun to thaw after they met for the first time since the catastrophic end to their affair . Behind her smile, however, it is clear Miss Farmiloe, 64, who has terminal cancer, still harbours some resentment towards the disgraced peer, complaining that during their meeting he showed ‘no regret’ for her problems. She is said to have been furious with him after he allegedly failed to support her when their affair was revealed. The pair, who met through fundraising work for the Tory Party, began seeing each other in 1996 behind the back of Archer’s wife Mary, but in 1999 a newspaper exposed them. Miss Farmiloe said Archer then reneged on a promise to pay for her legal bills when she sued the paper for libel in 2000. The following year he was jailed for four years for perjury after lying to a court about his dealings with prostitute Monica Coghlan. Archer was recently reported to have made derogatory comments about Miss Farmiloe as she lay critically ill in hospital. She was diagnosed with secondary bone and liver cancer last year and wears a wig because of the intensive chemotherapy. The pair, who met through fundraising work for the Tory Party, began seeing each other in 1996 behind the back of Archer's wife Mary, but in 1999 a newspaper exposed them . She has been gravely ill, and told in March how doctors had issued her with a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ order without consulting her family. It was that same month that friends told her Archer had made ‘callous’ remarks about her to a Times journalist. The journalist wrote that he had been ‘shocked’ by the comments, and Archer had asked for them not to be printed. Miss Farmiloe said she was still ‘fuming’ about the article when she saw Archer last week. She added: ‘He said not one word of regret that I had suffered so much from cancer. All he wanted to talk about was his new book.’ Commenting on the article, she said: ‘[It was] presumably because he thought I was dying and would not see it. Wrong gal, pal! I intend to live with cancer, not die from it.’ Mrs Farmiloe said Archer then reneged on a promise to pay for her legal bills when she sued the paper for libel in 2000 . Miss Farmiloe, whose  husband Jeremy, 60, is a surveyor, is now said to be feeling better and has defied her grave prognosis by appearing at a series of glamorous events. Last Thursday she wore a glittering red gown and tiara for an event at a London hotel where Archer was handing out awards to City high achievers. Friends said she knew he would be there and decided to front him up. One source said: ‘She didn’t confront him about what he said. He just wanted to talk about his book. ‘But she wanted to show him she’s still here, alive and fighting. She wanted him to know he hadn’t got away with it. ‘I’m surprised she didn’t hit him over the head with a plant pot. She has been so furious with him over the years.’ But Miss Farmiloe said: ‘I decided to forgive him because anger exacerbates cancer and we had some nice pictures taken together. Jeffrey was looking extremely well. I would say he is living the good life.'","Archer and ex-mistress Sally Farmiloe bumped into each other at awards .

"By . Eleanor Harding . If you're feeling a little over the hill these days, take some advice from Dame Joan Bakewell. The veteran broadcaster has said the twilight years can be some of the best in your life – and at 81, she should know. Her passionate defence of old age came during a talk at the Hay Festival to discuss the role of the elderly in society. Dame Joan Bakewell has said the twilight years can be some of the best in your life . She said: ‘You gain many things. You give up the things that you disliked. You don't have to worry about your shape or your fashion. ‘You give up ambition – it's too late. You're never going to run the show or storm Broadway or lead an army. It’s just too late. Give up feeling competitive. Let someone else win the race. They're going to anyway. 'Time is running out but it can be a good time right until the very end.' Dame Joan was appointed DBE in 2008 and made a Labour life peer as Baroness Bakewell in 2010, said elderly people needed to feel that they still had a role in society. She said the worst aspect of getting older was ‘losing a sense of purpose’ after giving up work and children have ‘flown the nest’. She called it ‘the most awful sense of deprivation’ but said pensioners needed to find new activities and interests to keep themselves busy. The former Late Night Line-Up presenter has been a passionate campaigner on age issues and was appointed the Government’s ‘tsar’ for the elderly in 2008. She said: ‘Old age is a different country. It feels quite different. I'm on the frontier of old age and I know it’s a different place from where I used to live. 'There's loss. I deal with loss daily. I dread opening the papers because they contain obituaries about my friends. You lose your friends. You lose your relations. My sister, six years younger, died. ‘I'm always at memorial services. They're the new party, by the way. They're very jolly events because you celebrate somebody's life.' Joan Bakewell listens entranced to Malcolm Muggeridge, the sage of Robertsbridge . She added: 'I'm not one of them theorising about what it’s like to be old because I know. ‘I've got hearing aids, I've got glasses and I'm likely to have a hip before too long. 'I'm going through the stages that people go through when they're ageing. That's happening to me. 'There's no doubt that the apprehension felt by the young about being old is that you're nudging your way to death. And death is a terror that still haunts us.’ Dame Joan was speaking alongside economist Nicholas Stern and social policy scholar Alan Walker about how to deal with an ageing population. Mr Walker, who has researched the topic in detail, said more needed be done to encourage people to live healthier lives so that they could keep active after retirement age.","Passionate defence of old age during talk at Hay Festival .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Seven-spot Ladybird Beetle, feeding on pollen from a cherry flower, now believed to be a more amazing creature than previously thought . They may be smaller than the size of your fingertip. But when it comes to ladybirds, size is no barrier to might, according to new scientific research. Experts have discovered the insects can reach the same speed as a racehorse and fly at altitudes close to the height of Ben Nevis. For the first time, a detailed study has shown the creatures travelling at heights in excess of 3,600ft and reaching speeds of 37mph. Researchers also examined the stamina of the insects and found that they were able to remain in the air for up to two hours. Up until now, scientists believed that anything over seven foot was a long-distance flight for a ladybird - but the new data shows they can actually travel up to 74 miles in a single flight. The study of the common or garden ladybird was undertaken using a monitoring device at Rothamsted Research, an agricultural research institution based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. It involved an analysis of data recorded over more than a decade of two species, the seven-spot and the invasive harlequin. Dr Lori Lawson Handley, from the . University of Hull, who led the study, said: 'When we saw them in the . flight cubes, we could barely keep up with them. They were so incredibly . quick. They are very active, fast fliers and are built to fly very . well.' The recording equipment used by researchers sends radar signals vertically, in a cone shape, to an altitude of almost 5,000ft. The harlequin ladybird is one of the most numerous types, along with the seven-spot ladybird, and both share their incredible traits . It is able to detect the direction of flight, speed and altitude, of all objects that pass through this airspace. It can also detect the size and shape of each item, which allowed the team to tell which were ladybirds. While most ladybirds were detected at lower altitudes, between 500ft and 1,600ft, the highest recorded were at around 3,600ft. The research, published in the journal PLoS ONE, also found the average speed recorded was 20mph, although some flew at almost double this speed. The fastest ladybirds were seen at the greatest heights, where they were able to take more advantage of stronger wind speeds. The monitoring equipment was not able to establish to what extent their flying speed was 'wind assisted'. However, high velocities were also observed in a second strand of the research, which involved studying the insects' flight in a Perspex box in a laboratory. Average flight time was found to be around 37 minutes, but to the surprise of researchers, they could remain airborne for up to two hours. Dr Lawson Handley told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We were expecting them to go for about 15 minutes. It means that if they are flying at their maximum speed of 37mph for two hours, they can cover 74 miles. Whether they are doing that in the field, we don't know. They have that capability. This is another side of ladybirds people don't see.'","New research reveals tiny bugs don't care about their size .

Moulded, comfortable sandals have already been showcased on catwalks and cheaper versions are now appearing on the high street. Isabel Marant's Holden sandal, retailing at a cool £280, is said to the holy grail of footwear this summer . For those with the money, the holy grail of sensible shoes is said to be Isabel Marant's Holden sandal, retailing at a cool £280. With their flat brown sole and two wide strips of padded leather, they may look fairly unremarkable. But demand is now so high that many stores have sold out - with opportunists selling them on eBay for as much as £380. Helen Attwood, shoe buyer at Selfridges, told The Times: 'It's the shoe of this season. 'It sold out in black and brown as soon as it arrived in store and that was before the sun started shining.' Ida Petersson, of Net-A-Porter, added: 'We unveiled them in December and they had sold out in the US almost immediately and everywhere else within weeks.' Phoebe Philo at Céline reinvented the classic Birkenstock-style sandal 18 months ago . Fashion experts say the trend for flat, 'ugly' shoes began when Phoebe Philo at Céline reinvented the classic Birkenstock-style sandal 18 months ago. Birkenstocks, which have a contoured sole, were first manufactured in Germany in 1964 and then later in California. They became popular all over the world because of their orthopaedic benefits, especially with those working on their feet all day. Recently, demand for the classic sandal soared after being championed by presenter Alexa Chung, and model Stella Tennant. Hannah Rochell, the features editor at InStyle magazine, said: 'The Isabel Marant Holden sandals are basically Birkenstocks for die-hard fashionistas that can't quite bring themselves to wear actual Birkenstocks.' For those on a budget, Sole Trader is selling Birkenstock Relax sandals in black for only £27.99.","Moulded, comfortable sandals are now appearing on the high street .

"By . Eleanor Harding . A boy of two hooked up to a drip was left lying across two plastic hospital chairs for six hours. Callum Giles was denied a bed as he fought a blood infection because of chronic shortages at Southampton General Hospital. His distraught parents John and Marie pleaded with nurses as their son writhed in pain but were repeatedly put off and told there was no room. Two-year-old Callum Giles was left lying across two plastic chairs at Southampton General Hospital for six hours because there were no free beds . Callum's furious parents claim that medical staff refused to let him use a spare camp-bed because it had no sides - and they feared he may roll off . In desperation, they suggested using . one of the camp beds which the hospital keeps for parents to sleep on – . only to be told it was against health and safety rules. Callum was forced to lie sweating in his nappy, comforted only by a blanket and pillow his parents had brought from home. Yesterday . Mr and Mrs Giles demanded an apology from hospital bosses and branded . the care they received ‘absolutely appalling’. Their son is just one of . countless patients across the country who have been left lying in . waiting rooms and corridors due to bed shortages in the NHS. Mr . Giles, 34, said: ‘It was awful. Callum’s temperature was sky high. All . he wanted to do was sleep but he couldn’t because the chairs were so . uncomfortable. I could tell that he was in pain. He was writhing around, . and the chairs were so sticky and hot. It’s horrible to see your child . like that. I felt so sorry for him.’ Callum, . from Southampton, first fell ill more than a week ago, when he had a . high temperature and sleeping problems, and lost his appetite. The toddler's mother Marie said she was told by nurses to sit on the blue chairs until a proper bed became available. She became so frustrated after making repeated requests for a bed that she ended up creating a makeshift one herself with the two chairs . Callum's father John, said: 'To be left lying across two plastic chairs in this day and age is unacceptable. The poor lad was so hot he was sticking to the plastic and found it incredibly uncomfortable. He was restless and unable to sleep' After six hours of waiting on the chairs, Callum was finally given a bed at 10.30pm and was discharged the next afternoon. He has been given antibiotics and is making a good recovery . Hospital . doctors tested Callum on Monday of last week and wrongly diagnosed him . with a viral infection, sending him home with instructions to give him . painkillers. Callum’s . condition worsened and at lunchtime on Friday he was taken to hospital . with a temperature of 41.3C (106.3F). Tests showed such dangerously high . levels of bacteria in his blood that doctors prescribed the highest . dose of antibiotics available, administered via a drip. The . two-year-old was given a bed in the emergency department but when he . was wheeled to a children’s assessment ward at 4.30pm he was made to sit . in a chair and wait. Mrs . Giles, 29, a childcare worker, was told he would be kept in hospital . overnight because his condition was so serious but a bed had not yet . become available. She said: . ‘Several times I asked if Callum could have a bed, but nothing happened. Even the consultant who came in to talk to us did not question the . situation. There was no blanket offered, nothing. Callum was swept to . the side as if he was just another number. It’s disgraceful.’ Her . husband added: ‘My wife … got so frustrated in the end that she pushed . two chairs together and laid him down.  His condition was bad. Blood . infections can be fatal if they are not treated.’ Last year it emerged that 40 per cent of people waited for more than four hours to be seen at the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (Southampton General is pictured) When . Mr Giles, a security officer, arrived at 9.30pm he suggested to staff . that they use one of the hospital camp beds for Callum. But, incredibly, . they said that would be dangerous and against hospital policy as the . bed had no sides and the boy might roll out. Callum . was eventually given a bed at 10.30pm and was sent home the following . afternoon. He is continuing on his course of antibiotics and is expected . to make a full recovery. But . his parents, who have six other children, have made an official . complaint to the hospital. Mr Giles said: ‘The care we received at the . hospital was absolutely appalling. To be left lying across two plastic . chairs in this day and age is unacceptable. ‘And to say that lying on a camp bed would be against health and safety is ridiculous – surely it’s more safe than a chair.’ He added: ‘We want to make sure that other people don’t suffer in the same way. It should be about putting patients first.’ Southampton General Hospital was criticised 18 months ago by the Care Quality Commission for a lack of staff and resources. A . hospital spokesman said yesterday: ‘While we are sorry to hear Mr and . Mrs Giles are unhappy with the care their son received, these issues had . not previously been raised with us and we are not familiar with the . accounts presented through  the media.’ He . added that the hospital would be happy to ‘discuss any aspect of . Callum’s treatment with his parents’ and ‘investigate any remaining . concerns’.","Callum Giles, 2, was battling a blood infection and hooked up to a drip .

"By . Eleanor Harding . It’s a problem which many parents are all too familiar with. You put your child to bed at a reasonable time – only to discover later that they have secretly stayed up playing on the internet. But that may soon be a thing of the past after inventors unveiled a new set of bedroom ‘spy’ tools to help parents keep an eye on their children. Watchful: Children secretly staying up to play on the Internet could become a thing of the past thanks to new bedroom spy tools allowing parents to see if their children are on the web, and turn it off remotely . Hi-tech: The system, developed by technology company Qualcomm, uses their AllJoyn system to link devices in a home via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . The system can alert parents in other rooms when children are using the internet, and allows them to shut it down in the child’s bedroom using their smartphone. From the comfort of their sofa, they can even activate a ‘talking teddy bear’ on the child’s bed to tell them: ‘you should be in bed’. The system also allows them to dim the lights remotely and switch off music. Developed by technology company Qualcomm, it uses their AllJoyn system to link devices in a home via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. A spokesman said: ‘Parents can receive notifications to their smartphone, television or any other smart device. ‘If you’re watching TV with your wife and your child is doing something on the internet, you can have a notification sent to the TV. Warning: From the comfort of their sofa, parents can even activate a talking teddy bear on the child¿s bed to tell them: 'you should be in bed' ‘It might say “Bobby is watching YouTube or playing Minecraft when he should be sleeping”. ‘Then it’s up to the parent what to do. It’s not an automated system in that sense, the technology is not going to parent the child on its own.’ The system was showcased this week at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona as part of the company’s SmartHome vision. It works by connecting a parent’s smartphone to electronic devices in the child’s bedroom – including the lights, stereo system, teddy bear, computer and ‘smart’ internet router. In order to work, the router would be fitted with an application which allows it to know which internet applications are running on it. After the child has been put to bed, the parent’s smartphone can pick up an alert from the router which tells them that the internet is being used in his or her room. At the touch of a button, the parent can in theory then send a command to the router to stop the activity. They can also turn off other devices remotely which are connected to the smartphone. The system also allows for devices to activate in sequence, meaning parents can remotely ‘wake up’ a child or put them to bed. Using AllJoyn, the sounding of the digital alarm clock in the morning can trigger lights to turn on and for a talking teddy to say ‘wake up’. Commands can be issued via tablet, computer and smartphone – or they can be programmed to activate automatically at a certain time. The SmartHome project aims to showcase the different potential uses for AllJoyn, with many manufacturers already incorporating it into their products. The teddy used in the home was a concept device, but similar smart teddies are already on sale, such as Teddy the Guardian from London-based IDX Labs. Developers stressed that the signals between devices are transmitted locally through the home network, rather than an external one. Other designs included a smoke alarm which communicates with television in another room to display a fire alert. There were also lights that flash when the fridge door is left open and an air conditioning system which can be controlled by smartphone. Qualcomm is working with dozens of manufacturers to promote a concept known as ‘the internet of everything’, meaning the connection of different aspects of the home and the community.","Parents can activate a talking teddy to tell children they should be in bed .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Secret police surveillance of the family of Stephen Lawrence has proved our democracy is ‘unaccountable’, a leading barrister has said. Michael Mansfield QC said police spying was ‘out of control’ and warned that other families may also have been targeted by undercover officers. The lawyer, who has supported Doreen Lawrence in her fight for justice, spoke out during a Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust lecture on undercover policing sponsored by the Daily Mail. 'Out of control': Michael Mansfield QC (left) said secret police surveillance of the family of Stephen Lawrence proved our democracy is 'unaccountable' Earlier this month, it was revealed that Doreen and her husband Neville were spied on by Scotland Yard in the aftermath of their son’s death. Mr Mansfield said last night: ‘It’s out of control. The fact that it has happened for such a long time is just a manifestation of the extraordinarily unaccountable nature of our so-called democracy.’ The spying, uncovered in a report by Mark Ellison QC, went on during the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen’s death. Mr Mansfield added: ‘This is another example of how the British state have managed its affairs when they’re so quick to criticise everyone else.' Spying: Earlier this month, it was revealed that Doreen and her husband Neville were spied on by Scotland Yard in the aftermath of their son's death . Under fire: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs yesterday he would immediately look into claims failed to act on death threats made against Doreen Lawrence . He said: ‘Without Doreen’s stamina and persistence alongside the fourth estate and along the big estate - that’s you - your support throughout has meant everything to her. The lecture, titled ‘Undercover Police and the Secret State’, was held at the TUC Congress House in Central London.

"By . Mike Larkin . and Sara Nathan . Fuming Gary Oldman has urged people to 'get over' the Hollywood 'outcast' Mel Gibson's notorious racist rants - insisting: 'I think political correctness is c**p'. The Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes star says Mel is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets - claiming: 'We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me.' Speaking in an explosive new interview with Playboy, the 56-year-old comes to the defence of both Mel and Alec Baldwin as he said people are 'hypocrites' for not forgiving the pair's transgressions. Scroll down for video . Angry: Gary Oldman says people should 'get over' Hollywood outcast Mel Gibson's infamous rants . When asked about the Braveheart star's treatment, he said: 'I just think political correctness is c**p. That's what I think about it. 'I think it's like, take a f***ing joke. Get over it.' Gibson, 58, made . anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested for suspected drink-driving in . Malibu in 2006, two years after his film The Passion Of The Christ was . criticised for depicting Jews negatively. According . to the police report, Gibson made anti-Semitic remarks to the arresting . officer, saying: 'F****** Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the . wars in the world.' He has since apologised for his 'despicable' behavior, explaining that the comments were 'blurted out in a moment of insanity'. And in the wide-ranging interview in Playboy's July/August double issue out on Friday that covers Gary's 'wild nights' with groupies and his four marriages, the actor - whose new movie Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is out next month - says: 'I don't know about Mel. He got drunk and said a few things, but we've all said those things. 'We're all f***ing hypocrites. That's what I think about it. 'The policeman who arrested him has never used the word n***** or that f***ing Jew? 'I'm being brutally honest here. It's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy. 'Or maybe I should just strike that and say ""the N word"" and ""the F word,"" although there are two F words now.' 'He's alright': Gary claimed 'everyone' has used racial slurs like Mel Gibson and should forgive him . Mel returned to the headlines in 2010 accused of battery of his then-partner Oksana Grigorieva, following the release of an audio recording where the actor apparently threatened to wrap a bat around his ex-girlfriend's head, used racist slurs and appeared to admit to having punched her twice. His friend Gary, who has also starred in Dracula, also backed 'good guy' Alec Baldwin, despite his past homophobic remarks. He . said: 'Alec calling someone an F-A-G in the street while he's pissed . off coming out of his building because they won't leave him alone. I . don't blame him. So they persecute. 'Mel . Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing . because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and . doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough. 'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know? 'But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That f***ing kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me.' Notorious: Mel Gibson has been an Hollywood outcast since his infamous drink-driving arrest in Malibu in 2006 . 'We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That’s what gets me. It’s just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone, that we all stand on this thing going, “Isn’t that shocking?”' After . then jokingly saying, 'f*** the Pope,' the True Romance actor admitted . the interview had taken a fateful turn, and insisted he was not 'a . bigot.' Working . class Londoner Gary, who is the son of a welder, said: 'No, but I’m defending . all the wrong people. I’m saying Mel’s all right, Alec’s a good guy. 'Good guy': The Dracula star said he understands why Alec Baldwin  has used homophobic slurs in the past . 'So how do I come across? Angry? It’s dishonesty that frustrates me most. 'I can’t bear double standards. It gets under my skin more than anything.' He then claimed certain comedians are allowed to say racist and homophobic things under the guise of satire, while he would get slammed. The father-of-three claimed: 'Well, if I called ( Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives) Nancy Pelosi a c*** — and I’ll go one better, a f***ing useless c**— I can’t really say that. Foul-mouthed: Gary also controversially said Nacny Pelosi is 'a c***' and said 'f*** the Pope' 'But Bill Maher and Jon Stewart can, and nobody’s going to stop them from working because of it. 'Bill Maher could call someone a fag and get away with it. He said to Seth MacFarlane this year, “I thought you were going to do the Oscars again. Instead they got a lesbian.” 'He can say something like that. Is that more or less offensive than Alec Baldwin saying to someone in the street, “You fag”? I don’t get it.' The actor, who only ever received one Oscar nomination despite a career of acclaimed turns, took a bitter swipe at the way members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vote - as he also called the Golden Globes a 'meaningless event'. Gary was finally nominated for a best actor in 2011 for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, but lost out to The Artist's Jean Dujardin . He said: 'At the Oscars, if you didn’t vote for 12 Years a Slave you were a racist. Disappointment: He was finally nominated for a best actor in 2011 for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but lost out . 'You have to be very careful about what you say. I do have particular views and opinions that most of this town doesn’t share, but it’s not like I’m a fascist or a racist. There’s nothing like that in my history.' The London born star, who now lives in Los Angeles with fourth wife Alexandra Edenborough, insisted he was a libertarian in his political views, and added, 'you don’t come out and talk about these things, for obvious reasons.' And he claimed his independent nature and his refusal to work on the political side of fame had cost him the movie world's most prestigious prize. He said: 'What people don’t realize is that you need to work at being a celebrity. 'I’m not talking about movies. I mean the other side of it. 'You have to campaign. It’s a whole other part of your career, and I wish I could have navigated it a bit better. 'I may have an Oscar now, had I.'","Brit star Oldman says 'We're all f***ing hypocrites'

"By . Sara Nathan . Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will move to California to be with his bride, actress Cheryl Hines, following their wedding next month, it's claimed. The couple, who will tie the knot at the Kennedy compound on Hyannis Port, Mass, on August 2, have had an offer accepted on a $5 million property in the celebrity enclave of Malibu, MailOnline has learned. And this is Bobby's way of showing his commitment to Cheryl after it was claimed he had a two-year affair with Connecticut socialite Chelsea Kirwan. Moving to Malibu: Despite allegations that RFK Jr cheated on Cheryl Hines with socialite Chelsea Kirwan, the couple - pictured in the Hamptons on July 4 - still plan to wed on August 2 . Close: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cheryl Hines share a kiss ahead of their marriage . Chelsea, 42, will face her estranged husband, surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan, in court in Connecticut next Tuesday as he battles to gain more access to their three children. Prof Kirwan's lawyer, as MailOnline has reported, plans to bring up Chelsea's close friendship with Bobby in open court - and plans to depose Bobby as well. Bobby currently lives in a rented home in Bedford, Connecticut, but will move coasts in the fall, according to sources. However,  his wedding to Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl, 48, is still on - and the pair will tie the knot at his mother Ethel's house in Hyannis Port on August 2, with a weekend of planned events. Indeed, the couple put on a display of intimacy when pictured in the Hamptons on July 4 - even wearing what looked like wedding rings, even though they have not yet said 'I Do'. The New York Daily News today claimed the wedding guest list has now spiraled to 600, with one source saying: 'Bobby wanted a small wedding, but he has a big family of at least 150 people and she has a huge family in California, so they have invited 600 people - and that’s small for the Kennedys.' Mother-of-one Cheryl, the source said, is going ahead with the wedding because she truly loves Bobby and 'really wants to make this work', adding: 'She has also gotten close to Bobby’s daughter Kick (Kathleen Alexandra Kennedy) when they took a trip together to Paris.' Today, a spokeswoman for Cheryl Hines had no comment, and Chelsea Kirwan refused to comment. Meanwhile, it was reported that serial philanderer Bobby kept a list of dozens of . women filed under the letter ‘G’ in his cell phone, including both Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan. Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party. Sources close to Prof Kirwan claimed the mother of three of his children had an 'inappropriate' relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr . Robert Kennedy Jr, 60, is set to marry Curb Your Enthusiasm star Hines, 48, in a ceremony expected to take place over the weekend of August 2, during the annual Kennedy family reunion in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts . The  New York Post . has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist, who works for Pace University and Riverkeeper, had contact . details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone. The . Post reported that Bobby's late wife, Mary Richardson, told a friend . about the list just two months before she committed suicide in May 2012. She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under ‘G’ because of the Italian slang for mistress - ‘goomah’. When RFK Jr had contact details for several women with the same first name, he would distinguish them by listing either their profession or city. His list included at least five women from Toronto and other in Paris, Palm Beach, Florida, and Aspen, Colorado. The Post contacted several women on the list, some of whom confirmed that they had met Kennedy. One described him as a ‘big flirt', while another described him as a ‘charming and talented man’, but denied that they had ever been romantically involved. Robert Kennedy's late wife, Mary Richardson, is reported to have shared details about a list of 43 suspected mistresses with a friend just two months before she committed suicide in May 2012 . This isn't the first time that details about RFK Jr's philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child. Bobby used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten. The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse. Alongside more prosaic details of Bobby's political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife. The 48-year-old actress and 60-year-old environmental activist took part in Fourth Of July celebrations in the Hamptons and didn't try to hide their gold bands ahead of their wedding this month . Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he described them. On days when he didn’t cheat, Bobby wrote ‘victory’ to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation. ‘I’m . like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001. The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012. The diary later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year. ‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and actress Cheryl Hines will wed on August 2 in Hyannis Port .

"By . Eleanor Harding . A grieving widow has won the right to keep her dead husband’s frozen sperm while she decides whether or not to have his baby. Beth Warren, 28, lost her husband Warren Brewer two years ago to a brain tumour and has fought to preserve his sperm ever since. The couple had planned to have a family together, with Mr Brewer making it clear before he died that his wife should have the chance to have their child. Tragic: Beth Warren, 28, lost her husband Warren Brewer, 32, two years ago to a brain tumour . Beth Warren leaving the High Court after winning her case to retain her dead husband's sperm, which was frozen before his death . Mrs Warren gasped when the judge announced her decision. Speaking after the hearing, an emotional Mrs Warren said she was 'elated' The law allows sperm and eggs to be . stored for up to 55 years. But when Mr Brewer died at 32 in February . 2012, he had not given consent for this and a storage time limit imposed . by the UK fertility regulator meant his sperm could only be held for . three further years. Mrs Warren said this did not give her time to . decide whether she wanted a family or not – and went against everything . she and her husband had intended. Yesterday Mrs Warren burst into . tears as a High Court judge ruled the deadline should be extended to . protect the couple’s human right to a family life. Beth Warren leaves the Law Courts  in London with her mother Georgina Hyde (far right), and her in-laws, Kevin and Helen Brewer . Mrs Warren said: 'Warren was my life. I know we didn't get that life we wanted. So we made this plan. Now I feel I can just move on in my life. With what I want to do. With this chance Warren left me' Judge Mrs Justice Hogg, who heard evidence at a hearing in the Family . Division of the High Court in London in January, ruled in Mrs Warren's . favour today. She added: 'May I also add my great sympathy for her. She . fell in love with a man, cared for him and loved him' Though the case . is unique, it is thought to be the first time such a judgement has been . made. Judge Mrs Justice . Hogg, who heard evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High . Court in London in January, said Mr Warren 'wished to keep open his . option to become a father of his own child. 'Notwithstanding . his wishes and intentions, Mr Brewer did not provide written consent as . required by the regulation, nor did he provide the requisite medical . certificate. 'I am satisfied had he known what was required he would have done that which was necessary. 'As it was he was not given the information, not advised and thus did not fulfil the requirement of the regulations. 'I . have held that Mrs Warren has a right under Article 8 in that she has . the right to decide to become a parent by her deceased husband, for . which he had made provision and which would accord with his wishes and . intention. For these reasons, I have made the declaration. 'May I also add my great sympathy for her. She fell in love with a man, cared for him and loved him. 'I . wish her and Mr Brewster's parent well, and ultimately whatever her . decision may be I wish her and the family much happiness after such a . difficult and sad time'. Mrs Warren gasped when the judge announced her decision. Beth Warren and Warren Brewer  pictured in 2010, one week before Brewer became ill for the second time. Mrs Warren, who uses her late husband's first name as her surname, asked a High Court judge to decide whether the sperm could stay in storage for a longer period . Mr Brewer making it clear before he died that his wife should have the chance to have their child . Speaking after the hearing, an emotional Mrs Warren said she was 'elated'. 'I . hadn't let myself believe that I was going to get that. I need to have a . think now move forward with my life, build it back up again and find . happiness really.' She added: 'I don't know where to start. Thank you to everyone who helped me. I am a little bit overwhelmed.' She . went on: 'Warren was my life. I know we didn't get that life we wanted. So we made this plan. Now I feel I can just move on in my life. With . what I want to do. With this chance Warren left me.' Mrs Warren said she would advise . anyone in the situation she and her husband had been in to contact their . clinic and make sure paperwork was properly completed. Warren Brewer and Beth Warren pictured one month after Mr Brewer's fourth brain surgery. After the ruling, Mrs Warren said: 'I am elated. Every good word in the dictionary. I hadn't dared to let myself believe it would happen' She added: 'I really want to make sure it doesn't happen again.' The physiotherapist from Birmingham previously told the High Court . that her late husband would not have wanted to place a time limit on her . conceiving his child. She said: 'I'm sure there's no way he would have wished to limit the length of time I could conceive in this situation. 'We . made plans to spend the rest of our lives together and plans for what . we would do if he didn't get better so I know there's no limit on the . amount of time for me. 'Every form we got from the clinic we read and signed'. The court heard that the last consent form that Mr Warren ever signed was on January 2, 2012. He had returned to the couple's home for New Year celebrations having been staying in a hospice. 'We . woke up that morning and Warren couldn't stand up - we wanted him . longer at home but he had to return to the hospice', Mrs Warren added. 'That's . why it was on January 2 that everything was signed, we spent New Years' together, it was the next day we arranged to go back to the hospice'. Mrs Warren was granted permission to store her late husband's sperm beyond April 2015. A . lawyer representing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority . (HFEA) had earlier  told the judge that officials sympathised with Mrs . Warren. But Jane Collier . said Mr Brewer, a ski instructor, had not given the proper written . consent to his sperm being stored beyond April 2015. Argument: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said it had 'every sympathy' with Ms Warren but says that they have 'no discretion' over the timings . A . lawyer representing Mrs Warren told the judge that the authority was . taking an 'excessively linguistic and technical approach' and suggested . that every option had not been made clear to Mr Brewer. Jenni . Richards QC said Mr Brewer wanted to ensure that his sperm could be . used by his wife after his death and had made his intentions clear. Mrs Warren said: 'I am elated. Every good word in the dictionary. I hadn't dared to let myself believe it would happen.' Mrs . Warren, who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying . husband, earlier said: ‘I am still trying to make myself happy again - you don't have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken. 'I need to make myself whole again. I want to be financially settled as . well, so that my child can have everything I had. 'I am just a normal . person who loved someone very, very much and lost them.' She . added: 'We just fell head over heels in love. It was a long time ago . that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would have . children. 'Ideally we'd have a boy and a girl and we talked about names. I am just trying to do the right thing.

"By . Sara Nathan . Barbara Walters is being courted by CNN and other networks just days after retiring from ABC. The news legend, 84, only left ABC on Friday following her last star-studded episode of The View, with guests including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Sources have told MailOnline that the Queen of broadcasting is being pursued by CNN, while another said: 'Barbara's retirement seems to mean nothing - she's been taking meetings all over town.' Scroll down for video . Queens of daytime: Oprah Winfrey told how when she was first started out in TV she got over her nerves by just pretending to act like Barbara Walters . Goodbye: Oprah Winfrey, right, embraced Barbara Walters during the taping of Walters' final co-host appearance on May 15 . Emotional moment: The closest Barbara Walters came to crying during her farewell show on The View on Friday was when Oprah Winfrey sang her praises and said that she was an inspiration. She is being pursued by news networks now - despite her retirement from ABC . After her emotional exit from the show she created, Barbara told US Weekly she planned to take a break over the summer - but admitted she was already thinking about new TV projects. She said: 'Monday comes, and I'm going to sleep late! A little later on I'm going to go to Europe for a few days with a friend because I don't want to sit home and think about, 'What do I do today? Why aren't I on the air?' So I'm going to go away for a bit. And then it's the summer!'' While she wants to slow down, the presenter hopes to interview more high profile people in the future. She said: ''I would love to do an interview with the Pope. I do my homework, so I have a certain sense of authority. Sometimes I know more about the person than they do themselves. I'm very rarely nervous. When I finish an interview, I do 'shoulda, coulda, woulda,' and it drives me crazy, but when I'm actually doing the interview, I'm fine in authority and that's a good feeling.' A TV source added: 'Barbara has been working for more than five decades and she will be a journalist till her dying day, there's no way she's going to sit at home knitting. 'She has let it be known she wants to continue working on projects.' CNN recently axed Brit host Piers Morgan's prime-time show - he was brought in to replace veteran interviewer Larry King. When asked about discussions with CNN, a source close to Barbara today said there was 'no truth' in the rumours, while an ABC source said Barbara remained tied to the network and would still appear on ABC news while executive producing The View. On Friday, Barbara was treated to a sensational farewell on The View0 as Oprah Winfrey surprised her and said: 'You're the reason I wanted to be in television. Like everyone else, I want to thank you for being a pioneer and everything that that word means.

Connie Chung and Joan Lunden. 'You are my legacy,' Barbara said to them as they crowded around her onstage. Oprah went on to talk about how Barbara had the 'courage' to become the first female co-anchor in spite of widespread criticism and the fact that her co-host Hugh Downs openly disliked the fact that he had to share the camera with a woman. Those who followed: Oprah Winfrey took a roll call of the dozens of female broadcasters who came after Barbara  Winfrey was the first woman to have a co-anchor position on television news .

"By . Bianca London . Need that little bit of extra motivation to hit the gym? A new piece of research may get you running to your next yoga class. According to a new study, more and more women are experiencing exercise-induced orgasms. An ‘exercise induced orgasm’ (EIO) or ‘coregasm’, as it is known by the leagues of gym-addicted fans on the internet, has gained both recognition amongst the fitness world and scientific backing. Scroll down for videos . Rise of the coregasm: Research has revealed that more and more women are experiencing exercise-induced orgasms, and yoga, favoured by Miranda Kerr, is one of the top sports for causing one . Get The Gloss writer Ahmed Zambarakji investigated the growing trend and discovered the most orgasm-inducing exercises. He writes: 'A recent study conducted by the . University of Indiana published in the journal Sexual and Relationship . Therapy suggests that the most orgasm-inducing exercises are 'climbing . poles or ropes, biking/spinning and weight lifting. Anything that involves engaging your . abs, basically.' And the most effective . workout? An exercise that works the abdominal muscles using a piece of . gym equipment called the 'captain's chair.' To perform the exercise you stand with your forearms resting on the padded armrests of the chair, which are positioned at right angles to the body. Fitness fanatic: Of the women who came clean in the study, 45 per cent held abdominal exercises responsible, 26.5 per cent weight lifting, 20 per cent yoga, 15.8 per cent cycling and 13.2 per cent running. Fitness fan Millie Mackintosh better watch out! You then squeeze your abdominal muscles . (which support the trunk of the body) to help you lift your knees to . your chest before lowering the feet to the floor again. Effective: The most effective workout is an exercise that works the abdominal muscles using a piece of gym equipment called the 'captain's chair' Of the women who came clean in the study, 45 per cent held abdominal exercises responsible, 26.5 per cent weight lifting, 20 per cent yoga, 15.8 per cent cycling and 13.2 per cent running. A lucky - and, one assumes, shockingly sensitive - 9.6 -per cent could even experience an orgasm by going for a brisk walk. And it seems that the trend is growing; 40 per cent of respondents had experienced an EIO on more than 10 occasions. But the majority of women aren't enjoying these experiences in the gym perhaps as much as they may in the bedroom. A fifth of women who experienced them . said they had no control over the experience and most of them felt . self-conscious as a result. Debby Herbenick, co-author of the study, said: 'These data are interesting because they suggest that orgasm is not necessarily a sexual event, and they may also teach us more about the bodily processes underlying women's experiences of orgasm.' While Hebernick claims the mechanics of the coregasm are still to be confirmed, an earlier study - and a bit of common sense - offers a relatively simply explanation, writes Ahmed. 'Exercise revs up the sympathetic nervous system and, for women who are already quite sensitive, an increased heart rate, constricted blood vessels, and elevated blood pressure might just be enough to tip them over the edge. 'A study entitled Sympathetic Nervous System Activity and Female Sexual Arousal (the clue is in the title) was the first to suggest that the female orgasm could be a “purely physiologic” phenomenon. 'This fits nicely with Hebernick’s statement that  “Most women reporting EIO said they were not fantasising sexually or thinking about anyone they were attracted to during their experiences”.' Take note! A recent study suggests that the most orgasm-inducing exercises are 'climbing poles or ropes, biking/spinning and weight lifting.

"By . Leon Watson . A gigantic line of powerful thunderstorms could affect one in five Americans as it rumbles from Iowa to Maryland packing hail, lightning and tree-toppling winds. Meteorologists are warning that the continuous line of storms may even spawn an unusual weather event called a derecho, which is a massive storm of strong straight-line winds spanning at least 240 miles. Wednesday's storms are also likely to generate tornadoes and cause power outages that will be followed by oppressive heat, said Bill Bunting, operations chief at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. This graphic shows the area of greatest impacts, particularly Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, that will be hit by tornadoes and hail . Batten down the hatches: The Mid-West is braced for a derecho - these long, flat clouds are often associated with thunderstorms . Widespread: Some 65 million people across 10 states could be affected by a derecho Wednesday, a storm where powerful winds stretch hundreds of miles, often causing widespread destruction . Not again? Forecasters are predicting the derecho to come from a giant wave of thunderstorms in the Mid-West. Last year, a derecho caused $1 billion in damages from Chicago to Washington . Double whammy? Tornadoes are often associated with the same weather systems that produce derechoes. Pictured is a map of tornado probability during today's storm and into tomorrow . And again? A huge area is expected to suffer tomorrow, with hail and lightning predicted. Much of the severe weather may concentrate in New York City . A derecho is a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms. Last year's historic storm saw widespread destruction and meteorologists fear it could be happening again, possibly affecting 64 million people in 10 states.In 2012, a record-breaking derecho caused $1 billion in damage from Chicago to Washington.Over 4 million were without power after the June 29, 2012 storm across 11 states.To be classified as a derecho, the line of storms must travel at least 240 miles and include wind gusts of at least 58 mph. 2012's storm saw winds as great as 100 mph. It can produce destruction similar to that of tornadoes, while the damage typically is directed in one direction. As a result, the term 'straight-line wind damage' is sometimes used to describe the phenomenon. The risk of severe weather in Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, is roughly 45 times higher than on a normal June day, Bunting said. Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Louisville, Kentucky, have a risk level 15 times more than normal. All told, the area the weather service considers to be under heightened risk of dangerous weather includes 64 million people in 10 states. 'It's a pretty high threat,' Bunting said, who also warned that the storms will produce large hail and dangerous lightning. 'We don't want to scare people, but we want them to be aware.' Wednesday 'might be the worst severe weather outbreak for this part of the country for the year,' said Jeff Masters, meteorology director at Weather Underground. He said it is possible to have tornadoes and a derecho at the same time, but at any given place on Wednesday the straight-line winds are probably more likely. Last year, a derecho caused at least . $1 billion in damage from Chicago to Washington, killing 13 people and . leaving more than four million people without power, according to the . weather service. Winds . reached nearly 100mph in some places and in addition to the 13 people . who died from downed trees, another 34 people died from the heat wave . that followed in areas without power. Derechoes, . with winds of at least 58mph, occur about once a year in the Midwest. Rarer than tornadoes but with weaker winds, derechoes produce damage . over a much wider area.

Weather experts have warned tree-toppling winds are on their way to the Mid-West. Here an American Beech tree is down on Capitol Hill grounds in Washington across from the U.S. Supreme Court after a powerful storm swept across the Washington region .

If the storm remains intact after crossing the Appalachian Mountains, which would be rare for a derecho, it should hit the Washington area by late afternoon or early evening, he said.

"By . Sara Nathan . They are the billion dollar couple whose marriage has been a carefully orchestrated affair - even down to the announcement of their first child live on TV. But as rumors continue to swirl surrounding an impending split between Jay Z and Beyoncé, sources tell MailOnline the rapper is desperate to save his marriage and plans to whisk his superstar wife away on a five-week 'make or break' vacation in between their final tour dates. A source revealed that Jay Z is trying to persuade Beyoncé - who is now looking at apartments in both New York AND LA - to join him, saying: 'Jay wants to save the marriage, they have their final US tour date in San Francisco on August 6 and then they have two dates in Paris from September 12 - that's it. 'He adores his daughter Blue Ivy and he wants a sibling for her, but Beyoncé isn't sure what she wants to do  - their marriage is in flux, that's the truth. Jay just wants them to spend some time alone together to try and work it out. Scroll down for video . The end of the fairytale?  Beyoncé looked emotional as she donned a white wedding gown while performing at Safeco Field in Seattle with husband Jay Z on Wednesday night . Separate lives: Jay Z is said to be desperate to save his marriage to  Beyoncé  - and wants to whisk her away for a make or break vacation. The couple put on a good show in Seattle on Wednesday night . Smiles: Despite their grins as last night's gig, Beyoncé still changed the lyrics of her song, Resentment, further fueling rumors of marital strife - and is not wearing a wedding ring (ringed) 'And it's not just throwing away a marriage - it's throwing away a brand. But it may be that Bey has just had enough. She has some trust issues with Jay.' The couple are currently on the West Coast on their On The Run Tour, from which they stand to earn up to $120 million. The source said their marriage has not been the same since they became parents and settled down to family life with their daughter, now two. The stress is said to have led them to a point where Beyoncé yet again hinted at marital strife. At their concert at Seattle's Safeco Field on Wednesday night,  she once more changed the lyrics to her 2006 song, Resentment - and was clearly seen without a wedding band. During the song, which is about a cheating scandal, she altered the track to reflect the current length of her romance with the rapper, singing: 'Been ridin' with you for twelve years. Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?' The original lyric should read: ''Been ridin' with you for six years.' She also changed the line, 'Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could'' to 'Like I couldn't do it for you like that wack b***h could.' And for now, Beyoncé keeps on staff her veteran bodyguard Julius De Boer, who remains one of her closest 'confidants' and 'knows everything,' according to the source. Indeed, it was was Julius, a Dutchman, believed to be a divorced father-of-one, who prevented Beyoncé's younger sister Solange Knowles from attacking Jay Z in her new infamous elevator attack at a bash following the Met Ball in May. Despite reports that the furious row between Solange and Jay was over his close friendship with singer Rihanna, a source claimed that his relationship with his former protégé is not believed to be romantic. If the most powerful couple in music do divorce, one thing is for certain - Beyoncé has certainly got control of all of her hard-earned cash. In December 2013, following the surprise release of her self-titled visual album, she made it clear: 'I started my own company.' Referring to Parkwood Entertainment, the entertainment and management company she founded in 2008 after parting ways with her longtime manager, father Matthew Knowles, she told fans at a private screening at New York's School of Visual Arts Theatre: 'When I decided to manage myself it was important that I didn’t go to some big management company. 'I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire and show other women when you get to this point in your career you don’t have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success - you do it yourself.' According to a longtime New York attorney, . the couple would certainly have a pre-nup in place following their . Manhattan wedding on April 4, 2008 . Raoul Felder, a noted matrimonial and family lawyer, told MailOnline: 'If these people didn't have a pre-nuptial agreement . they ought to see a psychiatrist - not a lawyer! Confidante: Beyoncé's longtime bodyguard Julius De Boer, who stopped Solange Knowles from attacking Jay Z in the infamous elevator row following the Met Ball in May, is said to be her confidant. He's seen here, top right, ushering the superstar, her sister and husband out of the party . By her side:  Julius De Boer is currently on tour with Beyoncé and Jay Z. He's seen with Bey at the Met Ball and again as she leaves a Midtown Manhattan office building in June . 'My . favorite hue is Jay Z Blue': Beyonce posted a heartwarming Instagram . snap on Monday of her husband cradling their daughter Blue Ivy on a . picturesque beach . Apartment hunting: Sources reveal that apart from looking at New York properties, Beyoncé is also looking in Los Angeles as well. The couple are seen on stage in Seattle on Wednesday night . 'But . there are some who believe that true love conquers all, sometimes . people are romantic - look at Paul McCartney and Heather Mills, people . can be irrational. 'I don't think this is the case here however, you're dealing with two people who are extremely savvy, it's all about business.' The pair own a string of properties, including the 8,309-square-foot penthouse at 195 Hudson Street in Tribeca, Manhattan in September 2004 for $6.85million - and now valued at considerably more. And Mr Felder said: 'In cases where there is lots of money, it's much easier to resolve. When there's a lot of money on the table, it's easier to draw a line. Money is a strange commodity, the more you have, the less important it is. 'And with the pre-nup, that really ends any arguments.' The lawyer pointed out the couple could file in any state where they own a home - not just New York, so they could pick a state with minimal exposure to ensure they maintain control. Asked about a potential custody arrange for Jay and Bey's daughter, Mr Felder said: 'This would be no ordinary divorce, there would be no father fighting to keep his child in state, these people have private planes - they could be living in Timbuktu!' For the moment, the couple are not believed to be shopping around for divorce lawyers - and sources maintain that a split, if it happens, would not be announced until the end of the tour at the Stade de France in Paris in September. On the rocks? Beyonce - pictured in The Hamptons with husband Jay Z and Blue Ivy - has hinted at marriage troubles as she changed the lyrics in a song about cheating during her performance on the couples On The Run tour in Ohio last month- and again in Seattle on Wednesday night . Surfboard, surfboard: Beyonce shared a photo of herself laying across the flat ocean rider she famously sings about in Drunk In Love in an Instagram snap on Saturday - again, without a wedding band on her finger . Bachelorette pad? Beyoncé is believed to have viewed this Chelsea apartment, on sale for $21.5million without Jay Z . Perhaps . what will be extremely telling will be any appearance the couple make at . this year's VMAs on August 24, in Inglewood, California. Beyoncé leads the VMA nominees with eight bids, including Video of the Year for 'Drunk in Love', her collaboration with Jay Z. It was at the 2011 VMAs, Bey famously announced . she was pregnant with Blue Ivy by popping open her sequined blazer and . rubbing her belly for the crowd while Jay Z and Kanye West high-fived . each other - and now the Daily News reports MTV wants Bey to open the awards WITHOUT her husband. What is indeed certain is Beyoncé's bid to keep up appearances - this week she posted a cute Instagram snap of Jay and Blue Ivy, with the note: 'My favorite hue is Jay Z Blue' - although privately it seems she's most definitely making plans for a fresh start without Jay. As the New York Post reported this week, the superstar has been secretly shopping for new digs without Jay Z- viewing a $21.5 million Chelsea penthouse early last month just weeks after the elevator incident. The 4,045-square-foot West 19th Street property is still a far cry from the couple's sprawling loft, and a source said: 'She was very quiet, as if she was looking on the sly.' Working: Beyonce shared this image of her and Jay Z during their Chicago show, featuring her sitting on a higher platform than him . And MailOnline has learned that the superstar singer has also been looking at properties in Los Angeles. Calling time on the marriage, a source told the Post: 'There’s still something there, even though it’s not going to last. Business is always part of the equation. They know they’re the king and . queen of hip-hop - and really, all of music. Neither wants to lose . that.' The insider also . alleged: 'Knowing them as I do, obviously there’s a little something to . certain rumors. When your man or your woman isn’t getting it done for . you, and I’m talking emotionally, not necessarily sexually… they keep . things quiet.' Bonnie & Clyde: Beyonce and Jay Z were every bit the power couple as they performed in Chicago on Thursday night for their joint On The Run tour . While on stage in front their adoring fans, the stars seem unruffled by rumours their marriage is in trouble. Meanwhile, eagle-eyed fans have picked up, Beyoncé has removed the IV tattoo on her wedding finger . And if that doesn't signify the end of a starry marriage, what else does.","Superstars Beyoncé and Jay Z's marriage is in 'flux' and Jay is attempting to fix the relationship - but Bey may 'have had enough'

And their paradise features a 15,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house that comes complete with a . lookout tower, as well as three smaller houses for their staff. The . exclusive Exuma archipelago is made up of 365 islands costing around . $30 million each and privately-owned by stars ranging from Johnny Depp . to David Copperfield and Tyler Perry.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Since drones became mainstream there has been a constant battle between pilots and law enforcement agencies about where the unmanned crafts can fly. Data analysts from San Francisco have created a map of the U.S. that plots where owners can pilot their drones, and where specifically the drones are banned. The states with the fewest restrictions are revealed as Oregon in the northwest and Maine in the east, while Nevada and California have the most. Explore the drone map below . The Don't Fly Drones Here map of the U.S (pictured) was created by data analysts Bobby Sudekum and Amy Lee. It plots where in the U.S owners can pilot their drones, and where specifically the drones are banned . In the U.S., the Federal Aviation Authority has a blanket ban on drones flying over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile radius of medium and large airports. In 2012, the FAA fined a drone owner $10,000 for flying his Zephyr II drone over the University of Virginia. He was fined because he had used the drone to record photos he later sold to the university. The FAA said the flight violated regulations that forbid the use of drones in the U.S for commercial reasons. Following an appeal, Judge Patrick Geragthy overruled the decision claiming the FAA has not issued ‘an enforceable rule governing model aircraft operation.’ He . added the agency has also ‘historically exempted model aircraft from . the statutory definitions of ‘aircraft’ by relegating model aircraft to . voluntary compliance with the [FAA’s 2007] guidelines.’ It was the first time a fine had been dismissed. Drones are also banned from being used for commercial reasons. Analysts Bobby Sudekum and Amy Lee plotted the location of these bases across the U.S, using Open Street Map data, the National Park Service and U.S Military Data. They then built the map in Mapbox.

Zooming in, and hovering a mouse over these red regions show what kind of restricted airspace it covers, it also reveals the name of the location. Drones have always been restricted above military bases and airports for security reasons, but the restriction above national parks only came into effect at the start of this month. The National Park Service (NPS) outlawed launching, landing, or operating drones on or over federally operated lands and waters. It was signed by director Jonathan Jarvis on 27 June. The NPS manages all of the country's national parks, monuments, and various historical sites. Individual parks had banned drones prior to this agreement, including Yosemite National Park in California in May. Mr Jarvis said: 'We embrace many activities in national parks because they enhance visitor experience with the iconic natural, historic and cultural landscapes in our care.

'However, we have serious concerns about the negative impact that flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks, so we are prohibiting their use until we can determine the most appropriate policy that will protect park resources and provide all visitors with a rich experience.' The hope is that the ban will eliminate many noise and nuisance complaints and help ensure safety. In September, rangers in Mount Rushmore captured a drone that flew over the National Memorial amphitheater in South Dakota. Then in April, visitors to the Grand Canyon complained about noise from a drone that crashed into the canyon.

Rear housings for previous iPhones have been aperture-free solid blocks that feature the Apple logo embossed on the exterior of the handset. In the latest images of what the firm call a ‘market-ready version’ of the case, the logo is part of the plastic panel inside the interior of the rear housing. ‘Tellingly, the plastic part looks to have been made thin enough that light can easily shine through,’ continued uSwitch Tech. The rear panel in the images is also more polished than previous leaks, but confirm the rounded edges and redesigned camera flash seen in past prototypes. Both the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions of the iPhone 6 are expected to be unveiled in September.

Prince Harry has started his US trip for rowdy royal pal Guy Pelly's wedding as he means to go on - with an evening at two of Miami's hottest nightspots. Although the trip was originally planned as a romantic getaway with girlfriend Cressida Bonas, the red-haired royal, 29, hit the party scene alone on Wednesday night - just days after the couple split. Missing the funeral of Mark Shand, the brother of his step-mother, the Duchess of Cornwall, held in the UK today, the Prince and his pals dined at Hakkasan and then went on to the trendy LIV nightclub at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel. And Prince Harry was certainly letting heartbreak get in the way of having a good time as he hit the town and was given VIP treatment in one of the club's SkyBoxes - a private booth which overlooks the scene - where a mystery brunette was seen hugging him.

However, her former boyfriend appeared not to have a care in the world as flew . into Miami on Wednesday, on route to Memphis, for a night out. The . prince, who is accompanied by a team of tax-payer funded Scotland Yard . bodyguards, first enjoyed a quiet dinner at the Hakkasan restaurant in . the Fontainebleau Hotel and Resort with a group of both male and female . friends. The party sat in a private dining room where they stayed . until after closing time enjoying duck salad, dim sum platter, . Stir-fried Chilean sea bass, Bahamian lobster and cocktails. A fellow . diner told the Mail: ‘It seemed like a really civilised dinner, it was . pretty low key. Harry was sat next to a tanned brunette woman and they . were chatting away, but it was hard to tell if it was flirtatious or . not.’ Miami Herald . columnist Lesley Abravanel gave a tweet-by-tweet account of watching . Prince Harry, describing the scene as 'possibly the most carefully, . quietly orchestrated visit to Miami outside the Witness Protection . Program'. She said the group . of seven 'conservatively dressed' young men and women arrived at 9.25pm . on Wednesday night and was escorted to a private dining room.

After dinner, the gang headed to LIV, and despite being fourth in line to the throne, the Prince was said to have been accompanied by just one large bodyguard. Lesley . claimed the DJs as the club were banned from giving the royal a 'shout . out' for security measure, and pictures were also banned. Harry's pal 'Skippy', a fellow red head, prides himself on being the prince’s ‘wingman’ and was with him when he famously stripped naked in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2012 as well as jumping fully clothed into a swimming pool in a nightclub in Croatia the previous year. While Harry appeared to be enjoying himself, it seemed lessons had been learned from his notorious trip to Vegas, however, when he was photographed playing a game of ‘strip billiards’ with an unidentified blonde on a mobile phone. This time security officers tried to stop partygoers taking photos of him on their phones and asked them to delete the images. Harry and his group are today checking out of a Miami hotel and will travel on to Tennessee where police have been seen sweeping the £1,300-a-night Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis.

Following Harry's shock split from Cressida, the Daily Mail reported the blonde is have ‘panicked’ after learning that she was to be placed next to Harry on the top table at the wedding breakfast thrown in honour  of Pelly and his bride. According to sources close to Harry and Cressida, that led to a bust-up between the lovebirds last weekend, during which the former dance student announced she would no longer be joining Harry on the trip. Within hours of the row, the couple were informing their shocked friends and family that their relationship was over. The Mail reported that another reason why matters came to a head was Stowe-educated Cressida’s discovery at the 11th hour that Harry’s plans for next weekend’s celebrations include some pre-wedding ‘boys’ partying’ to which she was not invited. Memphis police were spotted scouting out the Rendezvous restaurant before Princes William and Harry arrived . The Princes are reportedly staying at the luxury Peabody Hotel in Memphis while they attend their friends' wedding . Friends and family all spoke of their shock at the speed at which the situation has changed so drastically. ‘Cressie was really happy last week and looking forward to their trip to America,’ said one friend. ‘Things were very much on. Then, after the weekend she had cancelled her plans and - bang - that was it. ‘Why she was so happy one day and then so suddenly unhappy the next, no one honestly knows. It seems as if there is a bit of a stand-off between her and Harry over things at the moment, and it’s something of a mystery as to how long this will last - a week, a month, for ever?’ Another source added: ‘This really has happened very suddenly. I know for a fact that at Easter they were very much together, things were  as good between them as they  ever were. 'Cressida is young, so this could be just a blip. It’s just a real shame, though, as they made a really cool couple.’ Guy Pelly has remained a close friend of both William and Harry despite being caught up in a drugs furore surrounding Harry in January 2002.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court of abusing his position to have affairs with five women while on duty . A police community support officer used the police database ‘as a dating agency’ to have affairs with single mothers and domestic abuse victims while on duty, a court heard. Peter Bunyan accessed inside information to do background checks on women and their ex-partners after ‘welfare’ visits to victims of crime, it is alleged. He is accused of neglecting his duties by turning his police radio off on shifts before having sex with women, including at a neighbourhood police office. He is alleged to have urged a mentally ill woman to email explicit pictures of herself to the police station. Married Bunyan, 40, a father of two, denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office over a  five-year period. Prosecutor Simon Burns told Taunton Crown Court yesterday: ‘If he was not in uniform or on duty, there would not be a trial. ‘But if on duty or in his uniform he should have been at work but he was in bed with somebody, he was not exercising his proper role as a police officer. ’ Bunyan, of Carharrack, Cornwall, admits he had sex with four women but said it was off duty. He denies sex with a fifth woman. All five say the sex was consensual. Mr Burns said of Bunyan’s use of the  police database: ‘You do not use the criminal intelligence system as a dating agency.’ Peter Bunyan, an officer with Devon . and Cornwall Police, is alleged to have accessed highly sensitive police . data to perform background checks on women and their former partners . after so-called 'welfare' visits to victims of crime. He . is accused of neglecting his duties by turning his police radio down on . shifts before having sex with women, including at a police . neighbourhood office, as well as encouraging one mentally ill woman to . send explicit pictures of herself on email to the police station. Bunyan, a father-of-two, denies 12 . counts of misconduct in a public office, taking place over a five-year . period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west Cornwall. On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) is accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty . The case is being held at Taunton Crown Court, Somerset, out of the Devon and Cornwall Police force area. Prosecutor . Simon Burns told the jury: 'This is not a court of morals. You will . hear all sorts of sordid details in relation to this case. 'He . (Bunyan) has abused his position as a police officer by targeting women . - targeting vulnerable women - and conducting inappropriate sexual . relationships with them while on duty. 'He has behaved, while on duty as a police officer, inappropriately and unprofessionally. 'Not only was he in his full uniform... but occasionally even turned down or off his police radio.' Mr Burns said Bunyan had sex with women at various locations, including at a neighbourhood police office. Bunyan . also accessed the police database, where he was able to find highly . personal details about people in the community, including the women he . targeted, the court heard. Mr . Burns added: 'He used that confidential information, which is not . allowed to be simply looked at by a police officer, unless they have a . lawful reason for doing so. 'You . don’t look up somebody simply to be nosy, to look at where they live, . to look for their telephone numbers. He abused the police computer . system to his own advantage. 'You do not use the criminal intelligence system as a dating agency.' Mr Burns said the public expected PSCOs such as Bunyan to protect them on the streets, 'not to be in bed with them'. Mr Burns said Bunyan’s first affair was with a woman who had some mental health issues. She . was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The woman previously . had reason to call the police following a dispute with someone. Another . woman struck up a relationship with Bunyan after he went to her home to . take a witness statement when she was a victim of domestic violence. But . the statement took “an inordinate amount of time to complete”, the . court heard. Bunyan then started to ask the woman intimate questions . about her body. The . couple developed a relationship, which in one case saw Bunyan collect . the single mother from a firework display and take her to a . neighbourhood police office where they had sex. The woman said Bunyan had been on duty - something Mr Burns said the PCSO later admitted. Redruth police station, where Bunyan would openly view explicit pictures of his victims . Bunyan is said to have “encouraged” the women to post naked pictures of themselves - some pornographic - to . his local police station. Colleagues of the PCSO told the jury . how he “clearly appreciated” the images, which were sent on CDs and . viewed by Bunyan on the police computer at Redruth police station. PCSO Karen Moreley, who worked with Bunyan for a year, said he was sent images of naked women regularly. She told the jury: 'There were topless images and images using mirrors. 'He clearly appreciated these images and would laugh and joke and check the mail to see if any discs arrived. 'I found him quite forthcoming to women, quite creepy and unprofessional.' Bunyan admits having sex with four women, who include single mothers, women in their 20s, and victims of domestic abuse, but said it was off duty. He denies sex with a fifth woman.

"By . Anna Edwards . Sir Michael Wilshaw said communities should play more of a role in supporting problem families . Teachers and social workers should tell people that they are bad parents and to stop failing their children, the head of Ofsted has warned. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs that, as a former head teacher, he 'saw the result of children being brought up badly by their parents' and would routinely tell parents when they were failing. He also said communities should play more of a role in supporting problem families, referring to the 'old phrase ""a child is brought up by the village"".' Sir Michael said third parties needed to get involved when they saw children being treated badly by their parents - such as youngsters not being sent to school. 'These families need to know that they can't go on treating their children like this, they can't go on behaving in this manner and they've got to hit the targets that are being set by social workers,' he said. 'As a headteacher I used to tell parents that they were behaving badly and that they were bad parents. 'It didn't often go down extremely well but nevertheless that was my responsibility and it's a responsibility of social workers.' 'As an ex-headteacher I saw the result of children being brought up badly by their parents, so society has got to worry about what's happening in families and families in particular parts of the country, and children's services have got a part to play in helping and supporting those families, but families have got a huge part to play and communities have got a huge part to play in supporting children.' The Ofsted boss said headteachers and society has must worry about what's happening in families and raise concerns . The Government should also consider rewarding 'good citizens' to knock on their neighbours' doors and demand why their children are not in school, the Chief Inspector of Education has said. He told the Commons Education Committee: 'Well, communities have got a big part to play in supporting our most difficult families and most vulnerable children. 'In my experience in the most difficult communities there are always going to be good people who want to help. 'How do you incentivise good citizens, good people, good family members to engage with the most difficult members of society, and that's a policy issue for Government. 'How do you financially incentivise these people to get up in the morning, knock on the neighbours door, and say your children are not up yet, they've not had their breakfast yet, why aren't you taking them to school? Sir Michael, who was appointed Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills in January 2012, was speaking as he appeared at the Commons Education Committee to give evidence on Ofsted's recent report on the state of children's services. He said that in the wake of high profile cases such as the death of Baby P, children's services have never been under so much pressure. He said: 'The national consciousness of what can go badly wrong in terms of children's services is much greater than it's ever been because of the high profile deaths that have taken place over the past few years, and as a consequence of those tragedies the volume of cases under scrutiny have gone up, and the pressure on children's services have gone up and our inspection frameworks are much more rigorous as a result of that. 'We've also got to worry about the parlous state of children's services throughout the country and worry about those children who don't die and don't hit the headlines but actually are going through miserable lives because they are not being properly supported.'","Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs that social workers and headteacher need to tell parents when they are behaving badly .

Family affair: Karen Houghton, left, poses outside Kim's baby shower last June, while her older sister Kris Jenner struts her stuff in Paris yesterday . Crazy Aunt K: Karen Houghton called her sister Kris Jenner crazy in a Facebook post in April . She needs a drink: Karen Houghton said her sister needed vodka . Let's go crazy: Karen Houghton revels in her status . Karen, who has been outspoken about her millionaire sister Kris - and recently told how Bruce Jenner walked out on her because he was fed up of all her yelling - said despite everything she was happy for Kim. And she believes this union will last longer than Kim's second marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries in 2011, laughing: 'I think this one's going to work. I think . it's going to be more then 72 days! 'I think it's . going to work, I mean look at Nori, how adorable. I just love them and . hope they're happy.' Kim, 33, and Kanye, 36, are hosting an intimate group of 150 guests, according to Karen, who said that even her mother Mary Jo Shannon doesn't know the exact location of the wedding yet. adding: 'Kanye's calling the . people a half hour before and saying ""here's where it is"". I can't even . tell you where it is.' 'I think this one is going to work. I think it's going to be more than 72 days!' - Karen Houghton . It's believed that celebrations will start on Friday night in Paris with a guided tour of Le Palais de Versailles, and on Saturday morning, guests will be flown by private jet 700 miles away to witness the ceremony at the imposing Forti d Belvedere in Florence, Italy. And Karen said she would have 'absolutely' gone had her home not been at risk of damage from local wildfires, saying: 'Six o'clock in the morning they called me yesterday and said, ""Well are . you coming, are you coming?""' 'I said ""You know, I just don't know with the fires..."" It was absolutely the scariest thing I have ever been through. Everyone was evacuated and my house is a mess from the fires.' The care worker and part-time nurse, who works in an old people's home, said: 'I have to work till 8pm, then I guess I could catch a red eye or something. 'I'm afraid to leave - the fire could go all over my c**p. If your house was going to burn down would you go to Paris? Screw it - I've been to two weddings of Kim! But I'm really happy for her and I do have a present for her.' Karen, who has a 15-year-old daughter called Natalie, also said she did not want to leave her daughter at home alone. Natalie has been invited to the wedding - but does not want to attend without her boyfriend, who is not on the guest list. She has frequently been outspoken when her sister Kris, 58, has riled her. Last month, Karen told Radar that despite Kris and her estranged husband Bruce looking friendly there would be NO reunion.

And she said Kris was not taking the split well, adding: 'I think she’s got issues right now because Bruce left her. 'Kris is alone, she’s not dating. She’s not the type to run around.' She made the comments after writing on her Facebook page in April: 'Pray for Kris Jenner she needs it…crazy. Shes as nutcase [sic]. 'She doesn’t need prayers she needs sky vodka hahaha hahaha hahaha.' And explaining her somewhat harsh views, Karen said  'I get p***ed off at her because she doesn’t respond to me. If you think your sister would call you back, she doesn’t. And it hurts me.' Karen - who lives two hours from her sister in San Marcos, California - blames her sibling's celebrity status and hunger for fame and fortune. She said: 'I don’t care how much money you have or who you are, you’re my sister. I’m not afraid of her. I can’t get to her anymore. But I guess it’s the money. 'She’s a huge celebrity and now she has changed. I’m not saying good or bad. But I’ve seen what it can do to Kris… ever since she moved to L.A.' Admitting . she has had run-ins with Kris - mainly to do with caring for their aging . mother, Karen told MailOnline: 'I called up Kris yelling at her, because I was . like, ""You need to help your mom more and you know it."" And I think that she kind of got the message.I was screaming - I don't even care. 'I . don't care about stuff and I don't care what anyone thinks of me.

"By . Associated Press . An American doctor infected with Ebola said on Friday he's getting stronger every day as he recounted the terrible strain of caring for those suffering from the deadly disease. Dr. Kent Brantly put out a statement  through Samaritan's Purse, the aid organization he was working with in Liberia. He and another aid worker, Nancy Writebol, are being treated in an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Scroll down for video . Dr Kent Brantly, an American aid worker in Liberia who contracted Ebola, is pictured returning to the U.S. last Saturday. He released a statement on Friday saying 'he's getting stronger every day' Dr Brantly, pictured working in Liberia, was given an experimental treatment for Ebola which has never been used on humans. It is unknown whether it has played a part in his improved condition . In a statement, Dr Brantly said: I am writing this update from my isolation room at Emory University Hospital, where the doctors and nurses are providing the very best care possible. 'I am growing stronger every day, and I thank God for His mercy as I have wrestled with this terrible disease. 'I also want to extend my deep and sincere thanks to all of you who have been praying for my recovery as well as for Nancy (Writebol) and for the people of Liberia and West Africa. 'My wife Amber and I, along with our two children, did not move to Liberia for the specific purpose of fighting Ebola. We went to Liberia because we believe God called us to serve Him at ELWA Hospital.' The doctor also revealed the strain of caring for those who succumbed to the deadly disease. Ebola kills 90 per cent of people who contract it and there is no known cure. Dr Brantly wrote: 'One thing I have learned is that following God often leads us to unexpected places. When Ebola spread into Liberia, my usual hospital work turned more and more toward treating the increasing number of Ebola patients. I held the hands of countless individuals as this terrible disease took their lives away from them. I witnessed the horror firsthand, and I can still remember every face and name. 'When I started feeling ill on that Wednesday morning, I immediately isolated myself until the test confirmed my diagnosis three days later. When the result was positive, I remember a deep sense of peace that was beyond all understanding. God was reminding me of what He had taught me years ago, that He will give me everything I need to be faithful to Him. Dr Brantly pictured with his wife Amber and two children. The doctor's statement today said that he was improving daily as he is treated at Emory in a quarantined unit . 'Now it is two weeks later, and I am in a totally different setting. My focus, however, remains the same—to follow God. As you continue to pray for Nancy and me, yes, please pray for our recovery. More importantly, pray that we would be faithful to God’s call on our lives in these new circumstances.' Dr Brantly was transferred amid high security to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Saturday which is fitted out with one of the most sophisticated containment facilities in America. He was pictured being helped out of a special ambulance in a hazmat suit and walking into the hospital. Mrs Writebol's husband, David, who remains in Liberia, told reporters on Friday in a call organized by aid group SIM USA his wife appears to be improving. David Writebol said he was also thankful for the ‘marvelous’ care his wife received in Liberia before traveling to Atlanta and is grateful that she is now in a place where she can receive the best care possible. Few details have been released about the specific conditions of the patients. Nancy Writebol, an American aid worker from North Carolina who was infected with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia, arrives at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday. Her husband confirmed today that her condition is also improving . Nancy Writebol and her husband David were undertaking missionary work in Liberia when she contracted Ebola while helping those suffering from the disease . The aid groups referred questions to Emory, which has declined comment, citing patient privacy. David Writebol said since his wife arrived in Atlanta, she has received another dose of a treatment that's still in development and hasn't been tested in humans. Thel drug called ZMapp is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego. It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight off Ebola and is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the virus. At least one of the affected countries, Nigeria, has requested access to the experimental drug ZMapp, used on the two American aid workers. U.S. health officials have stressed that only extremely limited doses exist, the drug hasn't ever been tested in people and there's no proof it helped the two Americans. However the FDA has since 'verbally confirmed' changes to the hold that may allow the company to make the drug available, although it has yet to be proven as safe and effective. Despite the positive news from Dr Brantly on Friday, the World Health Organisation has declared that Africa's Ebola outbreak is spreading beyond the control of top medics and poses a serious threat to the rest of the globe. Four West African nations have recorded almost 1,800 cases as bodies were left in the streets and at least 961 people have died - including 80 medics. Today WHO's director-general declared the outbreak is moving 'faster than we can control it' as it emerged another 29 people have died in just two days.","Dr Kent Brantly put out a statement on Friday through his aid organization saying that his health was improving .

"By . Stephen Adams . and Ollie Gillman . 'Wasting NHS money': Sarah-Jane Marsh, partner of Sir David since 2002, is chief executive at Birmingham Children's Hospital . The wife of embattled NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has been accused of overpaying staff at the children’s hospital she runs by more than £1 million. Sarah-Jane Marsh is chief executive at Birmingham Children’s Hospital where 634 overpayments totalling £1.3 million were handed out between November 2010 and November 2013. The hospital has still to claim back £800,000 – meaning it is currently owed more money by staff than any other trust in England. Last night Tory MP Charlotte Leslie called Ms Marsh’s competency into question, saying she was ‘very concerned’ at the chief executive’s ability to run the hospital. Ms Leslie, a member of the House of Commons Health Select Committee, also raised the question about how Ms Marsh came to be appointed nearly five years ago at the age of 32, making her one of the youngest hospital bosses in the country. She said: ‘There are big questions over her competence and how she got that job in the first place. ‘She is wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money because she can’t run a tight ship. I am very concerned.’ She added: ‘It is tremendously concerning that this money has not gone towards the care of children.’ Ms Marsh, who announced she was to marry Sir David at the end of 2009, first met him in 2002 when, as an NHS graduate trainee, she was sent to work as his assistant for six months. At the time he was director of health and social care for the Midlands and East of England. The following year he gave her a reference when she applied for the post of head of planning and development at Walsall Hospitals NHS Trust. She got the job. He also gave her a reference when she applied to be chief operating officer at Birmingham Children’s Hospital in 2007, which she secured. In March 2009 she was made interim chief executive, and a couple of months later she was confirmed in  the £155,000-a-year post. This was despite having been in charge of day-to-day operations when the hospital was criticised by the Healthcare Commission for a lack of beds and poor training and care. That October Mr Nicholson and Ms Marsh announced their marriage plans. Sir David has always maintained he provided references only as a former employer and has stressed they were not in a relationship when he gave them. Her reference: Sir David announced he would be stepping down as chief executive of NHS England last May in the wake of the Stafford Hospital care scandal . The extent of overpayment has come to light thanks to a Freedom of Information request to all of England’s 159 NHS hospital trusts. According to responses from 112 of them, they paid out £50 million too much in 36,773 overpayments during the three-year period. They are still owed £11 million. Conservative MP Andrew Percy, another health committee member, said: ‘While the sums may look small in comparison to the NHS budget, they equate to very many nurses.’ Asked about Ms Marsh’s competence, Birmingham Children’s Hospital chairman Keith Lester said yesterday: ‘Sarah-Jane Marsh is a compassionate and committed leader who puts children, young people, and families first. Her track record over the past five years speaks for itself.’ Last month the £235 million-a-year hospital was given an excellent report by the Care Quality Commission. NHS trusts said human error or  miscalculation of overtime was most often to blame for overpayments, and staff often paid back the money through payroll. Last May Sir David announced he would be stepping down as chief executive of NHS England. The decision came after intense criticism from campaigners and MPs, following publication of the Francis report into the Stafford Hospital care scandal, in which up to 1,200 patients died. lSir David has appeared to mock Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a tweet to a spoof account that lampoons the Minister. ‘Hello Jeremy any instructions for the weekend,’ he wrote to @Jeremy_Twunt, whose 3,566 followers include NHS workers who don’t like Mr Hunt. The Minister has taken to ringing hospital chiefs personally  if they miss their targets.","Sarah-Jane Marsh is chief executive at Birmingham Children’s Hospital .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Richard Shears . A possible fifth 'ping' from the black box of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been detected by a surveillance plane conducting an acoustic search, Australian officials said. The latest signal was picked up by an Australian P-3 Orion aircraft, with on-board instruments tracing it to the same area where two pings were heard this week by Australian ship Ocean Shield. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is . co-ordinating the search in Perth, said on Thursday: 'The acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man-made source.' Scroll down for video . An AP-3C Orion returns to RAAF Base Pearce after a day of searching an area in the Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . 'Encouraging': A total of four signals, matching those of a black box flight recorder, have now been detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the search for flight MH370 . The search co-ordination agency headed by retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston says there is now doubt over whether the pings recorded by search vessels are from the black box of the missing MH370 aircraft . Earlier he said the discovery by Ocean Shield was . 'further encouraging' news in the search for MH370. He said the detection, on Tuesday afternoon, was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds, while the second was held for about seven minutes. 'Yesterday's [Tuesday's] signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor' he said. Despite what Mr Houston described as 'further encouraging findings' he said that the underwater vehicle 'Blue Fin 21', which can 'sniff out' objects deep in the ocean, would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed. 'I believe we are searching in the right area, but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,' he said. 'I'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage.' More signals: A handout image released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) shows the search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where  15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight MH370 more than a month after it disappeared . A map from AMSA shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight MH370 . However, U.S. Navy Captain Mark . Matthews said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is . somewhere within about a 12-mile radius. That would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the Bluefin sub between six weeks to two months to canvas. Data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder, said the air chief marshal. The Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis . Centre based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, on the NSW coast south of . Sydney, concluded that the two detections were from a source that was . not of 'natural origin' and was 'likely sourced' from specific . electronic equipment. Mr . Houston, pointing out that his optimism had risen since Sunday, warned . that a lot of silt could complicate the search, which is being boosted . by a sonar buoy and a modified RAAF P3 aircraft to co-ordinate with . Ocean Shield. 'It's . important for Ocean Shield to collect as much data as possible ahead of . deploying Blue Fin 21,' he said. 'The reason we want to do that is . there's no second chances.' The pings detected by the Australian Defence vessel Ocean Shield's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern Indian Ocean may now not be released . The towed pinger locator (TPL-25) on the deck of the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield detected two  signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder, but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with MH370 . The Bluefin 21 submarine drone, which will be used to scour the seabed for MH370 once the search area in narrowed down further, is hosited on board the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield after buoyanct testing . He warned that the recently-detected . signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - 'so . that means probably we're either a long way from it, or in my view, more . likely, the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the . signal is becoming weaker.' He added: 'So we need to, as we say in Australia, make hay while the sun shines.' Ocean . Shield, he said, would be looking to pick up more transmissions that . would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from. Once the search area has been narrowed, ships and aircraft could then find something in 'a matter of days,' he suggested. He . continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the . plane's final resting place, despite what he believed were signals from . dying batteries. Bluefin . 21, takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator, . which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres. A RAAF P3 Orion is seen parked on the tarmac after returning from a search mission for debris from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 yesterday . Iinitial confidence of Royal Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy (pictured, right, with search chief Angus Houston last month) of the recorded pings being from missing MH370 has now waned . The sub's sonar can scan only . about 100 metres and it can 'see' with lights and cameras only a few . metres. The maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres, and some areas of . the search zone are deeper. Search . crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor . that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds . emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there, said Mr Leavy, . who is helping to lead the search. Captain Matthews said: 'It's . certainly a man-made device emitting that signal and I have . no explanation for what other component could be there. 'I'm . an engineer so I don't talk emotions too much. But . certainly when I received word that they had another detection, you feel . elated. 'You're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved.'","Latest signal picked up in area where other pings have been heard .

"By . Ollie Gillman . An elderly couple were shocked to find that a battered bowl their cat used for a bed was actually a Ming dynasty antique worth a fortune. The owners, from Essex, put the ceramic piece up for sale because they were moving house, and were told by auctioneers to expect around £200. However, the scratched and chipped 'bed', which had been in their family for 114 years, was sold for £108,000 to a mystery bidder. This Ming Dynasty bowl - used as a bed by a couple's cat - has sold for £108,000 . The elderly pair decided to sell the ceramic piece because they are moving house . The bowl was among a collection of antiques brought back to Britain from China in 1900 by one of the owners' great-grandfather, Major General John Tulloch. Over the years, the owners donated most of their ceramics to museums and only kept pieces that had been damaged. They decided to sell their last nine remaining items at auction because they are moving house. Online punters from around the world joined 15 bidders, including some from China,  for the frantic bidding war for the moggy's makeshift bed. The detail on the bowl shows it could be from 15th century - during the Ming Dynasty . Auctioneers gave the chipped 'Ming-style' bowl a £200 estimate but were overwhelmed by the amount of interest in it from Chinese bidders. It sold for £90,000 - or £108,000 including fees - suggesting the bowl is authentic and dates back to the Imperial Ming dynasty, which ran from 1368 to 1644. An 11in, 19th century tall vase with a damaged lid also sold for nearly £40,000. And a scratched yellow saucer dish with a hairline crack fetched more than £11,000. The lots had been passed down through the owners' family for 114 years . James Grinter, from Reeman Dansie Auctioneers, said: 'There were about a dozen items from the same family. They were all in a bit of a state but they all did very well. 'The owners' cat used to sleep in the Ming bowl on top of a chest of drawers in the hallway of their house. 'It had a few chips in and had a staple repair - it was quite obvious damage to look at. 'We described it as Ming-style because it was hard to date and put a low estimate of £200 to £300 on it. The couple sold a number of other antiques - including a saucer which fetched more than £11,000 . 'But there was huge interest in it. I couldn't keep up with the bidding that was coming from online as well as 15 bidders in the room. 'I think the reason it did so well is because all of the lots had a cast-iron provenance. 'One of the owners' great-grandfather, who was a Major General in the Indian Army, acquired most of it while he was in China in 1900 and brought it back to England with him. 'It has all been passed down through the family. The lots that sold are the last pieces of the collection.'","Essex owners were moving house and thought bowl would fetch £200 at auction .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Everyone cares about their personal safety, but when queuing to see a World Cup game, or before boarding a plane, lengthy security measures can seem like a drag. A new security checkpoint, which resembles hi-tech honeycomb, promises to speed up this tedious process - and has already proved a success at the Arena da Baixada stadium in Curitiba, Brazil. The machine scans the contents of bags in seconds to detect weapons and chemicals - without guests having to open them up -  and can also process tickets for events, five customers at a time. Scroll down for video . A new security checkpoint (pictured), which resembles hi-tech honeycomb, promises to speed up the tedious process of checking bags. It scans the bags and processes up to five tickets at a time to get football fans into stadiums faster . The scanner processes tickets for events, and scans bags at the same time to cut security queues. People open one of the doors and place their closed bag inside, before walking round it and collecting the bag at the other side, which has been security checked in a matter of seconds. It was trialled at the Arena da Baixada stadium in Curitiba, Brazil for the World Cup. It can handle five customers at a time. Less security staff are needed as a result of using the machine and it helps protect people's privacy. There are no details about how the machine works exactly, but it uses multiple sensors and an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyse the contents of people's bags to spot weapons and chemicals. The company behind the scanner says it will be rolled out at more stadiums and possibly airports in the future. Qylur Security Systems, based in Silicon Valley, California, deployed its Qylatron Entry Experience Solution for security screening at the stadium, which has a capacity of 43,900. ‘The Qylatron automated detection system not only provided highly reliable bag screening, it also put fans ""back in charge"" of their own belongings as the nature of the Qylatron allowed fans to place their items into the honeycomb shaped device - that conducts five concurrent bag scans - and expedite their entry into the stadium,’ said Hugo Ramos, director for Agogo Marketing Promocional, which organised the security for some of the World Cup stadiums. ‘Rather than having stadium officials hand search personal bags, the Qylatron protects the personal dignity of fans and preserves the entertaining aspects of mass sporting events like the World Cup.’ The system is designed to speed up the process of people getting into large sporting events and pop concerts, and could be tried out at airports In the future. To use the device, people open one of the doors in the hexagon and place their bag inside. They then walk round to the other side of the large device, by which time their bag has been scanned. Qylur Security Systems, based in Silicon Valley, California, deployed its Qylatron Entry Experience Solution for the Arena da Baixada stadium in Curitiba, Brazil, (pictured) which hosted World Cup games and has a capacity of 43,900 . At the same time, the machine can also process people’s tickets. And because there are lots of security scanners in the one unit, five customers can go through the security check at once. The company claims the machine is the first to combine the initial greeting and ticketing experience for fans, with security screening. It added that the Oylatron scans the tickets and bags with far greater efficiency than humans, can detect security threats, improve guest experience and cut security costs by up to 50 per cent. The California Company has not disclosed exactly how the machine works but says it uses a ‘fusion of multiple sensors’ to check for certain chemicals and materials. Its artificial intelligence algorithm analyses ‘sensory output’ in a bid to eliminate ‘all too frequent human error, ensuring higher detection rates, reducing false alarms while maintaining very high efficiency.’ ‘Equipped with an intelligent, threat-learning engine and ongoing updates, the Qylatron is able to respond to ever-evolving threats, both locally and globally,’ it said. Lisa Dolev, CEO and founder of Qylur  said: ‘We heard from dozens of soccer fans at the World Cup about how much fun they had personally interacting with the Qylatron. ‘This is especially gratifying as it validates the core principle of why I founded Qylur -- to preserve human liberty while offering the most advanced security-screening technology in the industry.’ The system is designed to speed up the process of people getting into large sporting events and pop concerts and could be tried out at airports In the future.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A class of insecticide called neonicotinoids have already been proved to harm honeybee colonies. And now Dutch researchers have discovered that starlings and swallows disappear in areas treated with the chemical. It is the first time that scientists have directly linked a neonicotinoid called imidacloprid to the death of birds. Scroll down for video . Dutch researchers have discovered that starlings and swallows (pictured) disappear in areas highly treated with an insecticide called imidacloprid, which is a type of neonicotinoid already proven to kill off honeybees . Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world. The class of neonictinoid insecticide has been linked to the death of 15 species of birds in the Netherlands. Scientists found that the higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water studied, the greater the decline in bird numbers. Numbers of the birds studied decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre. This concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the Netherlands. They noted that populations of 15 species of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid. The experts looked closely at data on local bird population trends and environmental factors, which include imidacloprid concentrations in surface water, to come up with their findings, which were published in the journal Nature. It is the first study to correlate imidacloprid, which is the most widely used insecticide in the world, to possible indirect harmful side effects via the food chain, for birds. Ecologists at Radboud University Nijmegen and the Sovon Centre for Field Ornithology in the Netherlands, explained the trend by identifying concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface water in relation to other factors, such as land use. The higher the concentrations of the insecticide in the water, the greater the decline in bird numbers was seen. Populations of 15 bird species declined by 3.5 per cent on average in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid (marked in white on the map) and other regions (marked in orange and red) had higher concentrations of the insecticide in the water . The focused their study on the starling and barn swallow, which are common in the area. Ruud Foppen from the Sovon Centre explained that the species are relatively easy to study because there is lots of data on them to analyse densities and trends in their numbers. Most of the birds forage around ditches, hedgerows and field margins to find the insects, which they eat. And many of the insects spend part of their life cycle in water, so the scientists measured the water quality taken by district water boards. They found that higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water, the greater the decline in bird numbers. For the fifteen bird species that were included in the study, populations decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre. This concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the Netherlands. Populations of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid. A tractor spraying crops with insecticide is pictured . It is the first study to correlate imidacloprid, which is the most widely used insecticide in the world, to possible indirect harmful side effects, via the food chain, for birds such as the starling (pictured) Experts have previously proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter, particularly when temperatures drop. Research released in May revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives. The study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, strengthens the scientists’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder (CCD) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die. We demonstrated again in this study that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering CCD in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter,’ said lead author Chensheng (Alex) Lu, associate professor of environmental exposure biology at HSPH. Since 2006, there have been significant losses of honeybees from CCD. Pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide. Experts have considered a number of possible causes, including pathogen infestation, beekeeping practices, and pesticide exposure. Recent findings suggest that CCD is related specifically to neonicotinoids including imidacloprid and clothianidin, which may impair bees’ neurological functions.","Imidacloprid has been linked to declining bird populations for the first time .

"By . Sarah Dean . A man who blindly jumped off a cliff with a bucket on his head has admitted it was one of the most ridiculous things he has 'ever done'. James Thomas-Hall, who goes by the name James Kangaroo, had no idea how close he came to smashing into the ground at Brisbane's Kangaroo Point, until he watched the shocking video back. The 33-year-old from a small town near Byron Bay, NSW, performed the stunt seven years ago. Scroll down for video . Facing danger: James Thomas-Hall, who goes by the name James Kangaroo, jumped off a cliff with a bucket on his head . The video shows him standing at the top of a jagged cliff, where his best friend 'Boof' held onto the rope that would allow him to jump off the cliff in a bungee jump style stunt. 'Boof had absolute control of how fast I went,' Mr Thomas-Hall told the Daily Mail Australia. 'There is no one else in the world I would have trusted with that,' he added. Trusting: His friend 'Boof' was in charge of the rope which saved him from hitting the floor . Plummeting: The daredevil feel head first down the jagged cliff with the blue bucket on his head . Before he jumps, the reckless daredevil does a dance, with the blue bucket concealing his sight, and shouts 'watch me fall down'. He then leaps off the edge and begins to scream as he plummets down the cliff face. His feet run down the first part of the cliff but then he starts to tip head first. An almighty crunch can be heard as he reaches the bottom and narrowly avoids crashing into the floor by just a couple of feet. The 33-year-old performed the stunt seven years ago . Dangerous: He banged his shoulder and received a bruise but did not break any bones . He dangles at the bottom and tries to turn himself the right way up again. Mr Thomas-Hall said the crunching sound was not that of his bones breaking but the bucket hitting the rocks. 'The bucket saved me,' he laughed. He explained that he actually survived the stunt with just a very large bruise to his shoulder which stuck around for about a month. 'Lucky to be here': Mr Thomas-Hall said the bucket saved him when he hit the rock . Mr Thomas-Hall, who is a keen abseiler, admitted: 'I'm lucky still to be here.' Despite taking part in numerous dangerous stunts he said the worst pain he has ever felt was when he had his tooth taken out and that he has never broken any bones. 'I've done a lot of silly things in my life,' he confessed.","James Thomas-Hall jumped off the cliff at Brisbane's Kangaroo Point seven years ago .

"By . Ollie Gillman . and Jonathan Petre . Civil servants spent thousands of working hours visiting a cricket website over the summer when England’s Ashes battle with Australia was in full swing, new figures have revealed. Mandarins at the Treasury, the Department of Health and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) face accusations of wasting time after they logged on to cricket website espncricinfo.com at least four million times from January to August this year. The five-Test Ashes series ran from July to the end of August. With the nation transfixed by the fluctuating fortunes of the teams, civil servants were able to keep track of all the twists and turns of the five match Test series from their desks. Heroes: England captain Alastair Cook with the Ashes after his team's success. Figures show civil servants logged on to see the scores four million times . Defra calculated its staff spent 1,810 hours connected to the cricket website over a five-month period, clicking on it nearly 850,000 times. But Whitehall insiders said that although staff may have logged on to the site in the morning, they would not have spent all those hours glued to it because they would have then opened other work-related pages and checked on the cricket only occasionally. Time consuming: MP Nick de Bois said there should be less time-consuming ways for Government employees to keep track of the Ashes score. 'I can understand the appetite for the Ashes, but it might be cheaper for the Sports Minister to update fans with the odd email now and then.' he said . Figures are not available for how many hours the other two departments spent logged on to the site, though Treasury officials visited it nearly 2.5 million times over six months, while Department of Health staff visited it on more than 1.5 million occasions over seven months – far more than their Defra counterparts. Conservative MP and cricket fan Priti Patel said civil servants should have saved their Ashes fever until after working hours. ‘While we should get behind our team, civil servants should spend the time they are paid  to work focused on doing their jobs rather than following cricket.’ Fellow MP Nick de Bois said there should be less time-consuming ways for Government employees to keep track of the Ashes score. ‘I . can understand the appetite for the Ashes, but it might be cheaper for . the Sports Minister to update fans with the odd email now and then.’ The . figures, revealed following a number of Freedom of Information Act . requests, also found that Defra staff spent 2,600 hours on Facebook, . ‘hitting’ the site nearly four million times.

A band of South African computer scientists and engineers created Backtracker to give cyclists a ‘sixth sense’ and are now raising money to put it into production on crowd funding site Dragon Innovation. They wrote on their fundraising page: ‘As cyclists, we know the joy of taking to the open road. We also know the dangers, and rear approaching vehicles represent the worst kind. ‘We don’t always hear them approaching, and motorists are often blissfully unaware of cyclists. ‘In 2010 we set the task of solving this challenge in the hope of gaining some peace of mind while enjoying the fresh air.’ A handlebar mounted device (pictured left) gives cyclists the speed and distance of vehicles coming up behind them, while a rear-mounted smart light (right) warns drivers of a cyclist's presence by flashing increasingly furiously the closer they get . Comprised of two gadgets that clip onto a bike, the system has been designed to allay fears of being hit from behind by a car. A microradar mounted on the handlebars detects and tracks cars behind a bike. It gives a cyclist the speed and distance of rear approaching vehicles from up to 150 yards (140 metres) away. A green light represents the cyclist’s position on the gadget and a white light moves closer to it to reveal the position of a car as it closes in on the cyclist. ‘The beauty of a radar is that it can see through rain and fog,’ the firm, iKubu’s, managing director, Franz Struwig explained. The company says that this gadget allows cyclists to know what is going on behind him so they can focus on the road ahead. Another unit, displayed on the back of a bike, uses an intelligent system to increase the frequency of a flashing light, the closer a driver gets to a cyclist. ‘Backtracker really serves as a sixth sense, giving you information so you can make the best decisions in a situation,’ Mr Struwig added.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Flooding threatens villages today, yet we are able to build defences such as walls and reservoirs. Bronze Age people living in northern Europe had a more macabre solution, however. Ancient settlements offered hacked children’s skulls to the local lake gods in order to protect their homes, archaeologists have claimed. The skulls were found forming a protective ring around settlements near lakes in Switzerland and Germany. Victims of war: While some of the skulls show signs of head trauma, including slashes inflicted by axes (pictured) it is not thought that the children were human sacrifices . The skulls were discovered around the perimeter of three ancient villages in modern day Switzerland and Germany. Some of them show signs of head trauma as the result of blows from an axe and club. Archaeologists think that the children were victims of war, rather than of ritual human sacrifice. They were placed by Bronze Age people at the point at which the lakes flooded their homes. Experts think they were used as offering to place the lake gods in a bid to mitigate the flooding. It is thought that the skulls were relatively old when they were re purposed as a macabre type of flood defence. While some of the skulls show signs of head trauma - including slashes inflicted by axes - it is not thought that the children were human sacrifices. Instead, experts from Basel University, Switzerland believe that bones from long-dead children were offered to lake gods in order to keep rising water levels at bay. The study, published in the journal Antiquity, says: ‘Several of the children had suffered violent deaths, through blows to the head from axes or blunt instruments. ‘They do not appear to have been human sacrifices, but the skulls may nonetheless have been offerings to the gods by communities faced with the threat of environmental change.’ Mapped: The macabre approach to flood prevention has been found at three sites (marked on this map). Ancient people placed the skulls of children around the perimeters of the villages, especially in places where the water levels rose . Benjamin Jennings, an archaeologist at the university, explained that the Bronze Age lake dwellers faced regular flooding and often moved away from lakes to drier land, only to return later when the water receded. In order to maximise the time they could spend by the lakes, they built specially adapted houses. ‘The houses were either elevated on stilts (if the village was erected close to or in the water), or on top of a well-insulated wooden surface built directly on the ground (if the settlement was far enough from the lake-shore),’ the study says. And to supplement such practical defences, they also took more superstitious measures. Archaeologists uncovered ‘evidence of unusual and macabre human behaviour intended to counter the threat of environmental change’. Placed with precision: The archeologist said: 'At the sites, the remains are found at the perimeter of the settlement - not inside and not outside, but at a liminal position on the border between in and out'. The drawing shows their location around the village boundaries . The ancient . people placed the skulls of children around the village’s perimeter, . especially in places where the water levels rose particularly dramatically. Archaeologists think the bones were intended as ‘gifts to the gods long after primary burial, in order to stop the threatening floods.’ These winged axes from Wasserburg-Buchau are similar in form to the ones that would have been used in Bronze Age battles and inflicted the head wounds on the children . ‘A striking similarity that binds all the child skeletal remains together is the location where they were deposited; all of them were found near the settlement perimeter,’ the study says. ‘All the remains were deposited exactly at the time when the severity of flooding became greater.’ By analysing the skulls, the experts found that most of the children were under 10 years old when they died. While they found evidence of tooth decay and respiratory diseases, they said that they would not have been enough to kill the children. Instead, the archaeologists believe that they died as a result of blows to the head with axes and clubs, which would probably have been sustained during a war. They said they the injuries were not similar enough to suggest a type of ritual killing, or human sacrifice. Dr Jennings told LiveScience: ‘Across Europe as a whole there is quite a body of evidence to indicate that throughout prehistory human remains, and particularly the skull, were highly symbolic and socially charged.’ At the sites, ‘the remains are found at the perimeter of the settlement - not inside and not outside, but at a liminal position on the border between in and out.’ Archaeologists first discovered the ancient alpine villages in 1854 but they were only excavated - yielding bones, dwellings, tools, pottery and jewellery - in the 1970s. Some wooden artefacts suggest that people lived in such settlements between 3,800 and 2,600 years ago, but little is known about their belief system. Dr Jennings said: ‘There are very few instance or examples of burials in the vicinity of the lake settlements, and so we really do not know where the majority of the lake dwellers are buried, or how they treated their dead.’ Hacked: Archaeologists believe that the skulls were intended as 'gifts to the gods long after primary burial, in order to stop the threatening floods'. Some of the bones analysed show wounds inflicted by axes and clubs during a war (illustrated)","Skulls were found forming a protective rings around settlements near lakes in Switzerland and Germany .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Muscling though crowds in a packed pub to queue up and order drinks at the bar can take the edge off a good night out. But a new app allows you to skip the tedium of trying to attract the attention of bar staff and instead place an order on your phone. Orderella allows customers at certain pubs to order and pay for their food and drinks at the touch of a button. Scroll down for video . Pick up a pint: A new app called Orderella (pictured) allows you to skip the tedium of trying to attract the attention of bar staff and instead order a drink using s smartphone . German researchers last year shared some tips on how to get served fastest at a bar. They said that busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them, instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers. The scientists' study of body language is being used to develop a bartending robot that will be able to spot who really wants a drink and serve them in the fairest order. Researchers from the Bielefeld University found nine out of 10 thirsty customers adopted the subtle approach of deliberately facing the bar, which is the most successful for getting noticed and served, according to the study. By contrast, only one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they would like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender. The study looked at recordings of customers at nightclubs in Edinburgh and Germany to analyse how their body language attracted the bar staff’s attention. When their order is ready, it can be brought to their table or customers receive a message when they can collect it without any hassle. Payments can be made through the app, so there is also no need to wait around for the bill either. The app is currently being trialled by four pubs in Brighton, East Sussex, with the aim of rolling out to 37 InnBrighton pubs in the near future. Gavin George, chief executive of InnBrighton, said: ‘Orderella is very appealing to the sociable, cultured, tech-savvy customers who enjoy InnBrighton pubs. ‘When . you’re in deep conversation or soaking up the sun in a beautiful beer . garden, it’s great to have the choice to order from your table and have . your drinks brought to you. ‘We look forward to it becoming a key tool in our customer service kit.’ No more queues: Customers can order food and drinks on their smartphone (pictured) and when theiir order is ready it can be brought to their table.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An incredible dinosaur track site with perfectly preserved footprints has been discovered in Denali National Park, Alaska. The footprints belong to herds of duck-billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs, which thrived in the ancient high-latitude, polar ecosystem in the Late Cretaceous period between 100 and 66 million years ago. They roamed the area in large family groups, travelling across the rugged terrain together. An incredible dinosaur track site with perfectly preserved footprints has been discovered in Denali National Park, Alaska. One of the larger prints is pictured . Hadrosaurids, or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the family Hadrosauridae. The family includes lots of dinosaurs that were common herbivores in the Upper Cretaceous Period between 100 and 66million years ago. They lives in what is now Asia, Europe and North America. They are descendants of the iguanodontian dinosaurs of the Upper Jurassic period. Hadrosaurs are known as the duck-billed dinosaurs because of the sim8ilarity of the shape of their heads to modern ducks. The tracks show they travelled in large groups with babies travelling alongside much larger adults. Some of the footprints are so detailed that they reveal the creatures’ skin texture. Even tracks of bugs and worms can be seen. The footprints were found by three palaeontologists in 2007, when the Upper Cretaceous Cantwell Formation in the Alaska Range of Denali had not been explored. On the last day, perched precariously on the steep side of the mountain, Anthony Fiorello, of Pernot Museum, Dallas, Texas and paleontologists from the University of Kansas and Hokkaido University Museum, were ‘giddy – somewhere between giggling and crying’ when they came across the wealth of tracks. ‘Without question, Denali is one of the best dinosaur footprint localities in the world, but what we found that last day was incredible – so many tracks, so big, and so well preserved,’ said Dr Fiorillo. 'The Denali tracksite (pictured) is extremely significant to the reconstruction of this Cretaceous high latitude polar ecosystem, Dr Stephen Hasiotis of the University of Kansas said. 'The hadrosaur tracks show specifically where they lived and how they acted as an extended family' The footprints belong to mulch-generational herds of duck-billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs (illustrated) which thrived in the ancient high-latitude, polar ecosystem . ‘Many had skin impressions so we could even see what the bottom of their feet looked like. And there were lots of invertebrate traces - the tracks of bugs, worms, larvae and more - which were important to us because they showed an ecosystem existed during the warm parts of the years.’ The paper, published in the journal Geology, provides an insight into the heard structure of hadrosaurs, which lived as families within the warmer-than-expected Arctic climate. ‘The Denali tracksite is extremely significant to the reconstruction of this Cretaceous high latitude polar ecosystem as it demonstrates higher annual temperatures compared to the present-day climate,’ Dr Stephen Hasiotis of the University of Kansas explained. ‘The hadrosaur tracks show specifically where they lived and how they acted as an extended family. The dinosaur track site was discovered in Denali National Park, Alaska (mapped) in 2007 by three palaeontologists . Some of the footprints (pictured) are so detailed that they show what the creatures' skin looked like and tracks of bugs and worms were also revealed . ‘The burrows and trails of mud-loving beetles, mole crickets, midge fly larvae, and other sediment-dwelling beasties demonstrate that the whole cast of characters left their traces of life in the river bank sediments during the warm summer months - frozen in time, waiting to be discovered.’ The three paleontologists returned to the site to accurately measure and analyse the prints, which showed that four different age classes of Hadrosaurids – adults, sub-adults, juveniles and very young individuals – lived together in a large social group. The team’s research also suggests that the Hadrosaurid dinosaurs – affectionately known as the ‘cows of the Cretaceous,’ experienced a period of rapid growth in their life history. ‘This is one of the greatest dinosaur tracksites in the world in terms of size, number, and quality.  We could see how hadrosaurs walked, ran, or slipped on muddy surface. Perched precariously on the steep side of the mountain (pictured) the palaeontologists were 'giddy - somewhere between giggling and crying' when they came across the wealth of tracks . 'This is one of the greatest dinosaur tracksites in the world in terms of size, number, and quality.  We could see how hadrosaurs walked, ran, or slipped on muddy surface,' said Dr Kobayashi of Hokkaido University Museum.  A deep footprint is pictured . ‘Footprints were so vivid that we almost could see and smell them,’ said Dr Kobayashi of Hokkaido University Museum. ‘We were so excited when we found tiny, baby footprints, because we instantly knew this was the evidence to support the polar hadrosaurs survived through winters and lived as a herd to protect each other like other mammals do.’ The trio realised that the single bedding plane site was at risk from earthquake and could crumble and slide down the mountain into a nearby river. So Denali National Park helped the paleontologists remove and preserve the specimens. The moulds were then transported to the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas where they are now on display.

"By . Reuters . The U.S. missile defense system managed by Boeing Co on Sunday hit a simulated enemy missile over the Pacific in the first successful intercept test of the program since 2008, the U.S. Defense Department said. The successful intercept will help validate the troubled Boeing-run Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system which provides the sole U.S. defense against long-range ballistic missiles, and the Raytheon Co kill vehicle that separates from the rocket and hits an incoming warhead. 'This is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland ballistic missile defense system,' said Missile Defense Agency (MDA)Director Vice Admiral James Syring. A successful flight test of the exercising elements of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is launched by the 30th Space Wing and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency . He said the agency would continue its ongoing drive to ensure that the ground-based interceptors and overall homeland defense system were effective and dependable. Reuters reported on Friday that the Pentagon is restructuring its $3.48 billion contract with Boeing for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability. Sunday's high-stakes test came after the system had failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight previous tests since the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea. Earlier this month, Syring said that another test failure would have forced the Pentagon to reassess its plans to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in silos in the ground in Alaska and California. During the test, a long-range ground-based interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile target launched from the U.S. Army's Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Pentagon said. A successful missile test of the exercising elements of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is launched by the 30th Space Wing and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency . It said all components involved in the test appeared to have performed as designed. Program officials will spend the next several months assessing the performance of the system using telemetry and other data obtained during the test. The test marked the first successful intercept by Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Capability Enhancement II, or EKV CE-II, which failed in both previous tests conducted in 2010. The companies involved had no immediate comment. Ten of the interceptors now in place carry the kill vehicle used in Sunday's test. The other 20 carry an earlier kill vehicle that failed in a July 2013 test. Syring has said a fix will be implemented for that issue by year's end. Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, hailed the successful test as a big step forward for the troubled program, and said it would allow U.S. military commanders to reduce the number of interceptors that would be fired at an incoming ballistic missile. 'This success is a significant milestone ... that demonstrates the system's reliability and increases the confidence of the North American Combatant Commander ... responsible for the defense of the country,"" he said. Critics said the Raytheon kill vehicle had still only succeeded in one of three tries, and urged Congress to rethink plans to buy 14 more of the flawed interceptors at a cost of $75 million each, or just over $1 billion. 'Would you spend $1 billion on an insurance policy that only worked one third of the time?' said Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. ""We need to put the money into making the system better, not bigger."" Phil Coyle, former Pentagon chief tester and a longtime critic, called for accelerated work on a new design. 'We need to make sure we have a system that works, not expand a system we know to be deeply flawed,' he said in a statement.

Officers discovered 11 bags of heroin in the classroom, some of which may have been opened or chewed on. 'We know that one of the packages clearly looks like it was bitten,' said Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker. Little said 20 children were taken to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. None showed signs of injury and all of the children have been released to their parents. Police said they did not know how the child obtained the heroin. 'Someone has to be liable for this,' Little said. 11 packs of heroin were brought to  Commodore John Barry Elementary School in Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia on Tuesday . A teacher took action as soon as she noticed the situation in the classroom. 'Their teacher did a remarkable job,' Walker said. 'They saw the child with these items. The teacher recognized right away, took control and notified another teacher.' Police believe that the little girl who brought in the heroin is the only certain one who had contact with the drug. 'The only person who we're sure had contact with the product at this point was the young female that brought it in,' said Philadelphia Police Cpt. John Przepiorka. 'The young girl that brought it in did feel a little dizzy and didn't feel well. So we sent her over to CHOP to make sure she's okay.' Both the girl and her siblings will be cared for by DHS officials. A relative of the girl named Tamika Gore spoke to NBC and said, 'She probably found it. I have no idea. I know it ain't come from her house. I know that for a fact.' The school sent a letter home to parents to notify them that their children may have come into contact with an illegal substance. 'This school is crazy,' said Ayana Hales, a parent of students at Barry Elementary. 'My kids, I want them out of here.' One of the 11 packs of heroin (pictured) appeared to have been 'chewed on' and the little hgirl who brought it to her school complained of feeling dizzy .","The mother of the 6-year-old and her boyfriend are being questioned by police and their home is being searched .

Lawyers for Verizon demanded that Netflix immediately stop displaying messages to customers that place blame on Verizon's broadband service for slow delivery of Netflix TV shows and movies. In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Netflix, Verizon also asked Netflix to provide a list of customers on the Verizon network to whom Netflix delivered the notices and other information or face legal action.'

Failure to provide this information may lead us to pursue legal remedies,' Verizon general counsel Randal Milch said in a letter to Netflix general counsel David Hyman. In mid-May, Netflix started displaying messages on the screen for some customers when a video is buffering that say there is congestion on the network of Verizon or another Internet service providers. Netflix said on Thursday the messages are meant to provide customers more information about their service, similar to its publication of a speed index that ranks Internet service providers. 'This is about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband provider,' Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland said.

In a moment of calm before the storm, a priest blesses the runners and riders who are about to take part in an historic race that has been held in an Italian city for hundreds of years. The Palio medieval race has been held twice a year, every year, almost without fail since the mid-1600s.

The origins of the race are believed to come from the medieval period when the piazza would have been the site of a number of public games, mainly combative. Public races were organised by the contrade from the 14th century but they generally went across the city. When bullfighting was outlawed by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1590, the contrade started to organise the races in Piazza del Campo. Originally races were held on buffalos, while the first modern Palio on horseback took place in 1656.

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . As many as 75 scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta may have been exposed to dangerous anthrax bacteria because of a safety problem at one of its labs. Agency officials at the U.S. federal government labs say the risk of infection is low, but that all of the potentially affected staff members are being monitored or given antibiotics as a precaution. The issue occurred when bacteria samples that were not completely inactivated were moved from a higher level biosafety lab to a lower level one that was not designed to handle such samples. Scroll down for video . Infection: As many as 75 people at federal labs in Atlanta may have come into contact with anthrax (pictured) following safety problems. The employees have not shown any symptoms but are being treated . The problem was discovered last Friday, . when live anthrax bacteria were found on some materials being gathered . for disposal, the CDC said in a statement. Dr Paul Meechan, director of the environmental health and safety compliance office at the CDC, told Reuters that after the discovery, the agency immediately began contacting individuals working in the labs who may have unknowingly handled live anthrax bacteria. 'No employee has shown any symptoms of anthrax illness,' Meechan said. He added that the normal incubation period can take up to five to seven days, though there are documented cases of the illness occurring some 60 days after exposure. Scene: The issue occurred at one of the labs for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta . Symptoms of anthrax infection differ depending on how the victim comes into contact with the bacteria - through touching, inhaling or consuming. If the subject touches the anthrax, symptoms usually start within seven days and can include itchy sores that form blisters and swelling. Immediate treatment is necessary as 20 per cent of those who touch anthrax may die if it spreads to their blood. If the victim inhales the anthrax, they might suffer from a fever, headache, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. The outlook is bleaker for those who inhale it - with up to 90 per cent of cases becoming fatal. If someone consumes meat infected with anthrax, symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and mouth sores and, again, treatment is vital because anthrax in the blood system is fatal. To test for anthrax, skin cultures or biopsies can be taken, as well as chest x-rays or spinal taps. If anthrax is found, antibiotics can be used to treat it. Meechan said as many as seven . researchers may have come into direct contact with the live anthrax, but . the agency is casting as wide a net as possible to make sure all . employees at the agency who may have walked into any of the labs at risk . are being offered treatment. Around 75 individuals are being offered a 60-day course of treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as well as an injection with an anthrax vaccine. Meechan said it is too early to determine whether the transfer was accidental or intentional. He said all employees who were doing procedures to inactivate the bacteria were working in a biosecurity laboratory and were 'tier one select agent approved,' meaning they had undergone a security reliability review and deemed to be 'stable, trustworthy individuals'. Meechan said the CDC is conducting an internal investigation to discover how the exposure occurred and said disciplinary measures would be taken if warranted. 'This should not have happened,' he said. For those exposed, he said: 'We're taking care of it. We will not let our people be at risk.' If scientists came into contact with the anthrax, they could experience a range of symptoms, including blisters, shortness of breath, fever and chest pain. According to LiveScience, anthrax infection kills due to the toxins the bacteria produced when they're in the body. A recent study revealed that the toxins, lethal toxin and edema toxin, attack the cells of the heart muscle and the liver. The toxins can penetrate immune cells, killing them and slowly breaking down the body's defense system, which causes hemorrhaging that floods the lungs - making it difficult to breathe - and poisons the bloodstream. The victim must be treated immediately because once it's in the bloodstream, it can be fatal.","The scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being monitored or given antibiotics as a precaution .

"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . For the second time in a week, the University of Technology Sydney's library has been evacuated due to a bomb threat. At 3pm this afternoon the Haymarket campus was cleared of students and staff, including the adjacent UTS campus building,  Building Five. Evacuation sirens sounded 'continuously' after NSW Police were alerted that the library had received a bomb threat. It's exactly one week since emergency services closed the campus after a bomb scare. Details about the bomb threat or any possible suspects are unknown. Students are evacuated from the Haymarket campus at the University of Technology Sydney, after the second bomb threat in a week. The bomb threat was to the library and adjacent Building Five . Mounted police arrived to evacuate the crowds from the university and nearby shopping centre Market City, telling people to leave the vicinity as quickly as they could in response to a bomb threat. The busy inner city streets quickly looked like 'a ghosttown' as hundreds of people were evacuated, with NSW Police reacting to the second bomb threat to the UTS library in a week . NSW Police were on site and allowed people to re-enter the Library and Building Five at around 5.45pm, almost three hours after the emergency evacuation. Police have called it a 'precautionary operation' and tell Daily Mail Australia 'the police operation has been finished and nothing was found.' The exclusion zone cordoned off the surrounding areas near the busy innercity campus, leaving the area 'like a ghost town' according to witness, UTS student David Barden. NSW Police suspended the light rail service at Haymarket, closed nearby Ultimo Road and pushed the exclusion zone past the Entertainment Centre. Students and staff were updated about the bomb scare through the University of Technology Sydney's various social media accounts . The Haymarket light rail was suspended as police cordoned off the area. A bystander writes on Twitter: 'this area was full ten minutes ago.' 19-year-old UTS Journalism Law student David Barden was evacuated from Building Five during both police operations. Mr Barden says this afternoon during the second bomb scare, people were more panicked and the police seemed more concerned than they were during last Monday's evacuation. 'Police seemed really worried this time. The exclusion zone they set last Monday was only 10-15 metres, but this time they told us to leave the vicinity straight away and get as far as we could from the general area. The exclusion zone pushed everybody in the area out towards the Capitol Theatre.' Mr Barden says that the 'atmosphere was so different this time', with everyone leaving the site almost immediately. 'People are definitely concerned. At first, students were thinking maybe it was just a hoax. But when the sirens didn't stop and more and more police arrived, including mounted police, people got quite panicked and weren't willing to wait around,' said Mr Barden. The university could not be reached for comment but stayed in contact with students through their Twitter accounts and the university email. Emergency services shut the area off for almost three hours as they investigated the university's second bomb threat in a week.","University evacuated after receiving second bomb threat in a week .

Newlyweds Ali and Paul Bartlett look out from the back of the replica Dodge Charger after they are pulled over by Dorset police on their way to their wedding reception because the driver sounded an illegal horn . It features a Dixie horn – a musical car horn – which was banned in the 70s. Vintage car enthusiast Wayne Duke, 34, sounded the horn twice as he drove through the village of Wyke Regis in Dorset after some well-wishers indicated to the happy couple by pretending to pull a horn with their arms. Groom Mr Bartlett, who is a carpenter, was stunned when he saw the police signalling to them to pull over. He said: ‘We were shocked when we saw the police flashing their lights – and realised they were for us. ‘They must have been chasing us through a great deal of traffic to get to catch up.’ Police asked Mr Duke to open the bonnet so they could inspect the horn.

"By . Harriet Hernando . This tiny scrap of land may be the smallest park in Britain - if not the in the world. The Councillor Gerald Lee Park, in Darlington, County Durham, is a tiny patch of private land measuring 450 square feet. The park, which is named after the town’s new mayor, is nestled beneath an advertising billboard. Park life: A woman walks past the Councillor Gerald Lee Park. Locals reckon it could be the smallest in Britain, and even in the world . It was created when a group of residents in Darlington decided to turn the site into an ‘environmentally aware space’ featuring plants, free drainage and a recycled bench. The Councillor Gerald Lee Park will soon be pitted against Prince’s Park in Burntwood, Staffordshire, in a bid to be named Britain’s Smallest Park. There is currently an ongoing debate between residents of Burntwood and Portland in Oregan over which park is the smallest in the world. The park in America, which is two-feet in diameter with soil and some vegetation, has the backing of the Guinness Book of World Records. The one in Burntwood is just 15 feet by 30 feet, but they are disputing whether Portland’s is a park at all due to its minuscule size. Residents in Darlington wanted to put the tiny park on the map, and now it could stand a chance to win the accolade of Britain's smallest park . Paul Harman, Labour Councillor for Darlington, said: ‘The idea to do this started as a joke. ‘Councillor Gerald Lee decided to go forward with this because it will put the area on the map. ‘It means something very important indeed. ‘Little pieces of land like this owned by the council costs an enormous amount to maintain and what this will do is encourage local people to look after them and love them. ‘It is about the people in our area being positive and taking control. ‘Any rivalry in becoming the smallest park in Britain, and maybe even the world, will encourage people to love where they live and this is great.’ The park, at the corner of South Feethams and Victoria Embankment, has been created by members of the South Terrace Residents Association in conjunction with Guerilla Gardeners Darlington Division. The project was also backed by fellow resident and local Labour councillor Paul Harman, who suggested naming the park after Conservative councillor Gerald Lee in recognition of his contribution to environmental issues in Darlington. Councillor Lee said: ‘It is a lovely idea and it is great to see people taking ownership of little green spaces for the benefit of the community.’","The Councillor Gerald Lee Park is named after the town's new mayor .

"By . Sam Webb . An inquest has ruled that Peter Barnes died from multiple injuries when his helicopter crashed after hitting a crane in central London . The pilot who died in a helicopter crash in central London had been diverted because of bad weather before his aircraft clipped a crane and then plunged to the ground, an inquest was told today. Pete Barnes, 50, died from multiple injuries after the helicopter he was flying hit a high-rise crane on The Tower at St George Wharf, Vauxhall, and crashed into Wandsworth Road at around 8am last Wednesday. Mr Barnes, a father of two, had been flying from Redhill Aerodrome in Surrey to Elstree in Hertfordshire but was diverted to Battersea heliport due to the bad weather, Southwark Coroner’s Court heard. After the crash the helicopter erupted into flames, killing Mr Barnes and passer-by Matt Wood, who was on his way to work when he was struck by falling debris. He was flying a twin-engine Agusta Westland 109 helicopter. Police, the fire brigade and the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) air ambulance all attended the scene and Mr Barnes was pronounced dead by the HEMS doctor, London Inner South Coroner Andrew Harris heard. Coroner’s officer Paul Gregory told the inquest: 'The circumstances are that Mr Barnes was fit and well and had a FAA medical certificate that was in date. 'He was the pilot of an Agusta 109 helicopter and he was flying from Redhill to Elstree when he was diverted. 'Due to the weather conditions he was diverted to Battersea helipad around 8am in the morning and the helicopter clipped the jib of a crane at St George's Wharf Tower which caused the helicopter to crash.

"By . Harriet Hernando . Three businessmen accused of being involved in the illegal sale of stolen railway cable have been cleared of all wrongdoing after a judge said they were ‘lured into breaking the law’ by pushy undercover police officers. Paul Dawson, 47, and Gary Young, 44, who did not wish to be pictured, and business partner Gary Ogden, 47,  were among 17 suspects arrested during a police sting operation into scrap metal dealers who officers suspected might be trading in stolen items. But in a case of entrapment, it emerged two undercover officers posing as unscrupulous dealers had to visit the suspects’ business premises no less than four times before they managed to persuade them to buy what appeared to be stolen cable. Gary Ogden, of PG Metals in Bolton, was arrested after police suspected he was dealing in stolen metals following a sting operation . The three men will be awarded costs which are expected to met by the taxpayer. And 14 other suspects will now have their cases reviewed in light of the judge’s criticisms. Mr Dawson had initially refused their offers and demanded identification but the officers but they carried on repeatedly offering him dodgy items. He eventually agreed to take the cable only on condition the bogus vendors wouldn’t come back. Soon after the operation in October 2012 Mr Dawson and his colleagues at Bolton-based PG Metals in Greater Manchester were arrested and handcuffed during a string of coordinated 9am raids and charged with a string of offences including concealing criminal property. But almost two years on at Bolton Crown Court the case against the three men was thrown out after Judge Timothy Stead condemned the officers for going too far in their pursuit of the three men. Mr Odgen, whose mother died whilst he was awaiting trial, said he was left suicidal by the botched investigation. He said: ’It’s been a nightmare. None of us have a criminal records and then this happened. ‘We said we didn’t want it because it looked like railway cable but they have gone out of their way to force innocent people like us into buying it. It was blatant entrapment and we have been made to feel like criminals who could potentially have been locked up. ‘On the day they swooped in with about 30 officers and cordoned off the street, there was even a helicopter. I didn’t know what was going on. We were locked up for 12 hours, it wasn’t nice.’ Mr Ogden, who was cleared of all charges along with his colleagues after a judge said they had been 'lured' into buying the dodgy metal, said he had been left feeling suicidal after the ordeal . He added that the company has a robust procedure of checking identification from scrap dealers so when they are unable to present it, they are turned away. He even told the officers he was not supposed to buy burnt wire and if he was offered it he should report it to police. He said: ‘In this job you have to use your initiative and we would tell people to get lost and would not accept some stuff. We took their IDs and then kept saying we didn’t want it. We even refused stuff that was legitimate because it looked like railway cable even though there was no markings.’ ‘To come in three times and know we were not accepting it they should have just walked away, but they’ve pushed it to get a result.’ PG Metals check identification before buying scrap metal. After checking the undercover officers' ID they refused to buy the metal, but were persuaded after they came back four times . Following the charge, Mr Odgen said life became a daily struggle. He said: ‘I loved this job and we will get back to where we were but some days I didn’t want to get out of bed because of this. I thought to myself some days, ‘this isn’t worth it’ and thought about getting a rope. I can’t trust the police now, and they are the ones we are supposed to be trusting.’ The court heard how undercover police officers first visited PG metals on September 26, 2012 posing as scrap dealers with metal to sell. Mr Dawson asked to see identification and refused to buy the aluminium metal cable he was offered, which was legitimate, but looked similar to railway cable. The officers went back to PG metals again on October 9, 2012, and again Mr Dawson demanded to see identification. Officers called at the firm again on October 16, 2012 - their third visit - and offered Mr Dawson railway cable. He told them twice he could not take it and the officers asked how much he would pay for it if it was stripped. They returned later that day with the cable stripped of its identifying protective sheath and Mr Dawson bought it. When he was asked if he would take any more he told the undercover officers he would prefer not to have it. Mr Dawson, and Mr Ogden both of Great Lever, near Bolton were both accused attempting to handle stolen railway cable and concealing criminal property. Mr Young, from Breightmet, Bolton was accused of two charges of attempted handling of stolen property. All three have now been cleared of all charges.Judge Timothy Stead said: ’It is simply not acceptable that the state, through its agents, should have its citizens lured into breaking the law and then set out to prosecute them. ‘The reality of what the police did by going time and time again was to seek to wear down Mr Dawson’s resistance to a point where he would then do something that could be characterised as a criminal offence.’","Undercover police tried to sell dodgy metal to Bolton scrap dealers .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A mystery portrait of an unknown First World War soldier has finally been identified - 100 years after his death. For years the painting of the unknown soldier hung in Carmarthen County Museum in Wales but no one knew his name or if he survived the horror of the trenches. It remained a mystery until an amateur historian posted a picture of the painting on the Great War Forum website and asked for help to uncover his identity. For years this painting hung in Carmarthen County Museum in Wales but no one knew the soldier's name - until a team of historians looked him up . Historians scoured obituaries in wartime archive The Bond of Sacrifice and were astounded to see a photograph of the young soldier identical to the face staring out from the oil painting. The soldier was identified as Second Lieutenant Paul Chancourt Girardot who was just 18 when he was killed. And historians believe his mother Mary, who was an artist, may have painted the portrait in tribute to her son's tragic death. Records show the 18-year-old officer was killed in the second month of the war when a German shell landed in a quarry he was resting in. Girardot was serving in the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry when he died at Soupir on 16 September 1914. First World War enthusiast Martin Gillott, 49, was one of a group of four experts who pooled their knowledge of military history and uniforms to solve the mystery. Together they identified the cap badge, unique double leather shoulder straps and button-badge on the lapel, as belonging to a Second Lieutenant in the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry. The fact the officer didn't have any medals in the portrait led Mr Gillott to think it was painted early in the war as a memorial to a fallen soldier. Mr Gillott used the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website to create a list of officers killed between August 1914 and June 15 - and Second Lieutenant Paul Chancourt Girardot from Carmarthen jumped out at him. Historians searched wartime archive The Bond of Sacrifice and chanced across a picture of the unknown soldier in this obituary - and were able to solve the mystery of who he was . Mr Gillott, from the Witterings, West Sussex, said: ‘The photograph in his obituary was an exact match for the painting. ‘I defy anyone to say it is not the same person - I would say the photograph has been used to create the memorial portrait.’ Records show the young officer was the only son Lieutenant-Colonel John Francis Girardot and his wife Mary. His widowed mother was born in Cardigan, West Wales, and lived in Carmarthenshire after the death of her only son. Staff at the Carmarthen County Museum, in West Wales, are delighted they can now put a name to his face and have begun telling the lost story of his sacrifice to local school children. The painting 'Portrait of an Unknown First World War Officer' has now been renamed 'Second Lieutenant Paul Chancourt Girardot (1895-1914)' - and the story of his sacrifice revealed to a new generation. The museum had no record of when the portrait came into their possession but the soldier's identity was unknown when they re-catalogued their art collection in the 1970s. Museum spokeswoman Debbie Williams said: ‘We are delighted this discovery has been made - it is wonderful to finally find out who he is. ‘It is a tragic story but it is always nice when a piece of the jigsaw is put back in place. ‘The portrait has gone back on display with the new name and information about his service added. ‘We have a lot of school children coming through our doors and in this First World War centenary year it is wonderful his service will be remembered by a new generation.’","The picture hung in Carmarthen County Museum in Wales for years .

Mr Heppenstall, 23, of Wigan, Lancashire, said: 'We were having a rest in bed but Rachel kept needing to go to the toilet every ten minutes which unbeknown to us, was a sign that she was starting to go into labour. 'She felt something and asked me to have a look - and I could see it was the baby's head crowning. 'I got her back on the bed and dialled 999 and they said straight away that I was going to have to deliver the baby. 'I put it on speaker phone and because there was only us two in the house I thought to myself, I'm just going to have to get on with it. Mr Heppenstall delivered the baby on his birthday - and said his new son clearly wanted to join the party . 'Rachel gave three pushes and I guided him out. 'It all happened so quickly I didn't have time to worry about it. 'I had just wrapped him up and put him on her chest as the paramedics pulled up outside. 'They clamped the umbilical and then they said, ""Here you are, you have done everything else, you might as well cut the cord as well"". Following the home birth, the family went to hospital where a check-up confirmed the baby was healthy. Mr Heppenstall said: 'All in all it was quite a birthday and he is quite some present from Rachel to me.

"By . Harriet Hernando . An 11-year-old girl created a dress made out of 25,000 loom bands and sold it on eBay for £155. Abigail Baker from Desborough, Northamptonshire, spent seven days creating the multi-coloured garment made entirely from £90 worth of the popular rubber bracelets. However, where Kathryn Burnand and Helen Wright, from Prestatyn, Wales, managed to flog an almost identical dress last week for £170,000 on eBay, Abigail’s dress went under the hammer for just £155. Scroll down for video . Abigail Baker, 11, models the dress she made from 25,000 loom bands . The dress is made from £90 worth of loom bands but Abigail has made £65 profit after selling it on Ebay . But after the person who won the £170,000 dress pulled out on Monday, Abigail could be first in the world to successfully sell a loom dress on eBay. Her parents Marie, 33, and dad Nigel, 42, are proud of her for making an adult size ten dress from the colourful bands. Yesterday Mrs Baker, a trainee teacher, said: ‘I still can’t believe how someone so young can show so much dedication. ‘She has been getting home from school and getting on with it straight away. ‘She really has been non-stop. Whether it is in the car, while watching TV or having dinner, she is looming. Intricate: Abigail Baker, 11, from Prestatyn, Wales, made the dress over seven days . ‘I am really proud of her. I can’t put it into words how I feel. She is just a star, she really is.’ The Bakers believe their daughter is the first youngster to make a dress from loom bands. Mrs Baker said making the dress had taken a lot of hard work. She said: ‘She is so proud of her work. It has just boosted her confidence really. She was so determined to do it. ‘She has always enjoyed crafts and loom bands bring the creativity out of children.’ Abigail thanked her family for the support. She said: ‘I am really pleased with how it has turned out and that it didn’t go horribly wrong. ‘Everyone I have told about the dress have been really impressed and can’t believe I made it. ‘But most importantly, my family have been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £90 to make this dress and have supported me all the way.’ Abigail auctioned off the colourful garment to raise money for a family holiday. She said she wanted to raise at least £50 cash so she could give her four-year-old brother Liam £10, keep £20 for her to spend in the arcades and £20 for a fish and chips dinner treat while on holiday in Weymouth, Dorset, next month. She also wanted to raise money for her old Brownie pack, the 3rd Desborough Brownies. But the dress exceeded her expectations and fetched £155. The artistic youngster is not sick of loom bands just yet and she now wants to make a bag out of them. While the craze for loom bands is keeping plenty of children occupied, it's bad news for wildlife . Experts have warned that fish and sea birds could be under threat - from loom bands. Conservationists from the National Marine Aquarium are worried marine life could die after eating the tiny elastic bands used to make the popular bracelets. Staff at the aquarium in Plymouth, Devon, asked children to leave the rubber fashion accessories at home when they head to the beach and take care when getting rid of them. Paul Cox, the National Marine Aquarium director of conservation said: 'Loom bands, like any plastic item, are capable of persisting in the environment for many, many years and there is abundant evidence of small plastic items making their way into the diets of marine animals and seabirds with tragic consequences. 'While we wouldn’t want to single out loom bands as a specific threat, its true that they will become an issue if we let them get into the seas. 'Taking care with storage, use and when absolutely necessary, their disposal should ensure that they can be enjoyed without becoming a threat to wildlife. 'I’d be particularly worried about loom bands being taken to the beach as, not only is the likelihood of them getting into the sea so much higher there but there are also so many better things to do at the beach.'","Abigail Baker, 11, spent seven days making the dress from scratch .

Christopher Battley, 68, was adopted at birth in 1945 after his mother Margaret Powles, then 16, was unable to care for him on her own. His absent father was believed to be a Canadian serviceman, based in the UK during wartime. Christopher Battley, 68, with his sister Val Latimer, 65, who he tracked down on genealogy websites after he found out he was adopted . Mr Battley, who lives in Maitland, Australia, spent years trying to track down his biological family. After researching his genealogy, he discovered his birth name was Powles. He said: ‘The most uncanny feeling was finding out my real name.’ He began trawling ancestry websites and eventually his patience paid off – when he came across his family’s profile. Mr Battley said: ‘I sat down and thought “you’ve got to be joking.” Brother and sister Mr Battley and Mrs Latimer pour over family albums at her home in Norwich after meeting for the first time . ‘The odds of that happening - I just sat there bewildered, and then I found out how big the family was.’ It turned out Mr Battley had seven siblings in Costessey, Norwich. Meanwhile their mother had died on January 17, 2012 aged 82. Mother Margaret Powles, who died on January 17, 2012 aged 82. Mr Battley, who was adopted at birth, never got the chance to meet her . For a long time Val Latimer, 65, had thought she was the eldest of seven. But she was amazed to discover she had an older brother. And this week the siblings met for the first time in Norwich, with Mrs Latimer waving a giantAustralian flag or her brother’s arrival at the train station. She said: ‘It was a very powerful moment but we just about managed not to cry.’ Since meeting up the siblings have discovered several family traits. Mrs Latimer said: ‘He’s certainly got the Powles’ sense of humour and we’ve noticed familiar mannerisms.’ Mr Battley said he was overjoyed to find his biological family. He said: ‘The initial feelings of finding a family, a real family, you can’t ever imagine. ‘It’s very exciting but it will take a while to sink in.’ Mrs Latimer, who is already planning a trip to Australia, added: ’We’ll certainly stay close as a family now after finally finding each other - it’s just been wonderful.’","Christopher Battley, from Maitland, Australia, tracked his biological family down to Norwich using genealogy websites .

"By . Harriet Hernando . For most people, having a shower and sponging off is an easy task - but it sends Jackie Wrights's heart racing. The mother-of-four suffers from Trypophobia, a fear of holes which means even the thought of holding a sponge sends shivers down her spine - and she is forced to flee the shower if she spots any bubbles floating in the plug hole. Her terror is so real she quit her job in a school kitchen because as soon as she saw a cluster of holes - in crumpets, the bottom of mushrooms or the inside of peppers - she would have a panic attack. Jackie Wright, 45, from Wallsend, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne suffers from Trypophobia - a fear of holes. Even sponging off in the shower brings her out in a cold sweat . Even having a cup of tea brings her out in a cold sweat. She said: ‘If I see any bubbles in my tea, I have to stir them out with a spoon or I have to drink with my eyes closed.’ Jackie, who now works as a part time check out assistant, said: ‘I’m worried that insects will crawl out of the holes, especially in the sponges. It’s not the holes themselves that frighten me, but rather what’s inside them. Jackie Wright, 45, had to quit her job in a kitchen because the holes in food like crumpets and peppers gave her panic attacks . ‘My life was turned upside down. I was in tears and started to think I was going to break down every time I saw something that triggered me.’ The nightmare first began three years ago, after Jackie, from Wallsend, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, watched an advert for Sanex shower gel on TV. She said: ‘I hated it when the camera would pan out from the naked people on the screen and merge into the pores of someone’s skin. ‘As soon as I saw it, my skin would crawl and after that, as soon as I heard the voice over for the advert I had to turn over to another channel.’ Her world was turned upside down. She said: ‘There were loads of things I was fine with, and then suddenly I just couldn’t bear them. ‘When I suffered an episode at work, I felt like I was going to pass out and I’d be on the verge of tears. ‘It . would start with a tingle in my head, which made me want to rip my hair . out then I would break out in goosebumps all over my body and I’d want . to rip my skin off.’ Jackie suffered in silence, until one day at work in the school kitchens, she had a breakdown. The final straw came when her colleague was making a pizza and unaware of her phobia, she showed her the holey base. Jackie . said: ‘She had no idea about my phobia, but was telling me how she . didn’t like the patterns herself. I started crying and had an anxiety . attack, it was horrible. My heart was racing and I had to sit in the . office to calm down. ‘I realised that I couldn’t carry on like this so I quit my job a month later.’ Jackie researched her symptoms on the internet and discovered that her bizarre fear was in fact a phobia of holes. But doctors do not recognise the phobia, and Jackie wants sufferers to be taken seriously. She . said: ‘Not many people understand, so I am very careful who I tell . about my phobia. I have told some friends and family and they were . supportive but it was still embarrassing. I just don’t want people to . think I’m mad.’ But her phobia does have one plus point – she doesn’t have to do the washing up. But Jackie's phobia does have one 'silver lining' - she doesn't have to do the washing-up because her husband David, 46, (pictured) does it . Trypophobia is fear, revulsion or disgust of objects with irregular patterns of holes. British academics Arnold Wilkins and Geoff Cole, who claim to be the first to scientifically investigate trypophobia, believe the reaction to be based on a biological revulsion, rather than a learned cultural fear. They found that holes in skin, meat, wood, plants, coral, sponges, mould, dried seed pods, honeycomb, soap, cheese, soil, plants, wounds, bubbles, waffles, speakers caused sufferers distress. Their study in journal  Psychological Science also found some people think that something might be living inside holes and are afraid that they might fall in the holes. Cole and Wilkins concluded that Trypophobia triggers a fear of danger. The holes, or images of holes, stimulate 'a primitive portion of his or her brain that associates the image with something dangerous.' Jackie, who lives with husband David, 46, and children Rachael, 22, Connor, 20, Sofie, 14, and Caitlin, 12, said: ‘It’s the only silver lining of the phobia.’ And now she has started to face her fears and is receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help her cope with anxiety. During the therapy she has to pop bubbles and is forced to use the objects she fears most - sponges and crumpets. Trypophobia has been investigated by Dr Geoff Cole, a lecturer in vision science at the University of Essex. Dr Cole believes everyone has the phobia to a certain degree. He said: ‘Trypophobia is the most common phobia you’ve never heard of. We estimate that around 16 percent of the population is Trypophobic but we think that everybody has it to a certain degree.’ And Dr Cole has his own theory as to why people are so embarrassed to disclose their fear to their loved ones. ‘As the phobia isn’t officially recognised, people think they are the only ones to suffer from it. Thankfully the internet is raising awareness and we hope that with more publicity we can get the condition recognised.’","Jackie Wright, from Wallsend, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, suffers from Trypophobia, a fear of holes .

"By . Gemma Mullin . Imran Hussain, 32, is already serving a 14-and-a-half-year sentence for drug smuggling and dealing . An international drug smuggler who is already serving a 14 year sentence for hiding £800,000 of heroin in children's clothing has been order to pay up more than £70,000 or face longer behind bars. Imran Hussain, 32, from Birmingham, had made £285,781 from drug smuggling and dealing when he was convicted in August, 2013. He has now been ordered to repay  his ill-gotten gains or spend a further 21 months in prison. Birmingham Crown Court heard Hussain's realisable assets, including cash and the price of an industrial unit, came to £76,693. His Honour Judge Murray Creed gave Hussain six months to come up with the cash. He said: 'You have a criminal lifestyle by reason of the convictions the jury returned. 'I declare the realisable assets are £76,693 and I make a confiscation order in that amount which is to be paid by February 2, 2015.' Hussain denied importing heroin and possession with intent to supply but was convicted by a jury last August and handed a 14-and-a-half-year sentence. His operation was rumbled when police became suspicious about a Luton taxi making a delivery in Birmingham. When the vehicle was stopped, officers found four-and-a-half kilos of heroin with a street value of more than £800,000 concealed in the lining of children's tracksuits and jackets. Telephone analysis revealed the delivery was bound for Hussain. During a raid on his home, police found scales and a mobile phone - both covered in heroin - as well as an ounce of the Class A drug. Det Insp Martin Brennan, from the serious and organised crime unit, said: 'This seizure and the conviction has stopped a large quantity of heroin from being dealt on the streets of Birmingham. 'The arrest is a fantastic example of how local officers work closely alongside force detectives to speedily take action against those trying to bring Class A drugs into the West Midlands. 'Smugglers continue to try more sophisticated ways of concealing drugs to get them into this country, but we are one step ahead.

Dorset-based Bear Blades received a letter from the adventurer’s lawyers calling for the company to remove any reference to ‘bear’ including its name, logo and website.

The firm raised its concerns with Mr Grylls on Twitter, who said he would ‘look into this’. ‘We’re bitterly disappointed,’ Mr Senior said. ‘We’re trying to build a small business - it’s as much a hobby as it is a business - then someone completely faceless comes along and demands we change our name. ‘He’s meant to be Chief Scout and encourage outdoor activities. We’ll now look to rebrand because we don’t have the energy or inclination to fight it.’ Mr Senior, 33, said he has written to Mr Gryll’s lawyers, Carpmaels & Ransford, to ask why they have made the request to his firm, which he claims has sold less than 100 knives so far this year. Mr Grylls, 40, who was appointed Chief Scout in 2009, has found fame in both the UK and America with his survival television series, including Man Vs Wild and Running Wild With Bear Grylls. He has also collaborated with knife maker Gerber to create his own range of blades and tools. A spokeswoman for Bear Grylls Ventures refused to comment. However, after Bear Blades tweeted the presenter today, he replied: ‘Let me look into this.’ In the letter Carpmaels & Ransford say their client is ‘very concerned’ about Bear Blades’ application to register its logo ‘Bear Blades.

Utility.’ They wrote: ‘We act on behalf of Bear Grylls Ventures LLP, which is the merchandising company associated with the world renowned adventurer, writer and television presenter Bear Grylls. ‘Our client is very concerned about your application to register the Bear Blades Steel. Strength. Utility, and logo mark, the dominant and distinctive element of which is the word “bear”.’ Bear Blades owner Owen Senior, has been asked to take down the company's website (pictured) and logo . One of the knives on sale by Dorset-based company Bear Blades, which will now be rebranded . Bear Blades owner Mr Senior has since contacted Mr Grylls on Twitter who has said he would look into it . The company is marketed as a Great British bushcraft company selling knives of 'steel, strength and utility' The lawyers wrote that the logo is ‘very similar’ to their client’s ‘Bear’ mark and covers ‘identical and similar goods, namely knives and sheaths for knives’. They added: ‘Our client also objects to the use of this mark, which would create a likelihood of confusion among consumers, who would be likely to assume that “Bear Blades” products derive from our client. ‘Our client has furthermore built up a considerable amount of goodwill and the logo has acquired a reputation in the United Kingdom. Your use of a very similar mark takes unfair advantage of and is detrimental to the distinctive character and repute that our client’s Bear mark enjoys.’ In the letter dated July 25, Carpmaels & Ransford request that Bear Blades change its name to remove the reference to ‘bear’, withdraws it trademark application for its Bear Blades logo and cancels the registration of the domain name bearblades.co.uk. They also ask the company to ‘cease all use of any mark containing or consisting of bear or bear blades in any form and in any manner, including but not limited to online, social media, printed materials, packaging and to refrain from such use in future’. Ben Stiller (right) with Bear Grylls (left) on the Isle of Skye in Northern Scotland for his series Running Wild . The letter goes on: ‘Whilst our client realises this will have a significant impact on your business, as a trade mark applicant yourself, you will appreciate the value to our client of its name and the importance of preserving exclusivity in that name. ‘If you agree to comply fully and to provide written undertakings to that effect, our client is willing to discuss a suitable phase-out period for your bear name in order to facilitate your transition to a new name.’ Carpmaels & Ransford requested that Bear Blades respond to them by August 7. ‘If you do not agree to these requests, our client reserves the right to take all necessary steps to protect its intellectual property rights,’ it added.","'Bear Blades' received a letter from Grylls' lawyers asking it to change name .

A four year-old girl ended up needing hospital treatment after she choked on a piece of plastic the size of a two pence piece which was hidden in an ice cream sundae from Burger King. Liam Bennett, 25, took his family to the fast food restaurant for some lunch in Haydock, Merseyside on Tuesday when daughter Roseanne Chrystall began frantically coughing. She had been enjoying a chocolate fudge sundae in the back of the family car when Mr Bennett turned round to see her turning blue and frantically clutching her throat. He leapt out the car and began to squeeze her chest but was unsuccessful and so put his fingers down her throat and pulled out the inch-wide piece of plastic. He and partner Shona Chrystall, 23, immediately rushed Roseanne to hospital where doctors found her throat was swollen and grazed. Mr Bennett, a joiner, is demanding answers from Burger King over the shocking incident. The dad-of-three said: ‘She would have been dead if I wasn’t there. ‘I’m furious with what happened. How does a bit of rubbery plastic like that get into an ice cream in the first place? ‘When I went back in and told them about it they didn’t even look shocked.’ Mr Bennett was on a family day out and he spent around £15 on lunch for his partner and their three children Roseanne, George, two, and Thomas, ten months, before eating it in the car. He said: ‘My daughter was in the back and I just heard this noise so I turned round to look at her and I could see she was choking. ‘I dragged her out of the car and started squeezing her and hitting her back and I had her upside down at one point, but nothing was working. She was going purple. ‘I turned her over and put my fingers down her throat and pulled out this piece of rubbery plastic. It was about the size of a 2p. A Burger King Chocolate Fudge Sundae like the one Roseanne Chrystall choked on . ‘It had been lodged in the back of her throat.’ He added: ‘I went into the restaurant and they just said I would have to wait till the manager got back and they would give me a ring. ‘They didn’t seem surprised. They said “that must have happened when so-and-so set it up this morning”. ‘They seemed to think it was part of the ice cream machine.’ The family drove the shaken four-year-old to Wigan Hospital where doctors told the couple she was ‘a very lucky girl’. ‘We were going to have a nice day together but we just had to go home,’ said Mr Bennett. ‘She’s still got a sore throat.’ A spokesman for Burger King said the company was investigating the incident. He said: ‘Food safety is a top priority at Burger King restaurants. ‘We take this matter very seriously and are currently investigating the incident that allegedly took place at the Haydock Burger King restaurant, which is owned and operated by an independent franchisee. ‘We have not received any additional reports of this nature.’","Liam Bennett, 25, took his family to the restaurant in Haydock, Merseyside .

"By . Gemma Mullin . Afsor Ali has been convicted of three counts of possessing terrorist material and will be sentenced next week . A London Underground security worker who warned of a terror attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding has been found guilty of possessing a library of terror manuals. Afsor Ali kept a stash of al-Qaeda documents, bomb-making plans and extremist lectures on his computer and bragged that the 9/11 attacks were a blessing. The 27-year-old also made YouTube video rants where he warned of a terrorist attack at the Royal wedding and called for a Burn American Flag Day in another. After a three-day trial at the Old Bailey, Ali was convicted of three counts of possessing terrorist material and will be sentenced next week. Dressed in a cream Islamic robe and white skull cap bearded Ali looked skywards and appeared to offer a prayer. Ali was the spokesman of banned extremist group Muslims Against Crusades and was personally counselled by militant cleric Omar Bakri. He denied speaking to Bakri about committing terror acts, but said he had sought ‘clarification’ on faith issues. But prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said Ali promoted extremism in YouTube videos under the alias Abu Assadullah. In a clip from 2011, he ‘warns the viewer not to attend the Royal Wedding since there’s the risk of an attack,’ Mr Glasgow added. ‘He explains to the viewer that the British public have no one to blame except themselves because of the inability to condemn their government. ‘He describes the 9/11 atrocity as a blessing and an eye-opener for the American people.’ The Old Bailey heard how counter terrorism investigators found a library of extremist material and MP3 players belonging to Ali. A special edition of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire to celebrate the ‘martyrdom’ of Osama Bin Laden was also found on his gadgets. When asked about two laptops, a Toshiba and Lenovo, he said: ‘If I’m in a conference and anybody there, if they want to use my laptop, they can use it. ‘There’s a range of people there, but family have their own... sometimes there would be younger people there, they would say can I use your laptop.’ A hard drive of material was also seized, although Ali said he shared its use so did not know who could have uploaded the material to it.

Ummah and led by Ali were also members of Muslims Against Crusades. Ali was spokesman of Muslims Against Crusades and was personally counselled by militant cleric Omar Bakri . After a violent altercation with police Ali was arrested and the MP3 player in his pocket was found to contain the Inspire magazine. He was granted bail but attempted to flee the country but was stopped at St Pancras International on March 24 trying to board a Eurostar train to Paris with a passport belonging to someone else. His computers were then seized from his home and found to contain a raft of extremist material, including bomb making tips and guides to using AK47s. There were also recording of Ali on the phone with Bakri saying it would be ‘sinful’ to not go abroad and fight. Mr Glasgow said: ‘This defendant and a colleague were seeking advice on the duty of Muslim males to participate in Jihad, and they discussed the requirement of Muslims to travel abroad to fight for Jihad.’ Ali, of Whitechapel, East London, was convicted of three counts of possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist, but cleared of one. He will be sentenced on August 12. Before the trial Ali pleaded guilty to one count of possessing an identity document with improper intention. After the conviction the breach of bail was put to Ali and he was asked if admitted failing to attend court without due cause. However, Ali replied: ‘I believe I had a good cause and that is because I feel I won’t get a fair trial.’He will be tried separately for breaching his bail conditions.","Asfor Ali, 27, kept a stash of al-Qaeda documents and bomb-making plans .

Officers used tasers to subdue a lone gunman who had been holding his victim in the penthouse restaurant of The Meridian Tower in Swansea, South Wales. The drama began shortly after 4pm when the man entered the exclusive Grape & Olive restaurant carrying a handgun. Armed officers from South Wales Police can be seen escorting the man into the back of a police van . Police rushed to the scene at the tallest building in Wales at the exclusive Grape & Olive restaurant . Residents were trapped inside their luxury flats in the 29-storey tower as armed police cordoned off the building and evacuated diners from the top-floor restaurant. Paramedics wearing protective clothing and helmets were seen entering the tower around 5pm. Police told around 60 locals who had gathered to watch the siege to ‘move out of sight of the tower’ as the police helicopter circled the upper floors. The siege lasted for around two hours while a police negotiator entered the tower alongside armed police and talked to the gunman. It ended when the man was tasered by members of a ‘tactical response team’ and his hostage freed. Last night, police said a man was being held. Jason Hole, who lives in the tower, said he saw armed police and paramedics in helmets going inside around 4.15pm and was told by police to stay in his flat.

Store manager Diane Devonshire had just placed the stainless steel watch on the man’s wrist when he turned on his heels and fled. Mrs Devonshire, who runs David Mellor Jewellers in Eastleigh, Hampshire, said she tried not to ‘judge a book by its cover’ when she allowed him to try on one of the shop’s most expensive items. Scroll down for video . Diane Devonshire can be seen placing the watch carefully on the man's wrist in the corner of the shop . Seconds after she placed the £8,000 watch on the man's wrist he turned on his heels and fled the store . Mrs Devonshire turned to grab the man and chased after him as he made off out of the shopping centre . The man, believed to be between 24 and 26-years-old, can be seen pacing up and down in front of the store’s entrance and looking inside several times. The shop worker walks out and speaks to the man before he follows her inside, asking to try on the watch – a pre-owned Rolex Sea-Dweller. She gets the valuable timepiece out from the display and slowly puts it on seconds before he makes his getaway. The jeweller ran after him through the shopping centre and told her colleague to shut the doors and she fled, but did not want to leave the shop with one member of staff so gave up the chase. The man was seen wearing a blue shirt and Rayban sunglasses (left) when he walked into the store and was served by Mrs Devonshire (right) who put the expensive watch on his wrist and tried to chase him when he fled . Mrs Devonshire said: ‘He was a young lad looking at an expensive watch but I don't judge a book by its cover. ‘I put the watch on more slowly than I normally would, to keep a hold on it, and even held onto the price tags. ‘But as soon as it was done up he just fled. I chased him up to the road, then I thought he's going to have it anyway. ‘I nearly had him at the doors, though I don't know what I would have done. ‘It wasn't brave, it was a natural instinct.’ It is only the second time she has fallen victim to a snatch in 25 years.

"By . Gemma Mullin . A stretch of Wales’ highest mountain Mount Snowdon has been put on the market for £7million after a sheep farmer decided to sell up. Dafydd Morris from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, has decided to give someone else the opportunity to own a 600-acre slice of the picturesque landscape on the northern slopes of the mountain. The 76-year-old, who still farms the land, bought the area in 1986 and says if it sells he will use the money to buy another farm lower down the mountain after facing difficulties in hill-farming. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu (pictured) is part of the area for sale and is known as one of the top spots for rock climbing . He told MailOnline: ‘The reason we are selling is because it has become very difficult to farm, especially in the past two years. ‘People were saying they were worried about the environment and they weren’t happy about the way the land was being farmed. ‘So I was thinking of giving them the chance by allowing them to buy the acres.’ Mr Morris said he will not be selling the land to another farmer as he will remain farming on his remaining 600-acres. ‘It will go to someone who wants to look after the environment. ‘People can come there with their children and bring their tents. Schools will be able to come up and see a different area of the mountain.’ Mr Morris, 76, said he is selling as the area has become difficult to farm, particularly in the last two years . The area for sale includes one of Britain’s top rock climbing spots, Clogwyn Du’r Arddu, and a 112-acre space called Cwm Arddu, which is on the market for £2.5million. Remaining land will be sold off acre-by-acre at a cost of £12,000. But Mr Morris, the former chairman of the independent Council of the Welsh Highland Shepherds, says he doesn’t mind if there are no takers, as he will carry on as he had done. ‘We just want to give those people that want to take care of the environment the chance to do so and so they can understand what it has been like for hill-farmers. ‘If we make enough money we will buy a farm lower down the mountain but we will also keep our current one.’ John Harold, the director of the Snowdonia Society, told the Independent that he hoped the proposal is ‘motivated by a desire to protect the “iconic landscape, precious mountain habitats, rare wildlife, and the “mountain experience'” rather than the “potential income of £7.5million”.’ The 600-acre area on sale is in the national park (shown on map in relation to north Wales) He added: ‘Fortunately, much of the land is a National Nature Reserve and nearly all of it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. It is unlikely Snowdon will end up spattered with private glamping sites or such eyesores.’ Agents acting for Mr Morris have created an invite-only website to market the land to limit the number of potential buyers. It describes the land as ‘one of the wonders of Wales’ and ‘one of the most visited tourist attractions in the UK’. The advertisement states: ‘A large part of the Snowdon massif is up for sale and Dafydd Morris is calling on all conservationists and the public in general to grasp the opportunity to buy a part of Snowdon to help conserve and cultivate its natural beauty for generations to come. ‘Snowdon or Yr Wyddfa in Welsh is the highest mountain in Wales and is the home to a number of rare plant and bird species including the world renowned Snowdon Lily artic-alpine plant, treasured by the Welsh nation.’ Ownership of Snowdon is shared between the National Trust, the national park authority and a private trust.","Dafydd Morris decided to give someone else the opportunity to own the land .

"By . Gemma Mullin . and Daily Mail Reporter . Anastassia Tepljakova, 27, of Cheltenham, was jailed for four months at Gloucester Crown Court . A driver who gave a  colleague’s name when she was caught driving without insurance did nothing when her workmate was convicted and endured four court hearings before being cleared. Anastassia Tepljakova’s deceit was discovered only when the police officer who charged her met her workmate at court and realised it was the wrong woman. Tepljakova, 27, of Cheltenham, was jailed for four months at Gloucester Crown Court this week after admitting perverting the course of justice by providing false details. As a result of her lie, her colleague, Olga Jelcova, was convicted in her absence of driving without insurance and had a 15-month battle to prove her innocence. Tepljakova said she ‘panicked’ when approached by a policeman after the car she was driving ran out of petrol in Gloucester. She gave the name and address of Ms Jelcova, who she worked with at Laithwaite’s wine company, when the officer discovered that she had no insurance. It led to Miss Jelcova being convicted by magistrates. When she received notice of her conviction she began an appeal and, following a number of court appearances, a new hearing was set. Luckily, the police officer who dealt with the incident had taken a picture at the time and when he arrived to give evidence he realised that Miss Jelcova had not been the driver. She identified Tepljakova from the photo. Jailing Estonian-born Tepljakova, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said it was bad enough that she had driven without insurance and then lied to the police. But what made it far worse was that she had not owned up when she saw her colleague suffering as a result of her dishonesty. ‘Not only did you pretend to be this lady but you sat back and watched her suffer – and suffer she did, going to court again and again,’ he said. In a statement, Miss Jelcova said it had taken 15 months to clear her name and it had been ‘extemely stressful.’ ‘I cannot believe someone would do this to me,’ she said. Tepljakova appeared at Gloucester Crown Court yesterday after she was caught driving without insurance .","Anastassia Tepljakova, 27, was pulled over after driving her boyfriend's car .

She . said: ‘I was reading comments on the post and a lady had commented . saying it was her friend’s dog and she knows the lads personally. ‘She said that she had allowed them to walk the dog while she was at work and trusted them.’ Hertfordshire police say the male Chihuahua was not injured and was returned to its owner on Thursday night . A . spokesperson from the RSPCA confirmed they had received a number of . complaints and said: ‘We are very concerned about this footage of . someone swinging a Chihuahua around on a lead.

"By . Gemma Mullin . The fire which ripped through part of Eastbourne Pier is now being treated as suspicious, police have said. New information today suggests the blaze on the 144-year-old structure on Wednesday ‘may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally’. It comes after David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited the town to announce a £2million cash injection to help with the aftermath of the blaze. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited Eastbourne pier today after pledging to support town . The Prime Minister walks alongside the devastated wreckage along with George Osborne and members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue who managed to save most of the structure . Outside the former entrance to the pier, David Cameron speaks with members of the fire service . Detective Inspector Mark O'Brien, of Sussex Police, said: ‘As a result of our investigation we have received information to suggest that the fire may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally, and our investigation is now focusing on that line of enquiry. ‘A temporary scaffold platform has been erected adjacent to where the fire is thought to have broken out in order to enable scenes of crime officers and fire investigators safe access to the area.’ Police have called on people to submit pictures or video footage taken at the entrance or on the pier in the hours before it started. Superintendent Laurence Taylor said: ‘The area around and under the pier is still very hazardous and there is a security team deployed to stop people putting themselves in danger.’ The Prime Minister met with the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station as the wreckage stood behind him . David Cameron shaking hands with members of the fire and rescue service who saved most of the building . The Prime Minister visited the town today with George Osborne as he pledged to support the town. The pair met with members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station. Mr Cameron said: ‘The Government is absolutely committed to supporting coastal towns, and through our long-term economic plan we are creating jobs and boosting tourism. ‘I know that the loss of one of Eastbourne’s most prominent and well-loved landmarks will have hit the town hard and I am determined to do all I can to help local businesses recover.’ The fire happened at the height of Eastbourne’s important summer tourist season. In the next fortnight, the resort hosts its biggest summer tourist event - the annual Airbourne Air Show - which draws tens of thousands of visitors. Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne also announced an extra £3 million for the Government’s Coastal Communities Fund to encourage growth and create jobs in coastal towns. Mr Osborne said: ‘Eastbourne Pier is a much-loved local attraction and this fire is devastating news. I am therefore delighted to be able to provide financial support so we can minimise the effect on business and tourism. People walk along the beach to catch a glimpse of what remains of devastated Eastbourne Pier . The town is now set to receive a £2 million boost after a fire destroyed its Grade II listed pier this week . ‘We will work with Eastbourne as a matter of urgency to ensure that the funding is provided without delay so people can start enjoying the pier again.’ Coastal Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt named 10 coastal towns which will receive £8.5 million from the fund in the latest round of applications. The money will be used to boost tourism, regenerate historic sites and provide new flood defences, Downing Street said. But there is hopes that the fire-hit pier could reopen again as early as next year, as two-thirds of it was untouched by flames, according to Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd. The Liberal Democrat MP has said that following talks with East Sussex’s chief fire officer, the structure appeared ‘pretty sound’ and called on the community to rally round the pier’s stricken traders after fears that some had no insurance. Mr Lloyd said: ‘There is real damage but I’m confident that it can be repaired. Crowds gathered on Wednesday as the popular pier went up in flames and plumes of smoke billowed out . It took more than 80 firefighters to dampen down the tangled wreck of Eastbourne Pier after the blaze . Crews were still dousing flames the morning after a large section was destroyed and left a charred shell . ‘It’s still very much standing, and I’m very hopeful and confident that it will be reopening next year and be back in business.’ Helen Brook and Stuart Pearce, who were due to get married on the pier in three weeks’ time, have seen their dream dashed. The couple were to have wed on a section of the Victorian structure which escaped the flames. Ms Brook told ITV Meridian: ‘Once we heard that people were safe and had been evacuated, it then hit home what it meant for us. ‘Since yesterday, it has been a very emotional couple of days. We are just shell-shocked really.’ Holiday makers walk along the promenade with the pier stretching out to sea in the background . Passengers landing on Eastbourne Pier after a boat cruise in 1936. The paddle steamers took passengers to destinations including Folkestone, Sandown, Brighton, Hastings and even as far afield as Boulogne in France . East Sussex has been cursed by the devastation of some of its beloved piers in recent times. In 2003 the 148-year-old West Pier in Brighton was reduced to a mangled mass of metal by two major blazes within two months. In Hastings, the Grade II listed pier was almost destroyed in a fire in 2010 following years of neglect by its then-Panama-registered owner. Efforts are now well under way to restore Hastings Pier after more than £13 million was secured mainly though the Heritage Lottery Fund.","Fire tore through 144-year-old structure, which housed shops and cafes .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A pregnant horse died in agony from a gaping neck wound after its cruel owner made it wear a poorly repaired bridle which cut down to the bone. The three-year-old horse named Princess was spotted by walkers in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and was in such a bad state that that they could smell the animal’s rotting flesh. Paul Pratt, 29, the animal’s owner, was taken to court and has now been banned from keeping animals for life after admitting a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT . Princess suffered such serious neglect that she died in agony from a gaping neck wound caused by her bridle . Despite treatment Princess died just days later from septicaemia and vets were unable to save her unborn foal . Photographs taken of Princess after she was found show that the bridle was digging in to her flesh so deeply that it had penetrated down to the jaw bone. The RSPCA said it is likely the wound had been untreated for two weeks and the pregnant horse was starving to death when she was found because she could not eat. Despite treatment she died just days later from septicaemia and vets were unable to save her unborn foal. Pratt, from Bradford, who also owned two other horses, one of which he had had for 14 years, was given a 12 weeks prison sentence suspended for two years when he appeared at Bradford Magistrates Court. Paul Pratt, 29, appeared before Bradford Magistrates Court where he admitted a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal . He was also fined £1,000 and ordered to pay an £80 victim surcharge on top of the life-long ban. Nigel Monaghan, prosecuting, said: ‘An inspection was carried out following a member of public notifying the RSPCA of the situation. By that point the collar had been cut off. ‘It had been digging in and smelt foul. Flesh was hanging down around the twine and there appeared to be the jaw bone underneath. The inspector felt the smell of rotting would have been obvious to anyone.’ The horse was kept in a vulnerable state in fields off a residential road in Bradford between January 21 and February 6 this year, the court heard. In addition to a gaping wound to the length of her jaw bone, Princess was lying on her stomach, caked in mud. Mr Monaghan said: ‘She was sweating and struggling to breathe and drink water. The vet was concerned the horse was unable to move her jaw and she was given a tetanus injection but unfortunately the horse died. ‘We believe she was unable to feed because of the collar. This would have been prevented or reduced in severity if the owner had removed the head collar and had her treated.’ A post-mortem was carried and revealed that the lesion had been there for at least two weeks - if not longer- and there was no evidence of an attempt to treat the wounds. As a result Princess developed septicaemia and the post mortem also revealed she had a fatty liver- a symptom of starvation. The court accepted that this was not a case of deliberate torture, Mr Monaghan said: ‘The strap at some point broke and was replaced simply by a piece of twine. The defendant says that he did not put the twine under the head collar. ‘The charge is not did he put the collar there but that he caused the unnecessary suffering of an animal. He had a responsibility to check on the horse regularly and if the animal requires veterinary attention he should seek it. ‘Owners have a responsibility to their animals. The fact that this horse was in foal means that this led to the death of two animals.’ The bridle which was digging in to her flesh so deeply that it had penetrated down to the jaw bone . Mr Pratt had two other horses in the field with Princess - one aged 14 who he had owned since birth, and although they were found in good physical condition, they were taken from his care following her death. In a statement read out at court Pratt said he had owned horses for years and checked on them every morning and every evening and added that he checked ‘they had four legs and a head’. He said he had checked on Princess on the morning she was found and although he saw she had the head collar on and that it was not in good working condition he only noticed what he called a ‘mark under her chin’. Ian Hudson, defending, said: ‘As we have heard from the inspector, the horse was in good bodily condition, despite its other wounds and that is what Mr Pratt saw when he saw the horse everyday. ‘To look at the horse, it did not seem to be suffering and he accepts his culpability.’ Pratt had a previous RSPCA conviction in 2007 when he was charged with keeping two dozen chickens and bantams in the back of a dirty trailer without food, adequate water or sunlight. Three of the animals died because of the poor conditions. Magistrates chairman Graham Laycock, said: ‘The offence you have committed is so serious to put it in the custody threshold. I however have decided to deal with you by way of a suspended sentence. You will have a lifetime ban on any animals, which means keeping, owning or dealing in any animals.‘In reaching this decision we have considered the animals suffering and neglect and the offence so serious to result in its death.’","WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A burglar was caught red-handed after he broke into a house that had been fitted with secret cameras, which had been rigged by police. Andres Balog, 26, forced his way into the property in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, and stole jewellery and £10 in cash. His entry triggered special motion-sensor cameras, which then filmed his every move inside the ‘capture house’. Scroll down for video . Andres Balog, 26, was caught red-handed looking into the camera as he stole £10 cash and jewellery . Footage released by police shows Balog snooping around and rifling through bags in the living room and hallway. He then appears to look directly at a hidden camera in the kitchen before he is seen rummaging through cupboards. Balog, of no permanent address, was identified just over a week later when officers recognised him as he was brought into custody on suspicion of a separate offence. He was jailed for four-and-a-half months after he admitted the burglary on January 12 when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court last Wednesday. After the . hearing, Detective Sergeant Nicki Addison, from West Midlands Police, . said: ‘Houses, sheds, garages and outbuildings can all be fitted with . this portable and easy to install equipment, meaning any property in a . burglary hot spot area can be quickly converted to capture thieves. ‘By . informing the public of the success of these capture houses and . revealing just a snippet of our capabilities, the message from us is . two-fold.

"By . Gemma Mullin . Prisoners convicted of violent crimes are getting free weddings if they tie the knot behind bars. Cash for the 27 marriages that took place inside prisons in Scotland – and even the buffet – came from the jail kitty, which is made up of profits from the prison shop. Among those who have tied the knot in the last decade include Alistair Ferrier, who married partner Joanne Dye at Perth Prison, less than six months after he was put in prison for a drink-drive crash which resulted in the death of two pensioners and injured a third. HMP Perth Prison hosted the most weddings in Scotland last year as well as convicted Alistair Ferrier's . Stuart McKelvie of Edinburgh, who was jailed for the murder of Ian Taylor in 2008 when he savagely set him on fire and sliced his ear off before leaving him in woodland, was also allowed to marry in prison. Other inmates walking down the aisle include murderers, drug dealers and burglars – all of whom were men. But the prison service has said weddings for inmates are ‘beneficial’ in the rehabilitation process. A spokesman from the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said: ‘A small number of prisoners are granted permission to marry by the Governor. ‘SPS recognises the benefit in strengthening family support for prisoners in terms of preparation for release and reducing reoffending.’ Inmates walking down the aisle include murderers, drug dealers and burglars all of whom were men . He added: ‘It is not a wedding in a grand hotel, it’s a prison.’ The service notes that if the ceremony is free if it is conducted by the prison’s chaplain and if it is a civil ceremony then the cost of a registrar must be met by couple . It says in some prisons the cost of a buffet, for a maximum of six guests plus the couple, is covered by the Common Good Fund, which comes from donations and profits raised from sales in the on-site shop. The prison service spokesman added: ‘The food comes from the prison canteen, it includes cheap sandwiches and sausage rolls. The expense is minimal.’ Couples are also entitled to use an artificial flower arrangement free of charge. However Bob Lewis, 84, of taxpayer campaign group Is It Fair? told the Sunday Post: ‘Inmates are in a prison to serve a sentence because they’ve done something wrong, not to be rewarded like this’. Andy Silvester from the Taxpayers Alliance said: 'Law-abiding taxpayers outside jail walls have to pay for their own weddings, and prisoners should be no different. 'People up and down the UK think long and hard about whether they can afford to tie the knot, and will be furious that they're paying so others don't have to face that same decision.'","The 27 marriages and buffet were paid for by prison's Common Good Fund .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A mother has been jailed after she allowed her teenage son to miss 174 days of school so she could have a lie-in. The woman failed to get the 13-year-old ready for school in time and he only made it to 31 out of 205 sessions at his school in Swansea, South Wales. A court heard how education chiefs went to her home to investigate and found the woman still in her pyjamas. Scroll down for video . Swansea Magistrates Court heard that the mother had let the boy miss 174 days of school so she could lie-in . Video courtesy of Family Lives . Felicity Lewis, who was prosecuting on behalf of Swansea Council, said: ‘The mother was frequently in bed so her child was not ready for school. ‘It is of major concern to the education welfare service that her child has not been able to access the building blocks of education.’ Swansea magistrates heard education staff tried a ‘pick-up and drop-off service’ and even home schooling. But the mother - who cannot be named for legal reasons - failed to co-operate. She claimed her son had been ‘crying his eyes out’ at the thought of going to school. But the court heard how the boy had plenty of friends and was not bullied. The woman was jailed for nine weeks - making her one of only a handful of British parents sent to prison for allowing their children to miss school. She wept as magistrates told her it was one of the worst cases they had come across. Chair of the bench Diane Reynolds told her: ‘You have failed consistently and over a long period to ensure that your son has been attending school.’ ‘We feel the current offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate.’","Woman failed to get son to school and he only went to 31 of 205 sessions .

"By . Gemma Mullin . As war memorial services across the country . promise never to forget the soldiers who fought in the First World War, . new research has revealed millions of people have no knowledge of what . their ancestors did. An . estimated 7.5million Britons are in the dark about their military . heritage, the report by family history website Ancestry.co.uk found. It . means an estimated 1,260,000 men who fought in the trenches, at sea or . in the air have been ‘forgotten’ by their descendants. Report found over a million soldiers have been 'forgotten' (pictured are soldiers from the Royal Irish Rifles) According . to the report, most people assume if their relatives fought in the war . they would have been told about them, however many veterans never spoke . to their children about their role in the conflict, wanting to put the . trauma they experienced in the trenches behind them. Many Britons said their grandparents died before they could ask them about their wartime experiences. Miriam . Silverman, of Ancestry.co.uk, said: ‘Many veterans never spoke about . their experiences in the Great War upon returning home, so it’s . understandable how so much knowledge could have been lost, especially if . people missed the opportunity to speak to their older relatives before . they died. ‘The result is a widespread and tragic lack of personal knowledge of our WWI ancestry.’ Despite . this around half of people who knew of their ancestor’s military . service said they are more grateful for what they have today and a . similar number feel humbled when they think about their ancestor’s . bravery. The number of . people visiting the 2,400 British First World War cemeteries in France . and Belgium has never been higher, according to the Commonwealth War . Graves Commission (CWGC). Tyne Cot cemetery - the largest British First World War cemetery - has already had 350,000 visitors this year . Peter . Francis, spokesman for the commission, told The Independent: ‘Four or . five years ago we estimated the number of visitors each year to the Tyne . Cot cemetery at Passchendaele - the largest British First World War . cemetery - at 200,000 to 250,000 people a year. ‘This year we have already had 350,000 visitors. The numbers have been on a rising gradient year after year.’ While . the report suggests ancestors are being ‘forgotten’, the CWGC’s website . is reaching visitor numbers of around 10 to one in favour of soldiers . who died in the First World War. This . is explained by the fact the number of soldiers that died between 1914 . and 1918 – almost 800,000 – was more than in 1939 to 1945. And with each passing generation increases the number of people who had an ancestor in the First World War. In . a bid to help Britons uncover their veteran ancestors the family . history website is making its First World War Medal Index Cards . available and free to use.

"By . Gemma Mullin . A blazing hot weekend was tonight set to end as more than an inch of rain was forecast to fall in less than two hours before the morning. The Met Office has issued a yellow ‘be aware’ rain weather warning for tomorrow in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk. Areas of the South East could see up to 1.2in (30mm) of rain and even thunderstorms, with residents told to be aware of localised surface water. It follows a week of hot weather as thousands of people descended on beaches around the country after temperatures reached 30C in the South East. And as families packed up their picnic blankets, buckets and spades, the south coast became the place to be for people looking to party. Danger: A boy jumps from a footbridge into the River Taff in Pontcanna, Cardiff, into shallow water, which only comes up to the waist of other youngsters in the river . Jumping into the River Taff: The hot weather is set to come to an end today as the Met Office issues a weather warning for heavy rain . Party: A hen do group sit on Brighton beach dressed appropriately for the seaside as sailors, whilst drinking alcohol as the sun goes down on the south coast . Youngsters and hen dos gathered near fires to keep warm while the sun set on Brighton beach in East Sussex last night. Revellers partied until 6am and slept in tents or in sleeping bags on the pebble beach. Cleaners dodged groups of people this morning as they prepared to clear up for another day of people seeking sunshine. But . those heading to the beach were faced with a slightly cooler day than . yesterday - with a high of around 23C forecast for Brighton today. Most . of the UK has dropped in temperatures today. Helen Waite of the Met Office said: ‘It is cooler everywhere today than . yesterday. ‘In the North . West there will be cloudy conditions and temperatures of around 20C in . Manchester, whereas yesterday it was about 27C. ‘There . is rain and showers between Scotland and Northern Ireland and a few . showers over northern England. This will continue through much of the . day. ‘Glasgow will stay . partly cloudy and windy through most the day with a maximum temperature . in the high teens, possibly a bit less. East Sussex: Another group of women enjoy a hen-do dressed as Playboy bunnies, whilst sat in the warm evening weather on Brighton beach . Fire: After a busy day full of people seeking the sun, Brighton beach was not given a break as revellers embarked on the coast for some evening fun . Overnight: Visitors to the beach made the most of the hot weather, when it soared to almost 30C in Brighton yesterday and remained a warm night for most . ‘South . it is drier with some sunny spells. The sunshine might be a bit hazy . and the maximum temperature will be around 26C or 27C in the South . East.’ She added that things are set to turn worse tonight but things will clear up by tomorrow. ‘The rain in the north at the moment will move south down the western side and into Wales. ‘North it will be drier overnight with some cool spells and some misty patches this evening. ‘We’ve . got a yellow warning for heavy rain in the South East and we can expect . some heavy downpours particularly in the Kent and Sussex area. ‘There might be some downpours through the evening to start with showers transferring down from the north.’ She . added: ‘There could be some thundery showers in the South East from the . early hours of tomorrow morning and that risk continues throughout . Monday, with eastern areas more at risk of seeing a thunderstorm. ‘However . there will be some sunny spells around and drier weather and . temperatures are more likely to be around 23C or 24C in the South East.

Despite . claiming the water was more than 6ft deep, photos reveal children stood . in waist deep just inches from where their friends were landing. Horrified by-standers said the stunts ‘defied belief’ and called on authorities to put an end to the craze. Graham . Thomas, 56, said: ‘There are parents bringing their children here to . get involved, it defies belief, it's a weir, not a deep river. ‘It seemed like there was a tiny bit that was just a little bit deeper than the rest.

Lifeguards with safe bathing areas clearly marked with flags on the . beach, we'd encourage people who want to go into the sea to visit these . areas.’ A woman had to be rescued off the beach in Bournemouth, Dorset, by the RNLI after getting herself into trouble in the sea .

"By . Gemma Mullin . Ronnie and Reggie Kray were both gay and Ronnie never consummated his marriage, according to  new claims made by an ex-enforcer for the pair. Former villain Freddie ‘Brown Bread’ Foreman, 83, has been sharing tales of the east London violent gangsters with A-Lister Tom Hardy – who is set to star as both twins in a new film. He claims that although Ronnie admitted his homosexuality in his mid-teens, his brother Reggie was also gay and his marriage to Frances Shea was a sham. Scroll down for video . Reggie Kray married Frances Shea in 1965, but just two years later she committed suicide. Mr Foreman has described the marriage as a sham and says it was never consummated . He told The Sun: ‘The marriage was never even consummated. That poor girl was a trophy wife, nothing more.’ Frances, who was 16 when she met Reggie, married him in 1965 but two years after their wedding, she committed suicide aged 23. After the honeymoon in Athens she moved back in with her mother and is said to have tried to end their marriage after eight months. Bradley Allardyce, one of Reggie’s prison friends, later claimed he had told him that Ronnie had murdered Frances by forcing her to swallow pills. Freddie 'Brown Bread' Foreman worked closely with the Krays and revealed their secrets to Tom Hardy . Tom Hardy and Emily Browning film a wedding scene for new film 'Legend' in south-east London . Tom Hardy films scenes for his new movie 'Legend' in the East End of London with co-star Emily Browning . Legend, which is written and directed by Brian Helgeland, is planned for release in 2015 . Speaking of the new movie, entitled Legend, Foreman said: ‘The film apparently has Reggie looking out of his prison window and saying ‘I love you Frances’. But he certainly did not love her like a husband loves a wife. They never had sex.’ He also revealed for the first time the gang started by the brothers, known as The Firm, had plans to execute the brothers just before their arrests. ‘The twins were a nuisance and causing grief for everyone else. Some people felt they had to go,’ he said. ‘If they hadn't been nicked then they would have gone missing very soon afterwards – for ever.’ Ronnie and Reggie Kray were in the organised crime scene in the London's East End during 50s and 60s . Talented amateur boxers, the pair developed a reputation in the East End by the time they were 21 . Foreman, who was convicted of disposing of the body of Jack ‘the Hat’ McVitie, also offered first-hand advice to actor Tom Hardy on Thursday during filming for the new movie. He told Mr Hardy that Reggie often had a ‘quizzical look’ while Ronnie would ‘stare into space’. The pensioner admitted that Hardy had ‘nailed the part’ and said it was like being with a Kray twin in the flesh. The twins were born on October 24, 1933 and grew up in a slum area of Bethnal Green. Talented amateur boxers, the pair developed a reputation in the East End by the time they were 21. After opening a club in Mile End, they began demanding money from criminals, and by the early 1960s they were making up to the equivalent of £10million every year. They were jailed for life in March 1969, when their crimes caught up with them. Ronnie was 61 when he died of a heart attack at Broadmoor Hospital in 1995 while Reggie was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2000 after he was diagnosed with cancer. Legend, which is written and directed by Brian Helgeland, is planned for release in 2015. Tom Hardy plays both twins in the new film of their life Legend and is pictured during filming in East London .","Freddie Foreman, 83, claimed Reggie Kray's marriage was a sham .

Chris Middleton lost his left leg above the knee and the right below the knee when he was caught in a roadside bombing in Helmand in 2011. The 23-year-old from Syston, Leicestershire, was at Surrey's Headley Court military rehab centre when the offenders broke into his home. Sister Gemma Middleton, 20, who shares the house with Chris, came home to find the house ransacked . They stole two 50-inch plasma televisions, a Mac computer and laptop and some clothing.

Gemma said: ‘There are photographs of Chris in uniform, and with his prosthetic legs, all around the house. ‘If they didn't know whose house they were burgling before they went in, they must have done by the time they left.’ She added: ‘They have left the house in such a mess. Every drawer was pulled open and emptied and our wardrobes pulled apart. ‘I think they were probably looking for money they thought we might have hidden.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A horse sparked a seven-hour rescue operation after it fell down a 10ft hole and into an underground chamber where it was stuck for 24 hours. The 14-year-old animal, called Sianey, was in its field in Linthwaite, West Yorkshire, when it trod on some loose boards covering the hole, and is thought to have toppled backwards into it. She then spent the night underground after firefighters assessed her, returning the following day with specialist equipment to dig her out in a rescue mission lasting around seven-and-a-half hours. Scroll down for video . Rescue mission: Sianey the horse sparked a seven-hour rescue mission after she fell through this hole in her field and into concrete chamber below . Excavation: Sianey spent the night underground after firefighters assessed her, returning the following day with specialist equipment to dig her out . The specialist fire crew from nearby Cleckheaton, assisted by another crew, drilled through the 2ft thick concrete walls of the chamber using circular saws and jackhammers, as a crowd gathered to watch the drama unfold. Crews, who arrived at the scene at around 2.30pm yesterday, wanted to dig deep enough to enable the horse to walk free from the underground cave.

Trapped: Sianey was trapped inside this underground concrete bunker for 24 hours . Fears: Cleckheaton watch commander Colin Brown said the rescue mission was originally deemed to have been too dangerous, and that crews considered if it was more humane to put the animal to sleep . 'I can't believe Sianey has only suffered superficial cuts and grazes,' said Ms Dyson. 'How she got down there I've no idea. The hole was covered up with flags and has just given way - we had no idea that was there. 'It looks like Sianey has gone down backwards and tried to scramble out with her front legs. The firefighters have been fantastic - they have been digging all afternoon. 'She could not have been dragged out without being anaesthetised which is why we need to dig her out.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . A blind drug dealer who sold cannabis from his home for a year and got his wife to check the deals were correct has been spared an immediate prison term. Unemployed Assam Akram, 29, had lost his sight when he was 19, and had relied on his 27-year-old wife Samantha, a school cleaner, to oversee the sales. However, the couple were exposed when police attended their home in Nelson, Lancashire, following reports of a fight, and found around 100 grams of cannabis, as well as £1,080 in cash. Couple: Drug dealer Assam Akram, 29, (right) lost his sight when he was 19 and relied on his wife Samantha, 27, (left) to check the deals were correct. Officers found cannabis and cash in their home . Officers also found cannabis grinders, electronic scales and latex gloves. Their mobile phones were analysed and showed text messages from clients asking for deals of £20 a time, involving amounts of around half-an-ounce. Appearing before Burnley Crown Court, Akram and his wife of four years admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Akram also pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine. Each was given 15 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, with supervision. He must attended a drugs rehabilitation programme and his wife was ordered to go to the Lancashire Women’s Specified Activity Requirement. Akram was born with Retinitis Pigmentosa, . a condition with affects the pigments on his eyes. He began to get . vision problems at school and was registered blind in 2004 when he was . 19. Wife: Samantha Akram said she smoked cannabis for stress and pain relief and received a suspended sentence . The drug dealing emerged last August after police arrested the couple over a public order allegation after a fight between them and a friend of the family who was accused of mocking Akram’s eyesight problems. Police went into their home and an officer could smell cannabis. Samantha admitted she smoked the drug and said she had started taking it to get over a cancer scare. However, Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said police searched the couple's home and found cannabis with a street value of about £1,000, kept in different parts of the house in different packaging. They also discovered 3.28 grams of cocaine, worth £300. Messages going back to July 2012 were found on two phones, and the couple, who also had 'advertising messages' from cannabis suppliers, received texts asking about £10 and £20 deals, as well as amounts of a quarter and half-an-ounce. 'These messages go back to 2011, suggesting they have been using cannabis for some time before they have also branched out into dealing,' Mr Parker said. He told the court that when the pair were questioned, Akram claimed he was looking after the cannabis for a friend and smoked about £30 worth a day. Passing sentence Judge Simon Newell told the couple he was sentencing them for intending to supply about 100 grams of cannabis. He added: 'You shouldn’t think for one moment I am not alert to the realities of what had been going on. 'The reality of what you two were doing is patently obvious from those texts and that is very serious.' He said the fact the defendants had £1,080, when he was on benefits clearly gave the impression they were 'professionally and commercially dealing.' He warned the pair: 'This stops now. You have been into this in a serious way, but it stops now. You have got a chance. Take it.' Spared jail: Appearing before Burnley Crown Court, Akram and his wife of four years admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply, and were both handed suspended prison sentences . Speaking at their home after the hearing, Akram would only say: 'I was ashamed when I went to court. I was nervous.' However, his wife said she set up the drug dealing operation on behalf of her husband so they could fund their own smoking habits. 'He is registered blind and can’t see anything,' she said. 'He relies on me and his family. My husband doesn’t go out very much. I get worried about him. He doesn’t like the light. There isn’t much future for him being blind. 'It was intent to supply because they found messages to my twin sister because she’d asked if I could sort her some out. I’ve not been done for street dealing. It wasn’t a huge amount. I was ashamed to go to crown court, I lost my job because of it. I won’t be allowed to work in a school again. 'I’m sorry and I wish I’d never done it, I really do. I know I should never have done it. My husband smokes cannabis through boredom, he doesn’t go out of the house. We’ve been married nearly four years and together for almost 14 years since school. It’s sad. 'He can do a lot for himself, well he tries to, he tries his best. I’m on depression tablets and some days I don’t want to get out of bed but I know I have to to look after him. It’s hard. I’m in remission now. I smoke it for stress and pain relief. It’s stupid and I know I need to stop, my life does really depend on it and that’s not what I want. 'Someone gave me an opportunity and I started to sell a bit for him. I wish I never did. He was very embarrassed too.'","Assam Akram, 29, lost his sight when he was 19 and relied on wife Samantha .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A primary school headteacher has apologised after parents complained that a project on the discovery of a giant 'alien egg' in the playground left children in tears and too afraid to go to school. The project at Holy Trinity Primary School in Halstead, Essex, revolved around a 3ft-high egg found in undergrowth on school grounds and was part of a problem solving exercise. Despite assurances that the 'amazing discovery' was '100 per cent safe', some of the school's 250 pupils were so frightened by the egg that headmaster Jon Smith had to issue an apology after parents reported their children were distressed, and even suffering from nightmares. Project: The headteacher of  Holy Trinity Primary School in Halstead, Essex, has apologised after some pupils were frightened by a project involving the 'discovery' of a giant egg on school grounds . As part of the project, which took place last month, parents were sent letter reporting how the egg had been found, and that a scientist from the 'National Museum Of Strange Objects' was coming to investigate it. 'I am pleased to inform you that the . inspection has confirmed that the area and object are 100 per cent safe and pose . no threat whatsoever to the public,' Mr Smith wrote in his mock alert. 'What still isn’t clear however, is . the identity of the object.' He then said that the museum's Dr Violet Strangeways had asked that all children 'remain vigilant and put all their . energies into research and investigation in order to help the museum . ascertain the origins of this amazing discovery'. Worry: Some parents  at the school reported that their children had been upset by the 'discovery' of the egg . Apology: Headteacher Jon Smith sent out this apology to parents whose children had been worried by the egg stunt . As part of the project the children had to question where the egg might have come from, drawing pictures and writing essays on its provenance, with parents kept up to date on their project. However, a post on the school's Facebook page and Twitter account soon began attracting comments from some parents who reported that their children had been frightened. One parent wrote: '@HTPSHalstead tell me I'm not the only parent whose child hasn't eaten lunch & has been in tears about the ""discovery"" ? Prank too far?' 'It has come to our attention that whilst . the vast majority of the children at school were excited and engaged by . this morning’s ""discovery"" there are some who have been worried by it' Jon Smith, Headteacher . Another added: '@HTPSHalstead glad you . said that my son does not want to go to school anymore and has been in . tears since he come home #nothappy.' Although . the majority of parents writing on the school's Facebook page said . their children had been excited by the project, with the pupils . speculating that the egg could be that of a dinosaur or dragon, others . said that some younger children had been scared by it. One commented: 'He is scared of his own shadow and has been to sleep earlier but woke up at 9.20pm after having a nightmare!' Others said their children had been afraid to go to bed, with one mother writing: 'Holy trinity..........i hope this doesn't go on all week!!!!! I'm gona have 2 tired children!!!!!!!' Within hours of the initial post, Mr Smith had issued another letter, apologising to parents if their children had been upset by the egg. 'It has come to our attention that whilst the vast majority of the children at school were excited and engaged by this morning’s ""discovery"" there are some who have been worried by it,' he said in a second letter issued on June 16. School grounds: The well-meaning project revolved around a 3ft-high egg found in undergrowth on school grounds and was part of a problem solving exercise . 'We assure you that this afternoon we held an extra whole school assembly where we made it absolutely clear to everyone that the egg was of no danger to anyone, that it was safe to keep in school, and that we would therefore be able to observe it further tomorrow. 'We apologise if that message did not come through sufficiently and, as planned, in the follow-up assembly in the morning we will place further emphasis on it being of absolutely no danger whatsoever. 'During the course of today the children have produced an enormous amount of high quality work, in a variety of forms, related to the egg and it was great to see them so engaged. Such ""discoveries"" are quite common in primary schools across the country and are a very successful way of promoting problem solving, teamwork, group discussion and PSHE-related topics. This activity is part of our ""No Problem"" theme this term.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Postmistress: Margaret Player, 46, pretended she had been robbed at gunpoint, sparking a 600 hour police hunt, to cover up almost £4,000 of till thefts . A village postmistress who pretended she had been robbed at gunpoint to cover up nearly £4,000 of till thefts has been jailed. After stealing money from the post office branch in Croxton Kerrial, Leicestershire, Margaret Player rang 999 and falsely claimed a masked raider with a handgun had taken the cash sparking a 600 hour police hunt. Officers from Leicester Police spent between 500 and 600 hours searching for the non-existant thief, at a cost of almost £14,000 as 19 constables, a tactical firearms team, three sergeants, various inspectors and forensics experts joined the hunt. Police eventually came to suspect that Player had faked the robbery and asked for an audit of the post office’s accounts, revealing the truth behind the missing money. Player, 46, from Croxton Kerrial, admitted fraudulently falsifying accounting records, to conceal the fact that £3,800 was missing, between August 2011 and January 2012. She pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by falsely claiming that she had been robbed on December 20, 2011, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Neil Bannister, prosecuting, told Leicester Crown Court that inquiries revealed how Player had asked the Post Office for an additional delivery of £1,000 of funds prior to the false robbery claim, but the request was refused. She had also told a pensioner on the day of the fake robbery she did not have enough cash to cover pension payments. 'The police couldn’t find any evidence a robbery took place, and her explanation of what happened did not appear credible,' said Mr Bannister. House to house inquiries were made, and people who were at a bus stop opposite the Post Office at the time of the supposed raid told officers they had not seen anything suspicious. A Post Office audit ascertained £3,196 was missing following the ‘robbery’ but Player went on to steal a further £658 from the till after it was restocked. At one stage, Player had even pointed the finger of suspicion at the previous post mistress who still lived on the premises - resulting in an innocent woman being arrested and interviewed. Scene: After stealing money from the post office branch in Croxton Kerrial, Leicestershire, Player rang 999 and falsely claimed a masked raider with a handgun had taken the cash . Jonathan Dunne, mitigating, said Player had no previous convictions and was in debt at the time. 'She found it all too easy by using the post office till as a way of making ends meet, using it for extra money to tide her over,' he said. 'Having told the initial lie, it’s taken until now to admit to her lawyers what she’d done. She lost her job because of her dishonesty and is in even more reduced circumstances than in 2011.' Mr Dunne said Player suffered from ill health and was facing eviction from her home. 'You succumbed to the temptation of putting your hand in the till when you were a post mistress' Judge Nicholas Dean QC . Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Dean QC told Player: 'You persisted until June this year, insisting there was a robbery. 'You’ve finally faced up to the truth.' The judge added: 'You had pleaded guilty at an earlier stage to misappropriation, by taking money that wasn’t yours when in a position of trust. 'You fabricated a robbery and caused a considerable waste of police time and resources. 'What you hoped to achieve by reporting the robbery was the writing off of the money you’d taken - money that’s been wasted by you. 'You succumbed to the temptation of putting your hand in the till when you were a post mistress, entrusted by the Post Office with substantial sums.' He said an immediate jail sentence was 'inevitable and necessary'. After the hearing, Detective Constable Rob Buckley said: 'When Margaret Player reported the robbery she informed the call handler a firearm was used to threaten her and steal money. 'As a result officers from the armed response team were deployed to the incident. 'The initial response and subsequent inquiries resulted in many police hours being spent on the investigation, the inquiries spanned over two years. 'This was a complex investigation and we hope this case will deter others who may be considering abusing their position of trust.'","Margaret Player, 46, claimed masked raider with a gun held up her post office .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Sentenced: Sophie Hartley, 22, was jailed for four years after she  deliberately slit her neighbour's throat in a violent rage following an all day drinking binge . A young woman who called herself a 'Full Time F****** Ledgend' on Facebook has been jailed after she deliberately slit her neighbour's throat in a violent rage following an all day drinking binge. Sophie Hartley, 22, was sentenced to four years behind bars for her attack on 21-year-old neighbour Joe Arnfield during a heated row at her flat in Burnley, Lancashire. The pair had drunk up to six litres of cider before Hartley slashed her friend's neck with a kitchen knife, leaving him scarred for life with a six centimeter stab wound. Hartley claimed she was so drunk she could not remember the attack - initially telling police: 'If I was going to stab him, I would have slashed him up proper.' The brunette, who described her career on Facebook as a 'Full Time F****** Ledgend' (sic) later admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Stephen Parker, prosecuting, told . Burnley Crown Court that Hartley and Mr Arnfield had been drinking cider at . her flat throughout the afternoon and into the evening of March 13. He . said she had initially been good natured but at 7pm, her demeanour . suddenly changed for no reason and she became aggressive and . argumentative. Mr Parker . told the court Hartley had been shouting and swearing at Mr Arnfield, and . told him she was going to 'get people to sort him out.' Their mutual friend Gemma Wiggan had left the building earlier that afternoon, but returned to hear screaming from Hartley’s flat. She told police the pair were engaged in a heated argument with Hartley shouting at Mr Arnfield to get out, as the pair stood . face to face, punching each other. As the fight spilled into the kitchen, Ms Wigan said she saw Hartley reach for a kitchen knife from a drawer. She told her to put it back as she was going to hurt someone, but Hartley and Mr Arnfield continued to argue, the court heard. Drink: Burnley Crown Court was told that Hartley, pictured on another occasion, and victim Joe Arnfield had drunk up to six litres of cider between them before the stabbing . Ms Wigan said she then saw Hartley lunge at Mr Arnfield, thrusting the knife towards Mr Arnfield's abdomen. 'She got the impression she was trying to scare him,' Mr Parker said. 'Joe Arnfield didn’t move out of the way. 'The victim’s response was to . start laughing. He was saying ""You don’t have the balls to do it.” 'Hartley replied “Don’t tempt me, Joe.” 'He continued to laugh at her. Gemma Wiggan saw the defendant hold the knife up to Joe’s neck, Joe . still continued to laugh, she withdrew the knife and turned away from . him. He continued to laugh, she turned back to him again and in one . movement, sliced him horizontally across the neck.' Interview: Hartley initially claimed she was so drunk she could not remember the attack - telling police: 'If I was going to stab him, I would have slashed him up proper' 'Joe . Arnfield didn’t appreciate exactly what had happened, everybody started . to see blood, he held his hands up to his throat and his hands were . covered in blood. Gemma Wiggan said to the defendant “What have you . done ?” Hartley dropped the knife and started crying.' Mr Arnfield then ran from the flat, where some workmen tried to help stop the bleeding before he was rushed to hospital. Although he was left scarred by the attack, medics found that the blade had avoided any muscle, vital blood vessels or nerves. Hartley later told police she had been drinking since lunchtime but wouldn’t have stabbed Mr Arnfield. However, her account then changed and she claimed the pair of them had been messing around with a knife and the victim was a liar. The court heard she had 12 previous offences on her record, many of them drink-related. Richard Taylor, mitigating, said: 'She wants to come out of this sentence a better person. 'She says to me “I’m going to be scared of drinking anything on my release"". 'She has always said to me that she recalls very little of the incident. She is extremely remorseful and is relieved that great injury, or worse, was not caused.' Judge Jonathan Gibson sentenced Hartley to four years in prison, telling her she was lucky that Mr Arnfield had not been more seriously injured. 'It’s very fortunate for you it was a laceration which was not deep enough to interfere with muscle, vessels or nerves,' he told her. 'In the cold light of day, I am sure you appreciate you could have either seriously injured him or even killed him.'","Sophie Hartley, 22, jailed for four years for attack on Joe Arnfield, 21 .

"By . Associated Press . An attorney for a woman seen on video being repeatedly punched by a California Highway Patrol officer said tests show she had no drugs or alcohol in her system. Drivers who called 911 before the incident said 51-year-old Marlene Pinnock was barefoot on the shoulder of a Los Angeles freeway or attempting to cross lanes of traffic and appeared high or drunk. One caller said she appeared 'loaded.' Attorney Caree Harper said Pinnock has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the homeless woman was off her medications for roughly two to three months when the July 1 altercation occurred. Scroll down for video . Drug-free: Attornery Caree Harper, right, says her client Marlene Pinnock, left, had no drugs or alcohol in her system when she was taped being beaten by a California Highway Patrol officer . Assault: Pinnock's assault was videotaped and quickly spread online . The medication 'tends to make you drowsy so she had to regulate when she gets drowsy for safety purposes,' Harper said.  She added that Pinnock was previously misdiagnosed with a different mental illness and had been failed by the system. The CHP said Pinnock was endangering herself by walking on Interstate 10 and the officer was trying to restrain her. The agency has pledged a rapid investigation. CHP spokeswoman Sgt. Melissa Hammond couldn't confirm whether the agency has Pinnock's medical records but said if it did, they wouldn't be released because of the investigation. The woman whose videotaped beating by a California Highway Patrol officer sparked outrage told The Associated Press on Sunday that she believes the officer was trying to kill her and she wants him fired. Pinnock recalled being repeatedly punched in the head while being pinned by the officer. 'He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me, he beat me. I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death,' Pinnock said. Pinnock was released from the hospital last week after several weeks of treatment for head injuries, and now, she slurs her speech, Harper said. She's suing CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow and Officer Daniel L. Andrew in federal court for civil rights violations. The lawsuit claims excessive force, assault, battery and a violation of her due-process rights. Assault: The officer is seen grabbing and pummeling her . Stress: Pinnock, left, seen with attorney Caree Harper, said she's had nightmares about being beaten . The CHP won't confirm the identity of the officer, but the agency said he had been on the job for 1 1/2 years and is on desk duty pending completion of the internal investigation. Andrews' name appears in a document related to the encounter. Farrow met with community and civil rights leaders in Los Angeles multiple times last month and pledged that the investigation will conclude in weeks rather than the usual months. Pinnock said she had been homeless for the last three to five years, occasionally staying at a shelter, a family member's home or living on the streets. She said she was on her way to a place frequented by the homeless where she said she could feel safe to fall asleep. Harper said the area was accessed by walking along the freeway ramp. Drunk? Drivers who 911 said Pinnock appeared high or drunk before the assault, and one said she appeared 'loaded' She was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold by Andrew after the encounter, according to a document obtained by the AP. Andrew said in his report that she was a danger to herself and wrote that ""upon contacting the subject she was talking to herself. The subject began telling me 'I want to walk home' and called me 'the devil.' The subject then tried to walk into traffic lanes."" CHP investigators in July served a search warrant for Pinnock's medical records and the clothing she was wearing during the encounter from Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Pinnock is being supported by Harper to keep her off the street and is essentially ""starting from scratch,"" her attorney said. Pinnock said she's had nightmares about being beaten. However, she was also thankful for the support she's received and said she was indebted to the motorist who stopped to record the incident. 'Without the video my word may have not meant anything,' she said.","Marlene Pinnock, 51, did not have drugs or alcohol in her system when she was taped being repeatedly punched by a California Highway Patrol officer, her attorney Caree Harper says .

A single mum who enjoys kitting herself out with hair extensions and a spray tan is set to ruffle feathers – because she lets her two year old and four year old daughters enjoy the same things too. Sophie-May Dickson, 22, from Essex, sees nothing wrong with giving her daughters - Princess Bliss Tiana May, four, and PreciousBelle Ruby Rozina, two, - the works including spray tan, nail polish, and designer clothes. The single mum, who has not worked since she left school at 16 is set to appear on Channel 5 programme Blinging up Baby on Monday.

However, Ms Dickson does step in and draw the line at seeing her daughter perform the . raunchy dance move twerking. Yet she allows Princess to wear a blonde hair piece to other kids parties and says she has been wearing it since she was two. Princess regularly applies hair serum to her own hair and shares an incredible designer wardrobe worth . thousands of pounds with her sister. The closet, which could rival many women’s wardrobes, includes a pair of Ralph Lauren sparkly flat shoes costing £90 and a D&G child's dress costing up to £400. Princess's flashy pink bed costs around £1,000. ‘I go without so they can have these things,’ Ms Dickson said. She will not talk about how much she spends on her daughters, but admits that she often goes without to give them nice things. She rules out shopping on the high street and prefers going to boutiques instead. Ms Dickson split up with the girl’s father when Precious was very young, but makes sure the girls do not go without. Scroll down for video . Her two year-old, Precious Belle Ruby Rozina, whom she describes as a ’tomboy’ has her ears pierced and nails done.

"By . Belinda Robinson . A trio of lazy lions decided that they didn't need to do the hard work in order to enjoy a nice evening meal after stealing food from a leopard. The leopard, who had been stalking his prey for the past 45 minutes, had successfully killed the impala and decided to hoist his meal onto a branch of a tree in South Africa. Unfortunately for the leopard, a pack of lions were also close by, watching and waiting for the precise moment to strike. Hunt: A leopard is successful in collecting its evening meal after stalking an impala in the Sabi sand game reserve in South Africa . Climb: After gathering its kill, the leopard impressively hoists the impala into a tree . Supper: The leopard now has his evening meal in place, however, he is not the only one around . Wildlife photographer Andrew Schoeman said: 'Seeing the leopard stalk, chase and catch an impala is special, it is an exhilarating feeling.' 'We waited for about 45 minutes while the leopard stalked and eventually caught the impala, the Leopard then hoisted the kill and about five minutes later the Lions appeared on the scene.' The 41-year-old South African captured this encounter at night, while leading a wildlife photographic safari through the Sabi Sand game reserve in South Africa. However, even with 14 years of experience photographing wildlife, Mr Schoeman was stunned by the lions' next move. The lions bounded for the tree and began fighting over the impala while trying to keep their balance on the branches, allowing for the leopard to escape unharmed. Safe spot: The leopard hides his catch in a tree but he has now become aware that he has company in the form of three lions . Free food: The lions come bounding towards the tree and frantically start to climb . Fight: Once the lions climb the tree, their attention turns to fighting each other for the impala . Mr Schoeman, who lives in Nelspruit, South Africa, said: 'I have never seen lions climb trees like this but I know they can do it, so I was not surprised by the behaviour but it was great to see in real life. 'To watch the lions approach was very tense. We didn't want any harm to come to the leopard and we were relieved when the leopard managed to get away unharmed. 'It actually became quite comical and funny to watch the lions climb the tree, with their big bodies trying to balance in the branches while also trying to eat and compete with each other for the food.' Mr Schoeman has documented both lions and leopards for several years, learning the process of how they both hunt their prey. He added: 'I have watched both leopards and lions hunting before and I know it can be a long slow process but also exciting. 'Often the hunts are unsuccessful so when the leopard made the kill it was extra exciting and special to then watch the leopard hoist the kill into the tree. These animals can lift a heavy carcass almost effortlessly.' Wildlife: The photographs were taken by wildlife photographer Andrew Schoeman, who described the lions as comical as they struggled to balance as they attempted to take the impala for themselves .","The leopard stalked and killed an impala for an exhausting 45 minutes and stashed his prey in a tree for dinner .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Facebook: Mandy Ashforth and Barrie Moat celebrated their engagement after the date that never happened 32 years ago . A couple who reunited through Facebook have tied the knot more than three decades after one stood the other up. Mandy Ashforth, 48, from Yorkshire got over the fact that Barrie Moat, 50, stood her up 32 years ago and the pair showed that there were no hard feelings by getting married. But things did not go smoothly between them at first. The couple first met on holiday in . Bridlington, East Yorkshire in 1982 and were inseparable until Barrie, . then 19, left a heartbroken 17-year-old Mandy alone at the bus station. However, Mandy said that as the years passed by she never forget about Barrie. In 2013, over 30 years since he stood her up, she did a random search on a social networking site for . fishing pole repair services and ws shocked to find him. She quickly sent a friend request and soon the pair had rekindled that initial summer . loving feeling. The reunited couple delighted friends and family  by getting married exactly 18 months after she sent the friend request to her first love on Facebook. They tied the knot in front of 61 people. Mandy said: 'It was more than I ever expected - a real fairytale wedding. 'I had a big white dress and everything. 'It's hard to believe that after all these years apart we've got back together and we're now married.' Mandy said that she had spent years trying to locate Barrie after he stood her up, and . originally started by wandering around Sheffield - where he was from - . but to no avail. In later years she took to Friends Reunited and looked through old school records before they finally met again. Mandy recalled: 'We met as teenagers in Bridlington in 1982 - I was 17 and Baz was 19. I was from Eastwood and he was from Sheffield. 'We spent all our time together and at the end of the holiday he walked me to my coach and arranged to meet the following week on the Sunday. Wedding: Mandy Ashforth and Barrie Moat share a laugh on their wedding day just 18 months after she sent him a friend request . 'I arrived to meet Baz in Rotherham bus station and waited two hours but he never came to meet me and I was devastated. True Love: The newlyweds have now returned from a week's honeymoon in Marmaris, Turkey and couldn't be happier . 'In the year that followed, I looked for Barrie Moat in various places in Sheffield but never found him. 'The months turned into years and Barrie was always in my mind. 'I searched for him numerous times but it always led to a dead end.' The newlyweds have now returned from a week's honeymoon in Marmaris, Turkey and couldn't be happier. That happiness seems to have cleared Barrie's memory of the reason he stood up Mandy in the first place. The 50-year-old said: 'I have no idea why I didn't turn up to meet her - I really can't remember. 'I only joined Facebook to promote my fishing pole repair business and I never normally accept friend requests from women unless they have something to do with fishing. 'For some reason I assumed she was involved with fishing so I clicked to accept it and within seconds she had sent me a message. 'Things very quickly just clicked into place and we both decided we wanted to be together. 'It was just too good to be true. We both knew we had met the right person - I only wish I'd known that 30 years ago.'","Mandy Ashforth, 48, was stood up by Barrie Moat, 50, over 32 years ago .

Italy’s prison service said that . organizing events was not unusual, when everything happens ‘in broad . daylight, as in this case, we believe’. Happy hours: Female prisoners at San Vittore jail in Milan, Italy, pictured, were given alcoholic happy hours at least twice a week . Good times: Prisoners were even provided with a catering service at the events . However, Italian prison guards' union Osapp have blasted the revelations. It lodged a complaint to both the Ministry of Justice and the Senate president over the allegations. According to Osapp, prison staff agreed to organize the happy hours which ran until ‘late at night’ with ‘external guests’. Prisoners were even provided with a catering service and offered alcohol, say reports. The union has called into question both the costs and profits of the venture, asking for ‘urgent clarification’ from the Italian authorities.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Accusation: Michael Martin at Preston Crown Court where he was jailed for a string of lies . A senior police officer's 26-year long career is over after he was jailed for lying on his CV to win a string of top jobs. Mike Martin, 46, from Carlisle appeared at Preston Crown Court yesterday, after a four year inquiry into claims he exaggerated and fabricated his work achievements to clinch promotion to higher ranks with various forces across the UK. The court heard heard how the Superintendent falsely claimed to have a university degree - a BSc in Risk and Security Management - and said he had taken part into the investigation into the tragedy of a young Indian woman who was found starved to death inside her car. He also . lied about the identity of his line manager. Police began investigating . Martin, described as a 'capable and highly ambitious' officer after he . was offered a transfer to the Metropolitan Police in 2009 - just five . months after landing a job at the Merseyside force. Human . resources officials noticed that he had failed to seek the support of a senior . officer for the application, which would be normal practice and sensed . something was wrong with Martin's application. Officers later checked the veracity of his degree which he claimed to have obtained from the University of Portsmouth in 1996. The degree certificate was found to be a forgery and inquiries showed there was no record of him being on the course. The . investigators checked out a library where Martin said he met with his . tutor to find it had no formal links with higher education and wasn't . used by lecturers and students. Promotion: Martin lied about being involved in the investigation into an Indian woman's death to give potential employers the impression he had relevant experience in dealing with race and diversity issues . It emerged . that Martin had lied about being involved in the investigation into the . Indian woman's death to give potential employers the impression that he had . relevant experience in dealing with race and diversity issues. He also upgraded his Performance and Development Reviews in applications. It is thought he made £70,000 from his illicit promotions. During his appearance at Preston Crown Court, Mr Martin, who has been suspended from his £60,000 a year job since September 2011 showed no emotion as he was found guilty of fraud and misconduct in a public office after a week long trial. He was jailed for 18 months. Judge Anthony Russell QC told him: 'You were able to take advantage of the process to make untrue and misleading representations about your career and able to improve, thus gaining an advantage over candidates. 'In other words you cheated and your promotion resulted in a significant salary increase. 'You made applications over two years, a total of five applications using some or all of these false particulars. 'This was a serious breach of trust that the public places in all police officers, particular senior officers. 'It undermines the integrity of the police. Your conduct fell fall below what the public requires. 'It is a tragedy, you were a highly regarded police officer. You may well have achieved promotion later without telling lies. Ambition got the better of you and you decided to cheat. You have effectively lost everything as a result of this case. You have let down the police and public confidence in the police.' Jailed: Mr Martin, showed no emotion as he was found guilty of fraud at Preston Crown court, pictured, . Earlier in the trial, Mr Martin had told how he joined the Met in 1988 and was promoted to sergeant eight yeas later. He joined Devon and Cornwall in 2003 and was promoted to Inspector two years later. In October 2007 he transferred to Essex Police and was promoted to Chief Inspector. After a series of unsuccessful job applications he joined Merseyside as a Superintendent in February 2009 but just three months into the job he applied to rejoin the Met because he wanted to be involved in the policing of the London Olympics. Trouble began two months later in September 2009 when he was notified that his application to the Met had been accepted and he told Merseyside Police he was leaving. The jury was told an investigation began after it emerged Mr Martin's line manager at Merseyside had not made any recommendations in relation to the application and the move had been 'rather quick.' In December 2009 Merseyside was provided with Mr Martin's application to the Met which wrongly gave the name of line manager as a Chief Superintendent from the Essex force. Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told jurors: 'A subsequent investigation found that not only on that application, but on several occasions over some years, the defendant had made misleading statements and, indeed, fabricated information about himself, in order to support applications. 'On application Mr Martin falsely claimed to have taken part in a procedural review whilst at Devon and Cornwall Police following the high-profile death of computer engineer Davina Rappai who was found in her Ford Escort in a National Trust car park at Gorran Haven, Cornwall in August 1998. The review had taken place after claims five Good Samaritans phoned police but no officer went to see her in the ten days before her body was found. A post-mortem failed to find a cause of death but she weighed just 88lb and there was evidence of muscle wastage. In a successful application to Essex Police, Mr Martin had claimed to have been involved in implementing or drafting 'new strategies' as a result of the investigation. He plagiarised 16 lines from the application form of a colleague which claimed he had 'reviewed and challenged a raft of force policies regarding dealing with vulnerable people.' He said that he received expressions of gratitude, including from a coroner. He was given a formal interview by the Met and the case of Rappai was discussed. In feedback a chief superintendent talked of being struck by that example of showing sensitivity to minorities. But Martin's then-line manager in Devon, former chief superintendent Joanna Tennant told the court there were 'inaccuracies' in his application. She added that she was unaware that she had been put down as a 'verifier' of his application, and that she was never contacted by his prospective employers. She said that it was rare that new employers would check the accuracy of an application. Ms Tennant said: 'There's a definite skill in writing an application where you make the best and most of the evidence you have to present it to the employer.' However, Mr Martin denied wrongdoing but was convicted after a trial after jurors took almost six hours to reach their majority verdicts. He is expected to be dismissed from the force. Defence counsel Mr Michael Magarin QC said Mr Martin had always been an 'excellent police officer' and during his career had to deal with the 1994 mortar attack by the IRA on Heathrow Airport. He was also assigned to protect high profile figures like diplomats and royalty. 'This has been a complete humiliation for him to be in the dock and prosecuted' said Mr Magarin. 'He is now a convicted fraudster and he is unsure of what future job prospects he will have. The punishment has already been severe humiliation and distress, that in itself will serve as punishment.' After the case Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke, of Merseyside Police said: 'The public quite rightly have high expectations of police officers and Merseyside Police is committed to meeting those expectations by demanding high standards of professionalism, honesty and integrity. 'Mike Martin’s behaviour has been proven in a court of law to be dishonest and led to his appointment to a senior position in Merseyside Police. There is no doubt that his actions have been an embarrassing episode for Merseyside Police. 'It is vital that we maintain the public’s trust and confidence and ensure that officers and staff throughout the police service realise the importance of maintaining standards and working with honesty and integrity. 'We cannot afford to have officers and staff working for us who do not uphold the highest levels of professionalism, honesty and integrity and will always be robust in dealing with officers, or staff, whose conduct is unacceptable.'","Mike Martin, 46, from Carlisle was jailed at Preston Crown Court .

"By . Steve Robson . A travelling freak show has been forced to advertise a vacancy for a 'wolf boy/girl' in order to comply with Britain's employment laws. The Circus of Horrors, which reached the finals of Britain’s Got Talent in 2011, had signed up Jesus ‘Chuy’ Aceves of Mexico, who has a medical condition that means hair grows all over his face, to take part. But the producers found their new appointment breaches a government law which requires the job to be advertised in the UK on websites so that British jobseekers can apply if they wish. Hair raising: Mexican wolf boy, Jesus Aceves, had been signed up for the show before circus bosses were told they had to put the job out for any UK candidates . If no British wolf boy or girl can be found, then Jesus will get the job. According to the online advert, the successful candidate will earn up to £500 per week and that all applicants must be genuinely hairy – people with beards or wearing masks are unacceptable. The advert states applicants 'must have a minimum of 60,000 hairs growing on the face and linking up with the hairline, hair on the head is not included' It adds: 'Duties to include all aspects of working as a wolf person and any other circus skills would be an advantage.' The Circus of Horrors is playing 57 dates across the country over the coming months. Dr Haze, the show’s creator, said: 'It is a strange state of affairs, we are pretty sure there are not any Wolf Boys or Girls in the UK, but we still have to advertise the job over here. 'The thing is, the applicant must be a genuine Wolf person.' The advert says applicants for the job must have at least 60,000 hairs on their face . Perplexed: Circus of Horrors boss Dr Haze said the show had been left in a 'strange situation' after being told they had to offer the role to UK jobseekers . The Circus of Horrors rose to fame after appearing in Britain's Got Talent in 2011 . A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: 'This government is determined to control immigration while remaining open to the brightest and the best. 'All UK-based employers who wish to obtain a sponsor licence have to adhere to the rules set out in the application process.' Mr Acheves, who arrived in the UK last year and was thought to be the first Wolf person to visit the country in 30 years, has a rare condition called Hyper Trichosis. People with the condition, which is sometimes nicknamed 'Werewolf Syndrome', have a particularly high level of body hair. It is understood he will play a part in the show if no suitable applicants come through the recruitment process.

"By . Belinda Robinson . A bogus bride and groom have been jailed after rounding up guests for their sham wedding - from a local bus stop. Uzoma Onwuha, 30, and Robert Horvath, 35 exchanged vows at Cardiff register office, in front of strangers they'd met on the way to their ceremony in Cardiff, Wales. But Nigeria-born Onwuha had paid Horvath £1,000 to marry her so that she could get the necessary paperwork to stay in Britain. Sham: Uzoma Onwuha, 30 (pictured) exchanged vows with Robert Horvath in front of strangers they met at the local bus stop and invited to witness the nuptials . Staff at the register office soon became suspicious because the 'couple' couldn’t give basic details about each other. Later, a police investigation showed that one guest revealed that he was invited after the pair found him at a bus stop nearby. Cardiff Crown court heard that as soon as their big day was over the newlyweds went their separate ways. Onwuha caught a bus back to her home in London alone where she was arrested. Meanwhile, Horvath was seized in a raid on his home in Newport, South Wales, where he was found living with another woman. Prosecutor Jeremy Jenkins said: 'There were only six guests at the wedding. Case: Cardiff Crown court heard that as soon as the day was over the newlyweds went their separate ways . 'But they were unable to answer police questions such as where the other guests were from. 'One guest said he had been invited to the wedding after a random meeting with the bride and groom at a bus stop.' Onwuha, who came to the Britain on a student visa, admitted obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception. Horvath, a Czech Republic native who has lived in Britain since 2000, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. They were each jailed for 12 months and told to pay £225 to cover prosecution costs. Judge Phillip Richards said: 'Horvath got a financial reward from a woman who could scarcely afford that money. For him it was a money-making exercise. For her it was a money-losing exercise. 'Those who deceive in order to benefit in such a way are creating serious crimes. There is already enough criminal activity going on in the UK,' Upon serving her sentence, Onwuha will be released into immigration custody and steps will be taken for her to be returned to Nigeria.","Nigeria-born Uzoma Onwuha paid Robert Horvath £1,000 to marry her .

"By . Belinda Robinson . They have only just met, but this monkey and gorilla are already the best of friends at their home in Dublin zoo. Soon after they were introduced, keepers noticed the newly arrived red-capped African mangabey  whisper something into three-year-old gorilla Kituba's ear. There's no telling what the little mangabey was telling the gorilla, but who knows, he could have been revealing the secret location to a stash of bananas. Guess what: A red-capped mangabey, left, appears to hug and whisper into three-year-old gorilla Kituba's ear . Can you believe it: Soon after they were introduced, the newly arrived red-capped African mangabey had an in-depth conversation with Kituba . How many bananas: There's no telling what the little mangabey was telling the gorilla, but he could have revealed all about a stash of bananas . Helen . Clarke Bennett, team leader at the African Plains said: 'It has been . very exciting to watch the red-capped mangabeys and the gorillas getting . used to each other over the past few weeks. 'When . the time came for them to meet face to face things could not have gone . better. The younger gorillas in particular are very curious about the . mangabeys and keen to get to know and play with them.' 'To . introduce and keep these two species in the same space and ensure that . they live harmoniously together is a challenge but so far it has been . very successful,' the zoo says. The mangabeys will be sharing the Gorilla Rainforest with the Zoo’s gorilla family. The distribution of western lowland gorillas and red-capped mangabeys in Africa overlaps. They are a bachelor group which was formed to assist the European breeding programme for this species. Lovely to see you: The two primates hit it off immediately according to zoo staff and have remained close . See you later: The little red-capped mangabey takes a stroll in his new surroundings after his chit chat with his gorilla mate . Wearing a crown of red on top of their heads, the red-capped mangabey is a small primate with a distinctive face, white eyes and white fur framing the face. They are mostly found in coastal, swamp, mangrove, and valley forests, from western Nigeria, east and south Cameroon, and throughout Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and The Gabon-Congo border by the Atlantic shore. The petite monkey, also known as the 'collared mangabey' (Cercocebus torquatus) is tall and slender and typically lives in large groups of 10 to 35 individuals including several males. Mangabeys appear equally at home 30 metres up in the trees and on the ground and have a unique calling pattern in the form of cackles and barks which are used to keep the group in contact and signal their position to other groups. A throat sac gives resonance to their wide range of calls and is well developed in the males, but females also have small sacs – giving rise to loud cackles, whoops (da-ooo), ‘baddas’ and screams.Their diet consists of fruits and seeds, but they also eat leaves, foliage, flowers, invertebrates, mushrooms, dung, and gum.The monkey has no defined breeding season but reaches sexual maturity at five to seven years. Due to loss of habitat and being hunting for bushmeat they are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Redlist.","A monkey and gorilla walk into Dublin zoo - and become the best of mates .

"By . Belinda Robinson . A worrying number of shy and book smart children are being labelled as 'mentally ill' by doctors who  are under pressure from parents to give them a diagnosis according to a top psychiatrist. Professor Sir Simon Wessely, the new head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists says that there is a growing trend of medicating normal traits in children by the insistence of overbearing parents. Pushy parents are getting GPs to prescribe drugs such as Ritalin and Prozac to treat serious disorders creating a huge rise in antidepressants and drug use among young children. Wrong diagnosis: Professor Sir Simon Wessely, the new head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists says that there is a growing trend of medicating normal traits in children by the insistence of overbearing parents . Along with mental health diagnosis, one of the most commonly medicated disorders is attention deficit hyperactivity . disorder (ADHD). If a child is seen as being overactive, but does not . necessarily have ADHD, he could be prescribed drugs, Professor Wessely said. He told The Times: . 'Certain behaviour carry stigma and there's less stigma if it's associated with a disorder. Often it's about the avoidance of guilt. 'You get obvious pressures from parents: we've all been to middle class dinner parties where so many parents seem to say their kids are mildly autistic and yet they've just got into Oxford. And you think 'I don't really buy that one'... Around . three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have . ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve . their concentration at school. According to recent figures, the use of ADHD drugs has tripled over the past decade and antidepressants usage has shot up too. Professor . Wessely said that it is becoming less common for children to be . labelled as 'shy' but they are more likely to be branded as having a . social phobia or a behavioural problem. New head: Professor Sir Simon Wessely will take over as the new head of The Royal College of Psychiatrists in London next week and has already made his no-nonsense views known . Labelled: Shy children, who enjoy reading are often being labelled as 'mentally ill' by doctors who are under pressure from parents to give them a diagnosis . And . even schools are benefitting from mislabelling pupils, says Professor Wessely, as the more special . needs children in a school, the more funds they'll get. However, some experts claim that many disorders have no merit at all, and are in fact, made up. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) tablets: Pushy parents are getting GPs to prescribe drugs such as Ritalin for young children . Paediatric neurologist Dr Richard . Saul, based in Chicago, believes that ADHD simply ‘doesn’t exist’ and is being used as a . mask for less serious problems. Dr . Saul argues that children are being misdiagnosed. ‘ADHD makes a great excuse,’ Dr Saul . said in his book, ‘ADHD does not exist: The truth about Attention . Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder.’ ‘The . diagnosis can be an easy-to-reach-for crutch. Moreover, there’s an . attractive element to an ADHD diagnosis, especially in adults - it can . be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once, . rather than stuck in a boring rut.’ Echoing Dr Saul's views, a group of . researchers from Australia and the Netherlands said in November that the . diagnosis of ADHD may have become too broad. A . wider classification of symptoms for ADHD in the psychiatric ‘bible’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and . prescriptions for medication, the study warned. The group of researchers said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder. In addition, stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help, or they are undertreated.","Overbearing parents are pushing GPs to dish out drugs for treatment .

"By . Belinda Robinson . A dad-of-six says he was 48 hours away from death after medics repeatedly mistook his life-threatening bowel condition for stomach ache. Stuart Pashley, 47, from Clay Cross in Derbyshire was sent away with painkillers twice by doctors  when he complained of chronic abdominal pain. He also claims that he was told by one GP not to go to hospital because 'sickness bugs can close hospital wards and kill people'. Family man: Stuart Pashley is pictured with his wife Lisa and his two-year-old son William enjoying each day after he nearly died because his bowel burst and doctors mistook his symptoms for a stomach bug . But six days after his symptoms started, a third doctor sent him to hospital where he was diagnosed with a life-threatening bowel condition and had surgery to remove part of his colon. He also had to have a colostomy bag fitted. Mr Pashley said: 'I was in a coma for two days to recover from the operation. 'But when I came round the consultant surgeon told me that if I hadn't come in it would have been less than 48 hours and I would be dead. 'It didn't really sink in until later when I thought I have a wife and young children and that could have all been gone.' The doting father has six children, William, two, Amber, six, Eboni, nine, Laura, 22, Zoey, 24, and Vikki, 26. Treatment: Six days after his symptoms started, a third doctor sent him to hospital where he was diagnosed with a life-threatening bowel condition and had surgery to remove part of his colon . Coma: The 47-year-old, from Clay Cross, Derbyshire was put into a medically induced coma for two days to recover after surgery . He was diagnosed with suffering from severe diverticulitis, which causes pockets to form in the colon that collect waste and can eventually burst. He added: 'I knew from the moment the pain started it was more than a stomach ache. 'Since the operation I have been on forums and I have seen people say the pain is worse than childbirth. I was bent over, crying with the pain.' Mr Pashley initially phoned the NHS 111 helpline on March 7, after waking with abdominal pain, sickness and diarrhoea. He was told to keep up with fluids and take painkillers by the adviser and see a doctor if he was still in pain the following Monday. Three days later, and still in pain, he was visited by a doctor from Clay Cross Medical Centre who echoed the words of the 111 adviser and warned him 'not to go to hospital as sickness bugs can close wards and kill people'. The next day, Mr Pashley awoke with severe pains in his abdomen and his wife Lisa, 33, who works in local government, called for an ambulance. Mr Pashley said: 'My wife rang 999 and was told by the operator, because my condition was not life threatening, an ambulance could not be sent and if we wanted to go to A&E we would have to make our own way there.' Moments later, his wife phoned the non-emergency line 111 and was told an ambulance would be sent out. Advice: Mr Pashley launched a complaint against Clay Cross Medical Centre and says he has received a letter of apology, but wants to urge people to trust their instincts when it comes to their health . The paramedic rang Mr Pashley's GP and said that he would need stronger painkillers, so he booked in for another appointment the following day. When he arrived the next afternoon, he was 'doubled over with abdominal pain' but was still told to avoid A&E and was given high-strength painkiller, Tramadol. Later that afternoon - and now in the 'worst pain' he had ever experienced - another doctor visited his home and, at last, decided to call for an ambulance. He said: 'The next day I had a laparotomy and Hartmann's procedure for severe diverticulitis. 'I was told by the consultant surgeon that if I hadn't been admitted I would have been dead within 48 hours.' Following the intense surgery to remove part of his colon, Mr Pashley was put into a medically induced coma for two days to recover. He has launched a complaint against Clay Cross Medical Centre and says he has received a letter of apology, but wants to urge people to trust their instincts when it comes to their health. He said: 'Listen to your GP, do what they say. But you know your own body so if you think you need it, get another opinion.' A spokesperson for NHS England, said: 'We take extremely seriously incidents where patients suffer distress or harm whilst in the receipt of NHS care. 'We will be asking the practice to provide us with a copy of their formal response to the patient and, if appropriate, any performance concerns will be addressed.'","Stuart Pashley, 47, was sent away with painkillers twice by doctors .

"By . Belinda Robinson . and James Tozer . This is the first picture of the 11-year-old boy whose parents have been arrested on suspicion of neglect and child cruelty after allowing his weight to balloon to 15st. The couple, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk were caught out when they met with social workers with the explicit intent of trying to get a wet room installed at home - but were investigated. They claim that teachers encouraged them to contact a social worker for the state-of-the-art wet room which would have cost over £2000 as a trick to make authorities drop in. Overweight: This is the 11-year-old boy whose parents allowed him to balloon to 15 stone - but blamed genetics . According to The Sun police stepped in after doctors raised concerns about the boy’s welfare following two visits to hospital earlier this year. Yesterday the parents admitted that they called their obese son ‘Wee Chubby’ because of his size – but blamed genetics rather than his diet and lifestyle. Both parents have been arrested on child cruelty charges and been bailed. However his mum is adamant that the wet room would have made life easier for them as their son had refused to go upstairs - but it led child protection services to show up a month later. Following a meeting with social workers this week, the couple have agreed to a letter of intent over the boy’s care outlining what they will do to help him lose weight. If they fail to stick to the terms, legal proceedings will be started to take the boy into care. The 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 – close to double the healthy level. According to the NHS’s online BMI calculator, the healthy weight range for his age and height is from 6st 14lb to 9st 7lb. A social services report is said to record that he fell over during a school swimming session and was unable to stand up by himself. It also details admissions to teachers that the boy – who is supposed to be on a strict diet – had eaten takeaways and been to a milkshake parlour. The boy’s 20st father said yesterday: ‘My son’s always been big. He was born with shovels for hands and spades for feet. Everyone on my side of the family is big. ‘There’s nothing we can do about it. I only eat occasional kebabs. Our son’s favourite snack is steamed broccoli – and he’s still big.’ The father, 49, and his unemployed wife, 43, told The Sun they try to encourage their son to play sport by giving him toy guns to fire in their garden at home. He also plays regularly on his Nintendo Wii, a computer games console in which players depend on physical movements to control actions on the screen. The couple had signed up to a voluntary plan to tackle the boy’s weight when they were threatened with legal action earlier this year, but it brought no improvement. Concerns were raised by teachers at the specialist school he attends for help with autism, and the parents agreed to see a social worker. The 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 - close to double the healthy level - but the NHS's online BMI calculator, the healthy weight range for his age and height is between 6st 14lb and 9st 7lbs (file . picture) But doctors at the boy’s local hospital called police after he was twice admitted for treatment in March, and officers then visited the family’s home. The boy’s mother, who describes herself as ‘chubby’, said the family were trying their best to help him. ‘The idea they could take away my son scares me so much,’ she said. ‘I’m nothing without my kids. His weight isn’t that much of a big deal … it’s genetics – you can be genetically fat.’ Police said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to comment on the case, but added that a child’s welfare was ‘paramount’ in such situations and that officers only intervened when ‘other attempts to protect the child have been unsuccessful’.

"By . Belinda Robinson . The mum of a 15-month-old toddler who got a coin lodged in his throat has described how lucky she feels that her son survived the drama. Lesley Pattinson, 39, from Fylingdales, North Yorkshire had to rush to save her son Harry after he began to cough and retch after something got stuck in his throat. The quick-thinking mum said that she was at home with her son Harry who was sitting on the carpet at the other end of the living room when she saw him pick up something on the floor, put it in his mouth and swallow it. Lucky boy: Harry Pattinson stands with his mum Lesley who saved him when he nearly choked after accidentally swallowed a penny . X-Ray: The X-Ray shows a one pence piece stuck in little Harry's throat which he accidentally put it in his mouth . What's this mum: Little Harry looks at the one pence piece that he put in his mouth which is now safely in a toddler proof container which he will not be able to open . She said: 'It . was like it happened in slow motion - before I could stop him he had . already swallowed the coin. It's so strange because he's usually such a cautious . little boy, he's not one to throw himself into something without . checking with me first, usually he'd show me what he'd found rather than putting it straight into his mouth. 'I rushed over to him and he was coughing, choking. His lips started to turn a little bit blue. He was retching. It was really scary and just horrendous, but as strange as it sounds, I was really calm about it all. 'I'm not first aid trained but I think as a mother you see all sorts of things, and . I knew that I needed to stay calm. It was my job to stay calm and . reassure him. If I had panicked we wouldn't have got anything done . sooner. 'I . picked him up and tried to soothe him, while thinking about what I . should do. After just a couple of minutes, he seemed to calm down. He . wasn't gasping for breath, he seemed to be quite relaxed, but I knew that I needed to get him to hospital. However, the family lives in a remote area so help was not readily available so she had to do all that she could at home at that very moment. She added: 'It's a miracle he survived really. The coin was lodged right at the top of his throat. Luckily it went down his food pipe instead of his windpipe, otherwise the outcome could have been horribly different. 'But because it was so close to the top of the pipe, at any moment it could have flipped up and gone down his windpipe. The full time mum lives with her partner Dennis Shaw, 42, and her other three children Marcus Pattinson, 11, Declan Pattinson, ten, and nine-year-old George. Super mum: Lesley Pattinson said she is not first aid trained but knew that she needed to stay calm . She added: 'I decided not to ring for an ambulance because we live in such a rural area that I know it takes so long for an ambulance to get to us, so I got in the car and drove us to Whitby A&E. They rushed straight up to X-ray and from the picture they could see that the coin was lodged right at the top of Harry's throat. She remembers that she tried to keep him calm so the coin wasn't dislodged, but her son seemed to be fine and quite happy. She added: 'The doctors decided they had to send him to a hospital with a specialist anaesthetist for children. 'We waited for an ambulance and then it took about half an hour to get to the hospital, so we arrived at James Cook [hospital] around three hours after he swallowed the coin. 'As soon as we got there they took him up to theatre and gave him a general anaesthetic, and pulled the object out with what I think were like some pincers. Thankfully, they didn't have to make any cuts. 'When he came round, he was fine. We gave him some milk and because he'd kept it down they said to us that after a few hours he was fine to go home.Since then he's been absolutely fine. The grateful mother realises that her quick thinking actions saved her child's life and she said that she can't believe she was so calm, but she knew that panicking wouldn't help. She said: 'You're all a child has got in that moment to sort things out for them, that was my job and I'm glad it ended so well.' 'I feel very lucky that we've got a happy ending - it just makes you appreciate what you've got, really.'","Mum Lesley Pattinson had to save her son after he swallowed a coin at home .

"By . Belinda Robinson . In pain: Caroline Bielby has been left with permanent nerve damage, affecting her leg and foot . A mum-of-two has been forced to live the rest of her life in excruciating pain after spending two years with a metal screw lodged in her spine. Caroline Bielby, 36, complained to doctors 30 times that she was weak because of the piece of metal incorrectly inserted into a major nerve by surgeons at Castle Hill Hospital in Cottingham, East Yorks. Despite having spinal surgery intended to improve a condition in her spine in April 2010, the misplaced screw was not identified for 18 months, by which her symptoms grew progressively worse. Ms Bielby from Beverley, East Yorkshire experienced . pins and needles and weakness and was left with permanent nerve damage . affecting her leg and foot as the damage increased over time. She said: 'The last few years have been a complete nightmare and I am . still in pain which will never go away due to the damage to my nerves. 'I don’t feel like the same person as I was before the operation, but I do try to remain positive each day. 'It . is very difficult, especially struggling with the little things in life . that we all take for granted such as taking my youngest to and from . school, or not being able to do the housework like I used to be able to . do.' In March 2012, the screw was eventually removed - nearly two years after the original surgery - but the damage to the nerve was irreversible. Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital NHS Trust admitted there had been a failure to arrange further imaging after an x-ray and an MRI scan were incorrectly interpreted. Expert medical evidence found that if the screw had been identified and removed shortly after the original surgery, as the Trust accepted that it should have been, the damage to the nerve would not have progressed and Caroline's symptoms would have largely resolved. X-Ray: Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital NHS . Trust admitted there had been a failure to arrange further imaging after . an x-ray and an MRI scan were incorrectly interpreted . Mistake: The mum-of-two will live the rest of her life in excruciating pain but has received compensation . Ms Bielby has been awarded an undisclosed five-figure settlement to cover her loss of earnings as she was unable to return to work after the original surgery and will be unable to work ever again. She will also use the compensation to fund further treatment to aid her recovery. The former secretary, said: 'I haven’t been able to work since the surgery and I would love to do so, but unfortunately due to my condition I am very limited as to what work I can do. 'We went to Disneyland in 2011, but I was in so much pain that I had to sit down while my family enjoyed the rides. 'We're going back soon but I still won't be able to get on the rides because of my symptoms. I'll never be able to go on the big rides again. 'It's affected my whole family because I cant join in with them as much as I'd like to. 'I'd like to work but I would need a desk job with limited hours as I can't stand for long. 'I'm trying to remain positive and will do what I can to make it happen. I want to rebuild my life as much as possible. 'I feel I was let down by the NHS as I felt I was passed from pillar to post for two years whilst I was experiencing the most excruciating pain of my life. I hope that lessons have been learned by the Trust to prevent this happening to anyone else.' Positive: Caroline Bielby says she had experienced pins and needles and weakness but says that she is trying to remain positive and will rebuild her life as much as possible after a CT scan, right, revealed the truth . Ms Bielby recalls how she began experiencing back pain whilst she was pregnant with her first daughter in 1999. In 2002 she was referred by her GP for an MRI scan and was told she had degeneration of the discs in her spine. Over the next eight years, she went to hospital every six months for x-rays and an annual MRI scan to check on her condition. But the pain worsened and in 2010 she had surgery at Castle Hill Hospital to stabilise her spine in a bid to repair the damage. Following her surgery, Caroline’s back pain improved but almost immediately, she became aware of a sharp excruciating pain in her left leg and left big toe. She was initially advised that the pain would settle and was nothing to be concerned about. However, over the next few months, Caroline noticed numbness and loss of feeling in her leg, describing it as feeling ‘not like her own’. By early 2011, the numbness in Caroline’s left foot and leg had begun to spread and she had lost the feeling all the way up to two inches below her knee cap. Later that year, Caroline had a CT scan and x-ray which identified one screw at a different angle to all of the others and the surgeon explained that the top of the screw was rubbing away at the nerves causing the pain and loss of feeling in her leg and foot. Caroline was told she would need further surgery to remove the screw and underwent an operation in March 2012. Katie Warner, an expert medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who represented Caroline, said: 'The impact of the surgery on Caroline’s life has been devastating. 'She struggled with her symptoms for years and when she sought advice, no one identified the cause of the problems and she was made to feel that it was ‘all in her head’. 'Understandably, she feels very let down by the medical professionals she trusted. 'Caroline’s symptoms have affected her ability not only to work, but to carry out her day-to-day life with her family and all of this has had a significant impact on her confidence. She feels that she is not the bubbly, outgoing person that she was before all of this happened. 'The screw’s position was indicated on an x-ray taken just two days after the initial surgery and because it wasn’t spotted and rectified for two years it has now caused permanent damage to the nerves, leaving Caroline suffering needlessly. 'We are pleased that the Trust admitted liability and the settlement reflects the severity of Caroline’s condition and the impact it has had on her life. 'Sadly the mistakes that were made have left Caroline in an even more debilitating position than she was before surgery. 'We hope the Trust has learned from this and will ensure that patient safety is improved in follow up to future spinal surgery.'","Caroline Bielby complained 30 times that she was in pain after surgery .

"By . Belinda Robinson . A Russian cannibal who admitted to eating his friend on a Siberian fishing expedition walked free from court despite confessing to the jury that he wasn't even hungry when he ate him. The victim's distraught wife Olga Korochkin, 38, spoke out of her 'horror' at her husband's brutal killing after she revealed that all she's been left with is his foot with toes, one finger, and the back of his skull with some hair. Her husband, Andrei Kurochkin, 44, was eaten by his close friends - Alexei Gorulenko and Alexander Abdullaev - fishermen who got lost for months during an expedition in frozen Siberia. Not that hungry: Alexei Gorulenko gets a hot meal on board a flight after his rescue - he would later admit to eating his friend . In happier times: The dead man Andrei Kurochkin is pictured here on his wedding day with wife Olga who has been left with his human remains after he was eaten by friends . His wife said: 'Can you imagine what I have left? One . foot with toes, one finger, and the back of his skull with some hair. This is it. 'This is all I have left from the man I loved. Having just . these remains, how can I say goodbye to him? I have got almost nothing . to cry over...sorry, I can't think about it, I am losing my mind with . this. 'I never expected such horror . could come into my life. It has ruined not just my life, but also the . lives of all our relatives, and we are a big family', she said, according to the Siberian Times. 'Now I want these . cannibals to be punished. I fear our police are not keen to investigate . this case properly. Our law does not say a word about cannibalism, it is . not a crime.' Family man: The victim Andrei, right, is pictured with his daughter and wife Olga, left, before his fateful trip to Siberia . During the court case in Russia to decide the mens fate both made the shocking admission that they weren't really that hungry when they sliced up their friend and ate him. The prosecution at the trial in . Neryungri alleged Mr Korochkin, was beaten by the two fishermen who then dismembered, cooked . and ate the man's corpse. Forensic examinations of the recovered body showed that sections of flesh had been carefully sliced away while joints had been butchered. The court heard how they carried his body with them as they sought to escape their frozen hell. The dreadful revelations prompted Mr Kurochkin's family to argue that his friends had butchered him to death and they should be on trial for murder. But the court threw out the murder charge and convicted Alexei Gorulenko of causing bodily harm for which he was given a suspended three-and-a-half year jail sentence. Cannibal: Alexei Gorulenko is pictured here - he admitted he ate a friend after they were lost for days during an expedition in frozen Siberia during a court case in Russia . Rescue: Survivor Alexander Abdullaev is pictured in a grey jumper during his rescue after he and other fishermen were lost for days during the expedition in Siberia . The other survivor of the cannibal fishing expedition Mr Abdullaev, 38, was treated by the court as a witness and not charged. After the incident reports suggested that Mr Abdullaev, 37, ate Mr Kurochkin after he had frozen to death in the minus 40 degree temperatures. Mr Abdullaev told police  in Neryungri, in Russia's Sakha Republic: 'He died by himself. He froze to death. Only after that did we start eating him.' But this week in a rambling statement to the court, he admitted they ate their friend 'not because I was hungry. I had another reason,' according to reports. However, he declined to say what it was. The victim's widow, said that she had hoped her husband might still have been alive but this was dashed by a DNA test which proved that a few fragments of bone were his. 'Now I am . sure they have eaten him. Now we know that Andrei died somewhere else . and they dragged the body all the way through the snow, eating it step . by step. But together with the remains of my husband there were also . found the bones of animals. 'If they could kill animals, why would they need to try eating a human body? And why did they carry his head with them?' Cannibals: Both Alexander Abdullaev and Alexei Gorulenko are pictured being rescued after they ate a pal - Mr Gorulenko was convicted of causing bodily harm for which he was given a suspended three and a half year jail sentence . After the suspended sentence was handed down, the dead man's wife expressed her disgust over the verdict. 'I am shocked by the decision of this judge, and with the work of investigator who dealt with the case. 'Nobody expected it to end like this, that a cannibal walks free with a suspended sentence. I just can't understand what the judge was thinking about when [he] produced such a verdict for Gorulenko.' She added: 'The last recorded acts of forced cannibalism were in besieged Leningrad (during World War Two) and under the rules of war, people performing it were executed. Modern Russia cannot tell these people to 'enjoy their meal'. 'Mr Gorulenko hasn't spoken to me once. He didn't call, he didn't explain what happened in the taiga. He didn't even say sorry, like people do.' 'And he was Andrei's childhood friend. He has now gone back to fishing and this summer he will return to the taiga forest.' Mrs Korochkin had even took her appeal to President Vladimir Putin after her and the couple's 22-year-old daughter, Alyona feared that the case was not being properly investigated. She will now appeal the verdict. The fishermen had been missing for nearly two months after their Jeep sunk in a frozen river stranding the ice-fishing party in one of the most isolated spots in the world. A fourth man Vladimir Komarov remains missing, presumed dead.

Model mates Poppy Delevingne and Alexa Chung set out on a seriously stylish girls-only roadtrip for online fashion magazine The Edit earlier this summer. As well as posing in their classic convertible the two beautiful BFFs opened up about their ten year friendship, their wildest nights out, and why they feel it's so important to support and encourage the women in their lives. Poppy, 28, first met Alexa, 30, ten years ago at a casting call, and recalls that even then the brunette had stand out style. Poppy says: 'I remember thinking she was very beautiful, almost cat-like, but definitely a bit of a bloke. She was wearing skinny jeans that I wanted/needed in my life immediately – a feeling I had no idea would resonate every time I saw her.' No boys allowed: Model mates Alexa Chung and Poppy Delevingne head to Ibiza for a girls-only roadtrip. Alexa wears: Cape by Talitha; shirt by Roberto Cavalli; shorts by .

'The real turning point was when we went moonlit skinny-dipping in the sea at Cannes. It was spectacular. At 4:00 a.m., rummaging through bushes for our stray couture, I realized it wasn’t just another friendship,' says Poppy. The fashionista friends are lucky enough to have toured the world together, for work and fun, but of the two Poppy maintains that it is Alexa who has the most amazing stories: 'I love living vicariously through tales of her love life. That was one of the reasons for inviting her on this trip – we’re boy-crazy. James (Poppy's new husband) knows I’m boy-crazy and always will be, but Alexa is really boy-crazy. 'What else?

Having Cara as my baby, I had to learn quite quickly that I couldn’t be competitive because I had a sister who meant more to me. 'And I knew she was going to be brilliant, so I had to become very aware of not comparing. 'I don’t understand women who don’t encourage each other.

"By . Katy Winter . With her body racking up even more media coverage than her romances with various super-buff men, it is little surprise that Kelly Brook has topped a ‘best celebrity cleavage’ poll. Kelly’s breasts are those most admired by British women, garnering 35 per cent of votes, followed by soap star beauty Michelle Keegan (25 per cent) and Katy Perry (20 per cent). Surprisingly Man Men’s Christina Hendricks’ cleavage came in last place (3 per cent) despite her gloriously curvaceous 50s-pin-up body. Scroll down for video . We wonder if Kelly is one of the quarter of women who give nicknames to their breasts... Happily, it seems we are pretty content with our own lot when it comes to our cleavage: the survey, conducted by Ann Summers in celebration of National Cleavage Day revealed that the majority of us (69 per cent) are pleased with our cup size. In fact, so affectionately do we feel about our breasts, that 25 per cent of British women even have a pet name for them. ‘Pinky and Perky’, ‘The Twins’, ‘Owl and Pussy Cat’, 'Smidge and Smudge’ and ‘Puppies’ were voted most common pet names for breasts. But not all pet names are welcome: ‘jugs’, ‘bangers’, ‘knockers’ and ‘fun bags’ were voted the worst ways to refer to women’s breasts. Michelle Keegan (left) and Katy Perry (right) also have cleavages that are much admired by British women . British women, in particular women in North East (55 per cent) and East Midlands (30 per cent), have used their cleavage to impress a man, and 20 per cent of women from Yorkshire admit to bagging a free drink on a night out by flashing their décolletage. A further 10 per cent of Scottish women claim that their cleavage helped them bag a job promotion and 5 per cent of women from South East says they’ve used the power of the cleavage to get a parking ticket written off. Surprisingly Man Men's while Christina Hendricks' cleavage came in last place (3 per cent) despite her traditional 50s-pin-up body . The survey also discovered that 73 per cent of women own a push-up bra and over a third reveal that they wear a cleavage-enhancing bra every day, a further 25 per cent wear one on a weekly basis. Over half of the women surveyed said they feel empowered when they wear a push-up bra (54 per cent).","Kelly Brook, Katy Perry and Michelle Keegan voted best cleavage .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Comedy actor James Corden could barely hide his delight when he turned up to a charity football match in Bedford and bumped into the man who inspired one his most popular TV characters. The comedy actor based his character Neil 'Smithy' Smith from Gavin & Stacey, a beer drinking builder on a real life 41-year-old dad of three called Neil 'Smithy' Smith. Smithy - the real life one - had been close friends with Corden's cousin Lee Andrews for over 30 years and their friendship gave Corden his inspiration to create comedy gold. Mates: Comedy actor James Corden, left, could barely hide his delight when he turned up to a charity football match in Bedford and bumped into Neil 'Smithy' Smith . The pair met up unexpectedly in Bedford recently when they both played in a charity football match. In the popular BBC show, art imitated life when Corden made Neil and Lee's legendary scrapes  a part of his show. Smith told The Mirror: ' Some of the stuff me and Lee got up to in our twenties probably couldn't be shown on TV.' 'I think James saw a good craic with how we used to be. We were inseparable, just like Smithy and Gavin in the show.' He added that when the show first aired all of his friends kept texting and talking about the resemblance to his character. Smith said he tends to enjoy watching football, a drink and  a good laugh and can see why James thought it would make a good character for television. Luckily the real life Smithy thought that his on stage alter ego was hilarious. He recalls that when the pair first met he was already taking on roles in adverts and soap operas. But he praised him for being 'a normal guy' who is very down to earth. Corden who is close friends with David . Beckham, a BAFTA  winner and one of the country's most treasured comedy . actors puled on his T-shirt and played at the match. The match, for the opening of a new Salvation Army pitch was planned by his late uncle Roger Collins. Smithy said he was delighted to be playing alongside the award winning actor. Corden, in turn, praised his muse Smithy saying he was a great guy and he hoped that the character that he had created based off him had done him proud.

"By . Toni Jones . If you have ever travelled with Ryanair chances are that you have had a cause to grumble. But while most disgruntled passengers only daydream about the ways they might grab the attention of the airline's customer service team, or its notorious boss Michael O'Leary, one rather angry, and very funny, newlywed from Hertfordshire is using social media to wreak his revenge. This week a brilliantly angry complaint went viral after customer James Lockley posted an open letter to the budget airline via his Facebook page. Is all PR good PR? A complaint to Ryanair posted on customer James Lockley's Facebook page has received more than 60,000 shares . James and his new wife had been on their way to a second wedding reception in Bratislava when motorway traffic and 'incompetent' Ryanair staff conspired to thwart their travel plans. As James explains in his several hundred word post: 'We went straight to the Ryan Air assistant and explained our plight. She said we were still within the time and all would be fine but we had to make the attendant at check in aware and he would assist from there. 'We approached the attendant as instructed and explained. Unfortunately, in the main part, due to him being a child, and forgetting to bring his mother to work, he heard only half of the words before his brain fell apart like a wet cake. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary recently promised that the airline had 'reinvented' itself to become more customer-focused . 'He led us to the line for closing gates, . advised we should wait and all would be ok. We stood patiently in the . line for 20 minutes. 'We got to the front of the line and the lady, who . we shall from this point refer to a Vacant, explained that she had . literally just that second closed the flight and we had missed it. 'We . complained that we had done as instructed and she said it was the . child’s fault because he should have advised her that we were trying to . board a closing flight and that because he hadn’t told her it was . therefore our fault we had missed the plane.' In a series of withering put-downs the groom introduces ''Vacant's' other colleagues as 'Not That Bright' and 'Middle Gimp' and goes on to explain in detail how all four characters spectacularly failed to live up to the new improved customer service levels that Ryanair have recently claimed to implement. James continues: 'Middle Gimp had clearly listened hard at Ryanair Middle Gimp school as he managed to take two perfectly calm and sane adults and in a matter of seconds reduce them to angry people considering violence. Tweet revenge: Some of the thousands of Twitter messages in support of James's complaint . ""Check in opens 3 hours before the . flight"" he barked repeatedly as if it was the answer to every question . in life. We tried to ask Middle Gimp direct questions about why it was . necessary for us to miss the flight because the Child had forgotten to . do his job, and Vacant had forgotten to do hers. ‘Why is this our fault, and why should we miss the flight because Ryan Air staff have admitted they made errors?. ‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’ ‘Do . you acknowledge we have just cause for complaint as we tried to do the . right thing and the only reason we are not on the plane is because of . communication failures with Ryan Air Staff?’ ‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’ ‘What colour are my trousers?’ ‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’ ‘Do you think economic sanctions on Russia will diffuse the escalating situation in Ukraine?’ ‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’ ‘Were Man Utd right to fire David Moyes?’ ‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’ ‘My tinkle is hurting, could you take a look if I promise not to tell anyone?’ ‘Check in opens three hours before the flight.""' Under fire: The complaint about the budget airline has gone viral on Facebook . The open letter was posted on Facebook on April 24 and within days had garnered thousands of 'shares' on the social networking site. On April 26 James posted a Facebook status update saying: 'Staggered, over 6000 shares now for my Ryanair . story. Unreal, flattered and really pleased I have made some people . laugh. Thank you for all the emails and messages to show support and to . say it made you laugh, really appreciate it.' One week on and the post has been shared over 60,000 times and is a hot topic on Twitter as James awaits a response from the airline. James estimates that the experience has cost him £220 for new flights, £79 for a hotel, £50 for taxis to and from the airport and £35 for 'the world's most expensive sandwich' plus stress, inconvenience and an angry wife. He summarised his customer services experience by saying: 'So, thank you Ryan Air for a comfortable and enjoyable experience. I . have watched a program called the news so I fully expect this to land on . the desk of the customer services team underneath the empty bottles and . sandwich wrappers that you also file there. 'You treated us badly, you . cost us money and made us miss our wedding reception through a display . of incompetence I have not seen since Greece was allowed to have money . and a cheque book.' Robin Kiely, Head of Communications at Ryanair told MailOnline: 'We are aware of Mr Lockley’s complaint and have contacted him directly to address these issues.'

"By . Toni Jones . Sharing selfies with friends, Instagramming pictures of her shoes and tweeting about the latest blockbuster, Helena Burns sounds like any other social media-loving young women. Except that this young woman has a higher calling than most, and is using modern technology to spread the age-old teachings of God. Chicago-based Sister Helena is one of a growing number of young nuns hell bent on using social media to spread the word of the Almighty. Streetwise sister: Sister Helena Burns is a nun with a mission to spread God's word via social media . And that means getting down with the . kids. As well as her own blog and YouTube channel the American Sister has a Facebook page, vine, Pinterset and Instagram account and currently 14,600 Twitter followers.

Proof God exists: hummingbirds, hockey, coffee' and followers of @SrHelenaBurns can expect to see tweets on current affairs, pictures of her travels around various orders of the world, re-tweets from religious blogger friends and snaps of heartwarming proverbs. Flamehaired Sister Helena says: 'I was going to be an ornithologist, but God zapped me and I now belong . to the Daughters of St. Paul.' Sister Helena told The Atlantic: 'I try to really keep up with the . comments on my blog, and also Twitter and Facebook. I’m also on . Instagram and Vine a little bit.

Now the inspiring duo have done it again, revisiting the national park to deliver another spine-tingling journey through the wilderness. Filmed over the course of ten months the two men and their team spent 45 days trekking more than 200 miles to capture the awesome footage, including incredible sunrises, dramatic storms, changing seasons and even shooting stars.

"By . Toni Jones . There is something very decadent and a little bit naughty about staying at a hotel in your home town. The idea that you could whizz your date upstairs at any point throughout dinner for a different kind of 'dessert' adds a certain frisson to proceedings. In reality, a good hotel dinner means that you will probably overeat and drink just enough to find yourself fully clothed and snoozing though Graham Norton as Friday night comes to a close, rather than road testing the bedroom furniture. But the fact that you COULD be swinging from the spotlights remains. And the new rooms at London's Hoxton Hotel could be just the place to plan that sexy city rendez-vous. The Hoxton Hotel in London's Shoreditch has had a revamp . The design hotel has been a destination for the young, urban traveller for a while now thanks to its buzzing Shoreditch location, Soho House restaurant and pretty prices (booked in advance rooms start at just £49 per night). But in London keeping your cool is an ongoing operation, and with stylish new neighbours the Ace Hotel and Bethnal Green's Town Hall muscling in on it's patch The Hoxton has given itself a mini facelift to keep things interesting. On the Friday night my husband and I stayed, the lobby (which doubles as the bar and has recently been refreshed with new seating and lighting) was JUMPING by the time we checked in at 7pm. Weaving through the handsome but already loud crowd we winced inwardly as we remembered that we had forgotten to pack earplugs. And then winced at our wincing. What kind of old farts worry about the noise in a city centre hotel on a FRIDAY night? We needn't have worried (or winced) though, The Hox - as it likes to be known - might like to party, but it also knows that a good night's sleep is key for busy girls and boys wanting to make the most of a city break, and our third room floor room was perfectly peaceful. As well as the 'East London' design touches like Roberts Radios and random collections of cool-looking books that you won't have time to read, the renovated rooms feature black out curtains, frette bedding, oversized mirrors and a perfectly-sized desk and tech area for all that Instagram planning. Leather armchairs, pop art prints and parquet flooring add a stylish touch to an affordable city room and the bathrooms are slick and sexy, decked out in dark grey and featuring low-level lighting. East London cool: New bedrooms feature stylish touches and the bathrooms are sleek and simple . As long-term Londoners, instead of seizing the moment and exploring the area (the hotel is brilliantly placed for Liverpool Street and the City, Spitalfields market, Old Street and Hackney) we seized a red leather booth three floors down to people watch as we ate dinner. Downstairs the bar has been opened out to allow more beautiful things to come and hang while drinking Porn Star Martinis. With the restaurant being so close to the bar the atmosphere and service was hectic - we were served by four different people over the course of the meal - but the diner-style food: fiery jalapeño bites followed by a perfect burger complete with secret sauce and crispy bacon for me, and a halloumi and chickpea salad (generous on the cheese) for the veggie, was delicious. To summarise the people-watching was top notch, the cocktails were top shelf... and Ant and Dec were top lads on Graham Norton. What more could you ask for on a Friday night? The lobby has been opened out redecorated ready to receive more beautiful people . Rooms start at £49 and include a light breakfast delivered to your room.

"By . Toni Jones . Gwyneth Paltrow is a very, very busy woman, but she always makes time for her fans. This month, in between consciously uncoupling from husband of 11 years Chris Martin, the actress/mother/model/chef/lifestyle guru has managed to find time to scour her home town of LA for all the hotspots that we might want to visit. Her latest Goop newsletter features a guide to the place that she calls home offering advice and recommendations to hipsters, kids, the health-conscious (of course), architecture fans and her New York pals with a 'classic' section. Gwyneth Paltrow has published a guide to LA and a night at the £500-a-night Beverly Hills Hotel is top of her 'to do' list for out-of-towners . Introducing her guide to the glitzy Californian city she says: 'We live to source, scour, dine, and meander our way to the leanest and best info for you.' And by lean we assume that she's not talking about her bank account because the tips include a four-figured Sushi restaurant bill, £300 museum tours and seriously high-end designer shopping. But there are lots of bargains to be found too, and the list is certainly very comprehensive if you are planning on visiting the West Coast soon. Gwyenth's lifestyle site Goop features regular travel guides for women wanting to follow in the actress's fashionable footsteps . Gwyneth says: 'People may laugh at L.A.'s juice-cleansing, namasté-ing, ways, but the thrilling reality of sunny, 75-degree days is no joke.' Of course we don't look to the shiny, macrobiotic, jet-setting, millionaire superstar for practical tips on life. So here are some of our favourite LA travel tips fresh from planet Gwyneth.. SLEEPING & EATING . A night at Marilyn Monroe's beloved BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL, where prices start at £500 a night and finish . at somewhere your bank manager won't even want to think about, is top of Gwyneth's to do list for out-of-towners. Food-wise you should brace yourself as many of the eateries recommended by . the health-loving blonde include the terms 'invariably steep' ' sticker shock' and 'pricey but . worth it'. URASAWA on Rodeo Drive is famous for being one of America's most expensive restaurants where sushi master Urasawa, one of best sushi chefs in the world, spends two days crafting each meal and only lets 11 people sit at any one time. Gwyneth says: 'Depending on your order and sake consumption you can expect to spend . about 1K per person' but claims that it is worth it because of the exquisite wagyu beef and caviar gilded with gold. She also, surprisingly, recommends paparazzi hotspot THE IVY restaurant for people-watching from the patio over a shrimp salad, although admits it is 'overly touristy' The pretty Ivy restaurant in LA is a hot spot for celebrities and their well-heeled fans. Gwyneth recommends the shrimp salad . At the cheaper end of the spectrum one of her hangouts is Tex-Mex joint BAR AMA which . offers the best brussel sprouts in the city (sprouts are a 'thing' in LA right now) washed down with tequila cocktails. And the famously fastidious foodie also raves about the dairy-free pizzas at MOHAWK BLEND on Sunset Bouleavard, or for picky little eaters a mini 'protein plate' for kids featuring cucumber and cheese (and definitely no carbs) at BLUE PLATE on Montana Avenue. Sexy sprouts are a thing in LA right now and dairy-free pizza is also on Gwyneth's hit list . SHOPPING & DOING . The list of boutiques that the style icon frequents for herself include OPENING CEREMONY, BEATRICE VALENZUELA and CURVE, all featuring fabulous labels and far-out price tags. But as a mother-of-two Gwyneth no doubt also spends a lot of time shopping for children's clothes. While the retail therapy options in LA are huge, the 41-year-old highlights tweeny boutique UN DEUX TROIS as one of her top spots thanks to its personal styling service for high school fashionistas. Her hot picks for girls this season? Vegan leather leggings and sequined tops. Staying on the vegan tip, she also recommends ZULU TATTOO, an 'unintimidating' parlour that offers vegan and eco-friendly inking and promises to bring out the your own sacred marking. Eco-friendly parlour Zulu Tattoo recommends that clients avoid Spam and bring a power bar or piece of fruit to their appointment . In her down time it seems that Gwynnie likes to spend afternoons in the HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY, not trying to contact deceased superstars you understand, but instead taking in the gigs and screenings they host under the sun. And finally, to unwind after all that eating, shopping, tattooing and sightseeing she recommends taking the kids to WI SPA, a 24-hour spa ('Convenient if the family are supremely jet-lagged') where they can play in the mineral pools or zone out in the comic book library while mum and dad get a much-needed massage. Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband, singer Chris Martin announced their split via a Goop blog on March 25 .","Actress has published a travel guide to Los Angeles .

And Europe seems to be the travel hotspot for 2014 as Iceland, Denmark, Israel, France, Norway, Malta and Sweden all feature too. Croatia is already popular as a destination for British travellers but the coastal town of Rovinj is still relatively undiscovered and therefore a cheaper place to visit, say TravelSupermarket.com. Next month the town hosts the Red Bull Air Race and a forthcoming music festival in September could also be the reason for a higher number of searches. A recent increase in the number of low . cost flights to Poland's capital Warsaw could be the main reason for . its current popularity as it works out as a cheap location to visit. Russia . has been receiving more interest generally as a result of the Winter . Olympics, and its current newsworthy status will also have sparked . interest in the country. Dramatic: Visitors to Saint Petersburg in Russia will need to wrap up . Reykjavík: Not only one of the cleanest, greenest, and safest cities in the world, Iceland's capital - the most northern capital in the world - is famous for its wild weekend nightlife, colourful buildings and quirky people . Scandi cool; Lit buildings reflected in an urban canal in Copenhagen . A tale of two cities: Different types of architeture on show in Copenhagen . Tel Aviv: Whether it's to watch Justin Timberlake perform in May, take part in the Gay PRide Parade in June, visitors will be flocking to the 'white city' if online forums are anything to go by . Lots of media interest in the Northern Lights has been generated by sightings in the UK recently, and Reykjavik is still considered one of the places to go to see the spectacle, while the announcement of new low cost services from easyJet will also boost tourism numbers this year. Norway's Bergen has a blossoming art and music . scene, and a Viking festival in June half way between . Bergen and Stavanger in Carmoy may attract increased visitors to the . area over the summer. Scandinavia is still uber-cool at the moment, and for those who've been to Stockholm already, Gothenburg is a great alternative. Bob . Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said: 'We've been keeping . an eye on which destinations have been searched for over the last year . to uncover the top holiday hot-spots that have seen an unusual increase . in interest. Biarritz: For a long time the playground of the rich, this French coastal town is renowned for the beauty of its coastline, its curved inlets punctuated by rocky outcrops, and many cultural and musical events . Quaint: Narrow streets are full of character in Valletta in Malta . Last but not least: The opera house at the yacht harbour of Gothenburg, Sweden . 'It's often the case that new destinations start to come into our psyche as a result of a music or sports events, or even film and TV programmes from dramas to documentaries and we find our attention suddenly drawn towards a new place we might never have considered before. 'The good news is, low-cost air travel has given us the confidence and the opportunity to try out these up-and-coming locations. It means we can now get away for short breaks easily and affordably and be much more experimental with our choice of destination , having fun discovering new places in the process.' Which holiday hotspot will you be heading to this year? Post your comments below . On the magnificent coast of Istria (Croatia), right below the Lim Fjord, is the most romantic place in the Mediterranean! The town of Rovinj is the right destination for those seeking a sentimental feel of times that have forever gone by. This town began its romantic life on an island, its restricted area resulting in crowded houses, narrow streets and small squares, still untouched by modern urbanism. Rovinj is billed as one of the most romantic towns in the Mediterranean . On the seaside, the town is protected by a high rocky shore and house walls built on cliffs, while the mainland side is protected by solid walls. The town is dominated by the baroque St. Euphemia’s Church, its 60-meter tower providing a view of grey and red rooftops and chimneys, streets and squares, the port and pier with ships and boats, and the marina harboring yachts. This unique old town core, the 67-kilometer shoreline, 2,289 acres of protected green surfaces and improved park forests, 16 islands, islets and reefs, make this town unique. Built upon a rich fishermen’s tradition, it has become distinctive for its unique boat called batana and its songs bitinada. Its beauty was particularly appreciated by artists who have painted the most beautiful motifs here and exhibited them on Grisia, the street of artists. Romantic and mysterious, yet full of options for an unforgettable time. - Rovinj Tourist Board .","List of hip destinations created using online searches and Twitter statistics .

"By . Toni Jones . The star wattage of the celebrity front row threatened to outshine the blinging gowns at Saturday night's Julien Macdonald's show. Ladylike supermodel Coco Rocha perched next to a not so prim Abbey Clancy, whose sheer dress was strictly NSFW, while Millie Macintosh shared selfies with Laura Mvula, actress Samantha Barks and singer Eliza Doolittle. The Strictly cast were there en masse, too, to support their designer dancing partner-in-crime, as well as Julien's family, all the way from the valleys making the most of the pre-show cocktail reception as they celebrated his da's 80th birthday. And what a way to celebrate, as his son Julien treated the audience to a dazzling collection of glamorous British fashion inside the imposing Royal Courts of Justice . Heavy metals opened the Julien Macdonald show . A silver two-piece featured a sheer train . Heavy beading created optical illusions . The heavy bass on the stereo as the show opened was a prelude to the heavy metal all over the catwalk. A dramatic display of evening dresses began with a collection of gold, silver and pewter gowns featuring knitted, beaded, blinging mosaics and a LOT of mesh, ergo flesh. To follow there were more disco-ready dresses (the Julien Macdonald woman doesn’t wear trousers) – inspired by fabulous architecture and stained windows according to the designer – in ruby red, shimmering emerald green and electric blue. Celebrity stylist Nicole Smallwood said at the show: ' Julien never disappoints, with his use of glimmer and sparkle alongside carefully placed transparent fabrics making for a spectacular show. 'My favourite piece was the petrol blue dress which I'm sure we'll see sauntering down a red carpet or two in coming weeks.' The LBD was given a sexy makeover for AW14 . Glistening snakeskin was a theme . Glamorous shoe brand Gina provided sky-high heels . This peacock-inspired gown was a hit . The crowd-pleasing dress was seriously daring . Oriental detail showed skill . An electric blue knitted dress was daring but demure . A ruby red mini dress added a jolt of colour . A knitted dress shimmered on the runway . Flirty feathers, crochet detail and even a bit of suede made it into the show here and there but it was the floor-sweepers that had the crowd hooked with delicate peacock and oriental embellishment showing off Macdonald's mastery of detail. Before the show Macdonald addressed the willowy models, whose hair was slicked back with gel and faces were covered in shine: 'I picked you because you're beautiful on the inside and on the outside. Be strong, be empowered and have a f***ing amazing time!' Celebrity stylist Nicole Smallwood said: ' Julien never fails to impress with glimmer and careful use of fabrics.' The dramatic finale received a standing ovation from many of the celebrities sitting on the front row, and designer Julien was delighted with the response . The celebrity front row threatened to outshine the dresses (l-r) Eliza Doolittle, Samantha Barks, Coco Rocha, Abbey Clancy, Nina Nesbitt . Show-stopping gowns like Julien's need serious hair and make-up to complement them. Step up glam squad Val Garland and James Pecis who gave Saturday's models a fierce disco makeover before they hit the catwalk. Garland . is an industry heavyweight, having worked on models such as Kate Moss . and Georgia May Jagger and creating countless Vogue covers. Working with . L'Oreal Paris for Julien's show she didn't hold back, giving the girls . dramatic eyes and glistening lips, cheeks and skin. 'It's . all about the eye,' declared Val backstage, just before she bawled . at one of her interns for snapping Instragram shots rather than . powdering a model, 'I am using everything you shouldn't use: 8 hour . cream, lip gloss, oil... but these looks only need to last a few minutes . on the catwalk.' Mood boards for the artists to work from were posted around the hair and make-up stations backstage at the Royal Courts of Justice . While . designer Julien's inspiration was architecture and stained glass windows . Val's muse was a bit more straightforward fashion: Nineties model . Guinevere as she appeared on The Face magazine in 1999. Val . said: 'The idea is to create the impression of a bleached eyebrow with a . dramatic eye. My inspiration was Julien's girl Guinevere and a bit . of the new romantics. It's high octane, think glorious, glamorous, very . Julien Macdonald.' One of . Val's team of make-up artists was dispatched with a can of glistening . body spray to attack the models arms and legs: 'What's in it? Heaven . only knows, it's a trade secret,' she said as she added a golden glow to . the troupe of teenage skin. Hair, . overseen by the handsome James Pecis was hi-shine but low maintenance . slicked back into a glossy and futuristic tangle within minutes of the . models arriving from their last show. As . he piled on the mousee, hairspray and gel (applied with a paintbrudh of . course) Pecis said: 'The place is so massive and big, it can really take . a look. Julien's gowns are so beautiful, we needed something a little . bit tough to break it up a bit - as soon as you add an up-do it can go .

"By . Toni Jones . While waifs stalked the catwalks at Somerset House a curvier kind of model was posing at the nearby Vinopolis warehouse in London this weekend. British Plus-Size Fashion Weekend (BPSFW) is an event dedicated to clothes made for sizes 14 and up and, although not officially affiliated with London Fashion Week, the timing of the second annual show was of course planned to initiate a discussion about the shape of things to come in the industry. At the BPSFW shows retailers, designers and customers are brought together to highlight an aspect of British fashion mostly ignored by the British Fashion Council in their biannual fashion weeks. Here Cosmopolitan columnist and presenter Laura Puddy explains why events like this need to become the norm rather than remain niche. The first British Plus-Size Fashion Weekend took place this weekend in London . Hayley Hasselhoff was one of the curvy models to open the show on Friday (l) and High Street brand Evans was one of the retailers to show off its latest eye-catching designs  (r) Laura, who is a size 12-14, and hosted a panel discussion at the event says: 'This weekend I took a break from the grueling London Fashion week schedule and attended British Plus Size Fashion Weekend (BPSFW). 'An event set up with the goal of bringing fashion to the fuller female figure, I have to say I was intrigued, particularly as this is the topic of my monthly column ‘Catwalk to Curvy’ in Cosmopolitan UK. Columnist and presenter Laura Puddy champions plus-size fashion and hosted a panel on diversity at the event . 'On arrival, it was clear that this event . was going to be a refreshing change from the usual LFW line up.  The . myriad of voluptuous fashionistas congregated outside immediately filled . me with joy - fashion was about to celebrate curves. 'BPSFW was created to support the plus-size industry and give plus-size designers and retailers a chance to interact with their customers.  As the founders Remi Ray and Rianne Ward say, “BPSFW aims to enhance, empower and support the UK plus-size industry by connecting the dots between retailers, designers and consumers.” 'A point worth remembering, the average clothing size of a UK woman is size 16.  Attendees were excited that finally there was an event catering to women who love fashion but aren’t necessarily the accepted fashion ideal of being tall and waif-like. 'The event showcased an array of high street brands like Evans and Taking Shape, as well as designers like Dea London and Syreeta Badu, a London based designer specialising in sizes 14-32. 'A positive body image was encouraged – something I was really pleased to see and the catwalk models were a diverse range of curvy and plus size models, modeling everything from underwear to bridal collections. BPSFW was created to support the plus-size industry and give plus-size designers and retailers a chance to interact with their customers . The event is not officially affiliated with London Fashion Week but the timing of the show was, of course, planned to initiate a discussion about the shape of things to come in the industry . 'I hosted the afternoon’s panel discussion with industry experts talking about the past, present and future of the plus size industry. 'In attendance was fashion legend Caryn Franklin, campaigner for diversity in the fashion industry and co-founder of all walks catwalk, Caryn later tweeted; “Curvaceous Women and Statuesque Divas all around me. Delicious change from London’s regular Fashion Week” A tweet from fashion expert Caryn Franklin, who campaigns for more diverse catwalks . 'I totally agree with Caryn, it truly was amazing to see an event celebrating diversity and promoting that you can look and feel good no matter what your shape or size.

"By . Toni Jones . This party season sees the introduction of the turbocharged Bloody Mary using ingredients such as Horseradish-infused vodka at London's 69 Colebrooke Row (pictured) It's almost the most wonderful time of the year and for many of us that means a brilliant excuse to overindulge, party on a school night and mix our drinks with merry abandonment. Which is great. Until the morning after. After many years of research we know that festive hangovers don't get any easier with practice, but instead of telling you to drink a glass of water for every glass of alcohol, or make sure you get eight hours of sleep (yawn) we think it's much more practical to offer advice on how to turn around the terrible hangover you had so much fun creating. Step up, the Bloody Mary. A cocktail . classic that has magical healing properties, aka a dash of breakfast . booze to help clear the heaviest of heads. Plus the tomato juice mixer . counts as a health drink and one of your five a day (we think). Before . you run to Tesco and start mixing your own though it is important to . remember that not all Bloody Marys are created equal. Most bartenders . have their own special recipe and this season ambitious mixologists have created some seriously wonderful and weird concoctions based on the classic. So much so that this week our favourite . drink (and therefore hangover) specialist BarChick is celebrating the breakfast cocktail in all its scarlet glory on her site. She says: 'There’s only one thing worse than a bad Bloody Mary: a Virgin Mary (or as the Aussies say, a Bloody Shame). BarChick is big on brunch with all the bar hopping we do, so a healthy start to the day (with a little hair of the dog) is essential. 'Much more fun than a multivitamin/Berocca fix – BarChick washes her milk thistle down with a Bloody Mary. Always open to experimentation with this British classic, just don’t try and fob us off with a bottle of Big Tom.' From stuffed . chilli garnish to 'celery air' and steak juice, BarChick has hunted down the UK's best . hangover-busting Bloody Mary recipes to inspire your taste buds and help heal your morning after heads. We can't promise they will make you feel 100% fresh, but at this time of year every little helps. 1. The Keep It Classic Mary . For a straight forward BM fix keep the over the top frills to a minimum and add a bit of interest with infused vodkas. Try a dash of orange juice and HP sauce like Jake at Portobello Star in Notting Hill or try a take on The Red Snapper from Mark Hix which uses Beefeater London dry gin poured with Sundance tomato juice, lemon juice, Tabasco sauce. Mega mixologist Tony C at 69 Colebrooke Row uses a homemade horseradish vodka mixed with pepper sauce and some pepper distillate (whatever that is), which seriously does the job. 2. The Quirky Mary . The Natalia Vodianova from Bob Bob Ricard in Soho uses clear tomato water (the juice of a tomato is actually a clear liquid, you can recreate at home with a bit of blending and a lot of straining) and makes for a much lighter drink if your stomach is feeling delicate. Prince Harry haunt Barts has a full Bloody Mary menu including a tomato-flavoured martini (hold the juice) and the Bloody Liability which includes Belvedere vodka, Bloodshot vodka, fresh . beetroot, lemon juice and honey. Garnished with green salad topped with . beetroot and parmesan shavings. Barts in Chelsea favours a Bloody Mary Martini, hold the juice (l) while The Bloody Caesar at Powder Keg Diplomacy features house cured maple bacon infused vodka and clam broth (r) 3. The Meaty And Fishy Mary . The Bloody Caesar at Powder Keg Diplomacy is made with house-cured-maple-bacon-infused vodka, a classic spice mix, lemon, Clamato juice, tomato juice and clam broth, garnished with a strip of crispy maple cured bacon. For a more intense take on the drink the Meaty Mary uses vodka infused with Sunday’s topside of beef plus a splash of Sunday roast gravy. Steak restaurant The Hawksmoor also add meaty juices to their recipes and their award-winning Pete’s Tabasco 2010 uses the bacon cooked clam broth straight from the kitchen. 4. The Garnished Mary . For fish fans the Bonnie Gull at Bonnie Mary's comes with infused vodka, gin OR tequila garnished with an oyster or if you're feeling brave take inspiration from the Southsider Cocktail Club who use Beef Jerky Infused Gentleman Jack Whiskey ,Yellow Tomato Juice, Lime Juice, Tobasco Habenero Sauce, Bitter Truth Celery Bitters and Worchester Sauce served in a soup can finished off with a Feta Stuffed Red Chilli. The Beard to Tail Marvellously Bloody recipe (l) is sure to grow a few hairs on your chest with a mixture of Jack Daniel’s, tomato juice and a garnish of pork crackling while Bonnie Mary's Bonnie Gull (r) is simply delicious served with an oyster . 5. The Spicy Mary . A big night demands a big remedy and the Beard to Tail Marvellously Bloody is sure to grow a few hairs on your chest: A mixture of Jack Daniel’s, tomato juice, Worcester sauce, mixed chilli spice, smoke paprika, port, fresh lemon juice and topped off with a garnish of pork crackling. The Engineer in Primrose Hill used to have Kate Moss as a regular so they must know what they are doing. Their exotic-tasting BM is made with their own chilli and rosemary infused Triple Distilled Smirnoff Black and a base mix of spices, Worcester sauce, Tabasco, wholegrain mustard, Dijon and black peppercorns. To seal the deal the bartenders ‘garnish the hell out of it’ with tomatoes, cucumber, mozzarella and whatever else they can get their hands on. This can be adapted at home according to your quease levels. The award-winner: The Connaught's impressive concoction features a touch of naga jolokia, the hottest chilli in the world . 6. The Award-Winning Mary . For those mornings when only the best (and somebody else making it) will do then call in late to work and head to the creme de la creme of the cocktail world for breakfast. As winner of the Tabasco British Bloody Mary challenge the Artesian bar's Roman Foltan is the man to save you with a killer drink. His Smoked Bloody Mary uses Ketel One vodka infused with lemongrass smoke mixed with their signature spiced tomato with a side of pickles and oyster leaves. Or try The Connaught, who are always winning awards, with their mix of tomato juice, lemon, coriander, salt, pepper and a touch of the hottest chilli in the world, the naga jolokia. It’s served with what they call “celery air”, by running the celery through a juicer, then foaming it, they are able to get a full aroma of celery and the whole thing is finished off with a light grating of nutmeg.

"By . Toni Jones . Deciding whether or not to stay friends with an ex can be an emotional minefield. But straight-talking Samantha Brick has some simple advice: Move on, ladies! Writer Samantha was asked to share her opinions on relationships with ex partners for Bella magazine this week, and the feisty 42-year-old didn't hold back, singling out Simon Cowell's long-term ex Sinitta for some tough talking. Samantha says: 'I scoff at Sinitta, hanging on for dear life to remain friends with Simon Cowell. He has a new partner, who is five months pregnant with his son. Who is Sinitta kidding? Move on, girl! How on earth can you look to the future when you haven’t closed the door on your past?' Writer Samantha Brick claims that staying friends with an ex is always a bad idea and wants Sinitta to 'move on' from her relationship with Simon Cowell . Samantha is famously living in domestic bliss in the Midi-Pyrénées, south west France, with her French husband and a litter of puppies. Sinitta, who has married and divorced as well as adopted two children since splitting with fiance Simon in 1984, allegedly burst into tears after learning the shock news that he was expecting a child with married US socialite Lauren Silverman, 36. The couple dated on and off for twenty years and remain particularly close, with Sinitta, 50, a constant fixture on the multi-millionaire's Caribbean jaunts. Sinitta and Simon split in 1984 but continued dating on and off for 20 years afterwards. Sinitta allegedly burst into tears when she heard that Simon was to have a child with Lauren Silverman, saying: 'It should have been me!' Journalist Samantha lives in south west France with her husband Pascal Brick . Samantha says: 'Sinitta is living . proof that you really can’t be friends with an ex, and I genuinely take . issue with those platonic ‘mates’ who simper and smile sweetly when . they’re no longer the first on their former lover’s call list . Read the full story in this week's Bella magazine . 'I . scoff when they claim the green-eyed monster is something out of a . kids’ cartoon. If they’re being honest with themselves, when they look . in the mirror they’re the ones who are coursing with full-blown jealous . envy.' Recently the two women appeared on the Alan Titchmarsh show to debate this issue and Samantha claims that while Sinitta put on a brave front as she defended her relationship with TV mogul Simon, 54, she was clearly hurting when the cameras stopped rolling. Samantha says: 'When you’ve had a sexual relationship with someone – and they’ve seen you naked – it’s the most intimate and vulnerable you can be with another human being. 'Given that, it’s impossible to turn back the clock. Most of us in modern life struggle to keep up with our real mates, so why hang on to an old relationship unless you’ve got a hidden agenda?'","Samantha Brick was writing about the perils of staying friends with an ex .

"By . Toni Jones . and Sam Webb . Prince Philip dubbed it 'bloody daft' and critics say that the idea of debutantes presenting themselves to the aristocracy is outdated and elitist, but for certain sections of British society the Queen Charlotte's Ball at the Royal Courts of Justice is the ultimate summer event. Dubbed the 'crowning event of the London Season' the guest list is hand-picked with care: only young women from the richest families are invited to the  ball where, after months of careful preparation and spending thousands of pounds on each ticket, the young debutantes are able to show off their skills in poise and elegance. In the past debutante balls were seen as a rite of passage for the young women of the upper classes, an opportunity to introduce themselves to society and seek out a potential suitor, but for today's debutantes the Season is seen as an opportunity to wear a designer gown, party their way around Europe, and do a little something for charity.

Today the debutantes, all aged . between 17 and 20, follow the traditional Queen Charlotte's cake in to . the ballroom where the girls perform special curtsies . to their hosts (not, as popularly believed, to a massive cake) before . being judged on their posture, elegance and pace by the room. The . event involves meetings with aristocracy, etiquette classes, and . charity fund-raising, and the 'deb of the year' is chosen according to . 'who has worked hardest’ during . fund-raising activities throughout the season and shown the most . enthusiasm (she is usually the prettiest too, although that is not an official judging requirement). The young women spend months preparing for their dramatic entrance in to the ballroom and go to several dress fittings to make sure their couture gowns cling perfectly. The young women spend months preparing for their dramatic entrance in to the ballroom and go to several dress fittings to make sure their couture gowns cling perfectly . Tradition and modernity: Debutantes use their smart phones to photograph each other as they await the arrival of guests . Queen Charlotte's Ball was introduced by King George III in 1780 as a way to celebrate his wife’s birthday. Up until 1958, young debutantes used to be presented to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, until Prince Philip pointed out that it was ‘bloody daft’. Not only did parents hope their daughters would meet a suitable young man, the Season aimed to equip the young women with poise, confidence and social skills needed for their married lives. The white dresses worn by the debutantes are a nod to the virginity that was once required of a bride. They are also a reminder of the outfits worn by Queen Charlotte's ladies, who all would have been single women. As well as Prince Phillip's dismissal, the Queen felt such an elitist event was at odds with her desire for a more modern monarchy. Her sister, Princess Margaret, was also reportedly not a fan. She is reported to have said: 'We had to put a stop to it - every tart in London was getting in.' Glitter: The modern group of meticulously selected debutantes continue the tradition and celebrate their year of charity fund raising, etiquette classes and debut at The Queen Charlotte's Ball . The young ladies, usually aged between 17 and 20, attend the grand ball where they are presented to guests and curtsey towards the Queen Charlotte Cake . The London Season is rich in history and was formed over two hundred years ago . Prior to the event older debutantes . are on hand to guide and critique the girls on their dress, dancing and . pace around the ballroom and on the day an army of professional hair and . make-up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing, . setting off perfectly coiffed up 'dos with diamond studded tiaras and . precious jewellery. The . ball was cancelled in 1976 because it was felt it had strayed too far . from its more genteel and refined roots, but was resurrected in 2007  by . a former debutane called Jenny Hallam-Peel, who was reportedly begged . 'top keep the season alive' by society magazine Tatler’s former social . editor, Peter Townend, apparently begged Hallam-Peel from his deathbed. Attendees are now from backgrounds that would have raised eyebrows among the social set of the event's heyday. 'In countries such as the U.S. and France, there’s still a section of high society that takes the 'Season’ very seriously, as a rite of passage for their daughters,' Caroline Castigliano, designer of this year’s ball gowns, told the Daily Telegraph. 'But in London, you’re not likely to meet the daughter of a duke any more. It’s far more likely to be the daughter of a hedge-funder, and her parents may be from the Middle East.' Guests take to the dance floor at the glittering event . It used to take place before the Queen, but now Queen Charlotte's Ball takes place at the Royal Courts of Justice .

"By . Toni Jones . It will take more than a broken toe to hamper Prince Harry's partying schedule and on Tuesday night the young royal was back on the town after sustaining some minor injuries. The Prince was reported to have hurt his neck and broken a toe late last week and while Kensington Palace remained coy about the reasons behind the accident they did confirm that the 29-year-old remains committed to the South Pole charity trek that he has been training for. Sporty Harry is set to undertake the 208-mile Walking With The Wounded challenge next month. Following . last week's mishap there was speculation that he may pull out but aides . insist that the expedition 'is very much still on.' Prince Harry has been pictured for the first time since he broke his toe. He was LouLou's Private Members Club in Mayfair watching a special performance by Buena Vista Social Club . A spokesman for the Prince confirmed that the 29-year-old . injured himself ‘a few days ago’, but declined to go into further . detail, saying: ‘He broke his toe privately. That’s all we will say.’ X-rays . will have determined the level of injury but there is usually very . little that can be done to mend a broken toe apart from rest. On Tuesday night though Harry appeared to be bored of resting and put any pain behind him as he visited a London nightclub with friends. The smartly dressed Prince spent the evening at Mayfair members club LouLou's, watching a special performance by Cuban group the Buena Vista Social Club. Wearing a smart navy blazer, bright blue trousers and sharp white shirt the redhead seemed less boisterous than usual as he left the venue at 3am, and he sported a pair of soft suede shoes which might have been a concession to his recent injury. Fancy feet: Prince Harry wore a pair of soft suede shoes for his night out . The Prince looked smart as he left the venue in the early hours of the Wednesday morning . Harry also chose a blue suit for the christening of Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge . The . Walking With The Wounded challenge hopes to raise £2million for injured . servicemen. Harry will be joining a team of servicemen and women all of . whom lost limbs while fighting in Afghanistan. An aide said: ‘Prince Harry will be taking part. The trek is very much on. He’s been seen around and appears to be walking ok.’ A . source added: ‘Look at his teammates. They are men and women who have . had arms and legs amputated in the service of their country. This is not . a big issue for him.’ The Walking With The Wounded team during . training on the Langiokull Glacier in Iceland. Three teams are getting . ready to take on the South Pole Allied Challenge Expedition . Freezer training: Harry spent hours in a cold chamber with team mates on September 17 in preparation . Prince Harry’s girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, appeared to have been elsewhere on his big night out, although reports that the blonde recently enjoyed a weekend shoot at the Queen’s Sandringham estate are considered a sign of their deepening romance. The 29-year-old royal was given the run of the monarch’s private home in Norfolk two weekends ago and invited up a group of friends, including the blonde dancer who has captured his heart. Sources have told Mail Online that fourth-in-line-to-the throne Harry is ‘incredibly serious’ about 24-year-old Cressida. In recent weeks the pair have been seen out on the town together, enjoying several dates including a visit to see The Book Of Mormon and a James Blunt gig.

"By . Toni Jones . The clocks have gone back, the weather has turned ... and now we can bring you an exclusive look at the feel-good fest that is the Marks & Spencer Xmas advert so the Christmas excitement can officially start. Ahead of the seasonal TV campaign which will hit our screens on November 6th the brand has released a sneak preview of this year's offering. Starring a stellar cast of British talent including Rosie Huntington-Whitely, David Gandy and Helena Bonham Carter, the 2013 ad takes viewers on a spectacular seasonal journey inspired by some of our most loved fairy tales. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the stars of this year's M&S Christmas advert . For the first time the brand is using social media channels to debut its' multimillion pound advert, releasing a teaser on Instagram from Wednesday 30th October, before the full two minute version is available . on YouTube as well as the M&S website on Monday 4th November. Set to an enchanting orchestral . soundtrack, the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers . into a world of 'magic and sparkle' from Alice in Wonderland to the . Wizard of Oz. The retailer has released a sneak preview of the multimillion pound advert ahead of the full TV airing on Wednesday 6th November . Set to an enchanting orchestral soundtrack, the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers into a world of 'magic and sparkle' from Alice in Wonderland to the Wizard of Oz via Little Red Riding Hood . Rosie . Huntington-Whitely is - of course - the leading lady, first seen . pursuing a pretty little dog across a city street before tumbling from . the real world into a snow dusted enchanted forest, seated at a . fantastical feast. The ad . then follows the lingerie designer and model through a red riding house . scene, an Arabian Nights flight and finally a walk along the yellow . brick road, with a little help from the ever handsome David and a . bewitching Helena Bonham Carter, whose appearance is seen as a huge coup for the retailer. Glamour: Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party, hosted by model David Gandy in Autograph menswear . Helena Bonham Carter's Wizard of Oz is in a black Per Una coat with faux fur collar . The Daily Mail's Liz Jones - often the High Street's harshest critic - gave the ad a glowing review when given a peek on Sunday. She said: 'From my sneak preview, the ad is a triumph. But will other viewers agree? 'For . M&S’s vocal shareholders, this cannot just be a vanity project, an . escape for a few moments into fantasy. It has to make those cash . registers burst into song. 'This time, I think M&S has done . its homework, and pulled off quite a coup: while Bonham Carter is known . for her rather eccentric style of bird’s-nest hair and socks worn with . flip-flops, of late she has become something of a fashion icon. 'Here, Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that, although only two minutes long, cost many millions to produce. 'Teamed cleverly with Rosie, she’s a classy, . unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman, . being neither too frumpy, nor too unattainable. 'The . product placement — dresses, dresses and more dresses — is perfect, and . there is nothing cheesy about the production, apart from the Cheddar . truckles at the tea party. It’s fun, and, given the chemistry between . Rosie and Gandy, super sexy. 'Rosie . is a reliable cash cow (excuse the term) for Marks, with her own-label . lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store’s history. And . the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums, who will be the . ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home, very happy . indeed.' The ad, directed by Swedish music video maestro Johan Renck, who has made shorts for Madonna, Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams will be unveiled in full to fashion press at a red carpet screening on Tuesday night.

"By . Toni Jones . Women's Hour presenter Jane Garvey has claimed that it is still a man's media world . Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey isn't one to mince her words. Along with her co-presenter Jenni Murray the established DJ encourages lively debate on her Radio 4 women's interest show, whether the topic is Fifty Shades Of Grey or feminism in the workplace. Now, ahead of her new radio series on female pioneers, the broadcaster has slammed the sexist radio industry for reducing women to giggling sidekicks. Writing for the Telegraph's Wonder Women column the 49-year-old has revealed that she wasn't surprised about the 'kerfuffle' surrounding the appointment of the two female presenters to the rather old-fashioned Today Show. Earlier this month Mishal Husain became the show's second female anchor as she joined Sarah Montague at the controls. The 40-year-old Cambridge graduate's arrival raised eyebrows and while BBC director-general . Tony Hall claimed that he was 'very pleased' to have more female voices on the programme, Garvey warns that there is still a long way to go. Talking about men still dominating the airwaves she says in the blog: 'The truth is, it's still a man's media . world and we're a little bit lucky to be a part of it. Too often, women . on radio are parked right up Sidekick Alley: a stooge, an obliging . giggler, someone to facilitate the Wildean wit of the Big Man at the . controls.' Garvey has worked in the industry for 25 years and claims that she has never felt hard done by as a female presenter, crediting the 'enlightened' John Pickles for giving her the chance to host her first breakfast show in the 1990s. Mishal Husain as she begins her new job today as a presenter on the BBC's Radio 4's flagship Today programme . Throughout her broadcast career she has been inspired by female DJs like Annie Nightingale and Janice Long and TV talent including Esther Rantzen and Cilla Black, but says that female success stories like theirs seem to be too few and far between: 'We’ve come a long way, but we’re still . going quite slowly. Men still dominate at peak . times: breakfast and drive, the programmes you want as a . presenter, with a chance of an audience and a bigger share of the . resources.' Garvey puts this down to the perceived lack of authority or 'gravitas' of a female presenter, and goes on to questions the personality traits of a successful radio talent: 'I do sometimes wonder, late at night, whether the rather toxic mix of arrogance and insecurity required to do this sort of gig is more common in men than women,' she ponders. Mishal Husain, pictured . right, was born in Northampton, in 1973 but two years later moved to the . Middle East where her father practised as a doctor. After . spending time in Saudi Arabia, she returned to the UK at the age of 12 . to complete her education at Cobham Hall, an independent school in . Cobham, Kent. Ms . Husain went on to studied Law at New Hall, Cambridge, and then a . Master's degree in International and Comparative Law at the European . University Institute in Florence, Italy. Ms Husain began her journalistic career aged 18 in Islamabad at Pakistan's English-language newspaper The News. After . two years at Bloomberg Television in London in 1996, where she was a . producer and sometime presenter, she joined the BBC as a junior producer . in the newsroom and for the News 24 channel. During her rise through the ranks, she had stints at the Economics and Business Unit, . the daily Breakfast programme, on Asia Business Report (based in . Singapore), and as a presenter of business news on both BBC World News . and the BBC News Channel. From . September 2002 she was the corporation's Washington correspondent, . serving as the main news anchor through the buildup to the invasion of . Iraq and during the war. She named as part of BBCs Olympic Presenting team and presented News at 10. In . July she was announced as the first Muslim presenter of BBC Radio 4's . Today programme and the show's second ever female anchor.","Female broadcaster Mishal Husain joined the Today Show this month .

"By . Toni Jones . and Harriet Arkell . and Martin Robinson . As the only royal godparent the pressure was on Zara Tindall yesterday. And the 32-year-old seemed to take inspiration from Victoria Beckham's maternity wardrobe as she arrived at St James's Palace wearing a simple navy coat and matching headpiece. Whilst most of the group, including Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Pippa Middleton and Kate herself chose pale colours for the christening, pregnant Zara draped her growing bump in chic navy. Victoria Beckham wore a similar outfit for the Royal Wedding in April 2011 when she was pregnant with daughter Harper. Scroll down for video . Zara Tindall, pictured here leaving the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace with husband Mike Tindall yesterday, is the only member of the royal family chosen to be a godparent to Prince George .

She finished the look with a boxy turquoise clutch bag, a pair of simple court shoes and a £518 hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan. The Middleton sisters both chose to wear cream for the historic occasion, with Pippa opting for a 'trapeze' coat and 'Paris' dress by British designer, Suzannah. The cream wool coat costs £750. She teamed her outfit with a jaunty hat and carried a peach clutch bag. Proud mother Kate chose a ruffled cream design by Alexander McQueen, the label behind her 2011 wedding dress.

The christening itself is set to be a intimate affair and the godparents and their spouses will make up a crowd of only 24 people attending the 3pm service. As well as ignoring protocol by only inviting five senior royals, the Cambridge's have also broken from tradition by not having their son christened at Buckingham Palace. Instead the future king will be carried and blessed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in the little known Chapel Royal at St James's Palace yesterday afternoon. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married there in 1840, and George will be christened in a replica of the intricate lace and satin christening gown made for Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841.

JANUARY: A male university rowing club have bared all by posing completely NUDE in their raunchiest ever charity calendar . Instead of the usual strategically placed oars, this year’s calendar aims to create a relaxed atmosphere by showing the group larking around on the riverside. In one action shot, a muscular rower rugby tackles his blonde team-mate off the wooden jetty into the River Avon. Other snaps show the lads squirting water bottles in each other’s faces while another shows a rower playfully tipping a bucket of water over his naked pals.

There is also a . light-hearted nude tug-of-war where the flag attached to the middle of . the rope just covers one rower’s modesty. One . of the rowers and the calendar’s organiser, Politics student Laurie . Hulse, 21, said: 'It took us four days to shoot the calendar, all of . which took place at our Boat House on the Avon in June. 'This . year we have gone for a more natural feel, with fewer well placed oars . and more natural scenes, basically what we do every day at the boat . house but just naked. 'Getting . naked wasn’t a problem really, were all good friends and after about . five minutes it turned into four of the most hilarious days I’ve had at . university. 'It didn’t take . long for the water fight to become a ruck, with guys getting pushed in, . which by chance made for a great calendar shot. 'We’re . thrilled with the calendar, we think the photos look great and with all . of the extra bonus photos and the film we look forward to raising lots . of money for charity.' AUGUST: Calendar organiser Laurie Hulse said: 'Getting naked wasn't a problem really, we're all good friends,' The . team are hoping to repeat on last year’s naked calendar which saw it . sold out in days with orders coming from over 40 countries. The . hunky rowers have already built up an impressive celebrity fan base . including Stephen Fry, John Barrowman, Boy George, Gok Wan and Derren . Brown. And this year the . muscular athletes have decided to use their calendar to raise money . for a charity which challenges homophobic bullying in schools. Funds from the calendar and other products will go towards Educational Action Challenging Homophobia (EACH). The . registered charity is working with the rowers to develop a programme . called Sport Allies that will see them going into schools and making . viral videos. They aim to help . encourage young people who are being bullied about their sexual . identity to call a national helpline and speak out about the abuse they . suffer. OCTOBER (l) and NOVEMBER (r): This year the muscle-bound athletes have decided to use their calendar to raise money for a charity which challenges homophobic bullying in schools . Rower Laurie added: 'Supporters wrote in to us explaining their experiences of homophobia . and why the stance we were taking meant so much. 'This . has motivated us to set up Sport Allies, Our very own outreach . programme in partnership with EACH. We hope one day Sport Allies can . become a charity itself.' Director . of EACH, Jonathan Charlesworth, said: “There can be a reluctance among . males to be seen to be too bonded to their male friends in any emotional . or physical way. 'The Warwick . Rowers use tongue-in-cheek videos and photographs to challenge this, . and in doing so I think they are taking constructive and positive stand . against homophobia. We are proud to be the partner agency working with them.' Former . Warwick rower, two-time Olympian and World medallist Tom Solesbury, . also applauded the team for tackling bullying and homophobia in schools.He said: 'I rowed for Warwick, and am delighted to see my old club doing such great work for charity and for young people. 'I . think what they’re doing is very brave. I’ve faced many challenges in . my Olympic career, but I have to take my hat off to the boys for this.' London-based . photographer Angus Malcolm, who has shot all five of the rowers’ calendars, added: 'This year I’ve aimed to create a lot more captured . moments that show who the boys really are and how relaxed they are . around each other. 'It’s very much part of the message we want to get across. And I hope they look good, too.'

Languidly leaning against a window sporting a sharply tailored blazer, cream shirt and slouchy peg leg, Miranda Kerr looks every inch the model businesswoman in the new AW campaign for Mango.

On Tuesday Stella McCartney showed off space-age sunglasses and skin-coloured heels at her show in the Palais Garnier, today Cara Delevingne showcased luxury backpacks and wonder wigs at Chanel, but it is belts all over the catwalks of New York, London, Milan and Paris that have caught the eye of the trend-forecasters. For spring/summer 2014 designers including Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry and Pucci have all brought back the statement belt. The message is the bigger the better and huge buckles and extra hardware have added a tougher feeling to an otherwise feminine style. Belts were a key look for the women of the 1940s and 1950s who defined tiny waists with full skirts and tight belts and for many design houses, specifically Christian Dior, it became a signature style. Today we look at the trend from the current collections and possible inspiration from the archives. Carolina Herrara in New York: Prim checks meets plastic fantastic .

"By . Toni Jones . Princess of Michael of Kent appeared on Daybreak on Tuesday to promote her new novel The Queen of Four Kingdoms . She won't wear Spanx, hates her granddaughter's name and eats fat-free yoghurt with cinnamon for breakfast while her cats feast on fresh chicken or ham. Following a round of promotional interviews to push her latest novel it seems that there isn't much we don't know about Princess Michael of Kent. The wife of the Queen's cousin, often nicknamed Princess Pushy because of her demanding demeanor, also recently admitted that she was horrified when told to downsize and move full time into Kensington Palace. And today Daybreak presenters Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly had to stifle giggles as Her Royal Highness likened the Royal residence to a living in a terrraced house with a completely straight face. Wearing a sharp blazer and stiff-collared white shirt as well as a collection of heavy jewellery Princess Michael was appearing on the daytime TV show to promote her book, The Queen of Four Kingdoms, a tale of 15th century European royals. She explained that the book, the first in a trilogy, is a historical love story 'set in a time of Henry V, Joan of Arc, witches being burned daily, suspicion, superstition and arranged marriages.' When asked about her own love story, a marriage which has lasted for 35 years, the mother of two gushed: 'I'm a granny!' Princess Michael's son Freddie and his wife Sophie Winkleman had a daughter, Maud, in August. The princess wasn't massively impressed with her granddaughter when she first met her at a few days old though, declaring today: 'It was just a little thing, you know, awfully small. I'd forgotten how small they are. She has very long legs though. My two had little fat legs like a frog but she had long slender things that hung down. 'Now I get pictures almost daily. I live on Skype.' The royal talked about her new role as a grandmother to baby Maud, and also being neighbours with Prince George . There is also another new, very high profile baby in the 71-year-old's life, as she is a neighbour of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son Prince George. Describing their living arrangements she told hosts Aled and Lorraine: 'Kensington Palace is a little bit like Harrods. There are lots of courtyards. 'One of the family called it the 'aunt heap' because all the aunts live there, it's like living in a terrace.' '[William and Kate] have been living there for a while in a little cottage. William and Harry grew up next door to us so we have always seen them.' Prince and Princess Michael at their wedding in 1978, left, and Freddie and Sophie’s 2009 wedding . Sophie Winkleman, Freddie and Prince Michael at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee service of thanksgiving . Princess Michael and her husband Prince Michael, who is the grandson of George V, have been living in the West London palace since 2006. Speaking . to The Sunday Times Magazine this weekend, she recalled the moment when she was told . she would have to sell their £5.7million 16th century mansion, Nether . Lypiatt, in Gloucestershire to move full time into Kensington Palace. They needed to sell the house meet the £120,000-a-year rent on their . five-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace, after being told they could . no longer pay a subsidised ‘peppercorn rent’ of just £69-a-week. She . said: ‘Of course I miss the big gardens we had at our country house but . it became very expensive to run... we couldn’t afford it. ‘For the first time that terrible word . came into my life when our private secretary said, “Ma’am, you have to . downsize.” It was the worst word I’d heard in ages.’ Lap of luxury: The Kent family's 18th Century home, Nether Lypiatt Manor at Bisley, Gloucestershire .","71-year-old is promoting her new novel, The Queen of Four Kingdoms .

"By . Toni Jones . An 82 year-old great-grandmother from . Cornwall - who may hold claim to the title of Britain’s oldest punk . rocker - is to be the subject of an upcoming documentary film. Sprightly . pensioner Viva Hamnell’s story of her rise to fame as a vocalist with . legendary Cornish punk band The Bricks in the late 1970’s and her later . notoriety during a sensational drug trial is charted by award-winning . director Amanda Bluglass and cameraman Danny Cooke. After . the breakdown of her marriage in 1976, the then forty-five year old . mother-of-two moved to a secluded farmhouse in the tiny village of St . Anne’s Chapel, Gunnislake, Cornwall to face up to what she perceived as a . bleak future, alone and isolated. 82 year-old great-grandmother Viva Hamnell from Cornwall is to be the subject of a Channel 4 documentary . Mother-of-two Viva says 'punk has a great freedom with no rules' 'After the marriage split my life changed and I sat down on the front step of my new home and literally cried my eyes out,' said Viva. But as the musical and cultural explosion of punk rock gripped the nation over the long, hot summer of ’76, Viva soon found herself leading an unlikely double life - as a lollipop lady by day and a backing singer with 21 year-old son Simon’s punk rockers The Bricks - by night. The popular seven piece band – generally acknowledged as Cornwall’s first punk outfit - soon gained a cult following and garnered favourable comparisons with new wavers the Rezillos, as they toured Devon and Cornwall with tracks such as 'High Rise Harry' and 'Dole Queue.' Viva was a backing singer with 1970's cult new wave band The Bricks . Viva joined her son's band at the age of 45 after the breakdown of her marriage . Viva (wearing the hat) worked as a lollipop lady by day and a backing singer with 21 year-old son Simon's band by night . 'There was a spirit and energy about punk – it had great freedom with no rules,' explained Viva, who fell foul of the law in February of 1979 when an early morning drugs swoop by police discovered cannabis plants growing in her garden and the bizarre circumstances of her trial made the national press. 'I was in bed on a Saturday morning when the police burst in and when they asked me what it was I said: ‘I thought they were tomato plants.’ During the subsequent court case Mrs. Hamnell was duly found not guilty after claiming she’d received the plants from a friend and unaware of their true nature, had intended feeding them to her pet goat. 'It was the worst two days of my life. It was horrendous,' she recalls. 'I didn’t think there was anything sinister,' she explained to the judge at Plymouth Crown Court at the time. 'I just planted them.' The Chanel 4 film will touch upon her brush with the law when she was found not guilty of possession of cannabis after claiming it was feed for her goat . While Viva has moved on from the black tights, girl guide outfits and safety pin earrings of her punk heyday, her current look echoes the creations of Dame Vivienne Westwood . While Viva has moved on from the black tights, girl guide outfits and safety pin earrings of her punk heyday, her current look echoes the creations of Dame Vivienne Westwood, the pioneering designer who brought punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream. Filmmaker Bluglass whose recent project 'Ray: A Life Underwater' received 12 film festival plaudits internationally, explained how she was attracted to Viva Hamnell as her latest project. 'A friend told me about Viva and the minute I met her I just knew this film had to happen. It’s an incredible story that just had to be told. 'We’ve followed Viva from her farmhouse to Glastonbury where she has worked for the last thirty years and reliving her years of leading a punk band to setting up the Elephant Fayre - the forerunner of Cornwall’s renowned Port Eliot Festival.' With the short-edit version of the film soon to be screened on Channel 4, Amanda hopes an internet crowd-funding scheme will allow the purchase of the only known footage of The Bricks performing live and a much longer version of the documentary to be completed. 'This footage, owned by the BBC, is such a find and will transport the viewer back decades. Viva Hamnell keeps a high profile despite her advancing years, with an audience-participation performance where she shares her experiences with small, intimate audiences. 'To me it’s just my life history but there’s been so many people along the way, and the punk era in particular brought something alive in me. 'I never think I’m 82 as in my head I’m just Viva, which is Latin for ‘to live’ and that’s what I’ve got to do.' Director Amanda Bluglass says that she knew the story had to be told as soon as she met pensioner Viva .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Sir Mick Jagger’s former girlfriend has revealed that she could have died through the pressures of their relationship. Marianne Faithfull, who went out with the Rolling Stones front man in the 1960s, said being with him is ‘very difficult’. The 67-year-old singer described how she took an overdose of pills while travelling with Jagger and said L'Wrenn Scott’s suicide by hanging ‘could have been me’. Scroll down for video . Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull in 1969 shortly after they were arrested on drugs charges at their home on Cheyne Walk, Chelsea . Scott was found in her New York apartment with police later ruling that it was death by suicide in March. The 49-year-old left her estate, believed to be worth £6million to Jagger despite their relationship being described as ‘troubled’ by friends. Faithfull, who sang the Jagger-Richard’s song As Tears Go By, is a daughter of an Austrian baroness, Eva von Sacher-Masoch. She  is credited for introducing the then young rocker to literature, ballet and opera. Marianne Faithfull believes that it is difficult being in a relationship with Sir Mick Jagger . Mick Jagger  with Marianne Faithfull outside Marlborough Street  court,London where on 18 December 1969 they pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing cannabis resin . Baroness Eva Sacher-Masoch,  mother of singer Marianne Faithfull, pictured arriving at London Airport on her way to Australia to visit her daughter who is recovering from a drug overdose . She told The Sunday Times magazine that she had emailed Jagger following Scott’s death, but had not spoken to him. ‘I sent him an email on his private email address and just said “Love, compassion, so sorry if you need me or anything” that’s all,’ she said. ‘I look at poor L’Wren and I feel tremendous compassion because she obviously couldn’t cut it. Being with Mick was very difficult – and it could have been me. I did take a huge overdose in Sydney.’ Faithfull swallowed 50 sleeping tablets and washed them down with hot chocolate while on a flight to Australia with Jagger in 1969. She then drifted into a coma while arriving at their hotel. ‘I was unconscious for six days and nearly died, so that could have easily been me. Mind you, I was 22.’ Mick Jagger and L'Wrenn Scott who killed herself earlier this year . Despite saying what the pressures were in her relationship, she described them as ‘enormous’. The previous year, she had been pregnant with Jagger’s daughter — whom she’d already named Corrina — but miscarried at seven months. Faithfull said the pressures with a relationship with Jagger are: ‘Enormous, yes, but obviously for a lot of people it’s worth it.’ When asked why, she replied: ‘I really couldn’t say. And I wouldn’t say. That’ s nobody’s business. Anyway, it must be different for everybody. Most of those girls who are with him, since me actually, really like the fame and the money, all that s***. I never cared. ‘You have to be very strong, and poor L’Wren,’ she told the interviewer while shaking her head, ‘I think she also came from that very weird background, that Mormon thing.’ Sixties glamour: Faithfull with her friend Britt Ekland who was married to Goon star Peter Sellers in 1964 . The end of their relationship was the start of a downward spiral into heavy drug use and alcoholism for Faithfull. After leaving Jagger, she was penniless, became a heroin addict and lived rough in Soho. Last week Faithfull claimed that her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend ‘killed’ rock star Jim Morrison by giving him heroin which was too strong. Mystery has long surrounded the death of The Doors lead singer after he suddenly collapsed and died in his Paris apartment in the summer of 1971. More than 40 years on, singer Faithfull has claimed that her then boyfriend - a drug dealer called Jean de Breteuil - supplied Morrison with drugs which led to an overdose. Jim Morrison, nine months before his death, leaves the courtroom  in the custody of a policeman after the singer was sentenced to six months in jail, and fined $500 for using profanity in public and indecent exposure during a performance in March 1969 in Florida . In an interview with Mojo, she said of de Breteuil: ‘He went to see Jim Morrison and killed him. ‘I mean I’m sure it was an accident. Poor B******d. The smack was too strong? Yeah, and he died. ‘I didn’t know anything about this. Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now, except me.’ Morrison was found dead aged 27 in the bathtub of a rented flat on Rue Beautreillis in the Marais district of Paris. French authorities revealed he died of ‘natural causes’ following an autopsy. De Bruteuil himself died of an overdose later the same year in Morocco.","Faithfull, who sang the Jagger-Richard’s song As Tears Go By, is the daughter of Austrian baroness, Eva von Sacher-Masoch .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . It is a theatrical phrase which is used to wish those appearing on stage good luck. But it seems when one soprano was told to ‘break a leg’ before performing at Glyndebourne Festival, she literally did. The German-singer, Christiane Karg dislocated her knee after tripping on a set while playing the lead role in Mozart’s opera, La Finta Giardiniera. Christiane Karg, 33, in action at Glyndebourne before the accident which happened on Sunday night . But despite being in an agonising pain following the slip in the first act, the 33-year-old received a standing ovation after bravely carrying on with her performance. Miss Karg was playing Sandrina when she tripped on the frail paper stage set. In the opera, her character is sent mad with jealousy after her husband brutally stabs her for another love. The role demanded her to seek shelter in the fireplace of the house, which she believes to be a cave. During this production, she was supposed to jump through the paper wall of the house for effect, but tripped and fell awkwardly onto the stage. The opera was immediately halted on Sunday night and a doctor who was in the audience was asked to look at her injury. The GP was able to quickly put her dislocated left knee back into place. After 15 minutes, Miss Karg refused a trip to hospital and said she was keen to continue the performance. A chair was placed at the front of the stage and she sang her performance for the whole second half while sitting down. An audience member at the stately home near Lewes, East Sussex, said: ‘It was pretty shocking to see her fall down and it was obvious that it was a serious tumble. The German singer dislocated her knee in a fall during the first act of La Finta Giardiniera . ‘The performance was immediately halted and everyone initially thought that there was no way she could carry on. ‘She was extremely brave to carry on singing while sat at the front of the stage. The whole audience was extremely grateful and she received a standing ovation. ‘The show must obviously mean a lot to her as it takes a lot to carry on after a dislocated knee.’ Miss Karg was yesterday resting her knee and no decision has been made whether she will continue with the remainder of her performances at Glyndebourne. Her agent confirmed that she had wanted to continue with the opera after saying the pain to her knee had not affected her voice. He added that Miss Karg had refused painkillers, perhaps in case it made her feel drowsy, and enjoyed singing at the festival. It is the third time she has been in a production at Glyndebourne and has performed in concerts across Europe since 2006. In interviews about the latest production, Miss Karg has revealed that she was excited about the role. She said: ‘It’ll be a really interesting evening because there is a lot going on: the opera is very tragic and it’s weird at times, but that makes it more exciting. ‘People will have their own ideas about it and I think after seeing our production they will have a lot to discuss. I like these operas where you can have a new experience and really enjoy the discovery.’ A Glyndebourne spokesman said:  ‘A performance of La Finta Giardiniera was stopped for a short time following a fall from one of the cast.  Soprano Christiane Karg  fell and dislocated her left knee. ‘The performance was stopped temporarily whilst Christiane was seen by a GP who treated her immediately and was able to relocate the knee. ‘Miss Karg, who was keen to continue her performance, sang from a seated position on stage. At the end of the performance Miss Karg received a wonderful reception from the audience, delighted that she had been able to continue her role.’","Christiane Karg, 33, dislocated her knee after tripping on set on Sunday .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Nicky Campbell has revealed how he was left ‘extremely upset’ when  litter louts spat on him  outside his home. The Radio 5 Live Breakfast host was verbally abused and ‘showered’ with spit when he confronted the gang of yobs for ripping open bin bags and kicking rubbish all over his street. Speaking for the first time about the emotional impact of the attack in Clapham, south London, he said he had to be comforted afterwards by his wife Tina. Nicky Campbell has revealed how he was left 'extremely upset' when litter louts spat on him  outside his home . ‘I asked them very politely to put [the litter] in a bin and they covered me in spittle all over my hair,’ he told this week’s Radio Times. ‘I walked back home and then I went upstairs and had a shower and lay on the bed. ‘I called Tina and she came up and I talked to her about it and I was extremely upset. ‘You are only trying to do the right thing and then someone covers you in spit. I didn’t feel good about it at all.’ The former Watchdog presenter, 53, said his wife was angry when he told her about the incident ‘because I have a tendency to remonstrate with people’ but he added that he did not regret his actions and would probably do the same again. Although the incident occurred in 2011, it appears from Mr Campbell’s comments that it has had a lasting impact and remains in the forefront of his mind. The Radio 5 Live Breakfast host was verbally abused and 'showered' with spit when he confronted the gang of yobs for ripping open bin bags and kicking rubbish all over his street . Speaking shortly after it happened he told listeners of his BBC radio show: ‘I was going for a run and there were these kids – who were aged about 14 or 15. ‘And they had kicked open a bin bag and they were spreading the litter everywhere. ‘I remonstrated with them and they showered me with gob – all of them. It was unpleasant.’ His shocked co-presenter Rachel Burden, said: ‘What, they spat at you?’ Mr Campbell went on to clarify: ‘Yes, and they were very insulting and abusive.’ The shocking encounter happened just weeks after the father of four found himself having to chase a burglar from his property. After being alerted by the family’s golden Labrador, Maxwell, he jumped out of bed naked at 5am to confront the thief who was trying to steal his £600 bike from the garden. At the time Mr Campbell said: ‘I ran downstairs, opened the back door and flew out with Maxwell beside me. Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has also revealed that he likes to regularly challenge people if he spots them dropping rubbish . ‘My body parts were dangling in the wind. I just wanted to get him. I was pumping with adrenaline.’ However the burglar fled the property empty-handed. ‘If I’d caught him I don’t know what I’d have done – probably hit him,’ Mr Campbell added. ‘Or maybe I would have tried to sit on him naked until the police arrived – that would have traumatised him for life. ‘Something primordial took over and I didn’t think about anything other than grabbing him. It never even crossed my mind that he could have had a knife.’ Mr Campbell is not the only BBC host to take on litter louts. His hero, the former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman – whom he describes as an ‘interviewer nonpareil’ – has also revealed that he likes to regularly challenge people if he spots them dropping rubbish. However Mr Paxman seems to have had slightly better experiences confronting people who have thrown litter on the streets. Discussing his take on the problem, he said: ‘I find when you confront people and say “excuse me, you just dropped this”, then nine times out of ten – you might be unlucky on the tenth one – but nine times out of ten they will say “oh, sorry,” and take the rubbish away.’","The breakfast host was verbally abused and ‘showered’ with spit .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Wedding day: Peter and Vivien Beckwith married at The Queen's Chapel of the Savoy, London . He spent years – not to mention a small fortune – helping his late wife turn the Victorian mansion into a much-loved family home. But now property tycoon Peter Beckwith is selling the Grade II listed property... because his new wife does not want to live there. Mr Beckwith has put Prospect House on the market for £16.5million, but it appears that both the 69-year-old and his socialite daughter Tamara are somewhat reluctant to see it sold. For it is filled with memories of Miss Beckwith’s mother Paula, who died of cancer in December 2011 and who played a major role in renovating, decorating and furnishing the once-derelict mansion. Miss Beckwith said of the sale that she is ‘not going to think about it yet’. However Mr Beckwith, who married society hostess Vivien McLean last month, has accepted that his new wife wants them to create a home together. In an interview with a property supplement he said: ‘I built the house with my late wife, and you’ll see there’s a definite woman’s touch to the whole thing. 'The new Mrs Beckwith obviously wants to create her own space, wherever we end up.’ The interviewer described Mr Beckwith, who is worth an estimated £350million, as appearing ‘miffed’ about the sale and the tycoon admitted: ‘I will be sad to leave. It will be impossible to replace and I shall find it difficult to acclimatise anywhere else.’ Sighing, he concluded: ‘Well, variety is the spice of life.’ It is only five weeks ago that the house, in Wimbledon, south-west London, hosted the reception following his marriage to Miss McLean, 67, in the Queen’s Chapel at the Savoy hotel. Tamara, 44, and her sister Clare Van Dam, 41, were among the guests. Prospect House: Paula Beckwith spent four years renovating it.

She played a major role in renovating, decorating and furnishing the once-derelict mansion . Prospect House, which dates from 1866, had been empty for 36 years before Mr Beckwith purchased it with his brother John in 1995. He and Paula spent four years restoring the sprawling property, once part of the Atkinson Morley Hospital site. English Heritage agreed to the extensive refurbishments, carried out largely to suit the late Mrs Beckwith’s tastes. Original mouldings, cornice work and windows were sympathetically restored. The character of the building was respected by taking a traditional approach to the interiors. The main hall was given an oak staircase and fitted with a distressed Portland stone floor, while four rooms were renovated to create one huge kitchen. The master bedroom was given a purpose-made hardwood dressing room with hand-carved doors and pilasters. The grounds were extensively landscaped with several bronzes of a deceased family dog and a giant mermaid made of flowers – and £36,000 was spent on relocating several badger setts to make way for a massive lawn.

Paul Daniels adapted her house, spending thousands of pounds on it so she could retain her independence. But yesterday the celebrity magician vented his fury at discovering he faces being penalised by the taxman for doing so. Family: Celebrity magician Paul Daniels, pictured with his parents Nancy and Hugh in 1986, is furious after discovering he will have to pay £136,000 in capital gains tax when he sells his mother's house, following her death . Tax bill: Mr Daniels and his wife Debbie McGee live in a stunning £2.5million home on the banks of the Thames in Berkshire. But because his mother Nancy's home was registered in his name, he faces the tax bill in the wake of her death. Mr Daniels said he has saved the government money, caring for his mother in her own home rather than move her to a care home . He says he is facing a capital gains tax bill of £136,000 when he sells his late mother’s home. As it was registered in Daniels’s name and not his mother’s, he is liable to pay the tax on it as a ‘second home’. But he says that by caring for his mother himself he has saved the government thousands of pounds – and the essential renovations to the house should be tax deductible. ‘They don’t understand the amount I’ve spent and saved the government by providing for her,’ he said. Shortly after his father Hugh died, Daniels decided to help his mother Nancy to remain in the house she lived in close to him and his wife and stage assistant Debbie McGee. The entertainer renovated the bungalow by putting in wall banisters and adapting  the bathroom. But following his mother’s death in January at the age of 97, he has calculated that he will now have to pay £136,000 in capital gains tax when he sells the property. Daniels, 75, who lives in a £2.5million mansion in Berkshire, said yesterday: ‘My parents moved into a lodge house at our previous property and when we decided to move, I bought my mother a small bungalow in the same village as she wanted to stay. Anger: The celebrity magician said: 'People will say ""well you've made a lot of money on the house over the years, why not pay the tax bill"", but they don't understand the amount I've spent and saved the government by providing for her' ‘I did it to take away the need for her to worry about all the niggly things that put stress on to pensioners. Without me providing for her, my mother would have had to go into a care home paid for by the state.’ He told how he had to adapt the property to allow his elderly mother to live there as comfortably as possible. ‘I have spent thousands on the property to allow her to remain in the home she knew,’ he said. ‘There were so many bars on the wall to help her cling to while she walked that we joked she could practise her ballet in the house. 'People will say “well you’ve made a lot of money on the house over the years, why not pay the tax bill”, but they don’t understand the amount I’ve spent and saved the government by providing for her.’ The bungalow in Denham, Buckinghamshire, was bought by Daniels under his real first-name of Newton, for £150,000 in 1997. Property estimates for the area now value it at around £520,000. So wrong: Paul Daniels (centre) pictured with his parents, added: 'I will be handing over about £136,000 in tax. That feels SO wrong' Daniels wrote on his blog: ‘In any business you are allowed to claim expenses against tax. Apparently not in the case of capital gains tax. ‘At a first glance calculation, having saved the government a small fortune by looking after my mother at my own expense, which by the way, I have never regretted or minded in any way, I will be handing over about £136,000 in tax. That feels SO wrong.’ The Liberal Democrats wanted to raise capital gains tax from 18 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent to match income rates in 2010. But when faced with a revolt from his backbenchers, Prime Minister David Cameron watered down the proposals to 28 per cent for those earning above the basic income rate. The Government currently has no plans to change the rules of capital gains tax. During the recent floods Daniels told how he was able to keep his home on the banks of the Thames dry, despite the waters coming close to his property. The house was damaged both in 2003 and 2012, but thanks to a series of flood pumps and defences it was protected from the deluge this time.","Celebrity magician vented his fury at discovering the tax bill .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Social Worker Joseph Brown was struck off after being convicted of six counts of outraging public decency and one of voyeurism . An NSPCC social worker who was caught taking indecent pictures up women’s skirts was yesterday struck off from working in the profession. Joseph Brown was waiting for the train to his office at the children’s charity when a fellow commuter noticed he had taken an intimate photograph on his mobile phone of a woman passenger. Brown was stopped by the man on the platform who alerted British Transport Police officers at Wimbledon Station, south London, before he was arrested. Following an investigation, officers confiscated his home computer in which they found six more pictures, footage and videos of views up unsuspecting women’s skirts. A film of a 'female friend' taken a few years ago while she washed in the shower at his home was also discovered on his machine by computer forensic officers. Brown, who is believed to be in his early 40s, was convicted of six counts of outraging public decency and one of voyeurism in March this year. He was forced to sign the sex offender’s register and participate in a treatment programme. Yesterday, the social worker’s regulatory body, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), struck Brown off after a fitness to practice hearing. Brown, who arrived at the proceedings with his wife, applied to have the hearing heard in private - arguing the conviction had been a ‘very traumatic experience for me and my wife’. ‘I think the offence that occurred was when I was incredibly depressed last year,’ he told the panel of three experts. Arguing for the case to be heard behind closed doors without the Press, he added: ‘It might be damaging for my recovery considerably.’ But he burst into tears when the HCPC panel ruled the hearing should be held in public. His wife comforted him by stroking his back, before they decided to leave just minutes later. Brown sobbed: ‘The difficulty about it is I think about it and relive it’. He had referred himself to the HCPC shortly after being arrested in August last year. The hearing, in Kennington, south London, heard he was working for the NSPCC with ‘vulnerable people’ who could have been victims of sexual offences. At the time of his arrest, Brown had . already handed in his notice to take up a role for Wandsworth Council. The offence meant he did not go onto work for the local authority. The man was seen taking an indecent photograph of a woman at Wimbledon station, south London . In his letter to the HCPC, Brown admitted he had taken the indecent picture at the railway station of ‘an attractive lady in a short skirt.’ The hearing, which continued in Brown’s absence ,heard HCPC presenting officer Mary Page tell the panel Brown had not just carried out a one-off crime. She added: ‘It’s the gravity of the offence itself. This was not a single image taken on a single day, but a number of images taken over a number of days. ‘The count of voyeurism was raised from a video taken some time before August last year. This was not an isolated incident.’ The HCPC panel ruled that Brown’s fitness to practice social work had been impaired. In its judgement, it wrote: ‘In order to maintain public confidence in the profession and the regulatory process and to uphold proper standards of conduct, the panel has concluded that [Brown’s] fitness to practice is currently impaired.’ Brown, who had written saying he no longer wished to continue to work in the social care profession, was struck off.","Joseph Brown was took an indecent photograph of woman at train station .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Kate Atkinson is on course to make literary history by becoming the first woman to win the prestigious Costa Book of the Year Award twice . Kate Atkinson is on course to make literary history by becoming the first woman to win the prestigious Costa Book of the Year Award twice. The author, who first won in 1995 with  her debut novel Behind The Scenes At The Museum, yesterday scooped the Costa Novel Award for her latest title, Life After Life. The win means she has been placed on the shortlist for Costa Book Of The Year, a £30,000 prize which will be announced at the end of the month. Only poets Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes have won this main award twice, meaning Miss Atkinson, 62, would also be the first novelist to win the prize twice. Award organisers pointed out that if she wins, then women will have taken all the recent major literary awards, the shortlists of which are usually dominated by men. For example, last year New Zealander Eleanor Catton won the Man Booker Prize for The Luminaries. And Lucy Hughes-Hallett, who is favourite to win the Costa award after winning the biography category, was awarded the Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction for The Pike, her account of the life of fascist poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. In 2012 Hilary Mantel won both the Costa and the Man Booker for Bring Up The Bodies, the second book in her trilogy about the court of Henry VIII. Life After Life is Miss Atkinson’s eighth novel and is the story of a young woman called Ursula Todd in wartime Britain. Miss . Atkinson is best-known for the international bestseller Behind The . Scenes At The Museum and her 2004 novel Case Histories, the first of her . detective books featuring character Jackson Brodie, which has been . adapted into a TV series. The author, who first won in 1995 with her debut novel Behind The Scenes At The Museum, yesterday scooped the Costa Novel Award for her latest title, Life After Life . Miss . Atkinson, 62, said: ‘I am absolutely delighted to have won the Costa . Novel Award, and would like to thank the judges for choosing Life After . Life.’ The other category . winners include The Shock Of The Fall, the debut penned by a former . mental health nurse Nathan Filer, 32, who won the first novel award. The book - the story of a teenager’s descent into madness as he confronts his role in the childhood death of his older brother - was snapped up by publisher HarperCollins for a ‘substantial’ six-figure sum. Writer and TV presenter Clive James was on the shortlist to win the poetry prize for his translation of Italian poet Dante, but was beaten to the award by poet Michael Symmons Roberts. Mr Roberts has won the poetry award for the second time, this time with his sixth collection Drysalter. Writer and TV presenter Clive James (left) was on the shortlist to win the poetry prize for his translation of Italian poet Dante, but was beaten to the award by poet Michael Symmons Roberts (right) The children’s book award was won by political cartoonist, author and illustrator Chris Riddell for Goth Girl And The Ghost Of A Mouse. Lucy Hughes-Hallett was named winner of the biography award for The Pike, an account of the life of poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. Last year Hillary Mantel won both the Costa and Booker prize for Bring Up the Bodies, the second novel in a planned trilogy chronicling the life of King Henry VIII’s advisor Thomas Cromwell. The winners of each category receive £5,000 with an overall winner getting a further £30,000 at this month’s ceremony in central London. The Costa, formerly the Whitbread, is open to authors resident in the UK and Ireland.","Author first won in 1995 with debut Behind The Scenes At The Museum .

Dramatic footage of an RAF air display is believed to show the pilot killed in the Glasgow helicopter tragedy demonstrating his aviation prowess behind the controls of an army Chinook. Former flight lieutenant David Traill, 51, was piloting a police helicopter when it crashed into the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow on Friday night, killing all on board and several people inside. It has since emerged that Mr Traill was an experienced Chinook pilot who served in Afghanistan and Iraq before leaving the RAF to become a civilian pilot.

"By . John Stevens . and Ryan Kisiel . Found: Ella Hysom was missing for three days, but was found yesterday in east London . The parents of a deputy head girl who went missing during treatment for depression told last night of their joy at her being found alive and well. Ella Hysom, 15, was reunited with her family following a sighting by a member of the public three days after she vanished. A shopper, who had seen the teenager’s face on the front page of yesterday’s Daily Mail, recognised her as she walked around Ilford in east London yesterday. The story was also prominently displayed on the MailOnline website. Ella’s parents had made an emotional appeal for help in finding her after she disappeared on Monday close to the Ilford clinic where she was being treated. Last night her mother Alison, 43, wrote online: ‘Thank you so, so much to everyone who has helped us search for Ella. She has been found in London and we are on our way to see her. 'We will never forget the support and kindness that we have received. ‘The advertising and awareness campaign worked.’ Speaking from the family home in Colchester, she added: ‘We are so thankful for the coverage and thank the Daily Mail. You have been brilliant.’ Her father, Tim, 43, added: ‘We really appreciate it.’ Ella was spotted ‘wandering aimlessly’ around Ilford during the late morning yesterday and the member of the public called police. She was quickly picked up by an officer who took her to the police station on the high street before her parents collected her. A market trader said: ‘She looked sheepish and a bit disorientated while walking with the police. I didn’t know who she was at the time and I thought she had been caught shoplifting because she was very pale.’ One policeman involved in the case said: ‘It’s great news that she’s been found as sometimes you don’t get a happy ending with these type of cases. Scroll down for video . Ella was found after she was spotted by a member of the public in Ilford town centre . 'I heard a member of the public saw her in town after looking at the front page of a paper and immediately rang it in. She was a bit fragile but nothing was wrong with her. God knows where she’s been.' Ella had been receiving treatment at the clinic for six weeks. A keen rower and ballroom dancer, the teenager, who attends Gilberd Secondary School in Colchester, was described as gregarious, lively and confident. But her parents said she had become depressed, which had made her anxious and nervous. Ella’s Facebook page suggested she had split from a boyfriend who had found a new love. Ella's mother Alison (left) urged anyone who had . seen her daughter to 'please get in touch'. The teenager's father Tim . (right) described her as 'confident and outgoing' Around the time she was admitted to the residential care unit at the start of October, Ella left a series of emotional messages on Twitter. ‘The higher I get, the lower I sink. I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim,’ she wrote. She also said: ‘I long for that feeling to not feel at all.’ Hours before she vanished on Monday she wrote online: ‘I just want to die and hopefully that will happen so I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning.’ Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police were appealing for assistance to trace Ella Hysom, who went missing from an address in Ilford on Monday, 11 November. 'The 15-year-old has since been found safe and well. We would like to thank the media and members of the public for their assistance.’","Teenager was reunited with her relieved mother and father yesterday .

"By . Jack Doyle . and Ryan Kisiel . and Sam Webb . Legal proceedings over the aborted deportation of an African migrant who lured a vulnerable schoolgirl to a house for sex have cost the British taxpayer £350,000 - and he may now receive tens of thousands in compensation. Jumaa Kater Saleh, 24, was convicted as part of a predatory sex gang for the ‘deliberate, targeted abuse of a young and vulnerable girl’, who was aged 13 at the time. But he was allowed to remain in Britain under human rights law because he faced mistreatment if sent back to Sudan. Jumaa Kater Saleh, 24, who arrived in the UK in November 2004 hidden in a lorry, cannot be deported because he is part of a 'persecuted tribe' in Sudan . He claimed he was a member of the Zaghawa tribe, which has been persecuted by government forces and Arab tribe militia. His trial cost an estimated £100,000, his asylum support costs drained the public purse of £20,000 and it cost more than £200,000 to keep him detained, firstly in jail and then in an immigration centre. The Sunday Telegraph reported the total cost of interpreters alone was £25,000. Details of the case emerged as Saleh . went to court to demand compensation from the Government for locking him . up. He claimed he was unlawfully detained following his prison . sentence, when he was kept behind bars to protect the public. HIs case was thrown out in January but the Court of Appeal has now ruled that eight months of his detention was unlawful. Deputy High Court judge Philip Mott QC rejected Saleh's claim, but the decision has been overturned . The judges decided he was entitled to . compensation as a result of Home Office administrative delays before it . was decided that he could not be deported on human rights grounds. The decision has . sparked outrage. The father of Saleh’s victim called the decision 'crazy' and said his daughter would never be free of what happened to her. He said: 'He was a paedophile preying on young girls, yet he was only locked up for two years. What does he have to be compensated for? 'The worst of it is that as taxpayers, me and her mother are paying for him to go through the court system and then we’ll end up contributing through our taxes to any compensation he gets – the man who did this to our girl.' Tory MP Peter Bone added: ‘I take the very simple view . that if someone comes to this country and then breaks the law then he . should be sent back to where he comes from. 'Any arguments about his . human rights disappear when he has violated, violently, the rights of a . young girl.’ Saleh arrived in the UK in November . 2004 hidden in the back of a lorry. In January 2005 he claimed asylum . but this was rejected. However, because he was under 18, he was allowed . to remain until he reached adulthood in October 2006. He was still in the country in May . 2007, when arrested and charged with the sex offences. In February 2008, . he was convicted of two charges of sexual activity with a 13-year-old . girl. He was in a group of five immigrants who lured schoolgirls – . including three aged 13 and one aged 14 – to a house for sex. The judge at the trial had remarked . that all three girls were ‘clearly disturbed and vulnerable, far from . mature for their years and had been targeted by the group’. Saleh was . jailed for four years on the basis that the offences were planned and . that he knew the girl’s age. The judge also recommended him for . deportation. However, at the end of his sentence . immigration officials deemed that he should not be released as they . tried to deport him ‘for the public good’. He was let out in May 2011 . after it was decided that he would face persecution if returned to . Sudan, under protection against ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ and . risk to life. He now lives in Leicester. Saleh was a member of the Zaghawa tribe, which was subject to widespread persecution (not pictured here) Ruling against him in January, deputy High Court judge Philip Mott QC said he had not been unlawfully detained. The judge, sitting at the High Court . in London, accepted that Saleh was a member of the Zaghawa and so it was . ‘not possible’ to return him to Sudan. But he ruled there was no evidence of . Saleh being held unlawfully or unreasonably at any time and his case . failed ‘on all grounds’. The judge said: ‘It was deliberate, . targeted abuse of a young and vulnerable girl. The risk that the . claimant, in his early-20s, would commit a further sexual offence if . released… had to be considered as substantial.' A Home Office spokesman said it was 'disappointed' and is looking at all its options over the Court of Appeal's decision. He added: 'We believe it is right that dangerous individuals are kept in detention, wherever possible, in order to protect the public. 'We will continue to seek to deport individuals who show a complete disregard for the laws of this country.'

"By . James Slack . and Ryan Kisiel . A key ally of Ed Miliband provoked fury yesterday by blaming the ‘rhetoric’ of the Conservative Party for the brutal killing of a young Italian immigrant. Hannes Swoboda claimed the anti-immigrant language used by government ministers ‘is now leading to murder in the streets of Britain’. The Austrian, who is president of the Socialists and Democrats Group of MEPs in the European Parliament – which includes Britain’s Labour Party – was commenting on the killing of Joele Leotta. Hannes Swoboda has been told to apologise, after being accused of politicising the murder of Italian waiter Joele Leotta in Kent . He also attempted to blame Ukip for . the attack on the 20-year-old, who was beaten to death in Maidstone, . Kent, last Sunday, only a few days after arriving in Britain. Four . men from Lithuania have been charged with his murder. A police officer . investigating the attack told journalists at Medway Magistrates’ Court . that it was not motivated by racial tensions or jobs. Tory . MEP Martin Callanan, who leads the Conservative group in Brussels, . said: ‘To attribute blame for this tragic murder to the British . government’s crackdown on illegal immigration is exceptionally low. Hannes Swoboda should apologise for politicising a tragedy.’ Senior . Tory figures were mystified by Mr Swoboda’s remarks, which followed . speculation in the Italian media that Mr Leotta’s attackers accused him . of ‘stealing English jobs’. Joele Leotta hoped that coming to the UK would help him improve his English . In . a press release, he said: ‘The xenophobic, aggressive climate inflamed . by populists such as Ukip and by the rhetoric of the Conservatives in . government is now leading to murder in the streets of Britain. ‘Campaigns . such as vans with slogans telling immigrants to “go home” and . continuous negative rhetoric against foreigners – including EU citizens – . are creating an ugly mood in Britain, which has long prided itself on . being an open-minded and tolerant nation.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage has written to Mr Swodoba demanding he withdraw the statement. ‘Hannes . Swoboda is so blinded by hate against people who do not support this . view of full political union in the EU that he levels accusations . without checking the facts,’ he said. ‘In . common with all decent and right-thinking people I am concerned, as . should Mr Swoboda, with the rise of EU nationals committing crime in the . UK.’ Under pressure to . condemn Mr Swodoba, a Labour Party spokesman said: ‘These comments are . deplorable and we do not support them. Hannes Swoboda does not speak for . the Labour Party.’ Mr . Leotta had come to the UK to improve his English and only arrived here . on October 14. He was sharing a flat with a friend and had found a job . in an Italian restaurant. But . on Sunday night a group of men are said to have kicked down the door to . the flat before launching a savage attack on Mr Leotta and his friend. Doctors were unable to save him, but his friend, Alex Galbiati is believed to be recovering in hospital. Mr . Swoboda is a senior ally of Mr Miliband and was invited to speak . alongside the Labour leader at the party’s annual conference last year.

Faye Campbell, 21, only eats junk food - she has never eaten fruit or vegetables. Despite her poor diet, she is a size ten and weighs just 9st 12lb . She . says she has survived on a diet of cheeseburgers, pizza and chips. The . only ‘fruit’ she consumes is the flavouring in sugary fizzy drinks. But remarkably, despite her junk food diet, Miss Campbell, who is 5ft 8in tall, weighs just  9st 12lb. The . care worker, who lives in Stowmarket, Suffolk, was an extremely fussy . eater as a child. At her wits’ end, her mother Carolyn took her to the . doctor after failed attempts to hide vegetables in her meals. She . was apparently diagnosed with the digestive disorder gastroesophageal . reflux. The condition, which causes chronic indigestion and heartburn, . meant she was left in agony after eating. Miss Campbell developed a phobia of . food because of a painful digestive disorder she suffered from as a . child. Until she was 15 she only ate chips . Miss Campbell said: 'The thought of eating vegetables or any sort of fruit just makes me feel physically sick. Even putting them near my mouth terrifies me' But, . although it was possible to cure this, doctors found she had developed . lachanophobia – an extremely rare anxiety triggered by eating . vegetables. It is only after seeing a child psychologist that she started to eat foods such as pizza, burgers and cheese. Miss . Campbell said: ‘The thought of eating vegetables or any sort of fruit . just makes me feel physically sick. Even putting them near my mouth . terrifies me. ‘If mum is . cooking a roast dinner with vegetables I have to go into a different . room because I can’t stand the smell. 'Sometimes I have to open all the . windows to get rid of it. My family wish I could sit with them and have a . meal together, but I just can’t.’ Miss Campbell (pictured with her sister, Lauren) will leave the room if her mother is cooking vegetables as she cannot bear the smell - sometimes she has to open the windows to get rid of it . Miss Campbell's diet now consists of toast for breakfast, a large pizza from Dominos for lunch and cheeseburgers for dinner. She eats potatoes - if they're served as chips or waffles - and she can handle fruit - if it comes in fizzy drink form - but just the smell of any other vegetable is enough to turn her stomach . Miss Campbell (pictured at the age of six) had gastroesophageal reflux as a child. The condition, which causes chronic indigestion and heartburn, meant she was left in agony after eating . Miss Campbell (pictured with her sister, Lauren) said: 'I still can't bring myself to eat a roast or a home-made lasagne. It took me a good couple of years to get used to the other foods and I'm still fussy with that' Miss Campbell (pictured as a baby) has, amazingly, avoided ill health despite her poor diet . Miss Campbell (pictured aged five) said: 'I would like to eat like a normal person, but until I can overcome my phobia of food, then that day won't happen for a long time' Miss . Campbell’s typical day starts with toast for breakfast, a large . high-calorie pizza from Domino’s take-away for lunch and frozen . cheeseburgers with chips for dinner. She can only eat potatoes if they are served as waffles or chips and until she was 15 they were her sole diet. Miss . Campbell says her strange eating habits have also affected her love . life with many romantic dates being swapped from expensive restaurants . for McDonald’s.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health Supplements Information . Service, said: ‘This lady is risking her health with such a restricted . diet. ‘The total lack of . fruit and vegetables is worrying as these provide essential nutrients, . such as vitamin C, for immune function support, vitamin A, for eyesight, . potassium for blood pressure control. And magnesium and calcium, for . healthy bones. ‘People with low intakes of fruit and vegetables have a higher risk of cancer, particularly bowel cancer, and heart disease.’","Faye Campbell, 21, will only eat pizza, chips and cheeseburgers .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Headteacher Susan Papas has become the victim of abuse after improving lateness and discipline at the school . A headteacher who was sent in to transform a failing primary has become the victim of a hate campaign after she asked parents to stop smoking at the school gates. Susan Papas was asked to take over Selsdon Primary School after it was heavily criticised by Ofsted inspectors. But after improving lateness and discipline, she received a barrage of anonymous abuse from parents - including a petition entitled Get The B****es Out, aimed at her and her female deputy. Mrs Papas, 53, arrived at the South London school in September after the local authority was impressed how she vastly improved the results of a nearby primary. After a few weeks, she ‘respectfully’ asked parents to refrain from smoking outside the school’s gates, ‘as some may see this as setting a bad example’. Mrs Papas also kept parents informed about other issues on her online blog, but said she started receiving abusive messages after inviting a fellow parent to sell cakes priced between 10p and 20p to pupils as a treat at break-time on Fridays. A group of parents have allegedly now threatened to smoke in a ‘picket line’ outside the school gates. They had also vowed in online messages to ‘smash up the van’ the parent sold the cakes from after they were branded ‘unhealthy’. Mrs Papas, 53, said she was shocked when she saw the petition and did not expect it at the school, because it was much more ‘middle-class’ than the one she ran before. She said: ‘I was prepared for some resistance but not the nastiness and threats. I just want to make sure the children do well. 'All this unpleasantness is a handful of parents. I think for a long time they have been allowed to bully the other parents, so it was time to take a stand. 'When this happened it did make me initially think “why am I doing this?”, but I’m quite stubborn. ‘This problem needs to be resolved. We promote responsible behaviour and I would not tolerate bullying from the pupils or my staff so why should I from some of the parents? 'I think the best way to deal with bullying is to expose it and have it discussed out in the open. That is why I put it on the blog. ‘I think any parent has the right to smoke. However, I asked parents not to outside the school gates as it’s a narrow road and a lot of other parents who were arriving with buggies were complaining about the smoke they could not escape. ‘Some of my methods, like discipline, have been viewed as old-fashioned, but it is done in a forward-thinking way to better the school.’ The anonymous petition was brought into school after one was put through the letterbox of a teacher’s home. Parents of pupils at Selsdon Primary School in South London have launched a campaign of abuse after being asked to refrain from smoking at the school's gates . Some parents have also complained they have received them through their doors overnight. Despite the abuse, Mrs Papas said she had no intention of closing the online blog, which has been popular at her former school, Heavers Farm Primary, in South Norwood, where she remains executive head. Since she took over Heavers Farm in 2007 it has rocketed up Croydon borough’s league table and is one of the top performing schools in the area. In her drive to improve Selsdon primary quickly, Mrs Papas introduced lunchtime detentions for children who turned up late for classes, forgot their PE kit, misbehaved or did not complete their work to the correct standard in lessons. She said school tardiness had dropped by a half once parents realised that for every minute their child was late they would spend two minutes in detention. Sabrina Howes, 28, who now smokes away from the school while waiting for her child to finish for the day, said: ‘The new head has only been here for a few weeks and things are already so much better. ‘My little boy got a detention for doing one sentence in 20 minutes. I know he can do more than that. 'He hasn’t done it since because he knows if he doesn’t do his work, he’s staying in at lunchtime. ‘He’s only seven, he’s probably a bit too young to understand, but it has worked. I didn’t realise how bad some of the parents were until all this came out.’","Susan Papas was sent to Selsdon Primary School in South London to improve standards .

"By . Gerard Couzens . The kidnappers who held Carlos Tevez's father hostage for eight hours told him: 'Your son's our idol but we need the money.' According to Segundo Tevez they were also upset when they heard the former Premier League star had been left out of Argentina's World Cup squad. Detectives were today hunting the gang as a video emerged of the moment the kidnappers targeted delivery driver Segundo. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Close: Carlos Tevz posted this photo with the man he calls dad Segundo (right) on Twitter in March . The car used by the kidnappers was found abandoned in El Palomar, a Buenos Aires suburb . They . forced him out of his car at gunpoint and decided to kidnap him on the . spur of the moment after checking the vehicle's papers and spotting the . surname Tevez. They . captured him a couple of streets away from where they had held him up . early this yesterday morning as he tried to find a taxi in the Buenos . Aires suburb of Moron. CCTV . footage now being examined by police show the men turning right at a . crossroads in a white Volkswagen Passat to follow Segundo's black Dodge . Journey. A second take - where Carlos's dad has . already been kidnapped - shows the Passat following the crossover estate . with a member of the kidnap gang now inside. CCTV footage shows the men turning right at a crossroads in a white Volkswagen Passat . The gang demanded nearly £300,000 to free Segundo - who raised Carlos from the age of five after his mum abandoned him and his birth dad was shot dead. However, they settled for around £30,000 after Tevez, who led negotiations from Italy, said he would pay no more and the kidnap drama was leaked to the press. Segundo was freed just before 2pm local time yesterday after the ransom money was handed over at a third drop-off point the kidnappers gave so they could create confusion and escape the police net. Tevez's father told police afterwards his abductors had said: 'Carlos is our idol. 'He's the greatest there is. We don't want to hurt him. Why would we? The Argentine Secretary for Security, Sergio Berni, confirms to the press that Segundo Tevez, father of the Carlos Tevez, has been released by his kidnappers . 'The problem is we've got children and we need the money. We haven't got any alternative.' 'We hope he forgives us.' They also gave him a drink and biscuits at a petrol station they stopped at to refuel. Argentina's security secretary Sergio Berni last night promised a no-holds-barred hunt for the kidnap gang. He said: 'We're going to look for them under beds if we have to and we're going to find them. 'Believe me when I'll say that's what we'll do and it's not just because it's Carlos Tevez's dad.' Confirming the three culprits thought to be involved were not part of a professional kidnap gang, he added: 'At the beginning they stole his car and let him go. 'They returned for him after realising it was Carlos's dad. CCTV captures kidnappers in white car following Carlos Tevez' father in the black car before he was grabbed . 'Obviously we're not talking about a professional kidnap gang. We're confident we will catch them.' Tevez, who signed for Italian side Juventus in June 2013 after successful spells at West Ham, Man United and Man City, confirmed his father was okay late last night night in his first comments since the dramatic kidnap. He took to Twitter to say: 'I thank everyone for their support. I want to let you know my father is well, safe and sound. That's the most important thing.' He added in a later Tweet: 'With the sadness I feel it would be easy to criticise my country, but with its all its defects and virtues it's the country I love.' Tevez's biological father died in a shootout in Fuerte Apache, the run-down Buenos Aires slum where the footballer grew up, when he was just five. Tevez's biological father died in a shootout in Fuerte Apache, the run-down Buenos Aires slum where the footballer grew up, when he was just five . His mother Fabiana abandoned him when he was just six months old and he ended up being brought up by her brother Segundo, who he calls dad and shares a surname with. Earlier this year Tevez expressed his admiration for his adoptive father in a poignant Twitter message on his birthday, writing: 'You showed me how to be a man. 'My sadness is yours and my achievements your satisfaction. I love you old man. Happy birthday.'Tevez is said to send Segundo money every month and paid for his other children to watch him play at the World Cup in south Africa in 2010. His relationship with the only brother by birth he maintained a friendship with, Juan Alberto, was strained after he was arrested for holding up a security van while his millionaire sibling played for Man United. Express kidnappings, where hostages are taken for a short amount of time and a low ransom, have grown more common in recent years in Argentina as the country's living standards have dropped. The country, once one of the world's richest, is now dangerously close to defaulting on its external debt payments. Cristian Riquelme, brother of former Spanish La Liga star Roman, was kidnapped in Argentina in 2002 when he was just 17. He was released after his family paid half of a £175,000 ransom demand. Former Barcelona star Gabriel Milito's dad Jorge was snatched in the same year and released only after his family paid nearly £8,000.","Segundo Tevez was held hostage for eight hours yesterday .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Former cocaine addict and alcoholic Diego Maradona has set alarm bells ringing after a slurring speech to journalists outside a restaurant in Argentina. The soccer legend spoke at snail's pace and repeated himself as he appeared to struggle to finish his sentences after a restaurant meal with ex Veronica Ojeda. Maradona, who dumped his former girlfriend four months before she gave birth to their 18-month-old son Diego Fernando, is said to be heading for a reunion with the PE teacher. Scroll down for video . Diego Maradona, speaking to journalists outside a restaurant in Buenos Aires, where he appeared to be slurring and struggled to finish his sentences . Mr Maradona spoke out to criticise an arsonist suspected of starting a blaze which destroyed part of his dad's home, saying it was the work of a 'sick person' But it was his apparent state of intoxication outside Buenos Aires eatery El Corralon that caught the headlines as much as his tangled love life. Diego, 53, spoke out to criticise an arsonist suspected of starting a blaze which destroyed part of his father's home, saying it was the work of a 'sick person'. His impromptu speech sparked concern among fans who took to Twitter to voice their worry. One, Gonzalo Armagno, wrote: 'Cocaine destroys brain. Look at poor Maradona.' Another, Cecilia Molina, said: 'Shame on the person who got him hooked on cocaine.' The retired footballer's daughter Dalma, a staunch critic of Veronica Ojeda, even reacted to the furore by retweeting messages from fans and admitting she felt ashamed at the furore. One of her retweeted messages read: 'How bad Maradona looks. Hadn't he stopped drinking with Veronica Ojeda?' Another said: 'What's that woman with your dad doing by letting him speak. And she says she looks after him!!!' His impromptu speech sparked concern among fans who took to Twitter to voice their worry . Maradona is said to be heading for a reunion with his former girlfriend, who he has a 18-month-old son with . Mr Maradona was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after testing positive for cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983. He suffered a heart attack following a cocaine overdose in April 2004 and was admitted to intensive care in a Buenos Aires hospital. He underwent a stomach reduction op the following year in Cartagena, Colombia. In March 2007 he was re-admitted to hospital in Argentina and treated for hepatitis and the effects of alcohol abuse and ended up being treated in a psychiatric clinic specialising in alcohol-related problems. Soon after his discharge in May 2007, he appeared on Argentine television and said he had quit drinking and not used drugs in two and a half years. Before his dinner date with Veronica Ojeda, his girlfriend of eight years, Mr Maradona was linked to a pretty young journalism student after she published snaps of them together on her Instagram account. The 25-year-old blonde later denied rumours they were a couple, insisting they were only friends and she would never date 'a person of the age of my dad.' Maradona with his ex-girlfriend Veronica Ojeda, pictured in 2012, who he had been dining with before speaking to reporters outside the restaurant in Buenos Aires . The woman Mr Maradona dumped Veronica for, 24-year-old Rocio Oliva, is currently fighting extradition after the former footballer accused her of stealing more than £200,000 worth of valuables from his home in Dubai. Former womens' footballer Rocio was arrested at Buenos Aires' international airport earlier this month as she returned from Brazil where she watched the World Cup final. The blonde, who Maradona dumped at the start of the year following an argument over Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, insists she has done nothing wrong. Argentine papers say Veronica Ojeda, pictured kissing Mr Maradona at the end of their restaurant meal on Saturday, is considering moving to Dubai where the former footballer is now based. They are reportedly spending time together at her mansion near Buenos Aires' international airport. A friend of Mr Maradona's said: 'They are back together. Diego is renting a house in an upmarket neighbourhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires but hardly ever goes there and is spending all his time at Veronica's place. 'They still haven't made a decision about Dubai but they are talking about returning there together.'","Former footballer spoke at a snail's pace and struggled to finish sentences .

They were left with post-traumatic stress caused by their ordeal, a state lawyer claimed. Yesterday, 15 Spanish men took the witness stand as defendants. State prosecutors are indicting one for Mr Mallon’s homicide, one for assault with a dangerous weapon and 13 for affray. Prosecutors acting for his family in a parallel private prosecution are seeking homicide convictions for two of the 15.

Miguel Jimenez Martin, brother of the man accused of Mr Mallon’s homicide, told the court most of the 30 Spaniards outside the disco-bar were not involved in the violence. He added: ‘My brother defended himself from the older Brit after he attacked him. I saw a scuffle and then the foreigner disappeared.’ State prosecutors want Jose Ivan Jimenez Martin sentenced to 12 years in prison if convicted.Private prosecutors want him jailed for 15 years, along with a second man accused of attacking Mr Mallon with a bottle.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Spain is facing another formal complaint over Gibraltar after its police invaded British waters off the Rock to arrest three suspected cigarette smugglers. Two Royal Navy vessels were called in after a Civil Guard boat ignored a Royal Gibraltar Police patrol’s warnings to leave the area. A spat between the two sides - around midday yesterday- ended with a Spanish officer suffering back and neck injuries. Dispute: Two Royal Navy vessels were called to Gibraltar after a Civil Guard boat ignored a warning from a Royal Gibraltar Police patrol (pictured) to leave the area . The Guardia Civil today claimed the Royal Gibraltar Police vessel had rammed the suspected smugglers’ boat as it was piloted to a Spanish port by the injured Civil Guard. A Royal Gibraltar police spokesman said . there had been a verbal exchange but denied any contact with the Spanish . Civil Guard vessel or the suspected smugglers’ boat. The latest incident came just a day after a Spanish Navy ship invaded British waters around the Rock. The Royal Navy’s HMS Scimitar ordered the vessel out of the area in a tense radio exchange. Britain is expected to file a formal complaint to Spain over both incursions. Anger: The Foreign Office is expected to make another complaint to Spain's Ambassador to the UK, Federico Trillo (pictured), over the incursions . The Foreign Office summoned Spain’s Ambassador to the UK at the start of the month after a research vessel unlawfully entered British waters off Gibraltar. Foreign Office officials later revealed Spain has made almost 600 illegal incursions in just 14 months. It prompted MPs to demand a Royal Navy frigate be permanently based in Gibraltar as a deterrent. Gibraltarians who want London to get tougher with Madrid last night called for Spanish boats that disobey maritime law to be sunk. A group which pens online newsletter Gibraltar Messenger wrote: 'Gibraltar needs to have its own special boat squadron and to warn Madrid that it considers any incursion an act of war and aggression, and the next time it occurs they will be fired upon, and if necessary arrested or sunk.' 'The incursions into British Gibraltar’s territorial waters by Spanish military, customs and other vessels of the state are under international maritime law an act of war and need to be treated as acts of war,' the group added. Gibraltar claims three nautical miles around the Rock as its own. Spain insists the waters outside of Gibraltar’s port belong to them.","Two Royal Navy vessels called after Civil Guard boat enters British waters .

"By . Mark Duell . and Paul Bentley . and Gerard Couzens . Detectives from Scotland Yard have used a helicopter in a fresh search for Madeleine McCann ahead of crucial excavation work in the holiday resort where she vanished. After Scotland Yard detectives met with Portuguese authorities, an Alouette helicopter scoured the Praia da Luz coast on an apparent reconnaissance mission. Military photographers, who were accompanied by British policemen, took pictures of the beach and key sites in the resort where detectives plan to dig for clues in the coming days. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Local media said six Scotland Yard officials, including two forensics experts, had landed in Faro . Team of six: Detectives from Scotland Yard have arrived in Portugal to help with site excavations . Madeleine went missing as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. Aerial view: Specialist officers are expected to examine several sites in Praia da Luz after permission to dig was granted by Portuguese authorities, seven years after Maddie went missing from the area aged three . The preparatory work began amid ongoing tensions between British and Portuguese authorities over the cold case inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance seven years ago. A team of Scotland Yard detectives flew in to the country on Wednesday and later met with their counterparts for four hours. It is thought they have requested permission to question eight crucial witnesses after being given the green light to excavate key sites yards from where Madeleine was last seen on May 3, 2007. They have already had requests rejected by the Policia Judiciaria, however, including plans to raid homes of some of the prime suspects in the case. Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said yesterday: 'There are always going to be complications when you have got one police force in one country working with the police force of another. Arrival: Local media said six Scotland Yard officials, including two forensics experts, had landed in Faro . Team of six: Detectives from Scotland Yard have arrived in Portugal to help with site excavations . Investigation: . Local media reported that Scotland Yard has asked to speak with eight . witnesses considered 'relevant' to the long-running case, in a letter . sent to the Portuguese attorney general's office . Discussions: After almost two years of delicate negotiations, Scotland Yard has been given permission to start digging at sites surrounding the holiday resort in Praia da Luz where the youngster disappeared . Difficulties: The arrival of the team from Britain comes as tensions with the Portuguese authorities escalated . 'We have both got to be sensitive to these things. 'The critical thing is, as Madeleine's parents have said and we all support, is that they need to have some closure on this, they need to know what happened to their daughter.' A Portuguese Air Force helicopter was seen circling over Praia da Luz on Thursday afternoon. During a 15-minute flyover, aerial photographs were taken over the beach and the areas surrounding the Ocean Club resort where Madeleine was holidaying with her twin siblings and their parents Gerry and Kate. It is thought the reconnaissance exercise was commissioned by the Scotland Yard team on the ground, which is being led by detective chief inspector Andy Redwood. They flew over key areas expected to be dug up for clues in the coming days, including a large wasteland just yards from the Ocean Club complex. Search site: The waste ground in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Scotland Yard officers will join local police officers in digging as part of the investigation . Abroad: Specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across Praia da Luz - including this waste ground near the Ocean Club apartment complex . The digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster's body or remains . This land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance . Using radar equipment and mechanical diggers, officers will also search an area beside the beach and roads by the Our Lady of the Light church where Madeleine's parents prayed after she vanished. While British detectives instigated the new searches and will cover the huge costs, it is thought they will not be able to take part in the excavation work. Scotland Yard officers will, though, be on hand to supervise. Among the team are experts trained to detect bodies. Operation Grange was set up in 2011 to investigate Madeleine's disappearance after David Cameron ordered Scotland Yard to review all the evidence in the case. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished. She is due to turn 11 on Monday. The Met Police said it was not prepared to provide a 'running commentary' on the inquiry. Three former staff members at the Ocean Club are considered ‘people of interest’ by the inquiry. Analysis . of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her . abduction and were in contact in the hours that followed. One theory is that burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching Maddie when she woke up. Met detectives reportedly requested the men’s bank details and asked local officers to quiz the trio and search their homes. But the judge who dealt with the requests ‘did not consider Scotland Yard’s arguments valid’, local sources said. Resort: British police will dig three sites near the Ocean Club holiday apartments in the resort of Praia da Luz in Portugal, from where Madeleine McCann, then three, went missing in May 2007 . Detectives are also said to be preparing to dig up a site on a beach near the Ocean Club apartments . Madeleine's parents Gerry, 45, and Kate McCann, 46, attended a prayer service for on Saturday . Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed . Map: British police are expected to excavate two sites near the Ocean Club and one near Praia Da Luz beach . British detectives have since expressed their growing frustration at the length of time the probe is taking. At . the weekend Mr and Mrs McCann thanked the public for their . unstinting support at a prayer service on the seventh anniversary of her . disappearance. The couple . were joined by about 100 well-wishers, friends and relatives for a . low-key open-air service in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire. It saw candles being lit for all children around the world who have been taken away from their parents against their will. They . also spoke of the family's gratitude that the Metropolitan Police . investigation was now moving on to a ‘very active’ phase.

"By . Gerard Couzens . A British adventure-seeker on a round-the-world cycle trip has died after being hit by a 4x4 in Bolivia while her husband tailed her a few metres behind. Sharon Bridgman, 38, died instantly after being struck by the Toyota Land Cruiser on a dirt track near the world's largest salt flats - the famous Uyuni - in the south west of the country close to the border with Chile. She and husband Tim, from Zeal Monachorum near Okehampton, Devon, were nearly two years into a fundraising cycle trip for Cornwall-based disaster relief charity ShelterBox spanning 32 countries across three continents. Horror: Sharon Bridgman was killed after being hit by a 4x4 in Bolivia while taking part in a round-the-world charity cycle ride with her husband Tim . Tragedy: The 38-year-old died instantly after being struck by the Toyota Land Cruiser on a dirt track near the world's largest salt flats while her husband tailed around 200 metres behind . The couple were on the 19,000 mile-leg of the trip from south America to north Alaska when charity worker Sharon was struck from behind and knocked off her bike, just after 4.30pm on Saturday. The unnamed Bolivian man involved in the accident was arrested at the scene and is now in custody awaiting a court appearance. A local police spokesman said the accident happened after Sharon swerved to the left and caught the him by surprise. Last night members of Okehampton Cycling Club, which the couple have belonged to for nearly a decade, spoke of their shock at the news. Thumbs up: Mr and Mrs Bridgman pictured in Argentina last year at the start of their 19,000 mile-leg of the trip from south America to north Alaska which they were part-way through when she died . The couple, from Zeal Monachorum near Okehampton, Devon, were nearly two years into a fundraising cycle trip for Cornwall-based disaster relief charity ShelterBox spanning 32 countries across three continents . Club chairman Robert Szembek said: 'I only found out about the tragedy yesterday and am still in a state of shock. 'Everyone was following an Internet blog they were writing and they appeared to be having a great time and making lots of new friends. 'They'd already done what I would describe as some of the more dangerous countries on their route through Africa without any real problems. 'Tim had his bike stolen at one point and had to have a replacement flown out but that was the worst thing that had happened. 'My heart goes out to him. I haven't been able to talk to him but it goes without saying that he must be suffering immensely.' A friend added: 'They'd been cycling virtually non-stop since June 2012 but were going to break their journey in early July to come back to Britain for a friend's wedding. 'I don't know what he'll do now. All we've been told is that Sharon has been killed but we don't really know any more details than that.' The couple, pictured in Ushuaia in southern Argentina, were on the 19,000 mile-leg from south America to north Alaska when the charity worker was struck and knocked off her bike just after 4.30pm on Saturday . Adventurers: Mrs Bridgman wife her carpenter husband Tim in Nordkapp, Norway, on June 4, 2012, the first day of their rouind-the-world trip . Carpenter Tim set off with his wife from Nordkapp in Norway on June 4 2012. They cycled nearly 16,000 miles through 23 countries in Europe and Africa including Turkey, Egypt, Sudan and war-torn Ethiopia before arriving in Cape Agulhas in South Africa last November. They then took a plane to Ushuaia in southern Argentina to start their 19,000 mile ride, called the 'North to North cycle tour', to northern Alaska. Sharon, who did most of the writing, told in a diary entry on their travel blog posted just five days before Sunday's tragedy how they had spent a night on the outskirts of Chilean capital Santiago with firefighters before heading to meet a friend they had made earlier on their trip. She joked how Tim was taunted by a mosquito 'that had been on a three-week diet and was trying to catch up on many missed meals' in a farewell sign-off. Describing a hair-raising moment in an April 2013 post, written near the Ethiopian town of Sodo, Tim told how around 50 kids ran alongside them on a dirt track trying to grab their belongings from their bike and throwing stones at them. 'He must be suffering immensely': Mr Bridgman (pictured in Chile this year) is understood to be receiving support from British diplomats . He wrote: 'We were close to the edge of town when one hit Sharon on the head. 'It was the last straw. We stopped and tried explaining our thoughts to the adults but they just smiled and shrugged their shoulders. 'It was like riding through wild animals.' Sharon, who rode from Land's End to John O'Groats with her husband in 2005, had to give up impact sports several years ago because of serious back problems. The problems forced her to take seven months off work in 2007 and she had several spinal injections to help ease the pain. Speaking shortly before they set out, Tim said: 'Standing for a long period of time is still a problem but cycling seems to be the one thing that is okay. 'With determination and incredible support from family and friends over the years it has become managable enough to do this trip.' Ready to go: Mr and Mrs Bridgman arrive in Ushuaia, Argentina, to start their 19,000-mile ride, called the 'North to North cycle tour' to northern Alaska . Local police chief Marcelo Tejerina confirmed: 'Mrs Bridgman died just after 4pm on Saturday local time after being hit by a Toyota Land Cruiser driven by a Bolivian man on a dirt track near Villamar, around 125 miles south of Uyuni. She was killed instantly. 'Her husband who was cycling around 200 metres behind was unhurt. 'The driver stopped and called police. He has now been arrested and his vehicle impounded which is standard practice after a fatal road accident and he is in custody awaiting a court appearance scheduled to take place later today. 'Both the driver and the tourist were travelling in the same direction from Villamar to Uyuni and were about 125 miles from the Chilean border. 'Mrs Bridgman appears to have swerved to the left for reasons that are unclear and taken the driver by surprise.' British diplomats are understood to be assisting Mr Bridgman. His wife's body has been flown to the Bolivian capital La Paz ahead of its repatriation to the UK. The city of Uyuni is a major tourist draw for holidaymakers visiting the nearby salt flat, which sits near the top of the Andes at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level. It is the world's largest salt flat, covering more than 4,000 square miles and containing up to 70 per cent of the world's lithium reserves. At the time of her death, Sharon and her husband had raised just over £1,000 of their £10,000 target for ShelterBox. The charity provides emergency shelter and vital supplies to support communities around the world overwhelmed by disaster and humanitarian crisis. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Bolivia on April 26. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'","Sharon Bridgman died instantly in crash near the world's largest salt flats .

"By . Gerard Couzens . A Spanish biker has filed a formal complaint over a traffic accident involving Michael Schumacher weeks before the F1 star’s horror ski crash. Schumacher is accused of knocking the motorcyclist off his bike after failing to give way at a roundabout in Bormujos near Seville. The unnamed Spaniard is claiming compensation for the broken wrist he suffered and damage to a watch, his clothes and his motorbike in the accident on November 17 last year. Michael Schumacher is being sued by a Spanish motorcyclist after the F1 star allegedly knocked him off his bike when failing to give way at a roundabout while driving an Audi rental car weeks before his ski accident . Schumacher, who has been named in the complaint along with the company that hired him the rented Audi A4 he was driving and its insurers, has been in a medically-induced coma since suffering a head injury in a French Alps fall on December 29 last year. A trial will only take place if insurers contest the claim and the 45-year-old German would not be obliged to attend. Police have said in their accident report the seven-time F1 champion, who was on a private visit to Spain, failed to respect his alleged victim's right of way. Poor lighting on the approach to the roundabout has also been blamed. Last week, Schumacher's family were given the smashed helmet he wore on the day of his ski accident. Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) has been in a medically-induced coma since suffering a head injury while skiing in the French Alps on December 29 last year . Doctors caring for him have rebutted claims his injuries may have been worsened because the helicopter that took him from the ski resort of Meribel to Grenoble hospital made a stopover at a smaller hospital en route. Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has said Michael is making progress. She said at the start of the month: 'He shows moments of consciousness and awakening. 'We are on his side, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble, and we keep remaining confident.' She also rubbished claims his wife Corinna had plans to build a medical suite for him at their Swiss home.","F1 star accused of hitting biker after failing to give way on roundabout .

"By . Gerard Couzens . This is the moment British gap year student Henry Miller introduces himself at a tribal ceremony where he took the hallucinogenic drink that cost him his life. Henry, . 19, from Bristol, took yagé – which induces vivid hallucinations – while taking part in a tribal ritual in remote rainforest for the second time in two days. Moments before, he was filmed telling other tourists: 'I'm from England, my name's Henry. Moments before: Bristol-born Henry Miller, 19, is captured telling a fellow participant he doesn't know what to expect from his second taste of yagé, a hallucinogenic drug used in a Colombian tribal ritual . Ritual: The amateur footage shows Colombian tribesman playing instruments in front of a fire . 'This is my second ceremony. After yesterday I don’t know what to expect. 'I didn’t feel many effects yesterday from the yagé and I’ve heard that can happen in the first ceremony.' The footage, first broadcast by Colombian TV channel Caracol, has been heavily dubbed into Spanish. Tribesmen are also filmed playing instruments and stirring a substance in front of a fire. Tributes: Henry's parents and brother released a statement describing him as an 'adventurous person' who was 'polite, popular with a great sense of humour and was very much loved by his family and friends' Hours after this video was taken by a . fellow participant at the ceremony last Tuesday, Henry's body was found . on a nearby dirt track. Ricardo Suarez, the Putumayo police commander, said evidence suggests the shaman sent Henry to a hospital on a motorcycle with two young local men, but he died en route. ‘I’m from England, my name’s Henry. ‘This is my second ceremony. ‘After yesterday I don’t know what to expect. ‘I didn’t feel many effects yesterday from the yagé and I’ve heard that can happen in the first ceremony.’ Source: Caracol . 'Everything indicates that the two young men panicked and left him on the side of the road,' Mr Suarez said. Three . people including a shaman who prepared the drink, made from local plant . infusions, and two helpers suspected of dumping his body in panic after . he died on his way to hospital, have been questioned. State prosecutors will now decide whether to recommend charges. Colombian medical authorities said the cause of the death has not been definitely established. Fellow traveller Christopher Dearden . has told how Henry made animal noises and tried to fly after taking the . drug, said to create hallucinations more extreme than those caused by . LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms. He said: 'He wasn’t speaking, he was lashing out with his hands and feet. 'Then he started making weird animal noises and at one point he tried to fly.' Other tourists at the ceremony near Mocoa, south-east Colombia, said the shaman's family promised to look after Henry when he fell ill. Tribal: The drug is said to produce an 'extreme hallucinogenic reaction' that takes the user on a 'journey' The drug is found in the Andes in Southern Colombia. Henry was one of many tourists who try the substance . But police arrived as they ate . breakfast the next day at remote rainforest land belonging to the . Kamentsa tribe to say his body had been found nearby. The . Casa del Rio hostel in Mocoa in the Putumayo region, where Henry was . staying, promoted the drug on the ‘things to do’ section of its website. The website entry read: ‘Experience Yage, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate’. His devastated parents Elizabeth and David and brother Freddie paid tribute to the fun-loving teenager, who was due to study English literature, language, linguistics and media at Brighton University in September. They described him in a statement . released yesterday as an 'adventurous person' who was 'polite, popular . with a great sense of humour and was very much loved by his family and . friends'. Education: Henry attended the North Bristol Post Centre and had accepted a place at the University of Brighton . They added: 'We understand that he took part in a local tribal ritual recommended by the hostel he was staying at. 'The ritual involves a drink made from local plant infusions. 'We are awaiting further information from the Foreign Office but it is likely that a reaction to this drink was the cause.'","Henry Miller, 19, died after taking hallucinogen yagé for second time .
